        , Senator Fifield. I refer to advertisements that confirm that the government wants to replace
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        board members who have experience with disability and the disability sector with board members who only have corporate and board experience. Why is the minister trying to reduce representation of board members who have such important experience with disability and the disability sector?

         A few facts are important to put before the chamber. The first is that the previous government did not follow best corporate governance practice when they appointed all of the directors of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
          NDIS
         </a>
         board to have their terms expire on the same day, on 30 June 2016. That is not best corporate governance practice.
        </p>
        <p>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_I" rel="nofollow">
          If I
         </a>
         did nothing, we would not have a board for the NDIS from the middle of next year. Clearly, therefore, there is a process required to look at the issue of appointment and re-appointment of directors of the NDIS board. I can advise the chamber that on 17 April this year
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
          COAG
         </a>
         first ministers agreed that the NDIS should have the best board possible and that there should be a process to look at the appointment or re-appointment of board members. I can confirm that on 24 April the Disability Reform Council, which I chair, discussed this and that on 7 July this year I wrote to my ministerial counterparts seeking their agreement to a proposed approach for the appointment of board positions and that by 29 July all jurisdictions had replied, saying that they agreed with the selection process.
        </p>
        <p>
         What I want to see and what all jurisdictions want to see from the middle of next year is that we have a board which has continuity and that there are some existing board members who are re-appointedâ€”continuity is important at this stage of the scheme's rollout, but we are also open to having new board members. The most important thing is to make sure that this board has the best skill set possible in combination to ensure that the NDIS is the very best that it can be. So there is absolutely nothing unusual or odd about seeking to ensure that we have the best board possible.

           For the very good reason that
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KordaMentha" rel="nofollow">
            KordaMentha
           </a>
           were not engaged to review the performance of the existing board members. The purpose of KordaMentha was to provide advice to government as to what are relevant considerations for looking at a venture of this scale when considering the appointment or re-appointment of board members. This is a vast exercise. This is a scheme, at full rollout, which will be $22 billion a year that will be supporting 460,000 Australians. This is a very complex exercise. We wanted to make sure that we had in the next iteration of the board people who had the right skill set in combination for the transition phase which will rollout from 18,000 participants today to 460,000 participants over three years. I make no apology for the steps that we have taken.

               All board positions expire in the middle of next year and if we did nothingâ€”if we had no processâ€”there would not be a board in the middle of next year. It is self-evident that you need a process to look at who will be the board members from the middle of next year, which is exactly what we are doing. As to the other part of your question, Senator Moore, we are continuing negotiations with the jurisdictions on full rollout. They are going well and those negotiations are taking place in the context of heads of agreement, which, as you know, specify the target date for full rollout of the scheme.
