        My question is to the minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. From speaking to people in our home state of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        who faced a decade of inaction on housing and homelessness under the former Liberal and National government, it's clear Australians support our government's ambitious housing reform agenda. In that context, can the minister outline how the Albanese Labor government is working to deliver its ambitious housing reform agenda and ensure more Australians have access to safe and secure homes, and, critically, what is blocking much needed progress on this vital issue?

         I thank, dare I say, the 'good' Senator Smith—'our' Senator Smith—for the question and thank her as a very active representative of the people of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         for her work on this and on the Voice, which is also an issue that we know is so important to so many people. There are so many people in South Australia who are interested in and focused on how we get more homes on the ground in our state. People know that we do have an ambitious housing agenda, that we are serious about fixing the mess that those opposite made and that we have already invested billions. The reality is that the Liberal and National Parties sowed the seeds of a housing crisis and neglected those most in need. We had a wasted decade under the Liberals and Nationals, but, on this side we're not wasting a day. We've already created a $2 billion social housing accelerator to deliver thousands of new social homes across Australia. We've already expanded the National Housing Infrastructure Facility. We have already expanded the Home Guarantee Scheme. We've boosted the National Housing Accord, and we have increased Commonwealth Rent Assistance by 15 per cent—the largest increase in more than 30 years. Those are some but not all of the measures we have put in place.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, there is much more Labor wants to do, including the $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund. Senator Smith asked what is blocking progress. The answer is here in this chamber. It is the Greens, in coalition with the Liberals and Nationals, prioritising political tactics and denying shelter to those who need it most. They were voting against it, let's be clear, because the bill is about delivering more housing, including for women escaping family and domestic violence—

           The Albanese government is working in partnership with the states and territories, local government and the not-for-profit sectors to improve housing for Australians. Can the minister provide an update to the Senate on how the Albanese government's collaboration with these valued partners is delivering better housing for Australians?

            We understand that we have to work with state and territory governments and with organisations on the front line to respond to housing challenges. Unlike those opposite, who always tried to hand all this to the states, we've been working with state and territory governments. You know what they tell us? They tell us to pass the Housing Australia Future Fund. PowerHousing Australia, a network of community housing providers, has said:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Australians expect federal leadership and the time is now to pass this vital legislation and start taking action on housing affordability through the HAFF.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are other not-for-profit community housing providers who are asking the Greens and the coalition to pass this legislation. I just remind the Senate again that this is about crisis accommodation for women escaping family and domestic violence. This is about funding to repair remote Indigenous housing. This is about support for veterans at risk of homelessness. It's 30,000 new social and affordable homes. You should pass the HAFF when it comes to the Senate.

               have said that rejecting the Housing Australia Future Fund doesn't have a cost. That's simply not true; it does have a cost. Every day you stall and every day you work with them is another $1.3 million that will not be going into social and affordable housing in Australia. That's what it will mean. The HAFF could help fund 30,000 homes over five years. I would say to the Greens political party: don't keep putting your political tactics above the needs of those in the community who need more housing. The reality is that the Greens and the coalition are blocking more homes. We on this side of the chamber want to build more homes. Those opposite and the Greens want to block more homes. You should pass the Housing Australian Future Fund when it returns to the Senate.
