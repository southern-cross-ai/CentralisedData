        My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig. Is the minister aware that as a direct result of his decision to suspend the export of cattle to Indonesia, within one month alone up to 150,000 head of stock will exceed body weight limits, making them ineligible for the Indonesian trade export while being too light for processing elsewhere in Australia?
       </p>
       <p>
        Does he understand that this will leave graziers, including Indigenous land council managers, with no saleable cattle or income at the height of the winter growing season?

             What I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted by those on the other side is that this government is working diligently to ensure that the trade can be put back into place whilst maintaining appropriate animal welfare outcomes. Those on the other side are all at sea in relation to this point. They do not know whether they want animal welfare outcomes to be upheld or not. What they are arguing for is simply that the trade should resume immediately without taking into account animal welfare outcomes. Those on this side of the chamber want to ensure that we can do both.

                 Of course, those on the other side simply want the trade to commence without the welfare of animals taken into account. What the other side says is that the government made the decision. That is correct: the government made the decision in the face of animal welfare abuse that no-one on the other side would say is acceptable practice. No-one on this side says it is acceptable practice.

                     , I ask a supplementary question. I am pleased that the minister is focussed on animal welfare. Has the minister taken into account while making his decision to suspend the live export trade that graziers may have no option but to turn hundreds of thousands of cattle out onto rangelands, with the resulting animal welfare disaster as feed runs out and the inevitable environmental catastrophe as the rangelands are destroyed?

                      The government is working as quickly as possible to put in place the assurances required to put the trade back in and moving again. In the meantime, exporters have indicated that they are seeking alternative markets for the cattle.

                      have inspected the cattle currently in AQIS facilities onshore, and they are reported to be in good condition. The department is working with industry to identify the volume of feed available for animals in the supply chain at AQIS registered facilities and those being held on-farm.

                       , I ask a further supple­mentary question. Does the minister accept responsibility for the tens of thousands of cattle which will probably die a long, painful death, and will he now reverse his ill-considered decision and lift the suspension on cattle exports to those abattoirs that meet approved international standards?

                        There are two parts, at least, to that question. One, of course, is that the opposition fail to appreciate—or are ignorant of it—that abattoirs which meet

                        standards in themselves are not sufficient. It is about ensuring that we do have in place a supply chain so that we can track, and also monitor and verify, from the point of leaving the port to the point of a feedlot in Indonesia, and to the point of the slaughterhouse in Indonesia so that there is not any leakage.

                       <p>
                        What those on the other side want to accept is that animal welfare would not be taken into account in their proposal of simply looking at an abattoir alone, because there would be leakage in the system. What those opposite are now saying, of course, is, 'Restart the trade without taking animal welfare considerations into account'. That is what the opposition are putting to the parliament today.
