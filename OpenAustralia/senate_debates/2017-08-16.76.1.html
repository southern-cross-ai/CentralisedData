        My question is to Minister Payne, representing the Minister for Defence Industry, in relation to Australia's naval shipbuilding program. Can the minister confirm the future frigate program tender explicitly prevents the two sovereign and established Australian shipbuilders,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASC" rel="nofollow">
         ASC
        </a>
        and Austal, from taking any management or supervisory role—in other words, acting as a prime contractor—for the Navy's $35 billion future frigate program? For this nationally significant defence project, is it the case that only a foreign company can take the lead and that it will be a foreign company that controls the program, a foreign company that will install its own management teams in Adelaide, a foreign company that will choose the workforce, a foreign company that will control the intellectual property and a foreign company that will determine the shipyard's strategic direction—for example, whether there'll be future exports to other countries?

         I thank Senator Xenophon for his question. Given that the future frigate program is currently the subject of an active tender process, the government and I will not comment on matters that might affect that process. And, on that matter, I do observe that it is at best most unfortunate that sensitive tender information has been released today through the media and, as I understand it, on Senator Xenophon's website. It does not help during an active tender process to do that. It undermines it and places the tender at risk of being delayed or worse. What I can confirm to Senator Xenophon is that what the government has set up is a process that will establish an Australian sovereign continuous naval shipbuilding capability, a capability that will provide what our Navy needs to keep our nation safe and secure, a capability that will secure thousands of jobs for decades to come, many of them—if not primarily the majority of them—in the state of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         , which Senator Xenophon represents, but also across the nation through supply chains and through supporting industry.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our priority remains the acquisition of regionally superior, anti-submarine-warfare-optimised future frigates, along with the capability for sovereignty over their operation and sustainment. Intrinsic to that is the government's objective to maximise Australian industry involvement in the program without compromising on the capability, cost or schedule for the future frigates. This was a principal consideration in the decision to build in Adelaide, South Australia, noting that nationwide industrial involvement will be essential to the successful delivery of this major program. Everything the government has done since we made the decision to build the future frigates in Adelaide has been about creating a sovereign industrial base to deliver us the capability we need, along with the thousands of jobs that go with it.

           I note that the document was an unclassified document. In a 20 June 2017 hearing of the Senate Economics References Committee's inquiry on the future of naval shipbuilding, it was revealed that Defence knew, and had known for some time, that
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASC" rel="nofollow">
            ASC
           </a>
           would have no substantive role in the Future Submarine program. We now hear that ASC will have no substantive role in the future frigate program. Noting that I actively sought the future frigate plan from Defence through
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOI" rel="nofollow">
            FOI
           </a>
           and was denied access on very dubious grounds, and it is an unanswered question on notice that is overdue, when is the government intending to inform the parliament of the shrinkage and possible shut-down of ASC?

            , and you should not and would not expect me to, Senator Xenophon. But I can very clearly assure the Senate that the future frigates will be built in Adelaide, with Australian workers and with Australian steel, and we will create a sovereign, continuous naval shipbuilding industry. The Adelaide shipbuilding workforce in Osborne is already undertaking vitally important work. They have built up extensive experience and skills in the build of the air warfare destroyer, and I congratulate each and every one of them on what they do and continue to do on the

             AWD

            program. They will be very keen indeed to know of our commitment to a continuous naval shipbuilding capability based in Adelaide—indeed, as the naval shipbuilding plan sets out, as the Defence white paper plan sets out, as the request for tender sets out, as our infrastructure upgrade shows, as our purchase of Techport shows and as our development of the naval shipbuilding shows: all in Adelaide. The evidence stands there.

Not one ship commissioned—not one! Zero. Nada. Everybody can understand that, even the Scotsman in the room—not one. This government will have a continuous naval shipbuilding industry supported by
