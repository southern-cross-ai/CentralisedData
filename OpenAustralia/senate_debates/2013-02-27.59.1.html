           is in a position to continue to play its vital role in supporting the Australian economy. I trust that, despite some of the strange economics on the other side of the chamber, at least on the issue of the institution of the Reserve Bank there could be a modicum of appropriate consideration by the opposition.

            I ask a supplementary question. In evidence to the House economics committee last Friday, Governor Stevens said:

               Reserve Bank
              </a>
              and I am happy to respond, Senator Abetz. If those opposite have such respect for Governor Stevens, as we on this side do, maybe they could have a look at what he says about the Australian economy, maybe they could have a look at what he says about the Australian labour market, maybe they could have a look at what he says about the relative position of the Australian economy vis-a-vis other economies around the globe and maybe they could tell Mr Truss that we are not like Greece.

               I rise on a point of order on relevance. The question is very specifically about why the formal advice to government of the governor of the

                Reserve Bank

               was rejected. His advice was that all earnings of the bank be put into the reserve fund. That was the question.

                 I refer to my first answer. The decision was taken after consultation with the board. The Treasurer made the decision after consultation, and this government will always ensure that the

                  's 2011 annual report, Governor Stevens wrote:

                 <p class="italic">
                  …the prudent course will be to apply future earnings to rebuilding the RBRF before the resumption of dividend payments.

                 <p>
                  As the government failed to take what the governor described as 'the prudent course', which antonym of prudent best describes the Treasurer's decision? Was it rash, foolhardy, irresponsible, unwise or just plain reckless?

                   I think that was, dare I say it, a somewhat political question. Surprise, surprise for question time! I again make a couple of points. The first is: if those opposite want to be taken seriously on prudent economic decisions then perhaps they should tell the person who wants to be deputy prime minister—apart from Senator Joyce—that likening Australia's economic position to that of Greece is not a prudent economic decision. Perhaps they should also tell
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Hockey" rel="nofollow">
                    Mr Hockey
                   </a>
                   that using an accounting firm that was found to have acted unprofessionally is not a prudent economic decision, and perhaps they should remind themselves that using a catering company to do their costings is also not a prudent economic decision.

                    I rise on a point of order on relevance. My question was seeking the minister's guidance as to how she would describe the decision of the Treasurer? Given, by the governor's own definition, what the Treasurer did was not prudent, how would the minister described the Treasurer's decision?

                      governor. He ought to be very careful about what he says in that regard. The point I would make is that the government always makes decisions that it believes are in the best interests of the Australian economy.
