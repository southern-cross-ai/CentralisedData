          The price of electricity in this country is extremely high compared to other countries. In fact, the price of electricity is increasing significantly every year. Not only are Australians finding it hard to pay their electricity bills but power costs are hampering business growth. The people of Australia are at the mercy of greedy, profit-driven power companies. The Australian Electricity Regulator is supposed to be managing pricing and looking out for the best interests of Australians, but all we are seeing is soaring power prices. In Queensland, the Queensland government owned electricity companies are fighting their regulator to increase pricing, which may double the cost of electricity for Queenslanders over the next five years. The rubbish must stop and something must be done. This motion calls on the government to act. We need to start putting consumers first.

             The government does not oppose this motion, but I would like to clarify a few issues. The
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AER" rel="nofollow">
              AER
             </a>
             has issued draft determinations that will reduce electricity prices in
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
              New South Wales
             </a>
             , the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
              ACT
             </a>
             ,
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
              South Australia
             </a>
             and Queensland. The determinations are now being challenged by certain power network companies. The AER is a statutory authority and its decisions are subject to judicial review by the Federal Court and not by the government. The AER is not negotiating, and does not negotiate, its determinations. However, we note that in recent years the AER has been provided with new rules and tools, and we believe that these changes are now starting to deliver. The government also notes that the AER has been subject to two reviews in the past year: first, the Harper competition policy review recommended that the functions of the AER be rolled into the new access and pricing regulator; and, second, this year the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
              COAG
             </a>
             Energy Council is reviewing the governance of the national electricity market, including the government's arrangements of energy market bodies such as the AER. The government will consider these reviews and respond in due course.
            </p>

             I welcome Senator Lazarus's concern about high electricity prices and I look forward to him supporting the government opposing higher
