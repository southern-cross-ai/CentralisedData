         The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) &amp; (2) Given the very broad nature of the question, attempting to answer this question would cause an unreasonable diversion of resources.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3), (4) &amp; (5) Annual Regulatory Plans are managed within the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Finance_and_Deregulation" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Finance and Deregulation
         </a>
         . Please see the response provided by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation to Senate question on notice 2469.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (6) This question does not apply to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Veterans'_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Veterans' Affairs
         </a>
         . While the Department undertakes cost recovery where it identifies an overpayment, it does not have a cost recovery scheme in the context of this question.

         applies a cost recovery regime on activities that include Tours, Public &amp; Education Programs, selected Function costs, staff consultancy, Collection loans and photo reproduction sales, where appropriate. Fees imposed are calculated by applying a cost recovery model that closely follows the Australian Government Cost Recovery Guidelines. Much of the cost recovery activity relates to invoicing for employee/agency salary &amp; wages costs, with increase in fees reflecting increases in employee costs.
