        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and Regional Development, Senator McKenzie. Can the minister inform the Senate how the Liberal and Nationals government's record $110 billion—that's a lot of money—infrastructure investment plan is helping to connect communities, create jobs and support our economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic?

         Thank you, Senator McMahon, for your question and your tireless efforts to represent the Territory here in this place. As you said, our government is investing more in infrastructure—a total of $110 billion—than any other government in our nation's history. Since 2013, we've committed over $50 billion in infrastructure to our regions because we believe in the capacity of our regions. And we believe in their capacity if you just add water. That is why we've committed $1.6 billion to co-fund the construction of 30 water infrastructure projects, which will actually provide water into the future and unlock the economic potential for new and expanded agriculture for regional Australians. We're driving investments in infrastructure that are enabling

         </a>
         industries to grow and prosper—not just the croc industry, Senator McMahon! By doing, so we're charting a strong course to ensure the recovery from COVID-19.

         and Nationals government has committed $3.2 billion to infrastructure projects in the Northern Territory since 2013, and in this budget $323.9 million was committed to projects in the Territory that are expected to support more than 900 local jobs. We're upgrading vital road infrastructure, with $150 million for phase 2 of the

          NT
         </a>
         national network highway upgrades and just over $173 million for the sixth corridor under the Roads of Strategic Importance initiative. This will support the development of the gas industry in the Beetaloo subbasin, which I know you're incredibly passionate about, which will increase our gas supply, create more jobs and provide significant economic growth not just for the NT but for the whole nation. Delivering improvements to roads used by rural communities within the Beetaloo will benefit the residents, workers and visitors. It's clear from the investment that it's the Liberal and Nationals government that's committed to delivering the infrastructure our nation needs to economically recover.

            I'm sure you will be pleased to hear that the town of Katherine, the gateway to the region, has a strong tourism sector, schools and health facilities that will all benefit from the investments that we're making. We haven't just stopped with expenditure on the projects I mentioned earlier. We've committed $139 million to upgrades to the

             Outback Way
            </a>
            . We've got upgrades to roads that tourists use in some of the most spectacular parts of our beautiful nation, including the town of Alice. We have 26 projects under construction, and on those, together with the 12 we've completed, we've committed more than $395 million. We've also committed more than $30 million to build the

            and Berrimah Road overpass to ensure a safer commute for the 20,000 motorists that use it. The project will see up to 155 jobs at the peak of the works, and it will take nearly two years to complete.

               Thank you, Senator McMahon. Since 2013 our government has committed more than $2.8 billion to support community infrastructure that promotes stable, secure and viable regional economies and builds on the resilience of our communities as we recover from the pandemic. More than $247 million has been committed through the Regional Growth Fund for projects for the construction of the Katherine flood mitigation and headworks project in the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NT" rel="nofollow">
                NT
               </a>
               . For projects that help grow regional economies and provide sustainable employment, we've committed $206 million to the Regional Jobs and Investment Packages and $145 million to the Stronger Communities Program, which has funded around 12,000 projects since 2015, because we believe in recovery from COVID-19 that will be led by regional Australia.
