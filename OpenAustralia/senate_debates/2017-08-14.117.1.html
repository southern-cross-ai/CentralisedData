        My question is for the minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Brandis. We are currently on the precipice of a major nuclear conflict involving two dangerous and paranoid leaders, which has led some commentators to describe this as a more dangerous situation than the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Missile_Crisis" rel="nofollow">
         Cuban Missile Crisis
        </a>
        of October 1962. Yet the Prime Minister has said that Australia is joined at the hip to one of these madmen. Minister, isn't it time for Australia to surgically remove this growth on our hip so that Australia doesn't blindly follow the US into yet another senseless conflict but instead plays a more constructive role in helping to resolve conflict and to bring peace to the world?

         Senator Di Natale, to start with, I utterly reject your insulting description of the President of the United States of America. The United States of America is Australia's greatest ally. It has been our greatest ally since the time of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
          Second World War
         </a>
         , and long may it remain so.
        </p>
        <p>
         Nevertheless, Senator Di Natale, your question does give me the opportunity to address the situation in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea" rel="nofollow">
          North Korea
         </a>
         . North Korea's pursuit of nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities is unacceptable. It flouts unanimous UN security resolutions. Every act of defiance adds to the hardship of that country's long-suffering people. Australia is deeply concerned about the global threat posed by North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile program and its illicit activities, including sales of weapons of mass destruction, related material and arms, cyber attacks and alleged assassinations. Australia implements a sanctions regime aimed at limiting North Korea's ability to develop weapons of mass destruction.
        </p>
        <p>
         On 6 August, the Minister for Foreign Affairs agreed to designate an additional three individuals and seven entities for targeted financial sanctions under Australia's autonomous sanctions regime. Our measures add to the international pressure and complement the strong resolutions adopted by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council" rel="nofollow">
          United Nations Security Council
         </a>
         , including by resolution 2371, adopted on 5 August, which takes strong steps to curtail revenue going to North Korea by banning certain exports. Australia is delivering very clear messages to North Korea that its interests are best served by ceasing its nuclear capability.

            and the nuclear and ballistic missile program that it has developed in flagrant violation of unanimous UN security resolutions and of international opinion. It is that country that is the belligerent state. We continue to work with the United States as well as with the Republic of Korea, Japan, China and other friends and partners to ensure the strongest possible response to North Korea's defiance of international norms. We will work with our ally the United States, in particular, in developing that response.

What I can tell you, Senator Di Natale, as I can tell all senators, is that Australia is working with our allies and in particular working with the United States' administration in order to de-escalate this situation.

                 On relevance, I don't expect the minister to run a commentary, but I asked a very straightforward question. It was in the context of the answer he gave to my first supplementary question. When the Minister talked about being reckless and spoke about de-escalation, I put a very direct quote to him. It was a quote from the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_US" rel="nofollow">
                  President of the US

                 would face 'fire and fury like the world has never seen.' I asked him specifically whether he felt that language was consistent with de-escalation or whether it was reckless and I would like to minister to answer.

                   Senator Di Natale, we would be very foolish to glean foreign policy from American presidential rhetoric. I remember a previous
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_President" rel="nofollow">
                    American President
                   </a>
                   once declared that he would pay any price, bear any burden, support any friend and oppose any foe. President Trump is not the first American president who has engaged in rhetorical exuberance.
