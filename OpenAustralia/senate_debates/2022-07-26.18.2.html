       <p>
        I advise the Senate that, following a meeting of the Liberal Party Senate party room, I was elected
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition_in_the_Senate" rel="nofollow">
         Leader of the Opposition in the Senate
        </a>
        , and I welcome the continuation, following her successful election, of Senator Cash as the coalition's deputy leader, albeit on this side of the chamber. I acknowledge also the election of Senator Bridget McKenzie, who continues in her role as Leader of the Nationals in the Senate, and Senator Perin Davey having been elected as Deputy Leader of the Nationals across the parliament. I further advise the Senate that Senator Wendy Askew has been elected as Chief Opposition Whip in the Senate, and I congratulate Senator Askew on her election, along with Senator Scarr and Senator O'Sullivan, who have both been elected deputy opposition whips.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank Senator Dean Smith for his service as the Government Whip in the Senate over a significant period of time—since 2015—and congratulate him on his appointment to the opposition frontbench as shadow assistant minister for competition, charities and Treasury. I inform the Senate that Senator Ruston will serve as Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate, and Senator Duniam will continue as the deputy to Senator Ruston in relation to the management of business.
       </p>
       <p>
        I congratulate our senators on their various appointments, and also thank Senators McGrath and Chandler for their service as deputy government whips at the time in those parliamentary roles. I congratulate them also on their shadow ministry appointments. I congratulate all senators on their appointment to this place following the election. I particularly congratulate the three new coalition senators who have joined our ranks, albeit noting the loss, sadly, of some of our colleagues.
       </p>
       <p>
        I offer my congratulations to government senators and particularly to those government senators who have been appointed to ministerial and assistant minister roles. It is a great honour that those on the other side have, to be part of the government of Australia and to be able to undertake those roles. I acknowledge Senator Wong as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Government_in_the_Senate" rel="nofollow">
         Leader of the Government in the Senate
        </a>
        , returning to a ministerial role, and I acknowledge the other ministers, including new ministers, across this chamber. Whilst on our side we would have wished for an alternative election result, we know that serving the people of Australia as part of a government is an enormous privilege, and we wish you well in doing so, if not wishing you ongoing electoral success in the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        The coalition takes very seriously our role to be a responsible opposition working in this chamber, with the larger crossbench elected by the Australian people, to hold the government to account and to represent the views of our constituents, our communities and all Australians. We look forward to working in this chamber in a collegiate manner—respectful in our differences, bipartisan where possible and in the national interest—but demonstrating to the Australian people that our values are the values of Australia and Australians.

        I seek leave to incorporate in
