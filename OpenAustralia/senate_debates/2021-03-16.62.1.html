        My question is to the Minister for Women, Senator Payne. The government promised new school teaching materials on consent and respectful relationships back in the 2015 plan for women's safety but the education minister announced the rollout in classrooms only last week—a six-year delay. A student could have started and finished primary school in that time. Has the Minister for Women taken any action to find out why these important materials have been so delayed?

         I don't have details with me of the education aspects of that matter. I am aware that the minister for education in his remarks last week made reference to these issues and to the bravery of the young women in particular who had come forward as a result of the discussion of these very difficult issues in Australia, including sexual assault and rape, to disclose their own experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
         As I understand it, we have education materials in relation to the teaching of primary and secondary students about ethical behaviour, consent and respectful relationships through what is known as the Respect Matters program. That material will be freely available for use in all Australian schools in the coming weeks. The program for foundation to year 6 is focused on relationships and friendships, and managing these through changes and challenges. That is about providing building blocks for later content. The program for years 7 to 9 focuses on moving from preteen to adolescence and looks at relationships and power, and bullying and bystander action. Further, the program for years 10 to 12 focuses on personal and intimate relationships and that includes understanding consent, decision-making and consent laws and rights.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government understands that this is a much broader issue than just schools and significant funding has been allocated since 2013 by governments—federal, state and territory, but $1 billion from the Commonwealth—to prevent and respond to violence against women and their children—

            As the senator would be aware, we as a government, like previous governments—in fact, commencing in 2010 with what I would say was strong multipartisan support—have been supporters of, engaged in and leading on the National Action Plan to Reduce Violence Against Women and Their Children. Part of that is underpinned by the engagement of women's safety ministers from the states and territories with the Commonwealth ministers, who are at this point in time Minister Ruston and me. That is the framework under which the Commonwealth and the states and territories work on all of these issues. In relation to those individual reports, if I have anything further to add, I will bring further information to the chamber.

               As senators would be aware, there was very extensive consultation on the introduction of the reforms to the courts that

                Senator McCarthy

               has alluded to. This is a very important priority for the government within the family law system. I understand there's also been a report released this week in relation to matters affecting the court system, specifically in relation to family law. A number of initiatives which were part of the Women's Economic Security Statement in October of last year in the context of the budget also went to these issues, in the context at the time overwhelmingly of COVID-19.
