        My question is to the Minister for Defence, Minister Payne. This Tuesday, I asked you to clarify exactly what the costs of the Triton drones would be. A check of
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        will show that you didn't answer the question of what the costs would be. However, on ABC Radio that afternoon you said that you'd told the Senate what the costs would be. Could you now take the opportunity to clarify what the $3 billion to $4 billion price tag in the white paper refers to and what part of acquisition systems infrastructure or sustainment is included in that figure?

         I can advise the Senate that the initial approved investment for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQ" rel="nofollow">
          MQ
         </a>
         -4C Triton, which was announced earlier this week, is $1.4 billion. The initial approved investment includes the first of the six Triton aircraft and associated systems, $364 million for new facilities and infrastructure and a $200 million cooperative development program with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy" rel="nofollow">
          United States Navy
         </a>
         , which I also referred to in the Senate earlier this week, which will ensure that we are able to contribute directly to the development, production and sustainment of this aircraft. The total acquisition cost of the six aircraft and the associated systems is expected to be around $3 billion, which is indeed within the provision of the Integrated Investment Program. As was indicated in the white paper, that is a cost of around $3 billion to $4 billion.

        <p>
         This announcement is an important part of the government's long-term plan to provide Australia with one of the most advanced maritime patrol capabilities in the world that will assist us to support our borders and to support security in our region. It is a step change in capability for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Royal Australian Air Force
         </a>
         . Our maritime area, as I've said here and elsewhere, covers approximately 10 per cent of the Earth's surface. What the Triton will be capable of, in addition to its work that it'll do with the P-8s, is supporting missions of over 24 hours duration, covering an area of over a million square nautical miles, which is actually larger than the full area of the state of

It is a very significant capability and, together with the P-8A Poseidon, the Triton and Poseidon will work together as complementary systems, very much enhancing our antisubmarine warfare and our maritime strike capability as well as our ability to monitor and secure our important maritimeâ€”

           You may remember, Minister, that on Tuesday I asked you about the $7 billion figure that had been quoted in the media. You said to the ABC that afternoon that the $7 billion figure covered the whole-of-life cost of the drones. You said that it would be just shy of $7 billion. Can you now confirm to the Senate that the total cost of acquiring these drones is nearly double what was quoted in the white paper?

            No, that's not correct. As I indicated in my earlier comments and response to the Senate and to Senator Whish-Wilson's question, the total acquisition cost of the six aircraft, the associated systems, is estimated to be around $3 billion. Any reference to a figure of $6.9 billion includes the whole-of-life sustainment costs. The acquisition cost, which is recorded in the Integrated Investment Program, is most certainly the cost which is being adopted at this point.

              On that point, Minister, your government has outlined $200 billion in procurement costs over the next decade. Does that include sustainment costs? How much is that $200 billion figure going to blow out once we look at the true costs of this defence expenditure? Can you tell us how these things are officially budgeted by the government?

                  . In fact, what I was setting out for the senatorâ€”although he doesn't seem particularly interested in listening to itâ€”is the way in which the Integrated Investment Program was determined, which was externally cost assured at the time. The acquisition program is a comprehensive one. It is going to ensure that the ADF is equipped in the way that it needs to be to protect Australia and our interests. That's the government's job.
