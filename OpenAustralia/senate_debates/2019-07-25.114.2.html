        My question is to the minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Senator Birmingham. Following representations by Minister Taylor, then Minister Frydenberg's office arranged a meeting which took place on 20 March 2017 between Minister Taylor, Minister Frydenberg's office and members of the Department of the Environment and Energy to discuss a listing which affected Mr Taylor's private landholding. How many other farmers affected by this listing got this special treatment?

           One of the members of the department in attendance at that meeting was a compliance officer from the unit responsible for investigating Minister Taylor's company for allegedly poisoning hectares of critically endangered grasslands. How many landowners under investigation by the department are given this special treatment?

             On a point of order—I'm reluctant to do it so quickly, but given the last answer was only about nine seconds long: references to past statements are not directly relevant to the question. This question is: how many other landowners got this special treatment? I think the public are entitled to know that. The government is saying: 'This was perfectly fine. Minister Taylor can demand this.' How many other landowners got this special treatment?

              I'm reluctant to say that references to past statements are, by that nature, not directly relevant. I thought the minister was actually addressing the first part of the question, which was the preamble to the bit you just reminded him of. Senator Birmingham.

               , I was indeed making the point, given the question referenced the attendance of a compliance officer at the meeting, that Mr Taylor has been clear that he did not know that there was a compliance officer present at this meeting. I further highlight the statement of the secretary of the Department of the Environment and Energy, who has said very clearly on the record, 'In relation to compliance, I can be very clear that Minister Taylor has never raised the issue with me.'

              <p>
               In relation to the insinuation that somehow nobody else is concerned about this issue, can I draw the Senate's attention to a joint letter from

                    On relevance: we haven't had an answer to any of the questions asked so far. This question is asking how many attendees were made aware of the interest, and that hasn't been answered before. We'd appreciate an answer to just one of these three questions.

                     There's an opportunity to debate the merits of any answers after question time. I'm listening carefully to the minister to ensure direct relevance. He is 17 seconds in. I call on him to continue.

                      In relation to compliance matters, I again draw attention to Mr Taylor's statements that 'I have never made a representation in relation to compliance matters' and the secretary of the department's statement that he can be very clear that Minister Taylor has never raised the matter with him.
