         Thank you, Senator McDonald, for your question. I know we're all very concerned here today about the devastating bushfires burning across
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         and Queensland. Our first concern is for the safety and wellbeing of those directly affected. Like Senator Reynolds, I would also like to pay tribute to our emergency services workers in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFS" rel="nofollow">

        </p>
        <p>
         As of 1.00 pm today, all fires nationwide are burning at the watch-and-act level or below. Catastrophic fire danger conditions are forecast for parts of New South Wales today, including the Greater Hunter,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
          Greater Sydney
         </a>
         and Illawarra-Shoalhaven. This is the first time, since the new fire-danger ratings were introduced in 2009, that catastrophic fire danger has been forecast for Sydney. Very high to severe fire dangers continue on Wednesday the 13th over north-east New South Wales and South-East Queensland, with a risk of dry lightning exacerbating the danger. As the south-westerly change moves through South-East Queensland, severe fire dangers are forecast for South-East Queensland and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Tablelands" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Tablelands
         </a>
         of New South Wales. Very high fire dangers are forecast elsewhere over central and north-east New South Wales. Unfortunately, no rainfall is expected for the north-east of New South Wales and South-East Queensland over the next seven days.
        </p>
        <p>
         As we know, tragically three people have lost their lives. Our thoughts are with their families and loved ones at this difficult time. More than 30 people have been injured, including around 20 firefighters. The New South Wales fires have had a devastating impact on many affected communities, with 150 structures destroyed, 96 confirmed. Other property damage includes to telecommunications, power infrastructure, bridges and two schools. Evacuation centres have been established to support fire affected communities and, commencing yesterday, the

               Queensland also is recipient of the DRFA response and Queenslanders will be able to contact the Queensland government, which will be administering that. In terms of being prepared for situations such as these devastating fires, it requires collaboration between all levels of government. Australians know the importance of preparing for the bushfire season, especially those who live in or near bushland. Our farmers, in particular, are very aware of needing to have bushfire plans in place. But I think these fires have shown that it's not just those who live in and around bushland that need to ensure they've got an active fire plan in place. Practically speaking, anyone who lives in a high-risk area needs to have that bushfire plan in place. That means clearing vegetation around buildings and fences and clearing your driveways, gutterings et cetera. Some advice is to turn off electric fences. Always pay attention to our emergency services providers and act and leave when they give that advice.
