        The question is to the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Water, Senator Wong. It's been reported that 44 per cent of the world's oceans are currently experiencing measured marine heatwaves. We're experiencing record ocean temperatures in the north Atlantic, the Mediterranean and the Gulf of Mexico and unprecedented low levels of winter sea ice in Antarctica. Last week, waters off the coast of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        state of Florida hit 38.8 degrees Celsius—the highest in recorded history anywhere—causing widespread, immediate coral bleaching. Senator Wong, do you acknowledge that these ocean-warming events are climate change, linked to rising global emissions largely caused by the burning of fossil fuels?

        <p>
         I think that's a matter of scientific record. Climate change has an effect on the marine domain as it has an effect on the terrestrial domain, and so forth. I may say, in addition to that, that one of the things which we know is occurring and which is a risk particularly for Pacific island regions and South-East Asia is the effect that these phenomena—which include warming but also different patterns of warming in different currents—are having on fish stocks. Let's remember one of the things that we forget, because we obviously have a large continent that produces a lot of beef and meat: the primary source of protein for much of our region is fish. One of the things that we have engaged in detail about with Pacific island nations, Indonesia and others is how we can ensure we secure fish stocks at a time when climate change is, amongst other things, impacting upon the availability and pattern of fish. One of the ways in which we can do that is obviously the regulation of fishing, but, more broadly, there are environmental measures as well in relation to oceans.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is a broader issue of how we as a country will ensure that we play our part in tracking the path from Paris towards net zero by 2050. We are determined to do that, and the report that was released overnight by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO" rel="nofollow">
          UNESCO
         </a>
         in relation to the reef recognises the work that this government is doing in the face of climate change. I don't think that, on this side of the parliament, you've had the same views that have been expressed on the other side for over a decade, questioning the science. Where we disagree—and we do disagree—is with your policy propositions.

            , Senator Green, and the Prime Minister did stand up today and make comments before the media about this issue. Yes, we do recognise the importance of the reef and how critical the reef is to Queensland's environment and economy. We also understand the importance of acting on climate. Furthermore, we understand the importance of investing in the Great Barrier Reef.
           </p>
           <p>
            We are committed as a government to protecting the reef, for the 64,000 jobs which rely on it. We also recognise that

            has seen significant progress made by our government in relation to climate change, water quality and sustainable fishing. That is because we have invested a record $1.2 billion in the reef.

Minister, you've acknowledged the impact rising emissions, caused by the burning of fossil fuels, have on coral health. How is the Albanese Labor government's approval of new coal and gas projects, including three coalmines in 53 days, taking urgent and sustained action to protect the reef?
