       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP assistance is available to full fee-paying students studying in higher level education or training, and provides a loan for all or part of a student’s tuition costs. This assistance is aimed at encouraging students to take up higher level skill qualifications by reducing the financial barriers associated with study. From 1 July 2009, the VET FEE-HELP Assistance Scheme will be extended to assist certain state government subsidised students.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill makes amendments to streamline the application and assessment process for higher education and training organisations applying for approval to offer FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP assistance to students. The amendments will provide for administrative efficiencies resulting in faster approvals of higher education and VET providers, therefore giving students access to financial assistance sooner.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In particular, the Bill amends the tuition assurance provisions in the Act, to remove the administrative requirement for higher education and training organisations to have tuition assurance arrangements in place at the date of their application for approval to offer FEE-HELP or VET FEE-HELP assistance to students.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition, the bill provides for amendments to allow recommendations from approved national or state-based agencies to be used as part of the assessment and approval of training organisations to deliver VET FEE-HELP assistance. This will help to eliminate duplication between Commonwealth and State and Territory agencies, and reduce the cost and time taken to assess a training organisation’s application.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These amendments deliver increased efficiencies in the administration of the FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP Assistance Schemes, making it easier and faster for higher education and training organisations to be approved to offer assistance to students.

         Personal Property Securities Bill 2009
        </a>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Government went to the election with an ambitious deregulation agenda - a promise to reduce the regulatory burden on Australian businesses and to address impediments to the growth of productivity in this country. In the 18 months since coming to office, the Government has amply demonstrated its commitment to that agenda.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In a country such as ours – with a federation of Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments and a Constitution which divides responsibilities between the jurisdictions – each of the jurisdictions will inevitably have laws which overlap with laws in another jurisdiction. Where the laws between the jurisdictions regulate a similar issue but differ in terms, the practical outcome is that businesses and other users whose work crosses borders are left to grapple with a range of different legislative regimes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Single or harmonised laws, where they can be achieved, are the most obvious way to overcome these burdens. Identifying them and working towards single or harmonised laws, with the co-operation of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_Territories" rel="nofollow">
         States and Territories
        </a>
        , is an important priority for this Government and is part of our broader de-regulation agenda.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Which brings me to the Bill that I introduce into this Parliament today.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Personal Property Securities Bill 2009 implements a significant reform to Australia’s law on secured financing using personal property.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill will replace the existing complex, inconsistent and ad hoc web of common law and legislation, involving over seventy Commonwealth, State and Territory Acts. It will implement a single national law creating a uniform and functional approach to personal property securities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Personal property is any form of property other than land.  It includes goods such as cars, machinery, crops and livestock, financial property such as currency and letters of credit and intangibles such as intellectual property rights.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill will apply to all transactions which create an interest in personal property that secures a loan or other obligation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Secured finance using personal property is a major area of business for Australia’s banking and finance sectors. And borrowing using personal property has the potential to assist businesses to grow – particularly small and medium sized businesses.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        ’s reform in this area recognises the need to make it easier for businesses to use personal property to obtain finance. Given the current uncertainty in global financial markets, improving the capacity of businesses to borrow is crucial. And, of course, this is bound to have positive flow-on effects in terms of job growth and overall productivity.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill will more closely align Australia’s secured transactions law with that in other jurisdictions.  In doing so, it will increase the confidence of international investors and creditors in Australia’s secured transaction law and should make it easier for Australian businesses to secure finance in international capital markets.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Why reform is necessary
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Personal property securities reform is necessary to facilitate investment and to ensure Australia remains a competitive economy both domestically and in the international arena.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The complexity of the existing secured lending arrangements, and the lack of consistency between them, is a major source of uncertainty.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        By harmonising existing laws, the Bill will reduce that complexity and increase consistency in the arrangements for creating, dealing with and enforcing security interests in personal property.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In streamlining lending arrangements in this way, the Bill will provide greater certainty for both lenders and borrowers. It will lower the risk for lenders, improve the efficiency of secured financing and increase competitors among providers of finance.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Under the functional approach implemented by the Bill, a security interest will be a transaction that ‘in substance’ secures payment or performance of an obligation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill will focus the law on the real or economic effect of the transaction and not on the legal form of the borrower or the financial arrangement, or the location or nature of the property.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The reform will be supported by a single national online register of personal property securities replacing the existing confusing array of both electronic and paper-based national, State and Territory registers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This is twenty-first century reform for twenty-first century circumstances.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill takes advantage of the technology available to us in this digital age, by creating a real-time online noticeboard of personal property over which a security interest has been, or may be, taken.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Users will be able to search the Register via a web browser, or, alternatively, via their mobile phone using
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS" rel="nofollow">
         SMS
        </a>
        message connectivity.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This is in stark contrast to some of the registers that are currently used for recording an interest in personal property. There are, for example,          paper registers that have been around since the 1920’s and 30’s, which continue in use today.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If nothing else, this Bill will simplify things – not just from the perspective of convenience, but also from a costs perspective.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A telephone contact centre will also be available to facilitate access to the Register.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill also includes transitional arrangements to transfer the data on the existing registers to the new personal property securities register. The migration of data will take place before the Register goes live and is available to the public.

        reform
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I might just say a few words about the history of reform in this area.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It has had a long history in this country, with initial discussions about personal property securities reform commencing in the early 1970s.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In June 1990, the then Attorney-General Michael Duffy referred a review of the adequacy of personal property securities law to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Law_Reform_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Law Reform Commission
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In 1995, Attorney-General Michael Lavarch released a discussion paper on the draft legislation and issues raised in the ALRC’s report.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This began a process of further development of reform options through several options papers and extensive consultation with stakeholders right across the country.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        At this point,  I should acknowledge the contribution of my predecessor, the Member for Berowra and former Attorney-General,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillip_Ruddock" rel="nofollow">
         Phillip Ruddock
        </a>
        , who was genuinely interested in this reform and who made sure it was given the priority that it deserved.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It would also be remiss of me not to acknowledge that this reform is being pursed by all

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_April" rel="nofollow">
         In April
        </a>
        2007,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
         COAG
        </a>
        endorsed the need for a national system to deal with the creation and enforcement of security interests in personal property.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        COAG signed an inter-governmental agreement in October 2008, making clear its commitment to this issue.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Since then, personal property securities reform has been included as part of the ‘Seamless National Economy’ National Partnership Agreement reached between the Australian Government and the States and Territories.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In November 2008, a draft Bill was referred to the Senate Legal and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Affairs_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Constitutional Affairs Committee
        </a>
        . That Committee considered the Bill and consulted with stakeholders over a number of months.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         The Committee
        </a>
        tabled its report on the draft Bill in March this year, and made a number of recommendations for improving the Bill.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am pleased to say that the Government tabled a reply to that report in the Senate last week, accepting or agreeing to give further consideration to all of the Committee’s recommendations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Following from this, the Bill has been reviewed to simplify its language and structure. It is more consistent with comparable legislation in Canada,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        and the United States, while taking into account some of the unique circumstances surrounding Australian consumer law, commercial practices and recent technological advances.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Privacy concerns raised by the Committee have also been addressed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition, the Government has carefully considered the Committee’s recommendation to delay implementing the new register to May 2011.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The significance of this reform for business cannot be underestimated and the Government is committed to making sure business and the financial sector are prepared for the reform – particularly in view of the realities of the economic situation faced by business in the current climate.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government will consult with the States and Territories about the most appropriate start date for the reform and should be in a position to make an announcement about this shortly.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I wish to extend my thanks to the members of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee for their work and their recommendations on the Bill.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I mentioned before that the Bill has been the subject of extensive consultation. In fact, the private sector has been heavily involved in developing the bill right from the start.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The support shown by members of the Personal Property Securities Consultative Group, the business community, the legal profession and the banking and finance sectors has been invaluable.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And the contribution of the many professionals who have commented on the Bill has helped shape this into a Bill that meets the needs of Australian businesses.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The co-operation of State and Territory governments in advancing this reform has been essential.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Standing Committee of Attorneys-General has played an important role in the development of this bill, and I am encouraged by the commitment of my State and Territory colleagues to the process of legal harmonisation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The measures contained in the Bill not only demonstrate this Government’s commitment to deregulation, but also demonstrate the continued cooperation between the Commonwealth, the States and Territories on regulatory reform.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill demonstrates precisely the kind of thing that can be achieved by the simple act of Governments working together to bring about the kind of reform that is absolutely essential to a modern, functional economy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Given the constitutional arrangements in this country, the Personal Property Securities Bill will be supported by a referral of legislative power by the States and I am pleased to say that the referral process has already begun.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The first of the State referral bills was passed by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales_Parliament" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales Parliament
        </a>
        last week.  I look forward to the remaining States passing their referral legislation shortly.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Specifics of the bill
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I turn now to a few specific aspects of the Bill.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        All kinds of personal property will be covered by this Bill, subject to some very limited exceptions such as fixtures and water rights.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These kinds of property have been excluded as there are existing schemes in place to deal with security interests in them.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill will also establish the offices of Registrar and Deputy Registrar to oversee the personal property securities register and its functions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill provides default rules for the creation, priority and enforcement of security interests in personal property. The Bill deals with most aspects of personal property security transactions, such as when they are enforceable between the parties and against others, how a priority dispute will be resolved, how they are enforced and when security interests will be extinguished.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It goes without saying that having one law in this area will significantly simplify personal property security arrangements and make it easier for parties to establish and arrange the terms of their particular security agreement.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Conclusion
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As I have said, the Personal Property Securities Bill will increase certainty for all users of secured finance by removing barriers that inhibit businesses and individuals from securing credit over personal property.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        By reducing complexity and introducing greater consistency among the different kinds of secured finance, the Bill will generate wide ranging benefits for all parties who secure personal property to raise finance.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill will meet the needs of businesses and other users of secured finance. It will simplify the way they conduct their business and, more importantly, it will contribute to the growth of productivity and jobs in this country.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I commend the Bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of these bills be adjourned to the first sitting day of the next period of sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ordered that the bills be listed on the
