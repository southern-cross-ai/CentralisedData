        On Anzac Day this year, I went out to Tingha, a large Aboriginal community near Inverell. A lot of the people are Aborigines. I want to talk to you about Charlie Livermore. I will read a story in the paper from October 2005:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        With the passing of Claude Charles Livermore (Charlie) on August 8 this year it seems fitting to honour him by sharing his story of remarkable compassion and courage during his time as a PoW.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Aboriginal PoW not only survived three- and-a-half years at Changi, the notorious Japanese prison camp during the war, but through his bravery helped other PoWs to survive.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        He gained national recognition for the "Deerstalker" incident, of which most say saved his and others' lives.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Charlie was born on October 13, 1920, in Bundarra.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        When
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWII" rel="nofollow">
         WWII
        </a>
        broke out, the then 21-year-old wasted no time enlisting.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        His wife, Nora Livermore, said he was keen to enlist, but unprepared for the plight that lay ahead.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        "He may have even added two years on to his age just so he could go to war," Mrs Livermore said.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A member of the doomed 2/18th Battalion, Charlie was captured in Malaya upon arrival.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For the next few years as a PoW he demonstrated insurmountable courage and heroism.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        He learnt Japanese while in prison to help his fellow inmates and gradually Charlie was able to make acquaintances with the guards.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        "By being able to talk to them, the guards liked him more than the other prisoners, so he could then ask for extra rice," Mrs Livermore said.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        "They were all thin like African children so Charlie did whatever was necessary, including steal food for his comrades to ensure they did not die as a PoW."
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        One of the most famous tales among the PoWs at Changi, and indeed throughout Australia today, is the unusual campaign Charlie launched against the Japanese, known as the 'Deerstalker' incident.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Being Aboriginal made Charlie a particular victim of "Deerstalkers", Japanese guards unconvinced Australia had native black people.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        One guard in particular insisted that Charlie was an Indian and beat him severely when he protested his Aboriginality.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        "There was no such thing as an Aboriginal to the Japanese back then," Mrs Livermore said.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        After much prompting by his PoW friends, Charlie used the Aboriginal technique of ''pointing the bone' at the "Deerstalker," an Aboriginal tradition that many believe will kill the person the bone is pointed at.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The results following Charlie's pointing of the bone were extraordinary.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Major Doug Okey recorded them in his diary.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        He wrote: "I have never been quite sure what caused the change in the guard's attitude towards us after that, but change he did."
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        "The guard sold items to the officers at half price, but it was too late. The bone had been pointed and, sure enough, he was taken off the island on a stretcher and according to eyewitnesses, in great agony.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        "His death was announced some days later."
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Upon his return from the war, Charlie married and produced eight children. His wife said no matter where they went Charlie was respected by everyone.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        "People knew Charlie from all over the place and despite his treatment as a PoW, he never once said a bad word about the Japanese," she said.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        "Being a Christian, Charlie believed we were all equal."
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        During his final years, Charlie suffered from various war-related diseases, such as chronic bronchitis and nerve damage.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But, despite his ill health, daughter Yvonne Kent said he never once missed an Anzac Day celebration.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        "He was very sick earlier this year but he insisted on getting out of bed. He said, 'I'll see one last Anzac Day'," Mrs Kent said.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As one of the elders of the Kamilaroi tribe, Charlie Livermore was respected throughout society and will remain in the hearts and minds of those whose lives he saved and those who he touched through his incredible life story.
       </p>
       <p>
        At Tingha at the 11 o'clock service a plaque was unveiled for the 36 or 37 Aborigines who signed up for the war. People there told me about Charlie. He could scavenge through the bush; that was his Aboriginal teaching. So he'd scavenge for food and he'd keep others alive. Prisoners of war relied on him for extra food. It was amazing how he pointed the bone at the terrible Japanese guard. Of course, the guard got very sick and died. What a great Australian was Charlie Livermore. And with all those Aboriginals who went to war, volunteered and were keen to get out there and do their part to protect our country being remembered on a plaque at Tingha this year, I thought it was fitting I talk about Charlie Livermore tonight. May he rest in peace: a great Australian, a great digger, a prisoner of war and a well-respected Aboriginal member of the Tingha community. Rest in peace, Charlie.
