        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
         Mr President
        </a>
        , today I present the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties’ Report 156: Treaties tabled on 8 September 2015.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Report 156 covers three proposed treaties:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr President, air service agreements are bilateral treaties that allow commercial air travel between two countries.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The proposed Agreement with Laos details the number of flights; and the number of passengers and the quantum of freight that can be transported between Australia and Laos using commercial air services.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Agreement" rel="nofollow">
         The Agreement
        </a>
        permits airlines from each country to set up operations in the other country, including selling tickets, reaching code sharing arrangements with other airlines, offering package deals combining international air travel and domestic travel, and having fair commercial access to airports and related facilities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Agreement also emphasises the importance of air safety and security in relation to commercial air travel between Australia and Laos. All aircraft and staff involved in commercial air travel between the two countries must be certified to the relevant international standard. In addition, the authorities of each country have the right to inspect aircraft and facilities operated by an airline from the other country for both safety and security reasons.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Each country has the right to suspend without notice the services of an airline of the other country if there is a safety or security problem.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr President, at the moment, there are no direct commercial flights between Australia and Laos. However, the Committee hopes that this agreement will encourage stronger commercial ties between Australia and Laos.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr President, mutual legal assistance agreements establish formal mechanisms for cooperation between countries in the pursuit of criminal matters. Australia has 29 such agreements at present.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Agreement with Brazil will enable Australia and Brazil to cooperate in tackling serious and organised crime, such as drug trafficking, money laundering, human trafficking, people smuggling, cybercrime and terrorism.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Specifically, these agreements establish a framework for requesting and considering a request for legal assistance in relation to a criminal matter. The assistance rendered can include:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr President, a number of checks and balances are included in the agreement.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In particular:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        In relation to the death penalty, Government witnesses advised that Brazil has not conducted an execution since 1855.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr President, the final treaty considered in the Report I am tabling today contains amendments to the Convention on the Safety of Life at Sea, which is generally known by its acronym,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLAS" rel="nofollow">
         SOLAS
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        SOLAS contains basic minimum requirements for the safe construction, equipping and operation of ships at sea.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The proposed amendments to SOLAS include:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr President, I can advise that the Committee supports all the proposed treaty actions.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         The Committee
        </a>
        has recommended binding treaty action in relation to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Services_Agreement" rel="nofollow">
         Air Services Agreement
        </a>
        with Laos and the Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement with Brazil.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Amendments to SOLAS are deemed accepted by parties on a set date, so no recommendation is required.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr President, on behalf of the Committee, I commend the Report to the Senate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Question agreed to.
