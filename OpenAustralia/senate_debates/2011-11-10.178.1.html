         I note that Senator Xenophon was unable to be in the chamber today for personal reasons. He has requested that it be recorded in the
         <i>
          Hansard
         </i>
         that, had he been able to be in the Senate, he would have voted in support of both the Tobacco Plain Packaging Bill 2011 and the Trade Marks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Bill 2011.

          I know it is a little unusual to make a third reading speech, but this will be very short. I have commended the Minister for Health and Ageing for her leadership in this case. I think it is also appropriate that we recognise that our department, the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health_and_Ageing" rel="nofollow">

          , has shown enormous leadership, both here in Australia and internationally, and we should commend the many officers of that department who have done so much to get us to this point.

           by leave—Before I ask that the question be divided, I will just make a short statement.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
            Can I
           </a>
           say once again for the record that the coalition has sought at all stages to support—and indeed we are supporting—the passage of this legislation. I place on the record that it has been most disappointing the way Minister Roxon has chosen, in public fora and through media release, to seek to blame the coalition for the delays. I reiterate that it is not the coalition's role to determine what is or is not listed for debate in this chamber—that is proposed by the government. I say once again that on the last occasion the way the minister acted in relation to this legislation was appalling. I will not reiterate the comments I made in my speech in the second reading debate but I would say that on the last occasion, on 12 October, it was the Manager of Government Business, Senator Ludwig, who called for a debate on a change of hours and a variation in the business on that morning, which, of course, meant that the government on that day decided the order of business. So, if there was any delay, it was a delay which can be laid fully at the feet of the government. I take great exception to the minister's continued false assertions that the coalition was responsible for the delay of the passage of these bills. I ask that the question be divided, given that the coalition will be supporting one bill and not the other. We will not call the vote on the third reading, but could those comments be noted.
