        My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Conroy. How many car dealers facing closure as a result of the government’s bungled unlimited deposit guarantee have received new financing arrangements under the government’s special purpose vehicle announced last year?

           , I raise a point of order. We now have standing orders in this place that require the minister to be directly relevant to the question that has been asked. Clearly, the answer being given by the senator for the last 25 seconds or so—about 25 per cent of the time that he is given to answer the question—has been completely off. It has not been relevant in any way, shape or form.

             Money to withdraw from the Australian financing market. Both companies stated that the global financial crisis and the financial position of their respective parent companies were the reasons for the decision. The government has moved quickly to work with industry to develop an assistance scheme for automotive dealerships. The scheme consists of a special purpose vehicle to provide liquidity to car dealer financiers, who will then be able to assist dealerships that were unable to quickly secure alternative funding following the announced withdrawal of GMAC and

             .
            </p>
            <p>
             The special purpose vehicle became operational on 1 January 2009. The government will provide support to the

             in the form of a guarantee expected to cover a minor proportion of the transactions with dealers. The SPV is a transitional arrangement only and will remain in place until viable dealers establish new funding arrangements. The SPV is approximately $2 billion. It will operate with government support refinancing dealerships for a period—

              , I ask a supplementary question. I think that if he looks further into the brief he will find that the answer is zero, but we will try him on another question. Will the minister explain to the Senate the definition of a ‘viable’ business, as outlined in the special purpose vehicle guidelines?

                , I have a further supplementary question. Given the minister’s previous answers, is it a fact that despite the government’s rhetoric the special purpose vehicle will not prevent dealership closures and job losses in the car retailing sector? Why won’t the government simply come clean and admit that this situation could have been avoided if it had consulted with and listened to the
