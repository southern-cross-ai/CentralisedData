        My question is to the Minister for Finance, Senator Gallagher. Minister, last week you told the Senate that you first heard about sexual assault allegations in the week prior to them becoming public on 15 February 2021. Today the
        <i>
         Australian
        </i>
        newspaper reports that, in late January and early February 2021, Mr Martin Fisk, whose wife, Sandra, is the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        Labor Party's operations manager, told the ACT Victims of Crime Commissioner that he was working with a young woman who was about to make a sexual assault disclosure that 'would likely attract media attention'. Minister, did Mr Fisk or his wife Sandra ever raise these allegations with you or your office prior to 15 February 2021.

         I raise a point of order as to whether that question is in order. These are—
        </p>
        <p>
         I'll take that interjection. Senator Gallagher has answered question after question on this and has been upfront and transparent with the Senate. I didn't take objection to the nature of the questioning, with reference to President Hogg's ruling, for two days, after which time I drew the President's attention to it. We are now at the point where the opposition, in their desperate attempt to continue this tactic—despite what the

          DPP

         has said about Ms Higgins's mental state at the conclusion of her trial—are asking about alleged conversations about which the minister has made no statement. I respectfully submit that the question is not in order.

          President, in relation to the point of order by Minister Wong, it is clearly in order for, as President Hogg's ruling makes clear—as have subsequent rulings—a minister to be asked about statements they have made as a minister and, in particular, to be asked about statements they have made as a minister in this chamber. This question was premised first and foremost by referencing Senator Gallagher's statement—

            This question was premised first and foremost by referencing Senator Gallagher's statement to the Senate last week, and, as has been the case with questioning in relation to this, it is seeking to ascertain the veracity of those statements, given the deep concern about the minister having potentially misled the chamber. That is the basis upon which these questions have been asked and where this question is presented: testing the statement of the minister to the Senate in her capacity as a minister.

                Hollie, you can stop saying 'wow', because I am being absolutely upfront here. But you are now asking me things that if—and I'm happy to answer. The answer to the question is no. I'm happy to answer that because, even though it's not relevant and it's not relevant to my statement, I know what you would do if I didn't answer it. I know exactly what you would do, Senator Henderson and others. If you would like me to go through my telephone book and show you who's in my contacts, other diary appointments and things like that, we can continue to play this game. But in the meantime—and we have to be serious. We cannot stand here and say that we are creating a safe environment for staff, a safe workplace or an environment where women are encouraged to come forward and raise complaints about the way they were treated if—

                   report to those who attend morning teas and breakfasts and continue to say how they support women to come forward and raise their complaints in this workplace and others—all of you who do those things—to reflect on the line of questioning you are pursuing, which is over and above the issues that I responded to in my statement last week and the concerns that have been raised around my comments in estimates. The answer to the question is 'no'. I'm continuing to answer them because I know exactly what will happen if I don't. But I would also say that there are some other questions that need answers in this place. How did text messages get leaked? How did a draft statement of claim for compensation get leaked? How did all of that get leaked?
