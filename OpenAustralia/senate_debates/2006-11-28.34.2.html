        My question is directed to Senator Minchin, representing the Prime Minister. Is the minister aware that, between 1998 and 2004, there were a number of reports of unassessed intelligence highlighting that Iraq was circumventing

        as to why it disregarded these intelligence reports and why they were not deemed important enough to alert the

           Yes, I have lots of reports to read at the moment. As I said, I am not sure what reference Cole makes or does not make to the role of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ONA" rel="nofollow">
            ONA
           </a>
           , but I am happy to come back to Senator Faulkner with information on the question of whether or not there is any reference in the Cole report to the ONA and its role in the whole matter. I am happy to do that.
          </p>
          <p>
           In relation to the matter as a whole, I think, as Senator Faulkner would understand, the Cole inquiry has been thoroughly exhaustive. This has been a year-long, expensive, diligent and very thorough inquiry—the most thorough inquiry conducted anywhere in the world in response to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">

We are the only country in the world to have instigated a fully independent and transparent inquiry into the role of the Australian company named in the Volcker report.

                   —we were the only country in the world to set up a fully fledged commission of inquiry, which examined in great detail what went on and made recommendations, and we will act upon those recommendations. There is argument from the Labor Party about the terms of reference. I think those allegations are scotched by Commissioner Cole’s own statements with respect to the terms of reference—that is, that we made it clear that if he sought a widening of the terms of reference, they would be widened. We amended the terms of reference on five separate occasions in accordance with Mr Cole’s requests. If he had requested any further terms of reference changes, we would have granted them.

                   Commissioner Cole has vindicated the role of the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs in this matter. He has cleared them of any implications, any knowledge of these matters. He has indicted AWB for its deliberate misleading of everybody involved—the UN and the government—in relation to these matters. We are moving quickly to establish a task force, with the appropriate legislation that we will need, in the next two weeks. I presume the opposition will fully support that legislation to ensure that charges can be brought where appropriate. As to the particular role of the

                   , as I said, I am happy to get back to Senator Faulkner as to whether there is any reference to that in the report or any information I can give him.

                    , I ask a supplementary question. I note that the minister spent most of his answer not answering the questions that I asked. Nevertheless, I do acknowledge that the minister has given a commitment that he will come back and answer the substantive question that I asked. I would ask the minister if he could do that as quickly as possible—and certainly, I would hope, before the close of business today.

                    As a supplementary question, I ask that the minister also seek advice—if he is unable to answer in question time today—as to whether, given that the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and
