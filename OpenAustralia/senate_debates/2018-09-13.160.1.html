        My question is to the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Fifield. I refer to the minister who, on Tuesday, told the Senate, in relation to the sacking of former Prime Minister Turnbull:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … the Liberal party room made a collective decision in relation to the leadership of the party.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rather than explain how Prime Minister Turnbull was sacked, can the minister explain why the collective decision was made?

         It's curious that those opposite are very interested in all of us on this side. I have to say, our focus isn't those who occupy this chamber; our focus is on the Australian people. What we are focused on is transacting the people's business. As you rose to your feet, Senator O'Neill, I thought for one fleeting moment you were going to ask me about the

          A point of order on relevance: the minister may construct whatever question he wishes me to ask. The one I did ask, however, was: can the minister explain why the collective decision was made to remove the former Prime Minister?

            Thank you, Senator O'Neill, for your point of order there—always welcome. As I was saying, we are focused remorselessly on transacting the people's business. The matter that the senator raised in her question is one that has already been canvassed and addressed.

                 Was that the answer? Okay. I refer to reports that following the week of Liberal leadership chaos, 'Sources in both camps have concluded that the outcome was likely engineered by Morrison supporters from the beginning.' Do these reports explain the minister's swinging loyalty, that he's, in fact, a strategic genius loyal to Mr Morrison all along and that he even outfoxed Senator Cormann?

                  Senator O'Neill has obviously been working on this all week—the last question on the last day of the sitting week. All I can do is reiterate that the leadership of the parliamentary Liberal Party is a decision that is made collectively by members and senators.
