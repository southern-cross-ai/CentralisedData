         I have seen an email exchange which suggests that, but the email exchange—and you did not say this in your question, Senator Moore—indicates that the lecture was to be the 2015 lecture. At the time that invitation was made and accepted, the royal commission was to report by 31 December 2014. So the lecture was to be many months after Mr Heydon at the time expected no longer to be occupied with the royal commission.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Thank you, Attorney. Can the Attorney-General further confirm that Commissioner Heydon reconfirmed his attendance to speak at this Liberal Party event in April this year, despite his term as royal commissioner being extended, as you have said, until December 2015?

           I have seen an email exchange to that effect, yes. Lest you think there is anything unusual about that, let me read you some words from the inaugural

          <p class="italic">
           Yet unlike the British, from whom we otherwise derived so many conventions of political and civic life, Australians tend to observe a highly partisan view of their politicians, even after they have left politics. This is an infantile disorder. We need to grow out of it and acknowledge warmly those who have contributed to our public life.

           That lecture, the inaugural Neville Wran lecture, was delivered on 13 November 2008 by the Hon.

           lecture, promoted by the Lawyers Branch of the Liberal Party. Michael Kirby gives the Neville Wran lecture, promoted by the Australian Labor Party. I do not think there is anything wrong with either.

            , I ask a further supplementary question. Thank you, Attorney, for that answer. Can you now advise how last week's statement that the commissioner would be unable to give the Barwick address 'if there is any possibility that the event could be described as a Liberal Party event' is consistent with an email to the commissioner in April last year that advises the lecture is organised by Lawyers Branch, which is formally part of the Liberal Party?

             Senator Moore, I do not know if you were watching the royal commission yesterday, but the royal commissioner explained that very clearly, and I accept his explanation entirely.
