        I rise this evening to congratulate the Wanneroo

         RSL
        </a>
        Sub-Branch on the opening of its new clubrooms at the Wanneroo Community Centre. On 20 August, I was delighted to join Sub-Branch President Jack Le Cras
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        , the patron Brigadier Stephen Coggin, Warden Peter Tuck and committee members Peter Epps, Sue Epps and Sue Tucker at the official opening.
       </p>
       <p>
        The new base on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_Drive" rel="nofollow">
         Civic Drive
        </a>
        in Wanneroo provides the sub-branch with greater space to highlight the service and sacrifice of service men and women, enhance member participation and support community outreach programs across the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Wanneroo" rel="nofollow">
         City of Wanneroo
        </a>
        and, indeed, across all of Perth's northern suburbs.
       </p>
       <p>
        The clubrooms afford Wanneroo RSL the opportunity to showcase its significant collection of military history and memorabilia from wars, conflicts and peacekeeping operations. The impressive display, which was primarily collected by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War" rel="nofollow">
         Vietnam War
        </a>
        veteran Peter Tuck, hasn't seen the light of day until now and includes priceless reminders of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">
         World War I
        </a>
        , World War

        , the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War" rel="nofollow">
         Korean War
        </a>
        , the Vietnam War and even a French bayonet from 1872.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was inspiring to hear about the sub-branch committee's bold plans for the new clubrooms, which include coordinating school excursions, public open days, promoting veterans service stories and developing veteran advocacy and welfare services. But Wanneroo RSL's plans don't stop there, with the committee also seeking to develop a peace garden at the nearby memorial park, possibly featuring a historic anchor, cannons and propellers.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was particularly pleased again to have the chance to extend my personal congratulations to Jack Le Cras OAM at the opening. Jack is one of our living treasures. In June 1944, aged just 17, Jack was conscripted by the

        when news of the Japanese surrender broke on 15 August 1945. Jack's story is unique and he is one of very few Australians to have witnessed the signing of the

        several weeks later on 2 September 1945. Jack was responsible for escorting the Royal Australian Navy Vice Admiral John Collins to the surrender ceremony during which

       <p>
        Jack gave ABC and 6PR interviews on 14 August this year, marking the 75th anniversary of the

         Victory in the Pacific Day
        </a>
        and the cessation of World War II, offering a brief glimpse into his significant and very memorable life experiences.
       </p>
       <p>
        The rest of the 94-year-old Kingsley veteran Jack's life has also been nothing short of remarkable, including working as a supervising broadcaster during the 1962 Perth Commonwealth Games and the 1982 Brisbane Commonwealth Games. Jack's service to the community of Perth, particularly to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Returned_and_Services_League" rel="nofollow">
         Returned and Services League
        </a>
        , and the Naval Association of Australia, was deservedly recognised with a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        at the 2012 Australia Day Awards. Jack continues to serve the community in Perth's northern suburbs as Wanneroo RSL Sub-Branch president and coordinator of the Wanneroo RSL Anzac Day dawn service, which was held at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Memorial Park
        </a>
        in Wanneroo.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Anzac Day service, which Jack started in 2017, has quickly gained the reputation of being one of the biggest in Perth's northern suburbs, with more than 3,000 people in attendance. The Wanneroo dawn service is an experience to behold, which includes a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Moth" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and the participation of a host of community organisations, including the Limelight Theatre, Wanneroo Lions Club and the 1st Wanneroo Scout Group.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm particularly proud to be supporting Jack and the great work that he continues to do to support the Wanneroo RSL application for a community grant under the Saluting Their Service Commemorative Grants program to even better showcase their military history for community organisations and schools.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of all Liberal senators in this place—and I note that the Minister for Defence is here with me tonight, Senator the Hon. Linda Reynolds—we congratulate Jack, we thank him for his service and we thank everyone at the Wanneroo RSL Sub-Branch for their continuing support of the dedication and sacrifice of so many Australian men and women.
