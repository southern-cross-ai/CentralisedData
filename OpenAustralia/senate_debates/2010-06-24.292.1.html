         as if they were receiving exceptional circumstances relief payments for welfare related purposes. In other words, this bill had to pass tonight; otherwise, the government’s new drought relief trial in Western Australia could not have occurred. There is concern that those circumstances may arise, so it is important that this bill be passed this evening. I have to say that it is really very disappointing that we had to wait until almost the twelfth hour to get this passed, as it did not pass the House of Representatives until late this afternoon, even though the announcement was made some time ago.
        </p>
        <p>
         The opposition are pleased to support this piece of legislation, because it is looking at the future of drought relief in the country. It is important that we take this process forward and have a look at new ways of providing support to the rural sector. It is important to note that the trial will not affect farmers currently receiving income support payments and interest rate subsidies under the old

          . We think this is important. It is a new approach to how we handle issues related to drought and climate change. As I have noted in this chamber a number of times, in my home state of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           Western Australia
          </a>
          we are already starting to feel the impacts of climate change in some of our farming areas. Our farmers in Western Australia are extremely adaptive. Coming from an agricultural background, I understand very clearly how hard they work and how they do adapt to changing circumstances and climate variability. However, you get to a point where it is extremely difficult to adapt. So I think this is a good, innovative trial. My concern is that it is not being funded for long enough. We will see how this goes, but I do want to put on the record that the Greens support this and are pleased to be seeing such a new approach being trialled.

           . I wish to place on the record—and the minister is here in the chamber to hear this—that the opposition has again been exceptionally cooperative with the legislative program for the day. This is the last piece of legislation that will be passing through the chamber today. I understand that about 25 pieces of legislation have been transacted after a lot of negotiation and consultation over many weeks. It would be appreciated if the government would be kind enough to acknowledge this and inform Minister Albanese once again that the Senate is not obstructionist; that the Senate is being exceptionally accommodating in relation to a very large proportion of the government’s agenda. With those words, I indicate our support of the third reading of this bill.
