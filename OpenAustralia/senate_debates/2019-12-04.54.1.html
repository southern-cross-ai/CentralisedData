        I rise this afternoon to recognise the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        n finalists in the WA Australian of the Year Awards of 2020. This remarkable array of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">

        s serves our nation with distinction in sections as diverse as education, medicine and science.

        Western Australian of the Year finalist Annie Fogarty

       </p>
       <p>
        The Senior Australian of the Year finalist Professor John Newman is a pioneer in modern obstetrics. John is considered to be one of the world's leading voices in premature birth prevention. In 2018, John delivered a successful national rollout of the Australian Preterm Birth Pretension Alliance, a groundbreaking program which resulted in an eight per cent decrease in the incidences of premature births in Western Australia.

        And, of course, Young Australian of the Year finalist Yarlalu Thomas is a medical student and public health fellow, specialising in genetic and rare diseases. Yarlalu works with the WA Register of Developmental Anomalies, Genetic Services WA and Cliniface to revolutionise genetic healthcare services for Indigenous people. Yarlalu, who synthesises modern scientific and medical knowledge with ancient Aboriginal and

        WA Local Hero finalist Suzy Urbaniak is a decorated science educator and mentor, having received a number of eminent honours, including the Prime Minister's prize for excellence in science teaching and induction into the WA Women's Hall of Fame. Susie, who's motivated by seeing young people understand the applications of science to the real world, developed the Centre of Resources Excellence, a trailblazing science, technology, engineering and maths, or

       </p>
       <p>
        It's my distinct pleasure to congratulate Annie Fogarty OAM, Professor John Newman, Yarlalu Thomas and Suzy Urbaniak for their merited recognition as WA finalists in the WA Australian of the Year Awards of 2020.

        Secondly, I would like to acknowledge Julie Hughes of Ashdale Secondary College for finalising in the WA Education Awards of 2019. Julie was named as a Western Australian Beginning Teacher of the Year finalist for her innovative methods pertaining to science education. Ashdale Secondary College and its students are enriched by the presence of passionate educators like Julie. Indeed, my niece and nephew both attended and were educated at Ashdale Secondary College in Darch, so I know personally of the quality education provided by educators like Julie. This afternoon it's my hope that the Senate will agree to a notice of motion that I have, supported by other

        senators, to recognise the wonderful work of Julie and other notable West Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        In November, I had the privilege of supporting a number of occasions scheduled by Perth's Indian communities, namely the Indian Society of Western Australia, known in WA as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISWA" rel="nofollow">
         ISWA
        </a>
        , and Sikh Gurdwara Perth Inc. Diwali Mela, or the Hindu Festival of Lights, symbolises the spiritual victory of light over darkness, good over evil and knowledge over ignorance. Diwali Mela saw 30,000 people pour into the Claremont Showground in Perth on 1, 2 and 3 November. I'd like to extend my congratulations—and, I'm sure, the congratulations of all those 30,000 people—to the Indian Society of WA and to its president, Surya Ambati, and the ISWA management committee for providing every West Australian the chance to embrace this distinctly beautiful Hindu custom. I wish Perth's Indian community a very happy Diwali.
       </p>
       <p>
        Perth's Sikh communities venerated the 550th birth anniversary of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru_Nanak_Dev_Ji" rel="nofollow">
         Guru Nanak Dev Ji

        in Perth, saw more than 3,000 Western Australians enjoy and participate in this important occasion. I compliment the Sikh Gurdwara Perth Inc. president, Mrs Kaur Uppal, and her management committee on sharing Guru Nanak Dev's lessons of honesty, equality and goodwill with the people of Western Australia. Thank you to the Prime Minister also for sending his best wishes to Perth's Sikh communities to mark this special and, indeed, historic occasion.
       </p>
       <p>
        Gurpurab, on 12 November, saw Sikh Gurdwara Perth in Bennett Springs celebrate the 550th anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev Ji. Guru Nanak Gurpurab saw more than 5,000 people celebrate what is one of the most sacred festivals in Sikhism. To the Perth Sikh community, I wish you all a very happy Gurpurab.
       </p>
       <p>
        The celebrations of the 550th anniversary of the birth of Guru Nanak Dev Ji culminated in a sport and youth day on 16 November. Sikh Gurdwara Perth in Bennett Springs played stadium as youth from the Sikh community participated in a suite of different sports, including netball and soccer. I am looking forward to seeing, as we all saw on that day, the star-studded Perth Sikh Swans showcase their exceptional netball skills. I'm pleased to report the sports youth day was well attended on what turned out to be a very, very warm Perth summer's day.
       </p>

        Finally, the Westnam United Soccer Club celebrated its night of nights at the 2019 Westnam United Soccer Club awards night on 8 November at the Macedonian hall in Perth. Westnam United Soccer Club is symbolic of the benefits of grassroots sport, so I was delighted to provide a congratulatory message to the Westnam United Soccer Club awards night. The Westnam United Soccer Club awards night recognised the coaches, the managers and the players who represent the beating heart of Westnam United Soccer Club, a grassroots sport. I praise the Westnam United Soccer Club for celebrating the particular importance of the role played by its coaches, its officials and its volunteers, who brought this important event together. Of course, I congratulate the winners of the golden boots award, the juniors award, the managers award and the volunteers award. I would like to highlight the winners of the Westnam United Soccer Club

Thank you to Westnam United Soccer Club president Ted Nguyen and his management committee for their dedication to soccer promotion in diverse communities, a mission which I'm committed to supporting as its major sponsor again in the Asian Communities Cup finals next year.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2019 Asian Communities Cup sees seniors and masters teams from Perth's Chinese, Korean, Singaporean and Vietnamese communities compete in an exciting knockout competition. I'm privileged to be presenting the 2019 Asian Communities Cup, and I wish all the participants the very, very best of good sportsmanship. To reiterate, I'm dedicated to continuing my support of the Asian Communities Cup in 2020 and beyond and to partnering with the Westnam United Soccer Club to expand the Asian Communities Cup to include junior and women's teams into the future.
