        , my question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Social Services, Senator Ryan. On Friday, 28 October,
        <i>
         The Australian
        </i>
        had an article titled 'Welfare pays more than work.' The article claimed that a single parent with four children was able to earn more per year from income support payments than they could from a median full-time wage after tax. Analysis of the data showed that the figure for the working parent had not factored in the $30,910 in family tax benefits they would also receive. Did any member of the government, their staff or anyone from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Social Services
        </a>
        provide the so-called new government data mentioned in the article in
        <i>
         The Australia
        </i>
        ? If so, what was the nature of the data provided?

         I thank Senator Siewert for her question. I am familiar with the article. I am advised that the government never said that parents would be better off on welfare compared to getting a job, and that particular characterisation that you referred to was one of the media and not of government. The Minister for Social Services gave a very comprehensive speech about—

         Senator Carr, the Minister for Social Services gave a very comprehensive speech outlining a number of the challenges in the welfare space, and a number of the facts are worthy of repeating here. One of the cameos I can go through: the parenting payment single recipient for a person—

           I suspect I have heard those cameos before. I asked very specifically: did any member of the government, their staff or anyone from the

                  , I think it is a little odd that the senator is assuming that I would be able to peer into the minister's mind in a period of questions without notice. I am quite happy to outline the facts that I have at hand, but I am in no position whatever either to agree with the characterisation as outlined by Senator Siewert, to accept it as legitimate, or to peer into the mind of the minister I represent in here. I am happy to present facts.

                    Perhaps the minister, in taking that on notice, could also take on notice whether the government or the minister's office did in fact do any analysis before the minister made any comments on this and whether the data presented in the article was accurate or included a fair comparison of like-on-like—in other words, both groups were receiving family tax benefit.
