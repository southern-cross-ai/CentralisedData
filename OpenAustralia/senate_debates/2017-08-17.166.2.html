         Brian Francis Gibson was born in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascot_Vale" rel="nofollow">
          Ascot Vale
         </a>
         in Victoria on 4 November 1936. He was the eldest of 10 children of Kingsley Melbourne Gibson and his wife Agnes. After completing his secondary education at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Patrick's_College" rel="nofollow">
          St Patrick's College
         </a>
         in Ballarat, Brian followed his father into a career in forestry, undertaking further study by way of a Bachelor of Science in Forestry and a
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts" rel="nofollow">
          Bachelor of Arts
         </a>
         at the University of Melbourne. From 1957 until 1972 he worked with the Forests Commission of Victoria, and it was during his early years with the commission that he married Pauline Veronica James, with whom he had three children, Sharon, Kieran and David.
        </p>
        <p>
         The beginning of Brian's association with Tasmania came in 1972 when he was recruited by the paper and pulping firm
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Newsprint_Mills" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Newsprint Mills
         </a>
         in the town of Boyer. Before taking up this new role, however, Brian travelled to Jamaica with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          United Nations
         </a>
         Food and Agriculture Organization to lend his expertise to a forestry project in that nation. Returning to Tasmania, he went on to serve as
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Managing_Director" rel="nofollow">
          Managing Director
         </a>
         of Australian Newsprint Mills from 1980 to 1989 and as President of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association" rel="nofollow">
          National Association
         </a>
         of Forest Industries from 1987 to 1991. These were years during which the polarising disputes between conservationists and the Tasmanian forestry sector were particularly acute, and Brian's time at the helm of the industry's peak advocacy body no doubt coloured his views on the impediments to his state's future prosperity. He was no friend of the Greens. In his maiden speech, he lamented the fact that, although the environmental movement had successfully widened our understanding of the need for environmental consciousness, unfortunately the extremists of the movement had been successful in creating unnecessary concern about particular issues, and the political decisions which had arisen had done great harm to our economy and the investment climate.
        </p>
        <p>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Gibson" rel="nofollow">
          Brian Gibson
         </a>
         won preselection by the Tasmanian division of the Liberal Party and was elected to the Senate at the 1993 federal election, taking the place of the retiring Liberal senator for Tasmania,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Walters" rel="nofollow">
          Shirley Walters
         </a>
         , whose death we mourned only recently. In his maiden speech in this place, Brian paid tribute to the significant contributions of his predecessor but sought to assure his colleagues that they 'should not expect the same frequency of interjections from this seat', an assurance which I am sure all honourable senators who served with him would agree he lived up to. But that did nothing to diminish the significance of his contribution to the parliament. He was an exquisitely polite man.
        </p>
        <p>
         At 56 years of age, Brian had already had an enormously successful career in business when he took his place in this chamber. He had been chief executive of Australian Newsprint Mills for nearly a decade and was also an independent director of several large corporations, including being chairman of the Hydro-Electric Commission. In 1988, he had been appointed a
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Member of the Order of Australia
         </a>
         for his services to the forestry industry. Being responsible for managing Australian Newsprint Mills, one of Australia's few internationally competitive manufacturers in that sector, was, Brian observed, 'a good position from which to observe and understand the Australian economy'. In his maiden speech he made no secret of his intention to use his precious time in this place directing his energies towards reforming the economy and the business of government. It was microeconomic reform in particular which was for Brian an issue of moral concern, for he was adamant that it was only through increased productivity, together with fiscal restraint, that Australia could remain prosperous—wise words, indeed—not, as he insisted, for ourselves but for our children and their children, 'so that they have options available to them to devote what they wish to leisure, to the arts and to the environment, to those less well off in the world'.
        </p>
        <p>
         Drawing upon a lifetime of managerial and business experience, Brian Gibson quickly established a reputation within the Liberal Party as a forceful and well-informed advocate for economic reform. Just 10 months into his first term, in May 1994, he was appointed parliamentary secretary to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Alston" rel="nofollow">
          Richard Alston
         </a>
         , and from December 1994 he served as parliamentary secretary to the shadow Treasurer,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Costello" rel="nofollow">
          Peter Costello
         </a>
         . Reflecting on his time in parliament in the twilight of his Senate career, Brian Gibson identified his time in opposition as among the most productive years in which he was able to apply his economic and business expertise to the broad scope of significant legislative change then being pursued by the Keating government. Based on his reflections, it is clear that he saw himself as an economic reformist first and a partisan politician second, and he noted that he was proud to play a part in the formulation of national competition policy and the work of the newly minted
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          Productivity Commission
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Following
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
          John Howard
         </a>
         's election victory in 1996, Brian Gibson joined the first Howard government as Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, a particularly important role for a newly elected government determined to embark upon a course of significant economic reform. He had responsibility, among other things, for the corporations law and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Securities_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Securities Commission
         </a>
         , as it was then known.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, sadly, his time in the ministry was short lived. In October 1996, just seven months into the life of the Howard government, the Prime Minister formed the view, on a strict reading of his new code of conduct, that Brian should resign from the ministry because it had been revealed that he had signed a statutory instrument related to banking which affected a bank in which he held a small parcel of shares but by which he could not, in any way, have gained advantage. I had cause some years into my Senate career to reflect on the circumstances that led to Brian Gibson's resignation and the foreshortening of what would have been a very significant career in executive government at the forefront of economic reform. I gave a speech on the subject of ministerial responsibility to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANU" rel="nofollow">
          ANU
         </a>
         College of Law, and I recalled that many thought at the time that Brian Gibson's dismissal was unwarranted in the circumstances, but those were the early days of the government, and the Prime Minister was no doubt concerned to reinforce the public perception that his new code of conduct was unforgiving in its strictness. Subsequently, amendments were made which would allow an appropriate flexibility without compromising its purpose—to some extent, no doubt, in response to the injustice of the Gibson case.
        </p>
        <p>
         As I also said about the circumstances of Brian Gibson's resignation, no suggestion of dishonesty was made by anyone, because such a suggestion would have been risible. A more careful, more honest, more punctilious man than Brian Gibson it would have been impossible to know. And it is a great tragedy that an overzealous application of that document by a then inexperienced Prime Minister had that effect. The view I then expressed and express again today would, I think, be shared by virtually everyone, including, I dare say, Mr Howard himself.
        </p>
        <p>
         The injustice of Brian Gibson's resignation was taken up again by many of his Senate colleagues on the occasion of his valedictory, as was the characteristic stoicism that he had displayed in the aftermath. Reflecting on the episode, Senator Boswell observed that the dignity with which Brian exited the front bench will go down as one of the highlights of his career. A lesser person could have said: 'That's enough; I've had a gutful. You go and do it yourself now.' But he did not. He 'knuckled down and made a considerable contribution'. But perhaps the most poignant reflection on Brian Gibson's contribution to this place came from a political foe and a former senator who would be familiar to many in this place, none other than the Hon.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Conroy" rel="nofollow">
          Stephen Conroy
         </a>
         , who said of Brian, simply, that his resignation was Australia's loss.
        </p>
        <p>
         I had a personal association with Brian Gibson, relatively fleeting, but one that meant a lot to me. When I was first elected to the Senate, some 17 years ago, I had the good fortune to be allocated a seat beside Senator Gibson, up there where he and I sat, where Senator McKenzie and Senator Canavan currently sit. The coalition in those days had the practice of seating new senators beside older, more experienced senators. We'd not met before, and our association was relatively brief because he resigned from the Senate in February 2002. But, in the less than two years during which I got to know Brian Gibson, particularly as a new and inexperienced and enthusiastic younger senator, he was very kind to me, and he was very patient with me. As I said, a more honest, fussy, punctilious gentleman you would never hope to meet.
        </p>
        <p>
         Brian Gibson resigned from the Senate in February 2002 to return to the world of business, in which he had achieved such notable success in his prepolitical life. It is worthy of note that, at the time he served in this chamber, he was probably the most experienced senior businessperson to sit in the parliament, and the loss of all of that commercial experience was itself a tragedy. In his postpolitical life, he served on the board of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Stem_Cell_Centre" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Stem Cell Centre
         </a>
         and as a director of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_National_Maritime_Museum" rel="nofollow">
          Australian National Maritime Museum
         </a>
         , among other positions.
        </p>
        <p>
         Brian Gibson was an astute businessman, a capable parliamentarian, a cherished and honourable colleague and a devoted husband and father. He came to this place at the peak of his career. He gave significant service in policy development in a complex field to which he brought almost unique expertise, and, after the political mishap that befell him, he left in good grace and high esteem. On behalf of the government, I offer my sincere condolences to his loved ones.

          Gibson AM, who passed away this week. At the outset, I convey our condolences to Mr Gibson's family and friends. He was a senator for 8½ years and, considering his contribution, particularly in the context of economic policy, I think it is reasonable to say he was unfortunate not to have had the opportunity to contribute for a longer period as a member of the executive. However, his contribution as a leader in both public and private enterprise and his work as a senator means his legacy stands tall, particularly in economic policy.
         </p>
         <p>
          Born in Victoria, Mr Gibson's professional career was in the forest and forestry products sector. Initially an employee of the Forests Commission Victoria between 1957 and 1972, it was a job opportunity with
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Newsprint_Mills" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Newsprint Mills
          </a>

          that saw him cross
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_Strait" rel="nofollow">
           Bass Strait
          </a>
          and make Tasmania his home. I note that prior to taking up this position he fulfilled his commitment to using his professional skills for greater economic and social good by working for the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
           United Nations
          </a>
          on a forestry project in Jamaica.
         </p>
         <p>
          In 1980 he became managing director of Australian Newsprint Mills, a position he held until 1989, and he also served between 1987 and 1991 as the President of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAFI" rel="nofollow">
           NAFI

          , the

           National Association
          </a>
          of Forest Industries, an organisation with which I have some familiarity and which has played a prominent role in Tasmania's forest debates over many years. He was appointed a
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           Member of the Order of Australia
          </a>
          for his contribution to the industry in 1988. It was his professional and managerial experience that led the Tasmanian government to appoint him as the chairman of Tassie hydro in 1989. He would serve on the commission at a time when it was attempting to modernise to meet the challenges posed by the impending introduction of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Competition_Policy" rel="nofollow">
           National Competition Policy
          </a>
          , coincidentally a policy which accorded with his views on microeconomic reform.
         </p>
         <p>
          As the Leader of the Government has said, Mr Gibson was elected to the Senate in 1993, replacing the late
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Walters" rel="nofollow">
           Shirley Walters
          </a>
          . Re-elected in 1998, he served until 2002. He immediately indicated his interests and demonstrated his expertise in economic affairs by making a first speech that repudiated the protectionist policies that he described as the legacy of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Deakin" rel="nofollow">
           Alfred Deakin
          </a>
          . He decried the way such policies had inculcated, in his words, 'an inward-looking attitude within a high proportion of Australians that so many believe they do not have to be internationally competitive'. He went on to speak about the links between investment and microeconomic reform. He also advocated for major efficiency gains within the budget sector of government in order to reduce the taxation burden on individuals and business so that people would be encouraged to work harder, to save and to invest.
         </p>
         <p>
          Given his views, it is unsurprising he associated himself with what is known as the Modest Members group of parliamentarians, who championed fiscal responsibility and accountability. He also found a place with conservative senators and members connected by a shared Christian faith. He served on many parliamentary committees. I won't list them all but I do note in particular the role he played as chair of the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee and of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. As we know, the legislation committees play an important role in our Senate and, in particular, in the estimates process. Senator

          , I do want to say something quite genuinely. Brian Gibson was one of the best chairs of a parliamentary committee I have seen. He was a very good chair of an estimates committee basically because he understood politics—that was the difference. It was really crucial.
         </p>
         <p>
          However, as Senator Brandis has referenced, by far and away Mr Gibson's overarching contribution throughout his time in the Senate was in the area of economic policy. He came to this place with well-formed views about the place of government in the economy and the reforms he saw as necessary to lift the productivity of the Australian economy. His arrival was timely, as it coincided with a period of economic reform: the Keating government's own push for microeconomic reform. Then, of course, his career also flowed on to the Howard government's election and the changes that government sought and achieved for the tax system.
         </p>
         <p>
          First in opposition and then in government, Brian Gibson articulated three fundamental reforms to the budget process. These were the application of an accrual accounting method to Commonwealth budgets; the appointment of a
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Commission" rel="nofollow">
           National Commission
          </a>
          of Audit to report on Commonwealth finances and to lay out mid-term economic priorities; and the introduction of a Charter of Budget Honesty because he wanted governments to be held properly to account for their fiscal and economic policies. It says something about Mr Gibson's contribution that two of those have become the practice of the Commonwealth. Of course, the National Commission of Audit is something the previous governments have utilised. It is a testament to the way in which Brian Gibson made use of the opportunities presented to him by the parliament—such as through the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Accounts_Committee" rel="nofollow">
           Public Accounts Committee
          </a>
          and as a member of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committee" rel="nofollow">
           Select Committee
          </a>
          on Functions, Powers and Operation of the Australian Loan Council—as well as within his parliamentary party that all three of these reforms were enacted during his time in the parliament.
         </p>
         <p>
          Brian Gibson was a natural choice for the role of Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer following the election of the Howard government in 1996. He initiated overhauls in corporate law and administration, including corporate law simplification and reform. Senator Brandis has outlined in some detail the professional disappointment associated with his resignation after 10 months.
         </p>
         <p>
          Brian Gibson went on to chair a government members' taskforce on taxation reform and to assist in the public consultation process on the new taxation system. His role in the development of what became known as the A New Tax System package, best known for the introduction of the goods and services tax, is another lasting contribution to public policy, notwithstanding our political differences on that policy. He described these measures as 'probably the most important bills with regard to the structure of the economy of Australia that this parliament has seen for many a long day'. Brian Gibson left the Senate on his own terms in 2002 and went on to serve as an executive and board member in the private and public sector.
         </p>
         <p>
          Brian Gibson's political career was not long, but he made a substantial contribution. Any reading of his involvement at the forefront of many of the significant economic policy reforms of the mid to late 1990s shows a legacy that has endured. Perhaps most of all, he will be remembered as someone who stood by his principles both in ideology and in personal integrity. To leave politics with a reputation for dignity and honesty is something to which we would all aspire. On behalf of the opposition, I extend our deepest sympathies to Brian Gibson's family, friends and former colleagues at this time.

           Gibson AM was one of understated achievement, commitment and service. For those of us on the Tasmanian Liberal Senate team on whose behalf I have the privilege of speaking this afternoon, can I say we had the privilege of working with him. We had the privilege of interacting with and learning from a man of principle, a man of deep knowledge, experience, understanding and wisdom.
          </p>
          <p>
           Brian's many positions and achievements that have been fully detailed by the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Government_in_the_Senate" rel="nofollow">
            Leader of the Government in the Senate
           </a>
           , in anybody's language, is an impressive list. It needs to be understood that this list of achievements, appointments and positions was not just about padding out a
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CV" rel="nofollow">
            CV
           </a>
           . He devoted himself heart and soul to each task that he undertook. The understated nature of Brian is highlighted by the fact that his arrival in Canberra after the 'unlosable' election—which our side of politics went on to lose—was hardly recognised other than as a welcome new face rather than being recognised for the hotbed of policy talent and experience which was so sorely needed at the time.
          </p>
          <p>
           It was through his friend former President Paul Calvert that the leadership was alerted to his wealth of capacities. Once realised, those talents were immediately and effectively harnessed as he helped develop the policies in opposition and at the beginning of the new Liberal government which ushered in and heralded the golden decade of 1996 to 2007.
          </p>
          <p>
           His integrity was beyond question, yet an overly prescriptive and, quite frankly, senseless interpretation of ministerial standards saw him resign. As many said at the time, if there is a standard which requires Brian's resignation, I would back Brian any day over the particular requirement.
          </p>
          <p>
           Brian just recently received a call from former Prime Minister Howard, who had learned of Brian's severe ill health. That was a call that Brian genuinely appreciated. It's an indication of former Prime Minister Howard's genuineness and the high regard in which
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard" rel="nofollow">

           held

           </a>
           .
          </p>
          <p>
           His interest in public policy and political matters remained with him till the end. I, for one, was the beneficiary of numerous phone calls from him. I indeed met with Brian for a coffee as recently as 22 June, when he spoke realistically about his health challenges and stark prognosis, yet he did so with thankfulness for the extra decade of good living with which he had been blessed after a grim diagnosis with a different issue a decade earlier. His particular condition then was well treated and contained through the application of cutting-edge treatment. Regrettably, as one form of illness was being effectively treated, another was quietly taking hold of Mr Gibson, undetected, and ultimately claimed his life. On behalf of the Tasmanian Liberal Senate team, I express the condolences of the team to his lovely and supportive wife, Pauline, and his three children and thank him for his unselfish service to our state and nation. May he rest in peace.

            I too want to associate myself with the remarks that my leader and other speakers have made about
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Gibson" rel="nofollow">
             Brian Gibson
            </a>
            . I served with him in all the time he was here, and he was a real gentleman—perhaps unsuited to being in parliament because he was such a gentleman. But he was such a capable man.
           </p>
           <p>
            I continue to be distressed at the way Brian was sort of forced out of the parliament—not, I might say, by the opposition but by his own team. The incident which was the catalyst for that was at a crazy time in our political history. Brian Gibson was as honest as any person who has ever worked in this chamber could be, and the fact that he was required through political pressure to resign over a very minor technical infringement has distressed me ever since. Brian was a person who could have made such a real contribution to Australian life. He had made a significant contribution to his own state and his own community in what he did in his pre-parliamentary life, and it is just one of those great shames of life and politics, I guess, that someone who could have made such a great contribution had such a short time here. But, in the short time he was here, he certainly captured the friendship of everyone. Everyone acknowledged him as a very significant contributor to the debate and the works of this parliament and of government.

            , I don't have the authority to do this, but I'm sure I can say it if others perhaps haven't mentioned it: I know that former Presidents Calvert and Ferguson would want to be associated with this condolence motion as well. Unfortunately, they are all at the other end of the country from me, but, as Senator Abetz and other Tasmanians would know, former Senators Calvert, Ferguson and Gibson were a bit of a trio around the country doing various things in retirement.
