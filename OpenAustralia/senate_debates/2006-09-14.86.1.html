       <p>
        by leaveâ€”I want to take the opportunity to make some very short remarks on the retirement of the Assistant Clerk, John Vander Wyk, who is in the chamber at the moment. I know he will be terribly embarrassed that I have done this, but I was not here last night when the President made his remarks and I want to indicate on behalf of the Labor opposition how much we appreciate his 32 years of service to the Senate and his service to all the senators. We have great respect for the professional way he has always carried out his duties and the quiet way he goes about his business ensuring that the senators and the Senate function effectively. I personally very much appreciated his work when I was Opposition Whip. Many a time he provided me with advice that stopped me making a complete idiot of myself, and it was very much appreciated. I know all the whips over the years have relied on that advice and on the other jobs John has. I am under strict instructions from one of the other clerks not to make these remarks because clerks like to keep a low profile, but the Senate would not work without the hundreds of people who serve the Senate and Australian parliamentary democracy so well, and John has been one of those who have played a very senior role in servicing the parliament and our democracy. I understand from talking to him the other day that he is going up to live in Queensland. I hope he enjoys life up there and we thank him very much for his service.
