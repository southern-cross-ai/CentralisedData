        The Australian Government welcomes the opportunity to respond to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories (Committee), titled
        <i>
         Same country: different world - The future of Norfolk Island
        </i>
        (the Report), published in October 2014.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Report" rel="nofollow">
         The Report
        </a>
        highlights the need to address the critical governance, infrastructure and economic issues facing Norfolk Island as a matter of urgency to mitigate further economic decline and the deterioration of living conditions for Australians living on the Island. Many of the issues considered in the consultations and in the report are longstanding and have been the subject of numerous reports, inquiries and submissions over the last 35 years.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         The Committee
        </a>
        's recommendations note that Norfolk Island governance and economic reforms must occur together to give the community the greatest chance of recovery.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee's recommendations are substantial and far reaching and include the end of self-government through the repeal of the
        <i>
         Norfolk Island Act 1979
        </i>
        (Cth). In recommending this significant step, the Committee has recognised the provision of national, state and local government services by a single level of government drawn from a population of less than 2000 people is not viable. This theme was also reflected in a number of submissions to the inquiry.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Given the significance of the recommendations, the Hon Jamie Briggs MP, the Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development asked the Hon Gary Hardgrave, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrator_of_Norfolk_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Administrator of Norfolk Island
        </a>
        , to undertake a consultation process with the Norfolk Island community on each of the recommendations of the Report. The Administrator's findings have been drawn from public meetings, written submissions and personal representations from members of the Norfolk Island community, key stakeholder groups and the Norfolk Island Government and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislative_Assembly" rel="nofollow">
         Legislative Assembly
        </a>
        . The Australian Government's response has taken into consideration the views put forward by the Norfolk Island Government, and members of the community.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The consultation process highlighted a strong mood for reform within the community with most individuals, including some members of the Legislative Assembly, acknowledging there needs to be some change to the model of self-government. The Norfolk Island Government's own preferred model acknowledges that the current arrangements cannot sustain Norfolk Island into the future. Consultations also highlighted the need for urgent action and greater certainty in respect of future arrangements, particularly to build business confidence and encourage investment. Written submissions largely favoured repeal or amendment of the
        <i>
         Notfolk Island Act 1979
        </i>
        (Cth) and the establishment of a local government model. Many of the earlier reviews and reports into Norfolk Island also favoured the establishment of a local government, supported by appropriate state and Commonwealth services.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Norfolk Island Government's preferred model of modified self-government would continue to see the Norfolk Island both legislate for and administer state and municipal services, with the Commonwealth taking on national services only, such as immigration,

The Australian Government does not favour this approach as it will not address the governance and economic issues that have negatively impacted the Norfolk Island community and economy over time. There is broad support in the community and from the Norfolk Island Government for the Australian Government, as part of any new governance arrangements, to take responsibility for the delivery of key infrastructure projects. The Australian Government is committed to ongoing consultation with the Norfolk Island community on the process of reform and on the implementation of its commitment to extend the Australian taxation, healthcare and social security frameworks.

        RECOMMENDATION 1
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         The Committee recommends that, as soon as practicable, the Commonwealth Government repeal the Norfolk Island Act 1979 (Cth) and establish an interim administration, to assist the transition to a local government type body, determined in line with the community

       <p class="italic">
        Agreed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government supports the Committee's recommendation to change the current governance arrangements and proposes to transition the current Legislative Assembly to a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Regional Council
        </a>
        . The Australian Government notes through the consultation process undertaken by the Committee and subsequently by the Administrator, there is broad support from the community to alter the current arrangements for self-government. However, to maintain current service delivery and administrative infrastructure while the transition takes place, the Australian Government will amend rather than repeal the
        <i>
         Norfolk Island Act 1979
        </i>
        (Cth). This will allow the Norfolk Island Administration and associated entities, including the Norfolk Island Government Business Enterprises to continue to provide services to the community during this transitional phase. The Assistant Minister will hold delegations for Norfolk Island during the transition period and ensure an interim
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advisory_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Advisory Council
        </a>

       <p class="italic">
        Agreed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government agrees the Norfolk Island community must have an ongoing voice in governance and in government. This will be achieved through the establishment of a locally elected Regional Council.

       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government assume responsibility for the Cascade and Kingston Pier upgrades and that the Commonwealth Government expedite the works in line with Australian standards and occupational health and safety requirements, as soon as practicable.

       <p class="italic">

        The community consultation process highlighted a divergence of views on the long term needs of the community and the feasibility of further port or safe harbour infrastructure. However, there was acceptance this project should continue in some form to address the immediate and urgent needs of the community. Further scoping and feasibility studies will need to be undertaken to identify the optimum solution, taking on board heritage and environment considerations and the condition of other related infrastructure such as roads.

       <p class="italic">
        Agree in principle.

       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government supports the Committee's recommendation to improve passenger and cargo access to the Island and notes the importance of the cruise shipping industry to the Norfolk Island economy. However, this component of the broader Cascade/Kingston project remains unfunded by the Norfolk Island Government. This recommendation is agreed in principle subject to the outcomes of re-scoping of the project for the Kingston and Cascade piers and consideration in a future budget context.

         The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government ensure that, as part of the new governance arrangements, the public road infrastructure on Norfolk Island is assessed against current Australia-wide design, building and engineering standards and, where needed, work is undertaken to remedy deficiencies.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Agree in principle.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The maintenance and management of road infrastructure should continue to be an on-island responsibility in line with the responsibilities of a Regional Council. The Australian Government will work with the Administrator and the Advisory Council on the development of a long term roads strategy for Norfolk Island. The network of Norfolk Island roads has significantly deteriorated and it will take a considerable period of time and capital for these matters to be redressed. A long term 10-20 year strategy will include an assessment and prioritisation of remediation of existing roads and capital funding and the development of appropriate design guidelines based on local conditions and usage of the roads. The Administrator will seek state government expertise, as appropriate, to assist in this process. This recommendation is agreed in principle, subject to funding in a future budget context.

         The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government take charge of the psyllid eradication effort on Norfolk Island, and that responsibility for quarantine control matters be transferred to the Commonwealth of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry.

       <p class="italic">
        Agreed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government acknowledges this is more properly a national responsibility and a small jurisdiction such as Norfolk Island cannot sustain adequate and effective quarantine and border control arrangements. As a first step in supporting more effective quarantine arrangements, the Australian Government has provided $1.5 million for the conduct of a pest and diseases survey to identify potential quarantine and biosecurity issues. The Australian Government has also worked to build capability on-island and improve the effectiveness of current quarantine arrangements through the gifting and deployment of a trained quarantine detector dog.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The pest and diseases survey identified the presence of the potato and tomato psyllid on Norfolk Island. This insect poses significant biosecurity concerns and is a potential threat to the food supply on the Island. The Australian Department of Agriculture has provided advice to the Norfolk Island Administration on the management of this pest however a management or eradication regime is yet to be implemented.
