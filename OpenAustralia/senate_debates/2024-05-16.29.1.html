             Thank you, President. I thought that this brave new world of Labor-Green politics was going to deny me that opportunity too. We previously supported motions to ensure appropriate consideration and scrutiny of these time critical bills by Senate committees. But what we're seeing here, in relation to the addition of these four bills to the motion at the very last moment, with senators being asked to make a decision without having been given notice of it, is some new level of chaos in this place.

               I agree with Senator Henderson's interjection. The lack of courtesy being shown to this place is really something that the government ought to reflect on when it comes to seeking to provide the Senate with opportunities to actually do its job and scrutinise this legislation.
              </p>
              <p>
               I put on record the fact that we are very, very dissatisfied with how the government is conducting itself, not only seeking to ram things through in a time that is unacceptable but giving us such little notice to be able to consider them.

                    scandal and puts them with a dud deal for Australians when it comes to the export of our gas. They should be ashamed of themselves. You're selling us out. You're telling people on JobSeeker, youth allowance, all these other social security payments, 'Stay in poverty. We can't afford to help you guys, sorry.'
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    We don't have the money to do it and at the same time we're not collecting anything from our offshore gas. Hundreds of billions of dollars of

                    gets exported and today there is not a cent of petroleum resource rent tax. We'll hear people cry, 'Well, they're paying corporate tax.' They've minimised it below one per cent in recent years. This is embarrassing. More Australians need to know what you're doing. You're selling us out.

                       I will now put Senator Gallagher's amendment to the routine of hours variation, and that includes the bills from (v) through to (viii). I will remind senators that I have been lenient this time, but there was no change in the vote on any of those four bills and so the proper course of action is there should have been no division between the bills. But a division is required on the amendment.

                          voting all morning? It was to shut down debate on the new vehicle efficiency standard so that no-one in that chamber who is supporting the bill or not supporting the bill could have their say. And here we are again, with the Labor Party putting this bill into their guillotine motion so that no-one in this chamber gets to have a say on the biggest change to our transport sector since we got rid of the horse and cart. This is what weak leaders do when they are afraid. They're afraid of dissent, afraid of different ideas, and it's so typical that they got into bed with the Greens.
