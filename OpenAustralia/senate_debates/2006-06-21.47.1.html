         Multicultural Affairs
        </a>
        . Can the minister confirm that she is not a member of the

        of cabinet, which made the decision to change Australia’s immigration laws to appease Indonesia? Is it true that the minister attended a citizenship ceremony yesterday rather than the party room meeting where her planned changes to our laws were fiercely debated? Where will the decision about the final shape of the bill be made? Will it be made by the Prime Minister’s office, by Foreign Affairs, by Indonesia or by the government’s backbench? Can the minister also indicate whether she has been told whether the bill will proceed at all or is she still waiting for someone to let her know just what is happening?

But that would mislead, if you are referring to the meeting where this matter was discussed, because on that and other occasions relating to immigration matters I have gone to the meetings. Did I at a point yesterday leave the party room to attend a citizenship ceremony? Yes, I did. It was quite appropriate to do so because the citizenship ceremony was being held on

            World Refugee Day
           </a>
           , we were conferring citizenship on a number of people who had come here under our humanitarian and refugee program. Many Australians do not realise, because the Labor Party does not want them to know, that Australia is very generous to refugees. We have a 13,000 intake of refugee and humanitarian entrants each year, and we have been doing it for so long that it is regarded as commonplace. For the last few years most of our intake has been from Africa—and some senators have some issues concerning settlement problems that some communities have had. But we have been doing it long enough for a lot of refugees from Africa to have taken out citizenship yesterday.
          </p>
          <p>
           On World Refugee Day yesterday the theme was hope. These people display all of it. They have had it all along—courage, determination and hope to find a better place. They have come to a country that opens its doors to those who are most in need, works with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and says, ‘You’re the most in need, come in.’ And not just come in, but we say, ‘We’ve got resettlement programs for you and we’ll help you, and within a couple of years you can be an Australian citizen and your kids can grow up to have all the opportunities that that brings.’

           The other part of your question was: do I know what is happening with the bill? Yes, I do. I do know what is happening with the bill. Furthermore, I know when you are going to know, but it is not my place to tell you.

              I had coffee and scones. Is it true that the Prime Minister was forced to gag debate to get the meeting back under control? Whatever happened to the minister’s promise that she was ‘Listening to what my colleagues have to say,’ when she could not even be bothered to participate or stay for the full debate in the party room?
