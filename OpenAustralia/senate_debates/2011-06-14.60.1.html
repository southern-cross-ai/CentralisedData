        My question is to the Minister for Sport, Senator Arbib. Can the minister please inform the Senate of the outcome of Friday's historic agreement with the states and territories to protect the integrity of sport in Australia? Can the minister outline the key elements of this agreement and how this will help Australians to continue to have confidence in the sports they watch? Can the minister also advise the Senate on what this means for ensuring that our athletes are playing on a level playing field?

         I thank Senator Sterle for his concern on the issue. Australia has always led the way in protecting the integrity of sport not only in this country but also overseas. During the eighties and nineties it was Australia that led the fight against doping with the establishment of the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASADA" rel="nofollow">
          ASADA
         </a>
         , and Australia is leading the way now.
        </p>
        <p>
         On Friday, it was my great pleasure to work with my state and territory collea­gues—sports ministers from across the country—and also with state Attorneys-General to reach an agreement to address match fixing and to protect the integrity of sport. After five months of work it is an astounding result for sport to have all Australian state governments presenting a united front against the scourge of illegal and irregular gambling. I thank all my ministerial colleagues from across Australia for their commitment to this issue.
        </p>
        <p>
         The issues of match fixing and illegal and irregular gambling are growing day by day internationally. From Interpol, we have been alerted that the illegal gambling market is now worth $140 billion. At home we have seen incidents of match fixing and there are cases currently before the courts. There was a need to act and a need to act quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is important that all Australian sports lovers have confidence that our sports are being played fairly and that all our players are giving their best. Our athletes also deserve to know, whether they are competing here or overseas, that they are competing on a level and fair playing field. Cheating and corruption in sport erodes people's confidence in sport. It strikes at the very heart of sport. Given the seriousness of the threat, it is essential that we have a national policy to provide the foundation for all Australian governments, including pursuing nationally consistent legislative arrange­ments, integrity agreements between sports and the betting agencies and codes of conduct.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for that answer. Can the minister please advise the Senate what consultation was undertaken in forming the national policy to ensure that it protects the integrity of sport? Can the minister also advise the Senate on what the reaction has been to the release of the national policy?

           There has been extensive consultation with the sports and, in fact, sports have led the charge in this policy. We have worked closely with the

            AOC

           , and

           . We have also worked with the COMPS organisation led by
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Speed" rel="nofollow">
            Malcolm Speed
           </a>
           and all the major professional codes because they understand the threat to their own sports if these issues are not tackled.
          </p>
          <p>
           There will also be, in cooperation with the sports, codes of conduct and anti-corruption policies to ensure that integrity processes are in place for all sports. Finally, the policy will see the establishment of a national integrity of sport unit to oversee the national arrange­ments and to provide education. There will also be capacity-building arrangements for the smaller sports.
          </p>
          <p>
           We have also received support from betting agencies themselves who have become part of the push. Betting agencies also understand the threat to sport in the long term and to the domestic and international processes they have in place.

             Senator Conroy and Minister Macklin recently, in cooperation with their state colleagues, announced a number of changes to live promotion of gambling odds in sport. Many sports lovers are concerned about the number of advertisements and the live promotion of odds by commentators during sporting proceedings on television and also on radio. Senator Conroy has, through his portfolio, requested the sports, the broadcasters and the gambling industry itself to self-regulate and find ways to reduce the number of advertisements and also to rule out commentators providing live odds. This is a critical issue for those sports lovers and people who are committed to sport and also in protecting families.
