        This Bill delivers on the Morrison Government's election promise to give Australians greater flexibility to contribute to their superannuation as they approach retirement.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Government recognises the realities of the modern Australian workplace – a workplace that has become more flexible than ever before.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Far more Australians are taking career breaks or working part-time to raise children; and in particular, we are seeing an unprecedented number of women re-joining the workforce. Many people are choosing to work longer, often part time - choosing to maintain a connection to their professional lives.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And as our workplaces evolve, so too must plans for retirement.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        With this great progress comes an imperative for government: we must ensure our superannuation system is equipped with the same flexibility as our workplaces.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The superannuation bring forward arrangement already provide flexibility in the superannuation system to allows individuals to make up to three years' worth of non-concessional contributions to their superannuation in a single year.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill amends the
        <i>
         Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to
        </i>
        extend access to the superannuation bring-forward arrangements to people aged 65 and 66 from
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        1 July 2020, to better reflect the changing nature of work.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Through this measure, the Morrison Government is helping older Australians to boost their retirement savings, especially if they have returned to the workforce, by giving them a greater flexibility to make superannuation contributions as they enter retirement.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It also aligns the cut-off age of 67 for the bring-forward arrangements with the eligibility age for the Age Pension, which is scheduled to reach 67 on 1 July 2023.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The measure is a part of broader package announced in the 2019-20 Budget context – "
        <i>
         Superannuation – improving flexibility for older Australians
        </i>
        <i>

         The Government
        </a>
        will give effect to these remaining measures by amending the relevant Regulations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        By fulfilling our election commitment through this Bill, the Morrison Government is continuing to ensure all Australians have additional flexibility in how they save as they transition to retirement.
