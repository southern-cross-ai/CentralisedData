          In a democracy, balancing the public's right to know and protecting national security is a key responsibility of the government. Over the past six years a culture of secrecy has pervaded this government. The culture of secrecy is now undermining Australians' right to know and freedom of the press. The government have responded to the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
           AFP
          </a>
          raids in June with complete silence, and now wish to dictate the terms of a limited and restricted inquiry into their own mismanagement and apathy. If the government refuse to support this motion, they should stand up and explain their silence over the last three weeks and why they have failed in their guardianship of one of our most fundamental democratic rights.

             The government will be opposing this motion. The government is committed to ensuring our democracy strikes the right balance between a free press and keeping Australians safe—two fundamental tenets of our democracy. That is why the Prime Minister has already written to the Leader of the Opposition, outlining an inquiry into law enforcement and intelligence powers on the freedom of the press. The government considers it appropriate that the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Joint_Committee_on_Intelligence_and_Security" rel="nofollow">

             conduct that inquiry. The PJCIS is well placed to conduct that inquiry, given its responsibility for and experience in handling issues concerning national security information and legislation. We call on all senators to join the government in opposing this motion.

                is raiding media organisations in this country with a chilling effect on reporting and the core duty of the media to hold power to account. This inquiry has got to be done openly, it's got to be done transparently and it's got to be done in the full view of the Australian people so that they can have confidence that we're getting to the bottom of the significant malaise in this country, where rights are continually being eroded by scaring Australians and trying to make them understand that, in fact, their rights need to be given away and eroded. This inquiry needs to be done openly, and we will not support it being done by the PJCIS.

                   I can understand wanting accountability on an issue but this notice of motion, it appears to me, is basically a stitch-up. You want accountability? At no time whatsoever has

                   been approached to be part of the committee. You've actually done a stitch-up here by putting who you want on that committee. I don't believe it's going to be fair and balanced. Therefore I will not be supporting this motion.

                      The media is such an important element of our democracy. They couple citizens to our government; they inform the citizenry. We had some tremendous or very significant events take place a month ago that most people were quite disturbed about. We understand that national security is important, but national security is a means to an end, and that end is to protect democracy. Without a free press, there is no democracy.
