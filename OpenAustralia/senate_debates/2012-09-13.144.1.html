        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Henderson" rel="nofollow">
         Sarah Henderson

        , launched a petition. The petition reads as follows:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The petition of the undersigned shows our support for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalon_Airport" rel="nofollow">
         Avalon Airport
        </a>
        to operate as an international passenger airport. The provision of international passenger services at Avalon Airport will provide very important economic benefits for the Geelong region and Victoria as a whole, particularly with respect to employment, tourism, trade and the development of new industries.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Your petitioners ask that the Senate calls on the Gillard Labor Government to honour its 2010 election commitment to the resident of the Federal elections of Corangamite and Corio by permitting Avalon Airport to operate as an international passenger airport by:

       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Cheeseman was quoted as saying: 'Well, they have been remarkable advocates for the international airport!' Since 2010, what have Mr Marles and the member for Corangamite, Mr Cheeseman, actually done about implementing that policy? Absolutely nothing—nothing at all. If this were so important, wouldn't you assume that they would be making regular speeches in the other place about how important Avalon becoming an international airport is? But do you think they have? They have not. Indeed, the only mention from Mr Marles about Avalon was this:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The election ventilated a number of local issues in Geelong—the future of Avalon Airport …
       </p>
       <p>
        That is the end of it! Since 2010 Mr Marles has said nothing at all in the other place about this commitment—and that was on 22 November 2010.
       </p>
       <p>
        But, funnily enough, when Ms Henderson launched her petition on 28 August, remarkably, having been caught out, Mr Marles tried to justify his inaction in the Geelong
        <i>
         Advertiser
        </i>
        on Friday, 31 August. And what about the very silent, and almost non-existent Mr Cheeseman? Remarkably, having said nothing about this at all, on 10 September he suddenly rose to make some comments in relation to Avalon. He said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I have had a longstanding interest in the aviation industry, particularly with Avalon , down in my part of the world …
       </p>
       <p>
        He then went on to say:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Our region has a long-term ambition to increase the services available out of Avalon as well as, importantly, to harness the potential opportunities that would come from converting it to an international airport
       </p>
       <p>
        …    …    …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Avalon Airport is a strategic asset in our region. The member for Corio and I have been working diligently with stakeholders locally and with the government to recognise any potential that Avalon has.
       </p>
       <p>
        Oh, yeah? And where is the proof of that, I ask. Where is the proof of that? Because the last time there had been any mention at all from Mr Cheeseman of the word 'Avalon' was earlier in May—two words: 'Avalon Airport'—and, remarkably, before that, the last time there was any mention from Mr Cheeseman at all was 11 March 2009. Ms Henderson has shown these members up. They are completely incompetent in relation to Avalon Airport, with their weasel words at the last election. They have been caught out by Ms Henderson. She, thankfully, has taken up the cudgel in relation to Avalon. She, thankfully, has organised this petition. And she, thankfully, has taken some ownership that is of vital importance to the Geelong community and indeed the wider Geelong region. I seek leave to continue my remarks.

        Leave granted; debate adjourned.
