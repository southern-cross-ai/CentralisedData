        My question is to the minister representing the Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care, Senator Scullion. In an interview for the

       <p class="italic">
        A royal commission, after two years and maybe $200 million being spent on it, will come back with the same set or a very similar set of recommendations …
       </p>
       <p>
        When was the minister first advised of the change in the government's policy? Was it before or after his interview with

         The exact nature of the timing of that meeting I'm quite sure someone listening will provide me with. I understood that it was earlier in the week that the minister made a statement of a similar ilk. I didn't realise it was to

         I'd read his comments about he'd much rather invest much of these funds that potentially could be for a royal commission into the sector. I think we'd all acknowledge that since then he's made another statement, but I think certainly most Australians would acknowledge that—

The reason he will support a royal commission is that, wherever we have our senior Australians, , whose care is not the best care we can offer, where the quality of that care is not the best care that we can provide—

                  Thank you very much. It is absolutely essential that we are able to ensure the quality and safety of our most treasured Australians. And so a royal commission will be able to outline a confidence for families, with relatives and with friends that we'll throw a light on it in so much as parliament—not government, but parliament—can provide those matters. And, can I say, it was pretty interesting about people being confused about their position. The quote 'I don't know if one is needed' on Tuesday was in fact from

                     We are a cabinet government, and the decision was made by cabinet. But I would indicate that I don't accept the premise of the question where the indications are that we somehow changed our position. We came to a conclusion when there was significant new material. We looked carefully at a number of reports of inquiries into this matter in addition to the material that was provided by
                     <i>
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Corners" rel="nofollow">

                      </a>
                     </i>
                     . The government considered that information, as they do, in the normal way, and we made a decision that this would be in the interests of senior Australians, and that's why we've moved on this matter. I don't think that should be a particular surprise. We are absolutely committed to ensuring that the most senior Australians have the very best care and the very best safety, and we have their very best interests at heart.

                            . Again, there seems to be a move towards partisanship on this most important issue. We will not get dragged into that sorry mess. We're about fixing something. We're about doing something that the previous government never did. We will not be dragged into politicising the outcomes. We are working to fix this. We have made significant investments. As I've indicated, we'll be making an investment of an additional $5 billion over the next five years. We've increased investment by $5 billion over the past five years. A $10 billion increase in investment in care and safety of our most treasured Australians is a great record from this government.
