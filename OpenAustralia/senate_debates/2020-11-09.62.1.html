        My question is for the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Birmingham. Last week it was revealed after a year-long investigation that former Liberal candidate Mr Di Sanh Duong was charged with preparing a foreign interference offence, the first charge laid under the foreign interference laws. Minister Tudge appeared with Mr Duong at a media event at the Melbourne hospital in June. How is it that Minister Tudge, part of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">

         I thank Senator Keneally for the question. I do note that the first opposition question of the day came to me and was about sensitivities in a trade relationship and that the second opposition question today went to Senator Payne and was about conduct and comments and how they are handled in this place. This is quite a sensitive matter that Senator Keneally has asked a question about. I am surprised that she would raise it in the chamber in this way. Nonetheless, I can confirm that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
          AFP
         </a>
         has charged a 65-year-old Melbourne man with offences.
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to what briefings occurred with government ministers in the conduct of any such investigations, I'll take that question on notice, Senator Keneally.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
          Mr President
         </a>
         , I think people would expect that AFP investigations are handled sensitively, confidentially and carefully. Indeed, actions of government ministers during those investigations also need to be appropriate and carefully conducted. Mr President, I'll come back with any information that can be appropriately provided to Senator Keneally without jeopardising in any way the types of actions that do now find themselves before the court.

           Yesterday Mr Duong resigned from the Liberal Party before the party acted to suspend him. What action has the Prime Minister taken to ensure that no member of his government has been compromised as a result of foreign interference charges against a member of the party he leads?

            The government and the Prime Minister receive briefings from national security agencies, as is appropriate. Of course, those national security briefings provided to the government should be handled carefully and, by and large, in confidence. The opposition, through certain processes of the parliament, also receives national security briefings from time to time, including briefings that agencies have provided to various political parties in regard to their operations. I assure the Senate that we take all of those matters seriously and handle them with the seriousness and regard that we should have for them.

              The minister has publicly dismissed allegations by Senator Antic and others about South Australian Liberal member of the Legislative Council Jing Lee's relationship with China. What is the status of the allegations made by Senator Antic and other South Australian Liberals? Has the matter been referred to relevant authorities?
