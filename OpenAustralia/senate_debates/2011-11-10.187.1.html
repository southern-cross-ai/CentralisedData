        . Dr McCartney was a godsend to women in Australia and globally. Why? Because he was a pioneer in gynaecological cancer care and because he gave hope and, indeed, life to so many ovarian and gynaecological cancer patients, both here and around the world. Dr McCartney was a father of four children—John, Caroline, Clare and Tom—and the loving husband of Jacinta. He passed away on 22 October 2011, aged 70, after a brief battle with cancer. He is someone who gave decades of tireless, selfless and dedicated professional service to his community and had genuine concern and compassion for ordinary human beings and in his specialist field gave so much to women.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dr McCartney was the recipient of a special award from the Royal Australian and

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre_Dame" rel="nofollow">

        in Fremantle. In 2008, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Medical_Association" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Medical Association
        </a>
        bestowed on Dr McCartney a Hippocratic Award for his dedicated and distinguished services in gynaecological cancer surgery. He was a finalist for WA Senior of the Year in 2008.
       </p>
       <p>
        What was so inspiring about Dr McCartney was that he worked tirelessly and gave his all to his patients, right up until the week before he died. Dr McCartney was the first doctor in Australia to train as a specialist in gynaecological oncology. After training in

        , Dr McCartney, along with Dr Victor White, founded the Western Australian Gynaecologic Cancer Service, which was then located at the

         King Edward Memorial Hospital

       <p>
        To say that Dr McCartney was a trailblazer and a brilliant innovator when it came to gynaecological cancer does not do justice to what this gifted man did for women with these potentially life-threatening conditions. Professor McCartney's work is internationally renowned and inspired other professionals around the world to follow his lead. In addition to his extensive medical training, Dr McCartney thought outside the box and in doing so invented a device and a new approach to treating early stage cancer of the lining of the uterus resulting in less tissue damage, less blood loss, less pain and a shorter stay in hospital. This innovative piece of medical equipment was heralded as Dr McCartney's most substantial contribution to gynaecology. It was a device known as the McCartney tube, developed after he turned his attention to developing new ways to perform laparoscopic surgery in the early 1990s.
       </p>
       <p>
        The McCartney tube revolutionised the way hysterectomies and keyhole vaginal surgeries were performed, allowing complicated laparoscopic work to be performed more easily. Motivated by wanting to make surgery less complicated for doctors and recovery easier and faster for women, he invented the tube-shaped implement, made from polypropylene with a liquid silicone rubber cap, which gave doctors better access for surgery and provided other benefits like reduced blood loss as well as reduced risk and lower pain levels for patients post surgery.
       </p>
       <p>
        The McCartney tube also made work on cancers simpler. Endometrial cancer patients were found to have a lower rate of infection if they had been operated on by a surgeon using the tube rather than by means of open surgery. The patients also had shorter stays in hospital and were able to resume normal activities far more quickly. Just as importantly, Dr McCartney was the first doctor to remove major tumours as part of the management of advanced ovarian cancer. Patents for the tube have been granted all over the world, including in New Zealand, Singapore, the United States, Vietnam, Japan and across Europe.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dr McCartney also supported and was involved in the Women and Infants Research Foundation and its activities. What is often most critical for a doctor, especially for the very personal nature of gynaecological surgery, is bedside manner. In the many public acknowledgements recognising the dedicated professionalism of Dr McCartney, the one thing that appeared over and over again on news pages, on blogs and in articles about Dr McCartney was the message that he truly cared about each and every patient he attended to. Patient after patient has paid testimony to Dr McCartney on a tribute website set up in his honour. One says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Thank you for your patience, kindness and reassurance over the past five years as one of your many very grateful patients. You were a kind and gentle man. Whilst I never looked forward to my visits to your surgery, I always came away with a smile and a positive outlook.

       <p>
        After retiring from work at King Edward Memorial Hospital in 2007 after 31 years service there, Dr McCartney continued as Head of Gynaecologic Oncology at St John of God Hospital in Subiaco. Dr McCartney saved the lives of so many women and he trained doctors from Europe, the

        It is a testament to his success and his dedication that his procedures and the McCartney tube continue to be used all over the world. I am pleased to say that the McCartney Gynaecological Cancer Research and Education Fund has been established to commemorate the life and work of Professor Tony McCartney. I am proud to say Professor McCartney was a Western Australian. I am, like all women, indebted to his dedication to his work and to advancing specialist techniques and methods of surgery. I know that his enormous legacy will live on through the work of the many doctors he has trained and the many, many lives that he touched and the lives that he saved.

        In closing, I would like to quote one more obituary published online by the
