         Thank you to Senator Pratt for her question and for her advocacy over many years, like many on this side, for action on climate. The government's safeguard mechanism reforms are, really, the first chance in over a decade for us to implement climate action that gets us towards net zero. That's the important thing: how do we get to the targets that have been set, which I thought the opposition supported? I'll say more about them shortly.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australian businesses are pleading for it because they know that reducing emissions is essential to their long-term competitiveness in a global net-zero economy. We want to deliver sensible pro-climate reforms that the Australian people voted for and that businesses need so they can reduce emissions.
        </p>
        <p>
         But those opposite—I think Senator Canavan is demonstrating it now—oppose reforms, because there is a pathology of political conflict over there. You're not interested in solutions. You're not actually interested in reducing emissions. You're not interested in having a mechanism which enables the market to have certainty so we can deliver net zero, which, supposedly, you support in principle.
        </p>
        <p>
         You're not interested in that, but you are interested in having conflict—the same old fights, reheated for 2023. Of course, you have to ask the opposition who they are actually fighting for. Who are you fighting for? You're not fighting for businesses, because we know the business community supported this. You're not fighting for working Australians. You opposed both new jobs and secure jobs, whether it's the minimum—

           You're not fighting for working Australians. You opposed new jobs in your opposition to the National Reconstruction Fund, and you opposed a boost to the minimum wage. You're not fighting for families, because you voted no to energy price relief just weeks before Christmas. The question to you is: whose side are you on?

              Thank you, Senator Pratt. You're right: these are plans where there is a great deal of cost to all of us, across the economy, across the community, if those opportunities are squandered. I remind the chamber that the proposed reforms to the safeguard mechanism have been carefully designed following nearly six months of consultation and have broad support across the community.

              can go back to my first answer—what are you fighting for? You know you're fighting against business, you're fighting against working families and you're fighting against those on the minimum wage, but you're actually even fighting yourselves. You're fighting yourselves, because these are reforms that were first proposed by Mr Taylor. These are the same reforms that your party room signed off on. You're so determined to pick a fight that you're actually fighting against your own policy.

                 Thank you to Senator Pratt. We on this side of the chamber understand that without certainty the market doesn't move. If you want a demonstration of that, you can see the 22 failed policies of those opposite and the way that smashed investment in the generation sector, and businesses know that. I'll refer to recent media this week. There was a headline in the
