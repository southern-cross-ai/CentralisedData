        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Birmingham. Today, despite repeated attempts by this government to undermine and delegitimise her experience, Ms Higgins spoke to thousands of women at the March 4 Justice and called for action. Will the Morrison government now stop shifting blame and listen to Ms Higgins?

         Indeed, the government respects very much the statements made by Ms Higgins.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
          Can I
         </a>
         say that I appreciate the engagement of quite a number of staff representatives and former staff in relation to the establishment of the independent review that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_Discrimination_Commissioner" rel="nofollow">
          Sex Discrimination Commissioner
         </a>
         , Ms Kate Jenkins, is undertaking on behalf of parliament in relation to parliamentary workplaces. The input made, both publicly and privately, by some of those former staff as well as current staff into the terms of reference and the nature and the conduct of that review is greatly valued. I now hope that the manner in which that review has been stood up can provide confidence to individuals to participate fully in the review process and to share their experiences, as the terms of reference invites them to do, to work with Ms Jenkins as she independently assesses recommendations that can be brought forward to the government and this parliament in terms of action to be taken.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have also, as an interim measure, put in place a new hotline to handle critical incidents and provided details to parliamentary staff, both current and former, in terms of their ability to use that service and to reach out to that service, which has staff who are equipped to handle trauma-counselling type matters. They have been trained and advised in relation to the referral services that are available such that they can assist in referral, be they for criminal matters through appropriate pathways with appropriate support, or be they for harassment, workplace bullying or other matters, which can be referred, again, appropriately through for investigation and assessment with appropriate support.

           Today Ms Higgins spoke of watching the people she had dedicated her life to deny and downplay her experience in question time. The Minister for Women, Senator Payne, said:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           The only way it will change is if we as parliamentarians own the problems, own the failings and make the necessary changes.
          </p>
          <p>
           She repeated those comments today. Exactly when will the Morrison government listen to Australian women and own its failings?

            Well, indeed, we do. As Senator Payne has rightly said in both her
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Women's_Day" rel="nofollow">
             International Women's Day
            </a>
            address but also in question time today, we need to acknowledge that we all have a responsibility in relation to the many issues that have been raised over recent weeks, in particular. We have a responsibility to ensure that this place sets an example for the nation in terms of the type of workplace practices that are here. Workplace practices need to ensure, so far as possible, that we stamp out instances of bullying, sexual harassment or sexual assault, that we provide appropriate support services and investigatory services in support where such instances continue, and that we set an example in all of those processes, procedures and practices for others to follow. That's the type of work that I'm committed to supporting. I trust that Ms Jenkins, in the review she's undertaking, will deliver recommendations that assist us in that regard.

              The Morrison government didn't listen to Ms Higgins when she needed support after the alleged rape, didn't listen when she went public with her experience; instead it called her a 'lying cow'. Even today they refused to listen when she spoke at their very doorstep. Why is the Morrison government refusing to listen to the voices of Australian women calling for justice?

               We certainly are committed to supporting Ms Higgins and to cooperating and assisting with the police investigation which is underway as extensively and fully as we possibly can. The government has always been willing to cooperate and assist in relation to those investigations. We are also determined to continue our work in relation to the broader issues, not just those in the parliament that I've referenced in the previous two answers but those across the community more generally. I was asked earlier about the
               <i>
                Respect@work
               </i>
               report and we are implementing the first nine recommendations of that report. Many others apply to the private sector and we are working with the private sector on aspects of that. We are pursuing the implementation of those around training resources and we are seeking to make sure that there is a portal with information for employers and employees on how to eliminate and deal with sexual harassment. And there is the establishment of the Respect@Work Council, that I referenced before. We are committed to working on all these issues—
