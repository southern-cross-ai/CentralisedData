           The Australian government acknowledges the challenge of violent crime in South Africa, and our concerns are reflected in the official travel advice. The Australian government has also urged the

           government to ensure the safety and security of all of its citizens and, further, has also made our concerns in relation to land reforms known to them. Australia's humanitarian visa entry program is open to any applicant who believes they are facing persecution, with all such claims assessed on their merits. We do not make foreign policy via Senate motions and we will be opposing this motion.

              The opposition notes the concerns held in the community about the protection of democratic rights and freedoms in South Africa, as reflected in motions from Senators Leyonhjelm and Anning before the Senate today. The opposition also notes the apparent conflict of views within the Turnbull government, in particular between the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, about Australia's response. The opposition considers it extraordinary that the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection should have injected himself so blatantly into what is a domestic political issue in the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_South_Africa" rel="nofollow">
               Republic of South Africa
              </a>
              , particularly given the sensitivity with which President Ramaphosa is handling the matter of land reform. The opposition calls on the Prime Minister to clarify the government's position. Australia's non-discriminatory migration program has been in place for decades and is now an important part of contributing to Australia's vibrant multicultural community. If people are facing persecution, regardless of where they are from or the colour of their skin, they are able to apply for Australia's humanitarian visa program, which application will be assessed on its merits.
