        The problem of driver fatigue is one of the contributing factors in many fatalities on our roads. A well-timed 20-minute power nap could literally save your life and the lives of your loved ones. Driving when tired poses a significant threat to every road user on the roadâ€”drivers, riders, passengers and pedestrians. The consequences of driving when fatigued can be fatal. That is why it is important to take a nap as soon as you feel tired and as soon as it is safe to do so.
       </p>
       <p>
        Your body needs to refill its energy stores quickly. Most of us could use a burst of energy like this in our day. One in three adults don't get enough sleep. That ends up being quite a big sleep deficit on our roads. Power naps can help improve your reaction time, your focus and your concentration, all critical inputs to everyday lives but especially important when we are driving. So when you are driving and you feel tired, pull over. Make sure you are in a safe place with good airflow. Switch off your engine, set your alarm and close your eyes. And like all habits, practice makes perfect.
       </p>
       <p>
        As headspace reminds us, it will take time to perfect the power nap for you and your routine but it is worth practising and perfecting. Remember, we all want to get to our destination, and we all want to get there safely and in one piece. A well-timed 20-minute power nap could be the difference between you getting there a bit late and not getting there at all. The message is simple: we want people to recognise the signs of fatigue and pull over as soon as they can. Stop, revive, survive.
