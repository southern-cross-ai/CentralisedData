        My question is to Senator Birmingham, the Minister representing the Prime Minister. Yesterday, when asked whether the Morrison government will commit to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in full and on time, Senator Ruston said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There are many people who have made many comments … but that doesn't change the commitment of this government to remain absolutely focused on the delivery of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan.
       </p>
       <p>
        Given your coalition colleagues have today sought to prevent all water buybacks and block the return of the 450 gigalitres of water to our rivers, can the minister confirm that not all members of the coalition share that commitment?

         Before I call Senator Birmingham—on my right, I have asked repeatedly for silence during questions. There was murmuring across the chamber. I'd appreciate that not occurring during questions.

          In this place, I speak representing the Prime Minister, representing the government. I don't pretend to speak for every single individual and their views. But I make very clear, in response to Senator Smith, that the government stands resolute in its support for the implementation of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan—for implementation, as we have said, in full and on time.
         </p>
         <p>
          We are proud as a government to have ensured that billions, thousands of billions, of litres of additional water entitlement have been secured to support environmental flows across the Murray-Darling Basin. The securing of those thousands of billions of litres of additional water entitlement is enabling the Commonwealth Environment Water Holder to undertake a range of activities in support of environmental assets across the Murray-Darling Basin, not just in your home state and my home state of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           South Australia
          </a>
          , Senator Smith, but right across the Murray-Darling Basin—in the support and protection of Ramsar wetlands, internationally significant environmental assets, and of the overall sustainability of the river system.
         </p>
         <p>
          But, as has always been the case in relation to the Murray-Darling Basin, it is also crucial that the Basin Plan continues to be implemented in a way that seeks to ensure we have not only a sustainable river but sustainable and productive river communities who rely upon it, as well. That has been something our government has sought to work hard to achieve over the years in terms of prioritising investment in infrastructure across the river to secure those further water entitlements whilst helping those river communities to become more productive whilst returning water to the river to maintain that production of food and fibre that is essential to river economies whilst having that healthy river system.

             The answer to that is yes, Senator. Yes, it is. It is the case that, when those amendments come to a vote, I and the government will be voting against those amendments. That is the government position. And the government does so—

                 It was a coalition government, the Howard government, that passed the Water Act in 2007. I am pleased that, throughout my time in this place—indeed, the Water Act was one of the first bills that I contributed to in this building—we have maintained a bipartisan position in relation to support for the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. It is my intention that that is preserved and that is continued, and that is why the government will continue to support the Basin Plan.

                   Given the Nationals demonstrated disdain for the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, will the Prime Minister ensure that the Nationals do not retain the water portfolio or control of the Morrison government's water policy?

                    It's not for me to speculate in relation to ministerial arrangements. But I make clear, as I have, that the government's position in terms of support for the implementation of arrangements under the Water Act, including the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, remains. The government is determined to continue to support basin communities in the way in which that plan is implemented and to be mindful of the fact that there have been and are genuine concerns from people whose livelihoods and communities depend upon the basin and that we ought to be sympathetic and mindful of those concerns whilst ensuring implementation of a plan that guarantees all communities that rely upon the river system have a healthy and sustainable river system to support them, to support their communities, to support the productive growth of food and fibre that our economies depend upon, particularly across those river communities, and to support a healthy, sustainable system into the future.
