        I rise to speak to in support of the Excise and Customs Legislation Amendment (Streamlining Administration) Bill 2024. This bill represents a critical step in implementing the final elements of the former Morrison government's deregulation agenda as laid out in the March 2022 budget. Despite being delayed by the current Labor government, which postponed its implementation until 1 July 2024, this legislation is essential for reducing red tape and fostering economic group growth.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Excise and Customs Legislation Amendment (Streamlining Administration) Bill 2024 will benefit businesses across Australia by simplifying regulatory requirements and reducing costs. This bill is a step in the right direction, but it is only before this parliament because deregulation was a priority for the former coalition government. We need to see more economic reformâ€”not less. Only a Liberal government can deliver this. We need a back-to-basics economic plan that gets Australia back on track. A coalition government will deliver a stronger economy, alleviate pressure on the housing market, support small businesses, deliver more affordable and reliable energy, and increase workforce participation. This will reduce the cost of doing business, improve customer confidence and enhance economic growth.
       </p>
       <p>
        The coalition proudly supports this bill which implements good coalition policy that will allow businesses to thrive and contribute to our economy's growth.

         I would like to thank the senator for her contribution. This bill contains measures that will deliver significant deregulation benefits for businesses that engage in the manufacture, importation and distribution of fuel and alcohol. Excess regulation and administrative costs for these businesses will be reduced by these measures through making changes to licensing and fuel arrangements. I commend this bill to the Senate.
