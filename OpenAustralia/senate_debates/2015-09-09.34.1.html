        Queen Elizabeth II. Later today, London time, her Majesty will pass the historical record for the longest reign. I note that today stamps and coins are being issued to commemorate this occasion. Precisely when this longest reign commenced we cannot know because her father,

         Duke of Edinburgh

        , heard the sad news on her way to Australia. It is characteristic that the very first act that the new Queen did after being advised of the death of her beloved father was to write letters of apology to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_and_New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         Australia and New Zealand
        </a>
        that their imminent visit would now have to be postponed. This sense of duty above self has been the hallmark of the Queen's reign, and in that she has been ably supported at every step by

        For the first decade of her life there was little prospect that her Majesty would be our sovereign. She had a happy childhood and was instilled early with the principles of duty, hard work and Christian faith which have guided her in all her conduct. She has been our monarch for all of the lives of most of us in this country. She has known and advised 12

        to the present day. The Queen and Prince Philip have visited Australia many times in her long reign and have always been received with enormous affection and respect. For 364 days in each year her Majesty has dutifully dealt with official papers from the British government and from the governments of Australia and 14 other countries. She only gives herself

        <i>
         Dignified and Efficient

        . These words encapsulate the approach the Queen and Prince Philip have applied to their responsibilities of the almost 63 years. A few days ago her grandson,

        I think I speak for my generation when I say that the example and continuity provided by the Queen is not only very rare among leaders but a great source of pride and reassurance. Time and again, quietly and modestly, the Queen has shown us all that we can confidently embrace the future without compromising the things that are important.

         by leave—I join Senator Abetz in acknowledging the long and meritorious service of the Queen. It is the first and almost certainly the last time the

          Australian Senate

         Queen Elizabeth II is, of course, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Queen of Australia
         </a>
         . In fact, that has only been her title since 1973, and that is obviously not the only thing that has changed during her reign. So too has Australia's relationship to the United Kingdom and the monarchy. What has not changed is the affection of the Australian people for the Queen. On behalf of the opposition I extend our appreciation for her service.
