        As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I want to speak about my recent trip to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_York" rel="nofollow">
         Cape York
        </a>
        . I love being out with the people of Queensland and listening. It makes our work here in the chamber much easier. I'm very proud of Queenslanders, and I want to thank everyone in Cape York who hosted me and my staff on Cape York, especially for sharing their stories and their concerns. I want to start by acknowledging and thanking Doris Fred and Oscar Fred, who travelled quite a way to see us in Cairns. I also want to thank Sarah Addo and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Green" rel="nofollow">
         Mark Green
        </a>
        , who came down from the tablelands before we went to Cape York, and I want to thank Jack Wilkie-Jans and Trish Butler.
       </p>
       <p>
        Then we started off into Cape York, where we met
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Metzger" rel="nofollow">
         Bruce Metzger
        </a>
        and his wife at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Carbine" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Carbine
        </a>
        cafe and had some of the best pies I have ever tasted anywhere. Then we continued on to Lakeland, where we saw a community willing to discuss openly the imminent and dubious wind farm project up there. We listened to Joy and to Annette. We thanked Annette for speaking up in favour but we also thanked the majority who spoke against—Joy; Eric; Stephen, the contractor there; Dave; Tony, the publican; and Russell. I also want to acknowledge Ross Bensted, who has been in touch with us for many months now—in fact, since before I joined the Senate. He has constantly lobbied for industry on Cape York and a fair go for everyone on the cape.
       </p>
       <p>
        Then we travelled on to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_Vale" rel="nofollow">
         Hope Vale
        </a>
        , where we met with Andrew, the principal of the state school there, with his wonderful openness. We thank him for that and we also thank Tammy for sharing her experience. Tammy, a graduate of the Hope Vale school, went away and got a higher education and came back and is now on the staff there. We also met Michael, who loves it there and was not a resident of Hope Vale until recently. Then we went on to Musgrave and met Mary—and a huge steak! I have never seen a bigger steak in my life, and it was absolutely delicious. I can see Matt Canavan licking his lips here. Then in Coen we listened to George Mulley and Jackie—very successful and happy in their store there, a thriving little business. Then we went on to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archer_River" rel="nofollow">
         Archer River
        </a>
        and we listened to Medina and Brad.
       </p>
       <p>
        We also went to Lockhart, where we listened to Lyn and Stu and heard their forthright views and then had a wonderful time in the cultural centre there listening to Enoch, Joe, Evelyn and Irene—wonderful Indigenous artists up there, who gave us a tour, let us watch them paint for a while and told us what they were doing. Thank you very much for sharing in Lockhart. For their frankness, their practical ideas, their down-to-earth approach, their inspiring, their passion for the community, their confidence and their competence, I want to mention especially Paul Piva, the deputy mayor;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Clarke" rel="nofollow">
         Dave Clarke
        </a>
        , the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        ; and Noelene in the office. It gave us a lot of reassurance as to what needs to be done on the cape.
       </p>
       <p>
        At Bamaga we met with NPARC councillors Michael and Esmay and also Joseph, Gina and Dee on the phone, and we welcomed their open sharing of their views and issues. Then we met Paddy, Ugari, Shorty and Kees. Shorty introduced us to his granddaughter Magdalena and also Lucinda, a wonderful little baby. Magdalena is so full of joy there living in Bamaga.
       </p>
       <p>
        On
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI" rel="nofollow">
         TI
        </a>
        we listened to Fiona Pemberton from Border Force,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Smith" rel="nofollow">
         Aaron Smith
        </a>
        from the
        <i>
         Torres News
        </i>
        and Raphael and Jade, who run a wonderful cafe in the foreshore street of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thursday_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Thursday Island
        </a>
        , the Ma:Kai Cafe—wonderful service, wonderful food. Then we also listened to Karel who drives for McDonald Charter Boats, the water taxi there. That was an enjoyable ride—a bit bumpy but a wonderful way of getting to TI. Then, coming back down the cape, down the western side, we listened to Wendy at Bramwell and Ken, who introduced us to Geoff, the Bagman, who put on a wonderful show—fantastic singing of Australian songs, international songs, a variety of songs, and some wonderful humour.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will share the rest the next time I get an adjournment speech, but I just want to thank the people of Cape York very much for their hospitality. We had a very informative trip, a very enjoyable trip and a very safe trip. Thank you very much.
