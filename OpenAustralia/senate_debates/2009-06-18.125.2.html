       <ul>
        <li>
         simplifying the language of the exposure draft bill – for example, wording provisions clearly and limiting them to deal only with common circumstances;

        <li>
         simplifying the structure of the exposure draft bill – to minimise the cross-referencing needed;
        </li>
        <li>
         simplifying the terms used - for example instead of ‘tangible goods’ use the term ‘goods’ appropriately defined to ensure the full meaning needed for the reform is ascribed to the term; and
        </li>
        <li>
         using overseas provisions as often as possible to allow overseas experience to provide guidance for the Australian model.

        </b>
       </p>

        . The Bill will be amended to clarify the information about individuals that may be included on the register and to better describe the key privacy protections provided to individuals. The Bill will make it clear that address details of individual grantors will not be included on the register. Accordingly, a prohibition on making address details public is not required.

        A Privacy Impact Assessment will be undertaken by an appropriately qualified independent person or organisation. The assessment will be published on the Department’s website.

         Recommendation 6
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        5.34         The committee recommends that if any issues raised by the Office of the Privacy Commission in its submission are not considered as part of the Privacy Impact Assessment then these matters should be separately considered by the Attorney-General’s Department and a response to the issue be provided to the Office of the Privacy Commission in writing or made public.

         Recommendation 7
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        5.44         The committee recommends retaining the requirement for rights and duties to be exercised honestly and in a commercially reasonable manner. The intended scope of these requirements should be explained in detail in the bill’s explanatory memorandum.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        5.45         The explanatory memorandum should particularly explain that the requirement to act in a commercially reasonable manner should not fetter or undermine the ability of parties with similar bargaining power to contractually agree about what constitutes commercially reasonable behaviour.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Government response:
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Accepted.
        </b>
        This Bill will be amended to make clear that the duty to act in a reasonably commercial manner applies only in relation to Chapter 4 of the Bill concerning the enforcement of security interests. The duty to act in a reasonably commercial manner will not apply to the extent that the parties have contracted out of the enforcement provisions of the Bill under section 154 of the Bill.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Recommendation 8
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        5.55         The committee recommends that the bill adopt existing international personal property security conflict of laws provisions, such as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        conflict of laws model, unless there is a particular reason to depart from those provisions.

        <b>
         Accepted.
        </b>
        The Government accepts that the Bill should include conflict of laws provisions. The New Zealand conflict of laws provisions have been criticised as being uncertain. To avoid uncertainty in the Bill, the Government will include conflict of laws provisions in the Bill based on the provisions at Appendix A to the Department’s submission to the Committee (the revised commentary to the Bill).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Recommendation 9
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        5.62         The committee recommends that the scope and content of the enforcement provisions of the exposure draft bill be reviewed by the Department with particular attention to ensuring that the provisions are comprehensive and adequate.
       </p>

        The Bill will be amended to provide enhanced sanctions for improper use of the register and to ensure the registrar can monitor and investigate suspicious register activity. Further consideration will be given to appropriate sanctions for misusing the register which may include civil and criminal penalties.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

        The Government will carry out targeted consultation with stakeholders about changes to the Bill raised in the Committee’s report. However, further examination of the revised Bill by the Committee would not be consistent with ensuring the final text of the Bill is settled in time to allow stakeholders an adequate period to prepare to transition to the new PPS system. In order to provide certainty to stakeholders, the Government will progress development of the PPS Bill with a view to its passage through Parliament by the end of 2009 and will develop the new PPS register so that its main functionality is complete by May 2010.

        1.12         Liberal senators recommend that the government table a report in Parliament on the first year of operation of the reform within 15 months of the commencement of the Act. The report should include the views of stakeholders, including representatives of industry, governments, lawyers, consumers and academics and the government’s response to these views.

       <p class="italic">
        On 23 September 2008 the Senate Committee report, which included dissenting reports, was tabled in the Senate.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government has prepared a response to the Senate Committee report, including dissenting reports, in accordance with the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet Guidelines for the presentation of Government documents to the Parliament.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Senate Committee report made nine conclusions:
       </p>
       <dl>
        <dt>
         (1)
        </dt>
        <dd>
         The committee considers that the tax deductions for carbon sink forests under the Income Tax Assessment Act (1997)  represent a valuable policy addition that will promote greenhouse gas reductions.  The structures and processes outlined in the Act provide for a sensible legislative and administrative framework relating to the tax treatment around the establishment of forest carbon sinks.
        </dd>
        <dt>
         (2)
        </dt>
        <dd>
         The committee notes that other forms of greenhouse gas emissions reduction activities by industries are tax deductible.  The change in the tax treatment of carbon sink forests addresses this anomaly in the tax system.
        </dd>
        <dt>
         (3)
        </dt>
        <dd>
         The committee believes that the tax deductions will provide incentives for corporate investment into greenhouse gas abatement activities which represents an ideal opportunity to direct necessary capital to achieve positive environmental outcomes.
        </dd>
        <dt>
         (4)
        </dt>
        <dd>
         The new tax arrangements provide a short-term incentive to encourage early establishment of carbon sink forests that will contribute to a medium-term emissions target, while other options for delivering significant emissions reductions are further developed.  Carbon sink forests also contribute to the achievement of national policy objectives for sustainable natural resource management.
        </dd>
        <dt>
         (5)
        </dt>
        <dd>
         The committee considers that if Australia is to meet its carbon pollution reduction goals at least cost, the support of a viable carbon sink industry is important.  Appropriate taxation arrangements are one part of a range of measures needed to encourage the role of carbon sink forests in Australia’s carbon pollution reduction effort.
        </dd>
        <dt>
         (6)
        </dt>
        <dd>
         The committee recognises the benefits of relying on existing state and territory regulatory structures for the management of the impacts of carbon sink forests on the environment.  The committee has some concerns that in certain key areas, such as land clearance legislation, natural resource management and water sharing, some states and regions may not currently have in place appropriate regulations or plans to manage the impacts of carbon sink forests.  The committee notes that through the National Water Initiative, states and territories are committed to completing comprehensive water planning arrangements by 2011 and that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
          COAG
         </a>
         is currently seeking to accelerate the pace of this planning.  The committee also notes that under this process steps have been taken to ensure that those water systems under the greatest pressure receive early attention.  The committee considers that it would be desirable if a similar focus could be directed to regulation of land clearance and natural resource management.
        </dd>
        <dt>
         (7)
        </dt>
        <dd>
         More specifically, the committee notes the concerns raised in relation to the need to include ground water within water sharing plans.  The committee supports the inclusion of specific reference to ground water in the Guidelines.
        </dd>
        <dt>
         (8)
        </dt>
        <dd>
         The committee notes the significant support expressed during this inquiry for specific incentives to encourage the establishment of biodiverse forests.  The legislation as drafted does not distinguish between the type of forest planted and the committee is satisfied that it provides no disincentive for the plantation of biodiverse carbon sink forests.  The committee also notes that biodiversity considerations have been taken into account in the development of the Guidelines and that these should contribute to the establishment of carbon sink forests in conformity with good practice environmental and natural resource management frameworks.  The committee considers that any proposal to offer specific incentives for the establishment of biodiverse plantings must be considered within the context of existing environmentally focussed taxation incentives.
        </dd>
        <dt>
         (9)
        </dt>
        <dd>
         Finally, the committee welcomes the evidence received in relation to alternative options for terrestrial carbon stores, particularly in relation to perennial pasture cropping.  While there clearly is some work to be done to demonstrate the benefits of such as approach within a carbon trading scheme, the committee considers that the wider benefits of improved soil structures and the potential increases in productivity of such systems warrant further examination.  The committee considers that the government should request

        There are existing national environmental policy frameworks in place which provide agreed objectives and management approaches for all jurisdictions to protect native vegetation, including regrowth and remnant habitats.  Such frameworks include the National Strategy for the Conservation of Australia’s Biological Diversity and the National Framework for the Management and Monitoring of Australia’s Native Vegetation (Native Vegetation Framework).  These national frameworks are agreed between all jurisdictions and are underpinned by specific policies, legislation and management approaches within each jurisdiction.

        The Government is conscious of the need for an effective national framework for tackling land clearing.

        2008 the Natural Resource Management Ministerial Council (NRMMC) agreed to finalise the review of the Native Vegetation Framework.  The NRMMC confirmed the importance of the Native Vegetation Framework as the national policy framework for achieving a reversal in the long-term decline of Australia’s native vegetation and improving the condition of existing native vegetation.  The Native Vegetation Framework provides a mechanism through which the native vegetation management commitments agreed to by all state and territory governments can be progressed in a consistent and coherent manner.

        , state and territory governments have also enacted legislation for environmental protection, including to regulate the broad scale clearing of native vegetation and to protect threatened species and ecological communities.  The Government protects certain specific and defined matters of National Environmental Significance under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (

        Better soil management, including carbon in soils, is being addressed as a priority under the $46.2 million Climate Change Research Program component of the Australia’s Farming Future Initiative.  The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, the Hon Tony Burke MP announced on 3 March 2009 $20 million for soil carbon research under this Program.

       <p class="italic">
        The Government notes that complying with the guidelines is a mandatory requirement of the legislation, however, the guidelines offer some flexibility in how taxpayers may comply.  Extending the guidelines to involve mandatory requirements or additional regulatory requirements would significantly increase the cost of compliance for forest growers, increase the cost of administering the tax deduction, and would raise issues about the bounds of Commonwealth jurisdiction.

        Concerns regarding the potential for native vegetation to be cleared, or converted to, carbon sink forests are already addressed in the legislation.  Subsection 40-1010(2)(c) notes that to obtain the tax deduction the area occupied by the carbon sink forest must have been clear of trees on 1 January 1990.  In addition, the guidelines provide that all government regulatory requirements be adhered to in order to obtain the tax deduction, and this includes relevant state and territory land clearing regulations.

           and the government’s response to it, and I move:
          </p>
          <p class="moved">
           That the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate" rel="nofollow">

           </a>
           take note of the document.
          </p>
          <p>
           I have to say that the government’s response does not satisfy the concerns that I raised in the dissenting report from the majority report. In view of the collapse of managed investment schemes in recent times, I think the concerns that were put on the table by the Greens when this legislation was being debated are now more relevant than ever. At the time, the majority committee report said:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           The committee notes that other forms of greenhouse gas emissions reduction activities … are tax deductible. The change in the tax treatment of carbon sink forests addresses this anomaly …
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           The committee believes that the tax deductions will provide incentives for corporate investment into greenhouse gas abatement activities which represents an ideal opportunity to direct necessary capital to achieve positive environmental outcomes.
          </p>
          <p>
           That is exactly what they said about the managed investment schemes for forests. This was a fabulous idea to drive investment into rural Australia; what a good thing to do. It was all set up as a tax minimisation scheme, and look what an utter and complete mess and collapse has occurred because of that.
          </p>
          <p>
           At the time, I said we should be repealing the managed investment schemes, not bringing in another managed investment scheme by way of carbon sink forests. Yet the government and the coalition overruled that and went ahead. Now we have got two Senate inquiries into the managed investment schemes whilst continuing with this absolutely flawed proposal for carbon sink forests. I said at the time that these forests will not be biodiverse plantings, and the government said, ‘Oh yes, they will.’ But now in the government’s own response it says:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           The
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government" rel="nofollow">
            Government
           </a>
           notes that it is not the primary objective of the legislation to promote biodiversity.
          </p>
          <p>
           Exactly. The trees they put in they will put on the best land to grow the best trees with the most water because the idea is to bulk up the trees, bulk up the carbon as quickly as possible, and it is not its primary objective to achieve biodiversity and improvements in the long term in rural and regional Australia.
          </p>
          <p>
           The other major concern I had was in relation to land clearance. I said that this will lead to land clearance for people to plant these forests. The government have said, ‘Oh no, that’s not the case because it can’t have been forested in 1990.’ But the point is when you are talking about native vegetation you are not necessarily talking about land which conforms to the definition of a forest. There is a specific definition of a forest and quite a lot of areas of native vegetation across Australia do not conform to that, and there will be land clearance because of this. I urge the government to recognise that it is all waffle in the government’s response here about the wonderful strategies that are in place nationally to look at the clearance of native vegetation. We do not even have a trigger under the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC" rel="nofollow">
            EPBC
           </a>
           Act on land clearance, let alone anything else in terms of greenhouse. In the Tasmanian context I can tell you now there is no enforcement and compliance in relation to land clearance, there is no enforcement and compliance in relation to groundwater.
          </p>
          <p>
           The express concerns of National Party senators and the Greens in relation to this particular legislation were specifically in terms of four particular areas. One was that carbon sinks be registered on the property title, and I am glad the government has taken that up. The second one was no native vegetation to be cleared or converted for carbon sink forests. That has not been dealt with. Carbon sink forests should be biodiverse and cannot be harvested or cleared. That has not been dealt with. As I said, the definitions are such that native vegetation will be able to be cleared. The third thing we said was no carbon sink forests could be established in the absence of hydrological analysis in terms of groundwater and groundwater interception in the proposed areas. That has not been dealt with. In fact, the government has made a statement there saying that requiring hydrological analysis would be cost prohibitive. So in my view we have got
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MI" rel="nofollow">
            MI
           </a>
           schemes on steroids. That has always been my view.
          </p>
          <p>
           The MI schemes have now fallen over big time. The investors in them have had their fingers burnt very badly. The people who made the money out of them were the accountants and the middlemen, the financial arrangers. They were the ones who walked off with the cash with these MI schemes. Now a lot of rural communities are stranded, and the communities I feel particularly sorry for are those where the MI schemes went in and bought up the water rights. Now those water rights will be the first things sold off as the MI schemes are wound up, and whole rural communities are going to be left without water because the water rights will be sold somewhere else, further down the catchment, most likely, and that will mean the big corporate buyers will buy the water and the family farms will be left in communities without water. So this is a living disaster, the MI schemes, and nobody in this place can say that they were not warned. They were warned. They were warned by the Greens and warned by the Nationals about what the impact would be in rural and regional Australia, and everybody took no notice, went ahead and said, ‘Let’s do it again with the carbon sink forests. Let’s get out there and give 100 per cent tax deductions for carbon sink forests.’ And now we have had proof from the government that their primary objective is not biodiversity: ‘It’s too expensive to require hydrological analysis; we’ll rely on the states to oversee land clearance.’ But we know that, in a case like Tasmania, that is a joke because there is no enforcement or compliance with regard to vegetation clearance.
          </p>
          <p>
           I hope when this parliament starts looking at the mess of the MI schemes we will rapidly think again about this carbon sink forests legislation and get rid of it, because its primary objective is a tax deduction. When you introduce a financial mechanism the primary objective of which is tax minimisation and not the outcome—whether it was almonds, whether it was trees in the case of the forestry ones or whether it is now in terms of carbon sink forests—you always get rorting. That is what has happened. To the detriment of regional and rural Australia, that is what happened. The
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collins_Street" rel="nofollow">
            Collins Street
           </a>
           investors moved in, the accountants got their 30 per cent commissions and the communities are going to end up with a mess. They are now surrounded by plantations that are going to be fire hazards this summer, that are going to be full of weeds and feral animals. There is no money to manage those
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIS" rel="nofollow">
            MIS
           </a>
           forests sitting out there now and there will not be any money to manage these so-called carbon sink forests either once this scheme gets underway.
          </p>
          <p>
           We are still at a matter of debate in this parliament as to whether the tax deduction includes the cost of land. I believe it does and I have advice to say that it does which I provided to the parliament, and it is now only going to be a matter of someone taking this the court. We are going to have huge areas left with these MI schemes and what we have to make sure is that the government does not now enable forests that were planted as a result of tax deductions for wood production to end up able to be suddenly converted into carbon sink forests in order to realise some value for the investors that were in it to reduce their tax in the first place and not actually to get outcomes. That would make an even worse situation because you would then take out those plantations that were wood production and put them in as carbon sink forests and drive the logging further and further into native forests. That would be a disaster in biodiversity terms, a disaster in terms of the timber industry and the downstreaming that was meant to come from those plantations. It would be an Australian rural community horror show, in fact.
          </p>
          <p>
           So I would like to see the government rethink what it is doing and help to resolve the mess that was created because the Liberal and Labor parties supported this tax minimisation in the first place, clean up the mess of the MI schemes and repeal this legislation before we end up with exactly the same mess very shortly down the track.

            <i>
             Implementation, operation and administration of the legislation underpinning carbon sink forests
            </i>
            . I welcome the fact that the government has made the report. I would note that, despite the predictions of doom and gloom and disaster that we have just heard from the Greens, enormous opportunities arise for Australian agriculture with the incorporation of carbon sink forests into their lands.
           </p>
           <p>
            I still have some concerns about the processes that the government is putting in place through this measure and also through the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPRS" rel="nofollow">
             CPRS
            </a>
            . My concern is that the opportunities that should exist for farmers to integrate farm forestry into their whole-of-farm management plans, which is the way that this should be encouraged, is not being put into place in the way that it could be. The government should be showing greater intensity in the work that it is doing to try and get some of the accounting procedures modified, particularly those that give the opportunity for the recognition of carbon stored in wood products. This not the case under the current accounting rules, which severely limit the capacity of farmers in rural communities to take advantage of the opportunities that exist for the sequestration of carbon and the take-up of these opportunities. I am concerned that the growth in restrictions around the operation of some of these projects really does provide those limitations.
           </p>
           <p>
            In respect of Senator Milne’s comments, while I do agree with some of the prudential measures that are in place governing managed investment schemes, the collapse of two companies does not mean the demise of the whole process. There are companies that are still quite successfully operating managed investment schemes and providing opportunities for farmers and the supply of timber products into the wood supply. We all know that the Greens have the view that you should close down all forestry in Australia, and the way they misuse terminology and definitions in this debate is quite deceptive at times. I would urge people to take real caution when they listen to some of the hysterical contributions that are being made in this debate. In particular, people should listen very carefully to some of the terminology that is being used.
           </p>
           <p>
            I welcome the fact that the government has made a response to the committee report, but there remain some concerns, as I have indicated. The government needs to make sure that the real opportunities that exist for rural Australia to participate properly in forestry are dealt with as part of both this process and the development of the CPRS moving forward.
