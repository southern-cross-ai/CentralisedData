        My question is to Senator Cash, the Minister representing the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development. How is the Liberal and National government driving economic recovery in our drought affected regions by supporting the rebuilding of their businesses, their job markets and their confidence following the triple shock of bushfires, drought and the economic impacts of the COVID virus?

         I thank Senator Davey for her question. I acknowledge the commitment of all of us on the government's side of the chamber to rural and regional Australia and, of course, Australians who live there. As we know, rural and regional Australians are incredibly resilient. This has been highlighted in particular by the incidents of the recent droughts, bushfires, the floods and, of course, the impact of COVID-19. But, as we have all witnessed, rural and regional Australians have come through these significant challenges because of their fighting spirit. It is a fighting spirit that Senator Davey would know cannot be underestimated.

         and National governments are proud to support rural and regional Australians. Why? Because it's in our

         . Last week the government announced that drought affected communities across Australia will benefit from 163 local infrastructure and community building projects as part of a $207 million investment under round 4 of the Australian government's Building Better Regions Fund. This fund provides grants of up to $10 million to local governments or incorporated not-for-profit organisations for infrastructure and community initiatives. The fund invests in community projects that create jobs, drive economic growth and build stronger regional and rural communities into the future.
        </p>
        <p>
         The most recent round of the Building Better Regions Fund specifically focuses on helping communities that have been hardest hit by the crippling droughts. We know that many regional communities continue to face the effects of the prolonged dry spell. Our message as a government to them is clear: we understand that you are suffering, and we understand the challenges that you are facing.

           <p>
            Yes, I am. The government is continuing, as I said, its longstanding commitment to rural and regional Australia by making vital local projects a reality. What do these vital local projects do? They create more jobs, and they drive economic development across our regional and rural communities.

           <p>
            We have seen very, very good outcomes from the first three rounds of the Building Better Regions Fund, and we now want to build on these outcomes, including infrastructure projects that we are fundingâ€”the Tenterfield Water Treatment Plant replacement project in

               . You'd be aware that, as part of our economic recovery package for COVID-19, we have established a $1 billion COVID-19 relief and recovery fund to support regions, communities and industry sectors that have been disproportionately affected by the impact of COVID-19.

               Over $600 million has already been committed to support industries including aviation, agriculture, fisheries, tourism and the arts. These include support for regional aviation under our $100 million Regional Airlines Funding Assistance Program and relief for federally managed fisheries through the waiving of nearly $10 million in levies.
