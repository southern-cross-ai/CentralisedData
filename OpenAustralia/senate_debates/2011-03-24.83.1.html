        My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig. With the government appointed mediator in Tasmania’s forest industry talks suggesting that 572,000 hectares of Tasmanian forests may be traded off to the environment movement in exchange for support for the Gunns pulp mill, would the minister advise what independent scientific work has been undertaken to assess these forests under the long-accepted scientifically based criteria, such as JANIS and

        , to determine their suitability for removal from the existing industry wood supply?

         The Gillard government has welcomed the landmark agreement and believes that it is important that we play a constructive role in supporting this significant community-led initiative. Together with the Tasmanian government, the government appointed Mr Bill Kelty as the independent facilitator to work with the signatories to the community-led statement to help build and implement plans for the principles. The Gillard government looks forward to receiving—

           And we have appointed Mr Bill Kelty to lead that process. We already have the interim report on the statement of principles process and we will consider its findings. In terms of the specific issues raised by the opposition about this, it will mean that there will need to be work undertaken to ensure that definitional issues are resolved. The Gillard government remains committed to working with the Tasmanian community to respond to the challenges that are facing the forest industry.

          <p>
           It is a credit to those who have brought this forward, because it is about trying to resolve the way forward for the industry in Tasmania after decades of conflict. It is critically important—and I think the opposition makes the point—that we do get an assessment on these matters. We will undertake the type of work that will ensure that, under the statement of principles, community and industry groups are coming together to ensure—

                I went to that first, of course. A moratorium is essential in this. The Australian government endorsed the Tasmanian government’s initial moratorium in December covering 39 coupes. Mr Kelty announced on 11 March 2011 that a six-month moratorium had been agreed and that logging will not occur in areas environment groups identified as ‘high conservation value forest’ unless it is necessary to meet existing contracts or is subject to the approval of a reference group for the assurance of wood supply for existing industry.
               </p>
               <p>
                I understand that a blanket moratorium across all areas identified by environment groups is impractical at this stage. What I—

                  I am sure those opposite will be jealous about this answer. The due diligence by the Australian and Tasmanian governments will provide the assessment of the implications of implementing the statement of principles. That work is underway and being done, because it is required to have due diligence.

                   , I ask a further supplementary question. Given that the government has previously conceded in answer to questions on notice that it does not have a definition for ‘high conservation value’, what is the assessment process that was promised in the joint state and Commonwealth statement of 14 December for locking up further public forest resources? Or will this be merely another capitulation to the Greens for some of their favourite places?

                        It is not only the due diligence process but also the preparatory work that is underway, including gathering timber resource and industry employment data to examine the impacts of the proposal by signatories to implement the statement of principles. This work requires agreement by the signatories on the shape of the final agreement before the social and economic impacts and opportunities can be truly assessed. I encourage those opposite, those from Tasmania and those who support the direction in which the government is heading in this area to watch and assist Mr Kelty in that work.

                         , I raise a point of order on relevance. My question was about the process to evaluate the forests in Tasmania. It was not about the social and economic; it was specifically about the assessment of the forests, and that is the critical issue in respect of my question.

                            He took the point of order. I am sorry, but that was the most absurd point of order. Senator Ludwig’s answer was clearly relevant and in fact directly relevant to the question that was asked. The senator is redefining his question in a way that he chooses, because he does not like the answer he is getting and then takes a frivolous point of order. It should be dismissed out of hand,
