        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs, Senator Reynolds. Did Minister Dutton disclose to the Prime Minister that he received a political donation from the National Retail Association a week before he asked the

             I know that these issues have been explored in this place with Senator Reynolds, as well as in the other place, during the course of the week. There seems to be a desperate attempt to seek to draw some connection that just does not exist in this regard. The National Retailers Association has donated to both sides of politics. The Labor member for Griffith received donations from the National Retailers Association in the same financial year as Mr Dutton's campaign.

               My point of order is on direct relevance. The issue is not a political donation in its own right; the issue is a political donation being made to somebody who then fast tracks consideration of a taxpayer grantâ€”a taxpayer grant. I'd ask the minister to be directly relevant to the question.

                    I'm confident that Mr Dutton will have met all disclosure requirements in relation to donations or in relation to any other commitments in relation to the ministerial standards and expectations set around the ministerial standard. Mr Dutton, I'm advised, in relation to the grant asked the

                      My point of order goes to direct relevance. I accept that this is a question that has been directed to the Leader of the Government in the circumstances. On both this one and on the primary question that went to disclosure to the Prime Minister, I'd ask him either to be directly relevant or, if he is not in a position to do so, to take those issues on notice because they go directly to the issue we are asking aboutâ€”whether these issues were disclosed to the Prime Minister.

                           I will take the question on notice insofar as there are any details that need to be provided to the chamber about grant process disclosures that have been made. I am quite confident that Mr Dutton has met all disclosure obligations under political fundraising guidelines, that he will have met ministerial standards around disclosures that are required to be met and most particularly that, in administering public funds as a minister of the Crown, he has sought to deliver good public policy outcomes for Australia. Those good public policy outcomes for Australia include keeping Australians safe, be they in crowded places, in retail environments or in the types of locations that are crucially important in terms of the number of Australians who congregate, the threat to Australians and the importance of ensuring that businesses are well equipped to operate in safe environments and localities.
