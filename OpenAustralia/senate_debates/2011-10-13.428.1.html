        , Senator Ludwig. Bearing in mind that dementia is currently affecting over one million Australians—including those directly affected and those caring for a person with dementia—is the third most common cause of death, costs this country $6 billion annually and will be the third greatest source of healthcare and residential care expenditure within 20 years, and considering the importance of this issue and the fact that our community services and our health and aged-care services are ill-prepared to face this, why has the government terminated the dementia initiative? Will the government guarantee that the programs funded under this initiative will continue to receive at least the same level of funding that they received under the initiative?

         I thank Senator Siewert for her question about dementia programs. The Australian government is committed to funding the delivery of a range of dementia support activities. This support includes provision of $8.3 billion for the care of people in aged-care homes, 52 per cent of whom have a diagnosis of dementia. The government also funds the Extended Aged Care at Home Dementia packages and respite care to support people in the community and has funded around $30 million in service improvements, including in information provision, counselling services, referral, education and training. The government does take this issue very seriously.
        </p>
        <p>
         The report into dementia amongst aged-care residents found that the Aged Care Funding Instrument recognises that residents with dementia have greater care needs and that it provides, on average, additional funding of approximately $7,000 per annum per resident to assist with those needs. The government provided funding of $8.5 million to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHMRC" rel="nofollow">
          NHMRC
         </a>
         for dementia research, including funding for Dementia Collaborative Research Centres, of which there are three, to undertake dementia research and to translate the outcomes of that research into practice.
        </p>
        <p>
         Emerging evidence suggests that a healthy lifestyle assists in the prevention of dementia. The Australian government's $872 million investment in healthy living and the establishment of the National Preventive Health Agency are also contributing to better management of lifestyle factors, which may help prevent the onset of dementia. The government welcomes the release of the report

          , I ask a supplementary question. I noticed that the minister, although giving us some figures, did not answer the two questions I asked. The first was: why was the dementia initiative cancelled? The second was: will the government guarantee that the funding available will remain at at least the same level as under the initiative? I repeat those questions. While he is answering those questions, can he also talk about what the government are doing about timely diagnosis, risk reduction and continuing the cutting edge research that is needed if we are going to address dementia in this country over the next 20 years?

           I thank Senator Siewert for her supplementary question. I will deal with research funding, which was part of the supplementary question, before I come back and deal with the issues in the primary question. The government funds three Dementia Collaborative Research Centres to undertake dementia research and to translate the outcomes of that research. The government does so because it is incredibly important to get the facts right and to understand the nature of dementia so that we can undertake some of the work that you described. One of the three centres is focusing on early detection and prevention.
          </p>
          <p>
           Evidence shows that the risk factors for dementia are similar to those for other chronic diseases, such as heart disease and stroke. That is why I indicated earlier, in my answer to the primary question about funding—

            , I ask a further supplementary question. The minister referred in his answer to the Aged Care Funding Instrument and to work in aged care. One of the issues raised by the community is the fact that the

             Caring for older Australians

            , did not make many recommendations about, or greatly touch on, dementia. There is concern in the community about that. When the Minister for Mental

             (Queensland—) (): I thank Senator Siewert for her further supplementary question dealing with aged care. As an indication of the direction we are heading in this area, an additional 17,916 residential care and 2,000 transitional care places have been allocated nationally since we were elected in 2007. The issue of dementia is one of those areas that, as I understand it, is also included within that work. As we age and as we require additional places for aged care, if you look at the statistics around Alzheimer's and dementia, it is an issue that will have to be managed in aged-care facilities. I will take the funding part of the question on notice to make sure we can provide a more detailed response.
