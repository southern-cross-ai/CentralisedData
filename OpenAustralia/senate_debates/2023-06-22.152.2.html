          The facts are clear: Senator Gallagher has misled this Senate. Despite being given ample opportunity over the last two weeks to acknowledge that reality and to do the right thing by appropriately apologising and appropriately correcting the record, Senator Gallagher has instead obfuscated, avoided and outright refused to acknowledge that reality.
         </p>
         <p>
          The facts are very clear. At Senate estimates on 4 June 2021, Senator Gallagher stated that no-one had any knowledge of an alleged sexual assault in

           Parliament House

          before those allegations became public on 15 February 2021. That was a statement made in a tone full of indignation. 'How dare you!' Senator Gallagher said at the time she made that statement. Then last week, on 13 June, Senator Gallagher confirmed:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          I was provided with information in the days before the allegations were first reported …
         </p>

          That was not, as Senator Gallagher just said then, a 'heads-up'—

            but 'information'. Having said that no-one had any knowledge, she then acknowledged that, indeed, she had been provided with information. This is an open-and-shut case of misleading this Senate and this parliament. This debate right now, and many of the questions over the last two weeks, could have been avoided had Senator Gallagher simply acknowledged this blatant act of misleading the Senate. It could have been—

                Don't take my word for the fact that the misleading is there and is clear for all to see; take the analysis that has been repeated time and time again across the press gallery. Last night
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Crowe" rel="nofollow">
                 David Crowe
                </a>
                was crowned as the latest press gallery journalist of the year. What has he written? Quote: '
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katy_Gallagher" rel="nofollow">
                 Katy Gallagher
                </a>
                misled parliament'. A further quote is 'Gallagher's own words show how she misled a Senate committee in June 2021'. Phillip Coorey, from the
                <i>
                 Financial Review
                </i>
                finance minister Katy Gallagher was exposed 'as misleading parliament'. Indeed, I can quote some of the longest serving journalists who have covered politics in this country.
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Kelly" rel="nofollow">
                 Paul Kelly

                 Michelle Grattan

                , then? Gallagher's claim 'was wrong, and therefore misled parliament'. Journalist after journalist and observer after observer have all come to the same conclusion based on the same facts, and that conclusion is that Senator Gallagher misled this parliament.
               </p>
               <p>
                Why does this matter? As Senator Gallagher herself said to the Senate, amongst the many hundreds of questions that she sought to ask over this matter—she said to Senator Reynolds: 'You have a responsibility to the Senate.' Senator Gallagher, you too have a responsibility to the Senate, and what is that responsibility—

                 What is that responsibility to the Senate? It is, as the Prime Minister's Code of Conduct for Ministers says at section 4.1, to 'take all reasonable steps to ensure that they do not mislead the public or the parliament'. Senator Gallagher says that she has always acted ethically, but an ethical approach would be, firstly, to not mislead. An ethical approach would be, secondly, to own up if you have misled, to apologise if you have misled and to appropriately correct the record if you have misled. Senator Gallagher has failed on each and every one of those tests.
                </p>
                <p>
                 These are serious issues, and there are associated issues that go to questions of how the tragedy of an alleged sexual assault was politicised, but those matters are not before us today. It is the simple issue of misleading the Senate. No matter the views of senators on other matters, this Senate should not stand for being misled. It should send a message clearly by censuring Senator Gallagher.

                  For the last two weeks we have seen the opposition trying to blame everybody else for their own shortcomings rather than take responsibility for their actions or their failure to act. Senator Birmingham conveniently wants us to not remember what this is about. We remember what this is about and so do people around the country.

                    I don't know that an alleged rape is a private matter, Senator. You may think that. A Liberal staffer made an allegation that she was raped in a Liberal minister's office, metres from a Liberal prime minister's office, and instead of dealing with these issues appropriately, instead of taking a long, hard look at themselves, they just tried to point the fingers at others. What is worse—

We've seen that in their behaviour this fortnight. Too many of them have learnt nothing from the national reckoning of two years ago. The very same members of the opposition who were at the centre of events years ago—the very same members of the opposition who have dodged questions, have carefully chosen their language and evaded scrutiny, and have never been transparent about their knowledge and action—are now pointing the finger at others. It's a desperate attempt to launder their reputation—a desperate attempt to rewrite history by peddling false accusations about others.
