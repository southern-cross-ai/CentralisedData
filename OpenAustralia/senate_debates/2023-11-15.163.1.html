        It's always interesting to follow Senator Roberts and his manifesto. From one manifesto to another, I want to talk today about the Albanese government's measures that we have put in place to deal with the cost of living. The Albanese government has its eyes fixed firmly on our No. 1 priority, which is tackling the cost-of-living pressures that Australians are facing right now. We've crafted a comprehensive $23 billion 10-point plan, and I want to take a few minutes to unpack some of these key measures that we're putting in place to alleviate the pressures on Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        Firstly, we have delivered electricity bill relief. We are committed to providing relief, making sure Australians can turn the lights on or power the air con knowing that relief is there. Unfortunately, those opposite from the Liberal and National parties voted against these measures.
       </p>
       <p>
        We've also delivered cheaper child care, giving our youngest Australians the best start in life and giving parents the flexibility to return to work or to work more if they choose. The evidence shows that fees would have been 13 per cent higher if it were not for these measures that we've put in place.
       </p>
       <p>
        We've also increased rent assistance, because we know housing is particularly important for Australians and that assistance can make all the difference. But those opposite, unfortunately, voted against our bill to introduce the housing future fund to deliver more social and affordable housing to this country.
       </p>
       <p>
        When it comes to health, just a few weeks ago the largest investment in Medicare's 40-year history started, when we increased the bulk billing payments of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        s, making seeing a doctor more accessible and affordable for all Australians. We're also making medicines cheaper and more accessible to those Australians who need it most. Disgracefully, this was another measure opposed by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
         LNP
        </a>
        , so much so that they actually voted against it six times in the Senate. We've also boosted income support payments, ensuring that no-one is left behind in these tough times.
       </p>
       <p>
        After the cuts and neglect under the LNP, we are finally restoring
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
         TAFE
        </a>
        . We believe in investing in education, and that's why we're delivering fee-free TAFE. Building a skilled workforce doesn't just support people now but helps us build our future.
       </p>
       <p>
        Speaking of the future, we're not just addressing the challenges of today; we're laying the foundations of tomorrow. Affordable homes are crucial, and our government is hard at work to build more of them because, after a lost decade for housing in this country, there is a lot more work to do. We're expanding paid parental leave to make it fairer and easier for Australians to start and grow their families, and the Albanese Labor government is creating jobs and getting wages moving again, because finally, after a decade, Australians have a government that is working for them and getting wages moving and doesn't see low wage growth as a deliberate design feature of our economic architecture. Unfortunately, when it comes to those opposite and the minimum wage case, you had a government arguing to keep wages lower. Well, that's not what our government did when it came to arguing for a minimum wage rise for the lowest-paid workers in this country. We argued that wages should keep up with the cost of living.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have not lost sight of our primary focus, which is cost of living, wages, jobs and the economy. In fact, we've achieved some significant milestones during this difficult time. We've delivered the first budget surplus in 15 years, witnessed wages growing at their fastest rate in a decade and created 561,000 jobs since taking office, a record for any new government. Our commitment extends beyond just addressing the immediate concerns. We're making investments in the future of Australia. We're making investments in manufacturing, in the future of our care economy and in infrastructure and transport. We are working for Australia on multiple fronts, and our 10-point plan is a testament to that. We understand the challenges that Australians face, and we're not just talking about it or complaining about it as those over there are doing. What we're doing is implementing concrete actions to ensure a better, more affordable future for all Australians.
