         Introduction

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         The Committee
        </a>
        tabled its report in the Senate on 6 October 2005. The report comprised a majority report and a minority report from Government Senators.

        The majority report of the Committee responds to allegations of misuse of the programmes in the period prior to the 2004 election, serious impropriety in approval and announcement processes, concealed processes and political conditions placed on grants. The report fails to substantiate any of these allegations and reaches the conclusion that the administration of both programmes is ‘reasonably sound’.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        welcomes this finding and with it the bipartisan endorsement of the role of the Area Consultative Committee (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACC" rel="nofollow">
         ACC

        </a>
        ACs) in delivering positive outcomes for Australian communities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The minority report highlights the hundreds of successful projects across the country and the benefits these projects are providing to local communities. Some $250 million has been approved for nearly 1000 projects identified by local communities as high priority since 2001.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Six case studies cited in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Report" rel="nofollow">
         Report
        </a>
        from which the majority of conclusions have been drawn are atypical of most projects funded.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Two of these projects (Primary Energy and Beaudesert Rail) were originally assessed under arrangements that existed prior to commencement of the Regional Partnerships programme.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In two of the six cases (A2 Dairy Marketers and Tumbi Creek) no
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Government
        </a>
        funds had been spent at the conclusion of the Inquiry, and approval for the A2 Dairy Marketers project had been withdrawn.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee found no evidence of inappropriate interference by Ministers in the assessment of projects and has not identified any breach of the established caretaker conventions prior to the 2004 election.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee also received evidence in this Inquiry that the distribution of approved projects closely reflects the pattern of applications received. The Government encourages all Senators and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_Parliament" rel="nofollow">
         Members of Parliament
        </a>
        across all States and electorates to work with their local communities to identify worthwhile projects within their communities that may be eligible for assistance under the Regional Partnerships and Sustainable Regions programmes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The majority report claims to have been hindered by a lack of cooperation by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Transport_and_Regional_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Transport and Regional Services
        </a>
        (DOTARS). It is critical of claimed “misleading information” provided by the Department to ACCs and for failure to table all documents sought by the Committee, particularly in relation to the Department’s advice to Ministers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Department operated over the course of this Inquiry within long-standing conventions accepted by successive Governments relating to non-disclosure of advice provided to Ministers. The Department’s position was supported by advice from across the public service and Ministers. Consistent with that advice, the approval of the Minister was sought before documents were released to the Committee.

        The Government announced on 15 November 2005 that changes to the
        <i>

        programme will permit the Government to direct a pool of funds within the

        The

It is also important for reasons of fairness that applicants retain the ability to have an application assessed under the programme even if it is not supported by an ACC.

        The Government is not persuaded that this proposal would improve programme accountability. The publication of advice concerning recommendations made to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services by departmental advisers and by other bodies such as ACCs, is not supported. Publication of such advice would make it difficult for ACCs to provide a critical assessment of projects. This approach is consistent with long-standing practice in relation to the confidentiality of departmental advice to Ministers.

        This is already generally the case. However, there are some instances where it is not appropriate to insist on development approvals ahead of assessment. For instance, a community group that has raised funds through raffles and similar activities should not necessarily be forced to use those funds seeking approvals while there is high uncertainty about a project proceeding because they have not secured programme funding. In such cases approvals are made subject to securing relevant consents.

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate" rel="nofollow">
          Senate
         </a>
         take note of the document.
        </p>
        <p>
         Better late than never: 14 months after this very important committee report was presented to the Senate, we see this document presented. Having had the opportunity to look at the document, I now know why—because this is a feeble response to a very important committee report which was presented to the Senate. In the last sitting week of 2006, we see this document presented.
        </p>
        <p>
         Let me remind the Senate that this report shows that the government had taken advantage of its stewardship of the public purse to fund projects willy-nilly around the country, with more regard to its electoral prospects than to the interests of the taxpayer, fairness or proper process. As a result, quite a number of recommendations—some of which have actually been accepted by the government—were proposed by this committee. Let me remind the Senate that I said when the report was presented that it was a report which would shock the nation, and indeed it did. At that time, I named some projects where the spending total of $5 million was to do such things as fund a steam train that would not go, a creek that dredged itself, a milk company that folded before the ink on the funding announcement was dry, an ethanol company worth $1 that still has yet to produce a drop of fuel and a hotel funded to run ‘Wacky Wednesdays’ and stunt bikini babes while other communities on the Atherton tableland cry out for potable drinking water. What a travesty!
        </p>
        <p>
         And, 14 months later, what particular matters was the government keen not to agree to in this report? Surprise, surprise, from the point of view of the majority report of the committee: the government has declined to agree with those recommendations which allowed better scrutiny of the government’s ad-min-istration of this program, ‘regional rorts’. That is what the public came to know this program as. ‘Regional rorts’ were editorialised around the country as shocking misbehaviour by this government in the exercise of its administrative responsibilities—spend-ing from the public purse basically for the purpose of funding the government’s election campaign rather than really funding the interests of regional Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         We see that, where the committee recommended that area consultative committee recommendations be disclosed to funding applicants, the government disagreed. Where the committee recommended that the government conduct a review of the role of area consultative committees to ensure their contribution to regional development is maximised, the government disagreed. Where the committee recommended that biannual statements be tabled in the Senate by the minister representing Minister for Transport and Regional Services, listing the Regional Partnership Program grants approved in the preceding six-month period, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Transport_and_Regional_Services" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Transport and Regional Services
         </a>
         ’ and the area consultative committees’ recommendations, the government disagreed. Where the committee recommended that, where funding decisions were inconsistent with the department and/or area consultative committee recommendations, a statement for the reason for the decision be tabled, the government disagreed. Where the committee recommended that, to avoid the suggestion that this program was being used simply as a means of courting electoral approval as we got close to an election, the government effectively extend the caretaker provision of this program, the government disagreed.

         </a>
         programs, better known around the country as ‘regional rorts’, we have seen that this government is keen to maintain the ability to use this program for the purpose of funding its electoral campaigns, in effect, putting money into regions where it either thinks it needs to build up its support to retain a seat or is seeking to campaign to take a seat—potentially, probably from one of the Independents in this parliament, as they attempted to with the seat of New England at the last election.
        </p>
        <p>
         The public has had enough of issues such as the abuse of process that was involved in the Tumbi Creek grant. Two grants were announced by the Prime Minister. But we found out that, before there was approval of the process, storms had led to a partial dredging of the creek—in other words, the ordinary course of running water from the storm had done part of the job that the Commonwealth was going to pay for. We saw a steam train in Queensland that ceased to operate even though over $1 million had been paid towards the project. We saw, on the Atherton tablelands, a hotel being given funds to improve its competitive position in relation to others in that town—but, in the same community, we found a town that had drinking water that was barely drinkable and water pressure that did not allow the community to fight fire. What a travesty! What an outrageous performance by this government—and no contrition at all in relation to this program.
        </p>
        <p>
         What the government are keen to do is maintain their ability to pump money out during the lead-up to an election campaign and make promises during an election campaign without the constraint of actually having to show that the projects have the support of the organisations that the government has set up to, in part, vet these projects—the area consultative committees. They are not prepared to show the public that this body that they have set up that is supposed to have the expertise to deal with these matters, that is supposed to have the interests of the region at heart and that is impartial to government supports the project. They are not even prepared to say that. They are not even prepared to say that where there is a disagreement between the government and this body—this body that the government are setting up; they have total control over who is on this body—the government will make a statement of reasons or actually publish that fact.
        </p>
        <p>
         They are not prepared to allow the applicants who think that perhaps they are not being properly dealt with by the area consultative committee to know whether the area consultative committee actually approved their application in the process of consideration by government. What the government are clearly indicating here is that they intend to go through the same process again. They intend to follow the discredited process of using this program in the way that has become known—as a series of regional rorts to deliver electoral advantage to the government.
        </p>
        <p>
         I think the Australian community has had enough of this. I think the Australian community expects that, as taxpayers, when they pay money this government will account for the way they use it and account properly. I think the Australian community is sick and tired of governments using their money simply as a means of currying electoral favour. When the government makes these announcements they had better be prepared for a backlash. It may seem that there are opportunities for electoral advantage, but the reality is that a lot of people in the community are going to be asking questions about how this is being funded, who is paying for it, what the process has been and why other projects which are in the pipeline did not get funded when the ones that the government selected did get funded.
        </p>
        <p>
         This will become a poisoned chalice for the government. When it comes to the consideration of these projects, the opposition will be pointing out to the Australian people that this government wants to shield from the public the way that they handle this process, just as they shielded from the committee originally the determinations by the department and details of the particular projects, where even the department’s advice was overturned by ministers so that the minister could deliver the political advantage that they thought they had.
        </p>

         I was going to seek leave to continue my remarks, but Senator Forshaw is going to seek the call, and perhaps there will be someone else. This is a very shabby response to the committee’s report. It is eight months late, inadequate and one to which we will return and make sure the public is aware of.

          programs. As Senator O’Brien has pointed out, it is a totally inadequate response to that report. It is a totally inadequate response, I believe, to the very serious, important and constructive recommendations made in the majority report. It is particularly inadequate because it has been 14 months since the report was handed down and we get the response from the government to it in the very last days of this year’s parliament. The report was tabled in October 2005 and it has taken almost 14 months for the government to present what I believe is pretty much a pathetic response.
         </p>
         <p>
          I note that the government response indicates that they agree with a number of the recommendations, or agree in part with a number of the recommendations, of the committee, and I welcome that. But the government have rejected the substantial recommendations, the key recommendations that go to the heart of better accountability and particularly accountability to the parliament.
         </p>
         <p>
          I note that the government tries to make some capital out of the fact that the committee’s report found the overall administration of the programs to be reasonably sound. We did, and we have always said as an opposition that these programs, properly administered—certainly, the Regional Partnerships program—were a worthwhile way of funding important projects to promote employment and development in regional areas, particularly in areas that had otherwise undergone significant restructuring with the downsizing of rural industries or that had suffered economic hardship more than the rest of the country. The fact that the committee found that does not mean the government can just escape responsibility for the substantial and glaring inadequacies in the administration of the program.
         </p>
         <p>
          The government response says:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Six case studies cited in the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Report" rel="nofollow">
           Report

          from which the majority of conclusions have been drawn are atypical of most projects funded.
         </p>
         <p>
          The fact of the matter is that the committee, in the time it had available, took the approach of looking at six very important projects or case studies that had been funded under these programs. The flaws, poor administration and political interference in those case studies were substantial. The amounts of money that were involved were substantial. In the case of Beaudesert Rail, for instance, it was of the order of almost $6 million—$6 million of public money put into a venture which was pretty much doomed from the outset, no matter what the good intentions of the proponents were. There was a litany of mistakes and a litany of failure to take action at a time when it would have prevented a substantial waste of taxpayers’ funds.

          The Atherton Hotel project has become notorious. I notice that Senator Carr is in the chamber. I am sure he can comment even more about the scandal—

           <p>
            Yes, the tabletop dancers project, as it was referred to. Other worthwhile projects were simply ignored or not considered in any proper way.
           </p>
           <p>
            There was the Tumbi Creek fiasco, where money was advanced for a project to dredge a creek. There were serious questions about whether it was an appropriate project, given the wider consideration of problems in that region. When the money was no longer needed because the rain actually flushed out the creek and the dredging was not required, attempts were made to divert these funds to some other projects. There is no doubt in my mind that there was political interference by people associated with it—indeed, members of the coalition parties. That evidence was overwhelming. There was evidence that staff of ministers had engaged in an exchange of secret emails to divert those funds to other works.
           </p>
           <p>
            When we tried to have that matter brought before the Privileges Committee—and, from my recollection, the President concluded that it should have been given precedence in going to the Privileges Committee—the government used its numbers to stop that. That is the only occasion that longstanding members on that committee can recall where a matter was not referred to the Privileges Committee when there was a clear, prima facie case of political interference.
           </p>
           <p>
            This government just says: ‘Oh well, there are only six projects that the committee looked at. They were atypical.’ Then they say, ‘In the case of Tumbi Creek and A2 Dairy Marketers, no Australian government funds were spent by the conclusion of the inquiry.’ That is not the point. The reason that the funds were not ultimately spent was that the facts were out in the open and, in the end, the government became embarrassed and pulled the funds. The facts are that this committee looked at the processes involved in considering the applications that had been lodged and whether they had been approved or rejected by the department and, ultimately, by the minister.
           </p>
           <p>
            There was evidence of other projects where, after the area consultative committee had considered the merits of a proposal, the department determined that in their considered view the projects should not receive funding. Yet those projects did receive funding. It seemed to be a situation where the government, or somebody, had decided: ‘Maybe it should proceed. It is in a marginal electorate, and there is an election coming up.’ That is all on the record.
           </p>
           <p>
            The other point I want to draw attention to in the time I have available—and I think we could speak for a lot longer about this extensive inquiry—are the steps that were taken by the department to, in my view, sandbag the operation of the committee and prevent the committee from carrying out its properly constituted task of conducting this inquiry into this substantial government funded program. We sought information from the area consultative committees—documentation and other forms of information—about projects that they had considered. After the committee had written seeking that information, the department wrote to the area consultative committees and told them that they did not have to comply with our request. They gave them advice that privacy considerations meant that they really had not only no obligation to comply with the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate" rel="nofollow">
             Senate
            </a>
            committee’s request but also probably a duty not to comply. When it was pointed out that that was really a severe interference with the committee’s processes and was also incorrect legal advice, the department then said, ‘It’s up to you to decide if you want to comply.’ In the end, of course, we received the information but it took us a lot of effort. In fact, in the end we had to subpoena some of that information in a couple of cases. This committee was hamstrung by the failure of departmental officials who were maybe acting on instructions not to cooperate—I believe that, but testing it is another issue. I think this is a totally inadequate response. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
