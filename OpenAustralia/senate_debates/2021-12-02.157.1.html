        My question is to Senator Birmingham, the Minister Representing the Prime Minister. Can the minister update the Senate on the achievements of Australians throughout 2021 and how this Liberal-National government has had a plan to support Australian families and businesses throughout the challenges of COVID-19 this year?

         I thank Senator Small for his question and, in thanking Senator Small, I want to, in particular, thank all Australians, whom we are indebted and grateful to for all they have done, throughout 2021, as a nation, to stand together—particularly in the face of the once-in-a-century global pandemic that our nation and the world has been grappling with, which has resulted in the largest economic shock to the world since the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression" rel="nofollow">
          Great Depression
         </a>
         . Australians have demonstrated their resilience, and they should be congratulated and thanked for the efforts they have made, including coming out in droves to get vaccinated, with more than 39 million doses administered nationally, more than 92 per cent of the eligible population over 16 having had a first dose and more than 87 per cent now having had a second dose.
        </p>
        <p>
         COVID continues to be an enormous challenge right around the world. Only a few months ago, the delta strain was wreaking havoc here—as it has across so many nations, as the dominant variant. But lockdowns and restrictions that were put in place have helped to save lives and livelihoods, alongside the strong economic policies and support measures that have been in place.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia has fared far better than much of the rest of the world. On a per capita basis, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
          UK
         </a>
         and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA" rel="nofollow">
          USA
         </a>
         have had over 40 times the number of COVID deaths compared to Australia. By avoiding death rates such as those in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
          OECD
         </a>
         nations, we've managed to save over 30,000 lives. We've also fared far better than most countries on the economic front. Whilst we saw a contraction in the September quarter, this was during the period of the lockdowns across
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         , Victoria and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
          ACT
         </a>
         . But our economy has been roaring back. Job ads are more than 30 per cent higher than they were at the start of the pandemic. In fact, they're at a 12-year high. More than 350,000 jobs have come back since the start of September. We're on a pathway to see unemployment at or below five per cent for a sustained period—only the second time that has happened in 50 years. That's the strength, and that's thanks to the hard work of Australians.

           Minister Birmingham, how do the efforts of Australians, in rolling up their sleeves to make Australia one of the most highly vaccinated nations in the world, provide us with the confidence to safely reopen, stay safely open and live with the virus as we look ahead to 2022?

            Our national plan for reopening—which the Prime Minister drove, ensured we had the expertise of the Doherty institute to underpin and took through national cabinet—has relied upon Australians rolling up their sleeves to get vaccinated. And we thank them for doing that. In fact, they've become champions at it, delivering globally high vaccine rates across Australia. It is this that makes possible the safe reopening across our country. It's the incredible outcome made possible by all of the health workers and those who have risked their lives to help people suffering from COVID-19 but also to help to protect us all through the rollout of the vaccination program.
           </p>
           <p>
            That journey is not over. We are now one of first countries in the world to roll out a comprehensive nationwide booster program, to make sure that people can be as safe and as protected as possible. We've got access to more than 151 million additional doses, and the boosters will be freely available to anyone who is fully vaccinated. This is something we can all look forward to in 2022.

               We entered this pandemic from a position of economic strength, having brought the budget back to the point of balance for the first time in 11 years. This provided us with the fiscal artillery to be able to respond comprehensively throughout the pandemic, with $311 billion in direct economic and health support. JobKeeper; the coronavirus supplement; record business tax investments, to drive more investment through the economy; introducing and extending temporary full expensing and loss carry-back arrangements—all of them have helped to ensure that our economy gets through COVID strongly and comes out of it strongly.
              </p>
              <p>
               At the same time, $10.2 billion in tax relief flowed to 11½ million Australians, just during the September quarter—the largest tax cuts to flow in a single quarter in 20 years. We have been able to do all of this because we have stuck to our plan, kept our economy strong and kept Australian businesses strong, and the world can only wonder what it would've been like had the Labor Party and their higher taxes been there, instead of the actions that we have taken to keep such strength.
