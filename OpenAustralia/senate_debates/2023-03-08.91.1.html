         I thank Senator Green for her question and for her continued work for equality at home and beyond our shores.

          The UN
         </a>
         has described the status of women and girls in Iran as that of second-class citizens. Discrimination is entrenched in Iranian law and practice. But the women of Iran have not been cowed. Instead, these courageous women and girls and their allies have been at the forefront of protests, shouting, 'Women, life, freedom,' and the Australian government stands with them. We have called out Iran for its systematic discrimination against women and girls—most recently at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Council" rel="nofollow">
          Human Rights Council
         </a>
         last week. We have imposed sanctions on Iranians and Iranian entities involved in the violent crackdown on protesters.
        </p>
        <p>
         We stand too with the women of Afghanistan, where women's rights have been going backwards under the Taliban. The UN has found that the Taliban's treatment of women and girls may even amount to a crime against humanity. Women have been banned from attending university and girls from secondary education. Their movements and access to employment have been restricted. Sexual and gender based violence has increased. So Australia is supporting the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          United Nations
         </a>
         to provide health facilities and professionals to deliver reproductive health, counselling and protection services to vulnerable Afghan women and children, and last year we supported the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Food_Program" rel="nofollow">
          World Food Program
         </a>
         to provide food assistance to over 12 million women and girls. Australia and others have supported our partners to deliver life-saving health care, shelter, education, nutrition, protection and cash assistance.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are many places in the world where we need to continue to work with the brave women and men who seek to improve the position of women and girls in societies where they are, regrettably and sadly, treated in these ways.

             World Economic Forum
            </a>
            has estimated that at the current rate of progress it will take—wait for it—132 years to reach full parity. It will take 132 years, on the current trajectory, for there to be full parity between men and women.
           </p>
           <p>
            We also know that the crises of COVID-19, climate disruption and food shortages have hurt women and girls more. They have amplified existing inequalities, including gender inequality. According to the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WEF" rel="nofollow">
             WEF
            </a>
            , we saw a generational loss of gains in gender parity between 2020 and 2021, a documented step backwards in rates of livelihoods and poverty. Care Australia has estimated that 150 million more women than men are affected by food insecurity. We've seen documented declines in leadership and representation.

               The developments I have outlined are troubling, I think, to everyone in this chamber, and they remind us how much work there is to be done. But the Albanese government is acting. In our development program, we have reinstated a performance target requiring that 80 per cent of Australia's investments effectively address gender equality in implementation. We have also introduced a mandatory requirement that our
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ODA" rel="nofollow">
                ODA
               </a>
               investments over $3 million have a gender equality objective. And, in 2022-23, we will provide $65 million through the Gender Equality Fund to respond to the needs, interests and rights of diverse women and girls, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region. We have a steadfast commitment to advancing gender equality and the human rights of women and girls at home, in our region and globally. As I've said before, we take the world as it is, but we have to work to shape it for the better.
