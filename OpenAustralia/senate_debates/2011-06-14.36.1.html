               Thank you,
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
                Mr President
               </a>
               . This government has always been clear about the fact that, when we introduce a carbon price, we will provide assistance for Australian households. We on this side of the chamber recognise that those on fixed incomes will need extra assistance as Australia transitions to a low-pollution economy. We have been clear when it comes to Australian pensioners that we will look after them, and our record backs this up. This government has delivered a record rise in the pension, reflecting Labor values and Labor priorities. We understand that pensioners need the government's support, and they will get it.
              </p>
              <p>
               This puts us on the other side of the debate from the opposition, because the opposition has made clear in recent days that, when it comes to pensioners, the opposition is determined to ensure that any increase in assistance to pensioners that the government delivers through its carbon package will be clawed back by Mr Abbott and the opposition. It is the great pension clawback. Quite clearly those on the other side do not have the same regard for people on fixed incomes that the government has and has demonstrated. Unlike those opposite, we will ensure that the moneys paid by the big polluters go to Australian households and to those that need it most.

                  The answer is no. The reality is that the Australian people have not seen a credible alternative from this opposition. What we do know is that this is an opposition that is hard-wired to oppose regardless of the consequences. We know from what Senator Joyce has said that the opposition is intent on not only repealing a carbon price but also repealing any assistance that goes with it.

                  But it is interesting to see that not everyone in the opposition party room thinks this is such a great idea. A senior Liberal was reported in the

                    Isn't it interesting? Mr Abbott's strategy of opposing everything some of those on the other side—and I see a few heads bow, deciding to understand the consequences of that—

                        , I ask a further supplementary question. Again I thank the minister for that answer. I ask further: can the minister outline to the Senate the importance of ensuring that climate change policies are fiscally responsible? What threats, if any, are there to a fiscally responsible approach to climate change?

                         The threats to a fiscally responsible approach, whether it is on climate change or on the budget, lie among those opposite, because the reality is that those opposite are hard-wired to oppose regardless of the consequences for Australian pensioners and regardless of the consequences for the federal budget. It is interesting that Mr Abbott's fiscal recklessness is becoming so obvious that even his own team are starting to complain about it. We know that Senator Minchin himself has raised concerns in the party room, which have been reported publicly, about the importance of the opposition being fiscally responsible and the problems with Mr Abbott's response of opposing everything, including budget savings measures. There is also the coalition MP who said:

                        <p class="italic">
