I am presuming we do not have opposition consent for the amendments, as we did not the last time I raised them. What is it exactly about Australian security agencies that should render them entirely immune to freedom of information that does not apply, for example, to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA" rel="nofollow">

          I indicate that, as Senator Ludlam has anticipated, the opposition does not support the Greens amendments. It has been a well-established principle in this country that matters of national security, and like matters, are well within the appropriate exclusions from the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOI" rel="nofollow">
           FOI
          </a>
          regime and that we have other mechanisms, in particular the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Joint_Committee_on_Intelligence_and_Security" rel="nofollow">
           Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security
          </a>
          , the Office of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and recently, as a result of an initiative of the opposition in fact, the independent review of antiterrorism laws. There is a suite of safeguards which, in the opposition’s view, provide appropriate and searching oversight of the performance of national security agencies and which make it appropriate that they do not fall within the FOI regime.

           Thank you both. In concurrence with the remarks of the opposition and in addition, the legislation of course does not change the status of intelligence agencies, which are now excluded from the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOI" rel="nofollow">
            FOI
           </a>
           Act. I also remind the Senate that the ALRC open government report recommended that the intelligence agencies should remain wholly excluded from the operation of the act. In its reasons the review observed that, if intelligence agencies were subject to the FOI Act, ‘the vast majority ... of these documents would be exempt ...’
          </p>
          <p>
           In answer to your specific question, the nature of the functions of the intelligence agencies is such that those functions would be compromised by the public dissemination of that information. These functions cannot be carried out with the same level of transparency ordinarily expected of administrative action. For those reasons and the reasons articulated by Senator Brandis, we would not agree with the amendment.

            I do not propose to tie us up, but it appears that I am simply not being heard. We are not proposing to lift the ability of these agencies to continue to apply for public interest immunity on grounds of issues like national secrecy, operational security and so on. We are not proposing to lift those exemptions. What we are objecting to is the simple throwing of a shroud of invisibility over the agencies, giving them immunity from the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOI" rel="nofollow">
             FOI
            </a>
            Act. I would put the question one more time, unless you simply do not intend to answer it: what is different about Australian security agencies? Why should the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_Information_Act" rel="nofollow">
             Freedom of Information Act
            </a>
            apply to agencies in comparable democracies but not in Australia? If you do not have any answer to that question, I will simply put the amendments and we will move through.
