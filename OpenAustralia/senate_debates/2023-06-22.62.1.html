       </p>
       <p>
        The reason the coalition is moving this substantive amendment is so that for a period of three years from royal assent the government must publish details of key metrics of social harm within all the former cashless debit card sites, including, but not limited to, rates of violent crime, presentations to emergency departments and ambulance call-outs reported with incidents of domestic violence. In the absence of having these sorts of measures, how on earth can the government measure the success or otherwise of their decisions? We think that, as soon as practicable after the end of each reporting period, the minister must prepare a report on the social effects of the cessation of the cashless welfare arrangements in each of the program areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        If they don't do this, this is just another action of the government in not being transparent. This is an opaque government, unless, of course, they are prepared to support this reasonable amendment. These are the very issues that we were seeking to avoid by the introduction of the cashless debit card. The removal of the cashless debit card has already seen a significant increase in these kinds of harmful behaviours, and we call on the government to support us not only in the interest of transparency but also, most importantly, in the interest of people in the communities that this impacts.

         I outlined in the second reading debate the government's reasons for opposing this amendment. I know that the opposition will continue to pursue this amendment. To operationalise it would mean a waste of Commonwealth government resources and an attempt to turn the government's attention away from what really works, and I urge the Senate to oppose the amendment.

          will not be supporting this amendment. We are absolutely in support of having really good evaluation and really good data, and the data that is available so far on compulsory income management shows that it doesn't work. The data that has been proposed in this amendment was a very biased set of data. It totally ignores any of the value of removing compulsory income managementâ€”removing the cashless debit card. There is research that is underway, looking at the evaluation of the cashless debit card. I would absolutely like to see more data, but this amendment doesn't capture what is needed in terms of evaluation of compulsory income management.

           I will speak very briefly to this amendment. It was an amendment I circulated. I think it's absolutely shocking and disgraceful that Senator Rice would say that and the Greens would vote against this amendment, when the government has promised services in these communities. They've put money aside, they've promised wraparound services, and this amendment would hold the government to account and make sure those services are actually doing what the government promised it would do for those communities. Quite frankly, it's too late now to judge the failure of removing the cashless debit card. It's too late to judge that, because we've already heard, on the ground, the negative impacts of removing the cashless debit card. But, at the very least, surely the Greens could hold the government to account.

             This amendment would insert a sunset clause into this legislation, which would fulfil the Labor Party's policy of ending compulsory income management. Labor went to the election saying that they were committed to an end to compulsory income management. As I noted in my second reading speech, we had just before the election the opposition spokesperson and now the Minister for

             Ms Burney then said:

             Labor's fundamental position is that we do not believe in mandatory income management.
            </p>
            <p>
             When the government came to power, and they said they were doing consultation on compulsory income management, they actually set up a time line as to how long that consultation period would be. It was 18 months, which led us initially to put the sunset clause at the end of the 18-month period, giving you plenty of time to do your consultation, which would have put it at 24 March next year, 2024.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have since amended this amendment to actually add an extra year just to give you that extra time, and I understand that Senator Pocock is going to be in a position to support this amendment just to give you an extra year to fulfil that commitment of ending the dangerous racist policy of compulsory income management. It is the least you can do. I do not buy that, because you are doing consultation, you can't commit to a sunset clause. I was willing to engage on whatever type of sunset clause you might be interested in, given that we know that compulsory income management is a failed policy. It needs to end, but unfortunately the government was not willing to engage. They have not been willing to tell me, if 2024 or 2025 isn't an appropriate time for a sunset clause, when is an appropriate time. We need to have an end to compulsory income management. This amendment would put a very reasonable time frame on allowing that to occur.

              The government won't be supporting this amendment. The future of income management is and will be the subject of genuine and ongoing consultation with affected communities, individuals and experts in the field. Adoption of the amendment would undermine that process. Decisions will not be made until they can be informed by the outcomes of that consultation. Introducing a sunset date creates a series of additional risks. Arrangements to cease mandatory income management need to be measured and tailored to support communities and ensure no-one is left behind.

                These amendments will improve a bad bill. They won't make it good enough for us to vote for it, but they will improve it.

                Item (2) introduces a requirement to report on the costs of the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SmartCard" rel="nofollow">
                 SmartCard
                </a>
                scheme. Item (3) requires a review by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rightsâ€”the first one within a year and, subsequently, a review every three years. We know that this won't stop the worst harms of the bill, and we would absolutely seek to do that if we could, but at least this review process will provide some accountability. Item (4) requires a review by the Senate community affairs committee if and when the minister makes a legislative instrument expanding either the BasicsCard or the SmartCard. One of the key concerns that we have with this legislation is that it expands the minister's power in a dangerous way, so I hope that all of these amendments will be supported by the Senate.

The minister provided a response to the committee on 18 April 2023. Further, the instruments made under this bill are disallowable by both chambers of this parliament, which will provide plenty of opportunity for scrutiny and debate.

                    My final amendment inserts an exit clause. For people who are caught up in compulsory income management that's been forced upon them against their will, this exit clause would allow them to make a case that their mental, physical or emotional wellbeing is at risk by being subject to compulsory income management and so they are able to exit the framework. Under the old cashless debit card, there was an exit clause. It was very hard to do, but at least, if you could show that your physical, mental or emotional wellbeing was at risk, you were able to exit. Under this legislation, that clause doesn't exist. There is not even an exit clause for people who are being harmed by compulsory income management. Again, this is a very reasonable measure that I think should have the support of everybody in this place.

                     The government will not be supporting this amendment. However, I want to be very clear and considered on the reasons why. The provisions that Senator Rice referred to in the current legislation continue to operate. I note that the drafting of this amendment mirrors the legislation previously in place under the cashless debit card, which I believe was an exit process that was criticised for lengthy delays at the time by the

                     The current consultation underway on the future of income management is listening to individuals and communities about the broader questions around income management but also about this very issue. Decisions we take about this matter will be informed by those consultations. The government will not support amendments that would see vulnerable people transitioned off this program in droves without much-needed support, or experiencing lengthy delays while these matters are dealt with.
