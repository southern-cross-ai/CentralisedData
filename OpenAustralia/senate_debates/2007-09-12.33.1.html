        My question is to Senator Ellison, the Minister representing the Minister for Ageing. Can the minister confirm that Mr Graeme Menere, who runs
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belvedere_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Belvedere Park
        </a>
        Nursing Home, previously operated Kenilworth Nursing Home? Wasn’t Kenilworth labelled the worst nursing home in Australia in 2000 by the then Minister for Ageing, Mrs Bishop, when it was shut down for failing to properly care for residents? At the time, didn’t the government give Mr Menere a reprieve on Belvedere Park, which had repeatedly failed to meet care standards, putting residents at serious risk through 1998, 1999 and 2000? Wasn’t it revealed at the time that Mr Menere had been convicted of stalking one of his staff? Given this history, can the minister explain to residents and their families why Mr Menere remains a part-owner of Belvedere Park despite his appalling record of failing to provide proper care for elderly residents?

         I can confirm that Mr Graeme Menere was one of a number of key personnel in Neviskia Pty Ltd, the approved provider for Kenilworth nursing home. Kenilworth nursing home was a home of continuing concern due to certification issues. The conduct of Mr Menere and the approved provider’s continued noncompliance with accreditation standards was of concern. Of course the department imposed sanctions in relation to a number of issues relating to residents in March and September 2000. These decisions, however, were set aside by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAT" rel="nofollow">
          AAT
         </a>
         in December 2000. Kenilworth nursing home was not accredited by 31 December 2000. As a result of this, the approved provider ceased to be eligible for Commonwealth subsidies in relation to Kenilworth from 1 January 2001.
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to Mr Graeme Menere, I understand that he was convicted of an indictable offence in May 1998. Amendments to the Aged Care Act 1997, which commenced in January 2001, make it an offence for a person who has been convicted of an indictable offence to be one of the key personnel of an approved provider. I believe that one of the reasons that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health_and_Ageing" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Health and Ageing
         </a>
         had imposed sanctions revoking the approved provider status of Saitta Pty Ltd—and this is in relation to the Belvedere home—was because it believed that a disqualified individual, Mr Graeme Menere, was involved in making executive decisions on behalf of the company.

          , I ask a supplementary question. How can residents and families have any faith in the government’s aged care system when Mr Menere won an appeal in the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAT" rel="nofollow">
           AAT
          </a>
          staying the government’s attempts to close the facility? Doesn’t this leave open the possibility, as claimed by Mr Menere, that the nursing home may reopen? Eleven years after introducing its new aged care system, why hasn’t the government ensured that vulnerable, frail Australians are safe from Mr Graeme Menere?

           As I mentioned, in relation to this particular matter there was a conviction of this gentleman—an indictable matter, and the law was changed to make it an offence for a person who has been convicted of an indictable offence to be one of the key personnel. This matter is currently being dealt with—as I have outlined in the previous answer that I gave to the Senate. In relation to the decision made by the department some time ago, that decision was dealt with by the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAT" rel="nofollow">
            AAT
           </a>
           —an independent tribunal. We cannot interfere with the tribunal’s decision; that decision is made independently. But I can assure you that the situation at Belvedere, and the involvement of this man, is being taken very seriously.
