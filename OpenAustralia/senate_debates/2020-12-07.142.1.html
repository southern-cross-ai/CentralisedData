           The Australian social security system is a non-contributory, residence based program designed primarily to support Australian citizens and permanent residents. There has always been an expectation that temporary visa holders are able to support themselves while in Australia. Temporary visa holders who are unable to support themselves under these arrangements are strongly encouraged to return home. Most temporary visa holders with work rights were given access to their superannuation until 1 July 2020 to help support themselves. The government has provided $13 million to the

           to deliver emergency relief support, which is helping more than 50,000 temporary migrants. Those on temporary visas who are experiencing domestic and family violence are able to access existing national services that received extra Commonwealth funding, including 1800RESPECT, specialised family violence services and the trafficked people program.

              The opposition will be supporting section (a) of this motion, but in relation to section (b) we can't, and I would ask that the question be put on the parts separately. This is a point I've raised a number of times in this place. This part of the program is meant to be for straightforward and non-controversial items that don't require debate. In a party of government, when there is a section which calls for change that involves a considerable amount of money, we go through our own processes. It won't be determined by a Greens motion in this place, and it is not the appropriate place to do that. This is something where debate should be allowed and where there is discussion. It is not a yes or no question. In the interest of getting through this part of the program, we'll just ask that those questions be put separately.
