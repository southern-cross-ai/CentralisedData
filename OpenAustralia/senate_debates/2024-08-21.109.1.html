        Honourable senators: 'Wiradjuri'.
       </p>
       <p>
        I question whether it's 'Wiradjuri' or 'Wiradyuri'. It's actually spelt differently, so I'm just putting that on the record. That is including in relation to the issues associated with their section 10 application against Regis's McPhillamys Gold Project. If she has not met directly with them, can you let us know who has met with them on behalf of the government and on what date or dates?

         Thank you for the question. I understand that your question relates to the decision recently taken under the ATSIHP Act by Minister Plibersek in relation to a project in the vicinity of Orange, and it's in response, as you say, to information provided to her by a very, very large number of documents.

             I understand that the senator is seeking information about the approach taken by the minister in considering the application, and I'm advised that she carefully considered thousands of pages of documentation. That is the legal obligation of the minister, of course. In these matters and all of the matters that come before Minister Plibersek, she has made it very clear that her first responsibility is to apply the law and to do so in ways that produce sound decisions. I think that members on all sides of this chamber appreciate that Minister Plibersek exercises all the care and diligence that you would expect when applications—legal applications—are put before her.

               Minister, in your briefing notes there—following this news breaking last Friday, the lead applicant, Nyree Reynolds, said:

              <p class="italic">
               … more than often, we get told our knowledge isn't traditional enough, and we make things up.
              </p>
              <p>
               Is it in your briefings whether the minister did any due diligence to establish that none of the claims in the application were confected or fabricated, given it was done by the Environmental Defenders Office?

                (—) (): I reject, actually, the premise of your question. As I indicated in my answer to your primary question, Minister Plibersek of course conducts all diligence necessary to make decisions when matters are before her, and, in doing so, she of course relies on the advice of her department, which is exactly the practice that would have been in place when ministers took similar decisions in your government—the government that the coalition was part of. The point that I have made in these questions earlier in the week is that this decision is very similar to a section 10 decision that was made by former minister Ley when she was the environment minister. Former minister Ley made a decision in relation to the same act, in relation to the same legislation, that has been in place since the 1980s in relation to cultural heritage in the central west.

                                    Thank you to Senator Davey for rephrasing her question. I can say this: the minister took evidence from a number of groups, including of course the Orange Local Aboriginal Land Council and the Wiradyuri Traditional Owners Central West Aboriginal Corporation. I am aware that evidence was provided by at least both of those groups. The minister's obligations in all matters before her are to observe the law, and, as she has made clear on many occasions in relation to many matters, she is diligent in her approach to those issues. The minister has always considered that her first obligation is to take these decisions in a way that produces a sound legal decision, and I am sure that she has done so on this occasion also.
