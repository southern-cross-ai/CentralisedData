         Thanks, Senator Bilyk. I know you're a very strong supporter of the international education industry in your home state of Tasmania and right around the country. A strong international education sector is an important contributor to the Australian economy. It's in fact the biggest export that we don't dig out of the ground. But of course this industry was absolutely smashed by COVID. In 2019 international education contributed over $40 billion to the Australian economy and supported over 250,000 jobs. The pandemic saw that fall to $20.8 billion in 2021-22, so it nearly halved.
        </p>
        <p>
         International education has recently returned to being Australia's fourth biggest export industry, now worth $25.5 billion, but obviously there's still a very large gap to where we were before COVID-19 came along. International education also plays a role in filling Australia's skill needs, with high-quality graduates trained to Australian standards. Our government's work to reduce the visa backlog—another mess we inherited from the former government—and increase post-study work rights will help attract the best and brightest to Australian shores.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_students" rel="nofollow">
          International students
         </a>
         are starting to come back and that's a very good thing, but there is a lot more work to be done here. That's why the work that the Minister for Education Jason Clare has done, and the Prime Minister is doing in India right now, is so important.
        </p>
        <p>
         International education directly progresses Australia's interests in a stable and prosperous future for our region. The deep and enduring connections that result from international students studying and living in Australia brings more than revenue; it builds us friends in the region and beyond. International students help to strengthen Australia's international relationships. They are an invaluable part of Australian communities, bringing new perspectives, ideas and skills to enrich the cultural fabric of our society. Education plays a key role in building cultural diversity and people-to-people links around the world. It also ensures regional stability. They're some of the many reasons why our government is supporting it.

            Yes, I can, Senator Bilyk. As you would be aware, our government takes the relationship between Australia and India very seriously and that is a strong and important relationship for our future. I know that's certainly the case in my own portfolio of agriculture. The recently signed free trade agreement with India opens lots of new markets for agricultural producers in India, but I think that education is also a big part of the reason why this relationship is continuing to grow.

            will be the first overseas university approved to build a campus in India is proof of the strength of our relationship, and I'm sure all Victorian senators, in particular, are very proud of that.

              Thank you, Senate Ciccone. The Minister for Education's visit last week to sign the new mutual recognition agreement is further proof of that. It delivers an immediate benefit to the hundreds of thousands of Indians with Australian qualifications and to anyone with Australian and Indian qualifications that wants to continue their higher education. This agreement was the broadest that India has signed with another country.

                <p>
                 Thank you Senator Bilyk. I will just clear my throat as Senator Farrell is wont to do. Our relationship with India presents massive opportunities for Australia, both for our economy and for the people with the links it generates.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The Indian government has a plan to increase its higher education enrolments to 50 per cent of young people by 2035. The quality of our universities and the strength of our relationship has led India to ask for our help in getting this huge undertaking done. Following recent visits, we will see more Australian education providers established in India.
