          It is with great pleasure that I ask the first question for the government today to the Minister representing the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, Senator Scullion. Can the minister update the Senate on how the coalition government is creating jobs and stimulating economic growth through its record investment in infrastructure?

           I certainly can. This year's budget continues the coalition government's record investment in nation-building infrastructure projects, in roads, in rail and in airports. These projects are job-creating superchargers to the economy. We're going to take Australians off the misery of welfare and into the dignity of work.
          </p>
          <p>
           The coalition government is investing $75 billion in a decade-long pipeline of transport infrastructure. Inland Rail and the Western Sydney Airport are the sorts of nation-changing, family-opportunity-providing infrastructure projects that have not been attempted before. These new investments will collectively support around 50,000 direct and indirect jobs, particularly in regional and rural areas. People in regional and remote areas are going to be beneficiaries of the $3.5 billion Roads of Strategic Importance initiative, which is going to lift productivity on our regional freight roads. We're also investing an additional $160 million in the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outback_Way" rel="nofollow">
            Outback Way
           </a>
           , making it a total commitment of $330 million to the project. This is a decade-long pipeline of investment, giving certainty to businesses. They know what they're looking forward to. With this investment, the economy has created over 100,000 jobs in the last year. That's 1,100 jobs a day, 1,100 more families with a principal breadwinner.
          </p>
          <p>
           To do this, of course, and as I indicated yesterday, we have to get the budget back under control. The budget is returning to surplus next year. It's taken us five years to do it, just as the Howard government had to contend with Labor mess before we saw unprecedented economic growth. This government is getting the budget under control. As we continue to strengthen our budget position, we can invest in Australian families.

              for that question and I acknowledge what a strong advocate he's been for these important infrastructure projects. They are going to relieve congestion, grow the region and connect businesses—something that those opposite may not understand and clearly haven't done anything about in the past. We're investing $15.5 billion in funding transport infrastructure projects in Queensland and $5.2 billion in major projects in Queensland, including $1 billion for the upgrade of two sections of the M1 Pacific Motorway, from

                 The voters in Longman have a very real choice to make in the upcoming by-election. There's only one party you can trust to keep the budget under control. If the budget isn't under control, you can't make the sorts of investments in infrastructure and job creation that we're making. The Deception Bay Road interchange upgrade, which the people of Longman have been calling for, can be delivered because we've done such a great job of getting the budget under control so we can invest in such important infrastructure projects. The $120 million Commonwealth commitment to a six-lane overpass is going to increase safety, reduce travel times and connect Longman with other parts of Queensland. It is going to bring prosperity to Longman. This is part of the coalition's record $10 billion commitment to communities along the

                  Bruce Highway

                 . The people of Longman will benefit from the $1.4 billion

                 to Caloundra Road Interchange upgrade. They could never have benefited if the coalition hadn't got the budget under control so they could invest in the people of Longman.
