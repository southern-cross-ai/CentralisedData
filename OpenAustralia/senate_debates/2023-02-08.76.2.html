        My question is to the minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Gallagher. Was the Assistant Treasurer reflecting government policy on interest rates this morning when he said, 'We think that what's already in the system should do the job to ensure that we can dampen down demand'?

              I haven't actually seen the transcript of that interview, but I do understand that the Assistant Treasurer was outlining our government's plan to deliver on cost-of-living relief. He also indicated that the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RBA" rel="nofollow">
               RBA
              </a>
              has a tough job to do and that the RBA is independent—and those statements are correct. The RBA does have a difficult job to do. It is independent of government. It makes decisions based on the information that it has available to it at the time. The government's position reflects that. It is an independent body making decisions on monetary policy in this country. The area where the government have something to do is in making sure that our decision-making, the decisions we make in relation to the budget and others, do not make the job of the

               <p class="italic">
                The Board expects that further increases in interest rates will be needed over the months ahead to ensure that inflation returns to target and that this period of high inflation is only temporary.
               </p>
               <p>
                The Assistant Treasurer said this morning, 'I'm hoping if this is not the last'—he's talking about interest rate rises—'it's near the last of the rate rises.' Minister, why does the Albanese government contradict the RBA?

                 is making decisions about how to deal with the inflation challenge and how to return inflation to more normal levels. It's a challenge not only for the Reserve Bank but for the government as well.

                <p>
                 Of course, the bank needs to make these decisions independent of any influence. We have total and utter trust in them making the decisions that they need to make to ensure that inflation doesn't remain high for longer. And they are saying that they are seeing inflation moderating. The challenge for the government in working with the Reserve Bank and not against it is to make sure that the decisions we take are supportive and work alongside monetary policy and not against it, which is why the decisions we're taking in the budget are informed by that, dealing—

                   The increase in the cash rate to 3.35 per cent, the eighth successive rise under your government, will add more than $10,000 in repayments for the average Australian family with a variable-rate mortgage. With no plan to tackle inflation, a treasurer distracted by writing essays and an assistant treasurer who contradicts the central bank, isn't it the case that Australians will keep paying more under your government?

                    Conveniently, that question left off the fact that there was an interest rate increase during the month of May, when you were in government, and that the highest quarter of inflation growth was in the March quarter last year.

                      And who was in government then? This is an inflation challenge that we inherited. We inherited this challenge. The government has a plan to deal with it. It's to deal with cost-of-living relief, where we don't add to inflation. It's to deal with some of the supply chain problems that we've been seeing as a result of the war in Ukraine and the end of the pandemic. The third thing is to deal with the budget mess that we inherited from you lot and to show spending restraint in some of the decisions that we take in the May budget. So it's incorrect to say that the government doesn't have a plan. We do have a plan. We are implementing the plan, and we look forward to more of that in the budget.
