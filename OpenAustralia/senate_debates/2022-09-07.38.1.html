        I rise today to speak about vaccine injuries and the lack of help from the Albanese Labor government to those injured by the COVID vaccine. I receive many stories of people being injured every day, and they are seeking help. I've been contacted by one constituent whose wife suffered an extreme systemic reaction to her first

        as her condition worsened, and two trips to emergency prior to paralysis episodes from

        . She was then taken by ambulance and admitted to hospital in June 2021. She suffered a brain bleed and brain inflammation. She was subsequently diagnosed with multiple conditions, all attributed to her reaction to AZ. These conditions have lingered for 15 months and have been linked to acute onset lymphoedema and severe hypokalaemia, which have left her with severe permanent disabilities, including an acquired brain injury, and ongoing chronic conditions that need constant care and treatment.

        The couple has provided evidence to the indemnity scheme, including five letters from her GP, hospital admissions, one letter from a medical registrar, another letter from a consultant physician and clinical immunologist, a letter from another immunologist, another letter from a neurologist, another letter from a haematologist and another letter from a neurologist. Despite all of that evidence and these experts saying that her injury was caused by the vaccine, the indemnity scheme has refused her claim. It's not a lot; it's only $20,000 topped out. Yet this couple is suffering severely. I'm calling on the Albanese Labor government and the health minister, as well as the Minister for
