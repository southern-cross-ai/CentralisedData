         The answer to the honourable senator’s question is as follows:

        <p class="italic">
         (3) Yes, together with a hospital-based cyclotron.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) This question should be directed to the Minister for Health.

         (5) ANSTO based its decision to commence production of

        <p class="italic">
         (6) No.

         (7) This question should be raised with the Department of Health and Ageing..

         (8) No.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (10) By 2007, demand for PET scans was growing steadily. Much of the FDG used in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
          NSW
         </a>
         was sourced from Melbourne (although one Sydney hospital had its own cyclotron, which at that time only provided for its own needs). Given the short half-life of FDG and increasing demand for this important diagnostic agent, supply from other Australian cities was posing transportation challenges. The ANSTO Board therefore decided to approve the investment to create a subsidiary, PETNet Solutions Australia, for the purpose of producing FDG.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (11) Nothing.
