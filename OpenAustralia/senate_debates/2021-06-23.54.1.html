        My question is to the Minister for Women, Senator Payne. Can the minister please outline what the Liberals and Nationals in government are doing to support more women into leadership positions and further close the gender pay gap that Labor is always worried about, including through initiatives in the Women's Budget Statement?

          I thank Senator Davey for her question. The improvement of women's economic security and supporting more women into leadership positions are key priorities for the Morrison government. The 2021-22 Women's Budget Statement includes a $38.3 million expansion, for example, of the successful Women's Leadership and
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_Program" rel="nofollow">
           Development Program
          </a>
          that is funding innovative projects across Australia that support women into leadership roles, including—as I know Senator Davey recognises the importance of—in regional Australia. In the Morrison-Joyce cabinet, seven women hold cabinet positions, the highest number ever, including three of my colleagues here in the Senate, sitting with me today. Four additional positions in the ministry or the assistant ministry are also held by women. Those cabinet and ministry members are all members of the cabinet task force on women's safety and economic security.
         </p>
         <p>
          We also support women's leadership in the public sector, including a 50 per cent target for women on Australian government board positions, and we are on track to meet those commitments. Our Women's Budget Statement also includes a $17 million investment to support world-class sporting events and development programs for women and girls in both football and basketball. We know that sport can be greatly beneficial to women's leadership—for players, for administrators, for coaches and for volunteers. We warmly welcome the

          , I note, importantly, the gender pay gap is at a record low level of 13.4 per cent, and we are committed to driving that even lower. I particularly want to welcome the leadership of the director of the Workplace Gender Equality Agency,

                Senator Davey's question is a very important and timely one. We know that gender diversity on boards, for example, contributes to more effective and innovative decision-making and outcomes. In December of 2020 women held a record 49.5 per cent of Australian government board positions. We have strategies in place to meet the target of 50 per cent, and I'm personally committed to continuing to increase gender diversity and to reach that target.

               <p>
                As a coalition government we've appointed a number of women to senior leadership positions, including the outgoing secretary of my own department, Frances Adamson. Secretary Adamson has done an exceptional job as the secretary of the

                </a>
                . I want to acknowledge her leadership, her own commitment to diversity. What she has brought to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the change that she has overseen in the department over the 36 years of her role in
