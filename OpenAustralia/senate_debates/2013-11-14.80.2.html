           In answer to Senator Wong's interjection—no, I do not because, like all of the Australian people, we are completely aware of the fundamental policy failures of the former government in this particular area. I remind the senator, because she clearly is not aware of the facts, that there is currently a Labor legacy caseload of over 30,000 people who arrived under the former government and who are currently onshore and not in detention centres. Under the former government the detention centre capacity became exhausted—

            : this is an issue of relevance. The minister was asked a very specific question about current process, procedure and administration and at no point, with almost half the time gone, has the minister attempted to answer the question. This is identical to yesterday, when they refused to provide any answer at all and in fact said, 'We intend to not answer a question.' So, Mr President, I ask you to draw the attention of the minister to the question and invite her to answer it.

              As I was saying, this government is working calmly, methodically and practically—unlike the former government—to stop the boats. We had a Labor caseload legacy of in excess of 30,000 people who are currently onshore, a caseload that the former government did not advise the Australian people they did not begin processing—

                    In relation to the over 30,000 people that the former government failed to process, this government has been up-front and stated to the Australian people that we have restored temporary protection visas. In relation to the minister's question about what we will be doing in relation to people who come to Australia, perhaps the minister needs to read our policy.
