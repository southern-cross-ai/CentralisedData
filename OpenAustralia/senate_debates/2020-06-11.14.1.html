        Parents are able to make a claim for paid parental leave up to three months before the expected date of birth or adoption. The bill originally had a provision for prebirth claiming between 1 April 2020 and 1 July 2020 to ensure the claims could be made in the three months leading up to the commencement date. Due to COVID-19 and the change to the parliamentary sitting schedule, it was not possible to have this bill pass the parliament before 1 April. The start date of the changes has not moved from 1 July; however, prebirth claims will also only be possible from 1 July 2020 instead of the intended date of 1 April 2020.

         The opposition supports this amendment because we understand the need to change the start date in terms of those applications. However, we think it's unfortunate that the parliament was unable to sit earlier to deal with this legislation, as we called to have happen.

         I have a question for the government. I note this is relevant to our own second reading amendment as well as the amendments to be moved by the

             How do you calculate the number of people that will get it under the existing circumstances? How do you forecast it using the usual formula? At which point does that lag effect come into account? Just tell me how you work it out.

               When do you expect the impact of that eligibility to first start impacting? Clearly people had COVID job losses as early as March, and they could have become pregnant before then or at any time into the future. They might have a child in nine months time from now but have had that period of time impacted by coronavirus in terms of their employment. Can you just give me an overview of how you intend to calculate that noting that lag effect?

                 In that context, if you've got employment data from 12 March and you'll have employment data for every month after and your usual method of calculating how many people are going to claim paid parental leave is based on population statistics, why is it that you're saying in that lag effect you can't calculate that until next year? That doesn't really make sense to me.

                     Is this the case for all kinds of workforce participation issues in terms of estimates of who's working and how much work people are currently doing that you don't know or is there something intrinsic to—I don't know—being an expectant parent and families that make this particularly difficult?

                         So it's okay to rely on data for the purposes of population growth statistics, but you're unable to translate the impact of that work test because it goes over 13 months. Do you have an indication of how many people who might be about to commence paid parental leave in the next couple of months would already have been impacted in terms of not meeting that work test? I've certainly been contacted by constituents. That is not a 13-month period which is contingent on how much the economy picks up or doesn't pick up and therefore impacts on how much of the work test impacts on your work test modelling. What is the current impact, as of now, in terms of those who would otherwise have been receiving

                           With respect, Minister Cash, I don't understand the reference to 13 months. We do understand that eligibility is forecast over a 13-month period, but we certainly know of families that are looking ahead now to a couple of months time, where they know they have lost their eligibility because they have lost work recently and therefore they don't meet the 10 out of 13 months eligibility, I think it is, for that work test. I really don't understand why you don't have any indication of the data that might give you an indication of the number of people affected. You've said that the data hasn't come in. But is that data calculated on general unemployment data and extrapolated? How do you usually calculate how many people you expect to be receiving it? Are you really saying that you don't calculate that for another 13 months time in the past? If, as you said, you can't calculate it for another year, that's not an estimate of how many people are about to receive it, which clearly the government needs to be able to do.

However, because this is an unprecedented event, any such estimate may not be a correct estimate, so at this point in time it is unable to be undertaken, because the reason for not working is not yet known. So, in the normal course of events—you are right—it would be based on previous data. But because of the nature of the unprecedented event, this has not yet been able to be done.

                             In that case, for all your workforce participation issues—clearly we know that coronavirus has had an unprecedented impact on workforce participation. We know it's had an unprecedented impact in particular on women's workforce participation, and even the government has been able to acknowledge to some extent that that's an issue. Have you not made any attempt yet to quantify what that impact actually looks like and to translate it into, frankly, all the various eligibility thresholds, whether it's for jobseeker payments or situations where people change their family tax benefit status because they have lost work and therefore they've lost income? Clearly the government has to be grappling with these issues now to be able to look at the debt and the impact of the policy decisions and the current economic crisis on households and the Australian economy?

Again, it goes to the information I have already provided—that in terms of paid parental leave we're only at the very early stages of the impact. As I've said to you, in the normal course of events the estimation would be able to be done, but because of the unprecedented nature of the event and the fact that we're only in the early stages of it, this has not yet been undertaken.

That is happening to them here and now, and you are trying to tell me that this government has no idea how many of these families are being impacted by the loss of employment because of COVID-19, in terms of their eligibility for paid parental leave?

                                      Again, the answer is: yes, we know how many people are claiming JobKeeper, and Treasury is able to work out that estimate, but, in relation to the specifics of your question, the department will not have that information until people formally lodge that claim.

                                       Why did the government include JobKeeper as a means to acquitting the requirements of the work test, noting that many of those people on JobKeeper might be doing a little bit of work or might be doing no work? Why is it that the government won't extend the same right to acquit the paid parental leave workforce participation requirements for people who now find themselves on the jobseeker payment or who find themselves dependent on their partner because they don't meet the income thresholds to be eligible for jobseeker payments?

                                        Senator Pratt, I'm advised that the rationale behind it was that JobKeeper is all about maintaining that important connection with employment, and that is what paid parental leave is. That is the rationale for utilising JobKeeper.

                                         Okay. So JobKeeper is relevant in the sense that you want to maintain that workforce participation connection using JobKeeper. But these are women who are about to take a pause from their work, or dads who are about to take a pause from their work, because they're accessing paid parental leave. It is of course an objective to keep parents who have children connected to their employers. Is that not also an important objective for people who have also been dislocated from the workforce but who might be in casual roles?

                                          In response to the question: again, you asked for the rationale in your previous question. The answer to that question was that the rationale was based on the premise of maintaining that connection to employment. In terms of casuals, you'd be aware that casuals who have been in a continuous period of employment with their employer for 12 months or more, based on the definition of the Fair Work Act, are entitled to JobKeeper. As such, there will be some casuals who are afforded the benefit of this rationale.

                                             If that's the case, how is it that JobKeeper keeps those requirements? Surely all you need to do is to capture those people within a JobKeeper payment so that they do have workforce participation which would enable them to do that?

                                               Thank you, Minister Cash. What advice would you give to the families who had otherwise banked on having this income because they were going to meet the work test? They've lost their jobs recently, they're about to have a baby and many of these families are now looking at needing to draw down on superannuation because they've lost employment. What advice would you give these families who are now managing an insecure economic future at the same time as expecting a baby?

                                                   amendment goes to this very issue. In fact, our amendment would fix the problem that we've been discussing. As has been articulated, if you lost your job because of COVID, but you weren't eligible for JobKeeper, for whatever reason, now you're also not eligible for paid parental leave. We think that's unfair and it's very easily fixed. Amendments (1) and (2) on sheet 8927, which I will move provide that, if through no fault of your own you've lost your job because of COVID-19 but you had expected to otherwise remain in employment and be eligible for

                                                   Importantly for the number-crunchers over there, that won't increase the budget draw because those people were projected to be eligible for PPL anyway. The whole lengthy discussion we've just had actually boils down to the fact that those projections won't have changed. You're basing it on population projections, so those projections will be the same. The same people who would have been entitled to PPL when their employer existed but who, unfortunately, because of coronavirus now have no work will miss out. It's an easy fix, and it won't have any budget implications, so I am interested in knowing why the government isn't supporting this amendment, since it won't cost you any more than it otherwise would. Could you answer that, Minister, before we deal with the amendments?

                                                      Senator Waters, I will respond to the amendments that you've moved. You would be aware that, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the government moved quickly to introduce amendments to the Paid Parental Leave Act to allow the time that people spend on the JobKeeper payment to count towards the paid parental leave work test, as I have described in responding to questions from Senator Pratt. The proposed amendment that you have moved has the potential to allow people with a non-genuine claim to be eligible for paid parental leave—for example, people who may have already been planning to leave work irrespective of the impact of COVID-19. The proposed amendment that you have moved would also increase the evidence required for submitting a claim for paid parental leave, adding to the administrative burden including for employers who may be called on to speculate about the work intention of claimants and what amount of work they would have asked claimants to do, but for the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. There would be no way for Services Australia to independently verify these claims.
                                                     </p>

                                                      The amendments that you have moved also add a new provision that would allow the secretary to determine that a person would have met the paid parental leave work test if it were not for the impact of an emergency services event. The amendment also allows the minister to declare an event to be such an event and to declare the coronavirus outbreak an emergency circumstances event. In these situations, a person would be deemed to be working the hours they would have been working pre the COVID-19 impacts. The approach is similar to that currently applied to people who do not meet the work test due to a pregnancy related complication or illness, or a premature birth. However, these events are relatively rare and easily verified. The amendments that you have proposed would also require assessments on a significantly greater scale, creating additional administrative burden, including for employers. On that basis, the government will not be supporting the amendments that have now been formally moved by the

                                                       Minister, I want to take you up on a few of those points. Firstly, the claim that there would be non-genuine claims sounds to me a lot like you were just saying women are going to lie. We do hear that from your side of the chamber quite a bit. It's still not okay and it's also not right. I ask you to reconsider whether you really want to assert that women are going to make up the fact that either they are pregnant or they were otherwise going to leave the job or stay on the job, because that's just playing a trope that's very unhelpful and is actually quite dangerous, as I would hope you know.
                                                      </p>
                                                      <p>
                                                       You then talked about speculation on work intention. These people have a contract, so there's no need for speculation on their intention. They are employed. Were it not for COVID, they would be entitled to receive paid parental leave because they are employed. I genuinely don't understand how you think there's some speculation required as to their employment situation or their intention.
                                                      </p>
                                                      <p>
                                                       Lastly, on the point that this would somehow require additional paperwork: these are the same people who otherwise would have been eligible for
                                                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PP" rel="nofollow">

                                                       L. They might now have to put in a different form. It's not like there are going to be additional people. The only thing that has changed is the pandemic. The number of people has not changed. Just their eligibility to get any support from this government is what has changed.

                                                       You noted that you have made JobKeeper count for the purposes of

                                                       eligibility. I'm aware of that, and we welcome that. But there is actually no real reason for you not to also extend PPL eligibility to people who would have been eligible were it not for the pandemic. It gets a bit confusing, but I think people understand the point. It's not their fault that their business has either gone bust or chosen not to offer JobKeeper, or they are not eligible because your government won't extend JobKeeper to the number of people that it should; namely, casuals, people on temporary visas, students—the works.

                                                       In a sense you are hoisted on your own petard. You are trying to use that as an excuse to say they don't deserve help. They do deserve help. I don't accept your premise that women are going to lie about their employment situation or their reproductive health status. I'd like a further response on why you're not simply going to do the right thing here and give people the money they would have otherwise been entitled to.

Thank you for acknowledging that.

In response to that, while the approach is similar to that currently applied for people who do not meet the work test due to a pregnancy-related complication or illness or a premature birth, these events are relatively rare and easily verified. The amendment you have put forward would require assessments on a significantly greater scale, as such creating additional administrative burden, including for employers.

                                                            This discussion has highlighted for me another significant issue in relation to pregnant women meeting the work test. Pregnancy discrimination is, of course, known to happen in Australia. Clearly, if you have a permanent contract and you're employed then you have some protections. However, if you're a casual employee your shifts can suddenly drop off because of that pregnancy discrimination. Has the government done any assessment of the issues around someone meeting the work test when they otherwise would have met it—they're not leaving a job or dropping shifts of their own accord by choice but rather are experiencing pregnancy discrimination and insecure work rights and therefore do not meet the work test?

Because you might simply stop getting shifts rather than—we know that this commonly happens when people are discriminated against at work. I've seen many examples of it, and it's very difficult to mount a discrimination case under those circumstances.

It is fully costed, and it would allow the biological father of a child or the partner of a child's birth mother to make a primary claim for parental leave pay for a child if the child's birth mother does not or is not likely to satisfy the income test at the relevant time.
                                                                </p>

                                                                 As I noted in my speech, there is inequity between two families on the same combined income: they would be eligible if the man were the higher income earner but not eligible if the woman were the higher income earner, which is just unfair. The current rules just don't reflect the realities of modern parenting, with more dads staying at home to care for children. The number of stay-at-home fathers has grown to 80,000 in 2016, based on the latest census data. It is time to move away from models that assume children will be cared for by a primary carer who is the mother. Modern parents don't define themselves in this way, and it's time the legislation doesn't either. Minister, do you concede that the rule which unfairly penalises high-income earning mums and stay-at-home dads by tying eligibility to the birth mother is a discriminatory and sexist rule?

The time-critical nature of this bill, which, as you are aware, provides critical flexibility in paid parental leave, precludes the government from considering other changes to the scheme at this time. Any changes to the means-testing arrangements would require consultation and investigation to ensure we strike the right balance.

The proposed amendment that you have moved on behalf of Centre Alliance seeks to enable biological fathers or the partner of the birth mother to claim paid parental leave where the mother does not satisfy the paid parental leave income test. This would have the effect of enabling partners of high-income mothers—that is, above $150,000—to access paid parental leave, subject to the partner meeting the income and work tests.

Whilst we remain open to discussion about further opportunities for improvement, our critical and immediate concern is delivering on the commitment for increased flexibility that has been widely supported.

                                                                   </p>

Any changes to the means-testing arrangements would require consultation and investigation to ensure we strike the right balance. I also stated that whilst we remain open to discussion about further opportunities for improvement—in answer to the question that you have just put—our immediate concern is delivering on the commitment for increased flexibility that has been widely supported.
