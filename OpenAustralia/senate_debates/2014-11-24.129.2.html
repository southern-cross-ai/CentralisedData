          I understand that Senate resources are limited in relation to select committees. We acknowledge that. And I understand that at least one other select committee will need to be wound up in order for this to have the full amount of resources. We accept that that is the case. The worst case is that this will operate on limited resources until March, when the inquiry into the activities of the Queensland government is concluded. Furthermore, if Senator Day is appointed chairman of the committee, he has suggested he may consider relinquishing his fees as chairman to contribute to the committee's costs.

             The government supports the proposition that the commencement of the substantive work of the committee be delayed. We think that is a good approach, given the resources of the Department of the Senate. But I think it is also appropriate to acknowledge that, at the tail end of the last Senate, the opposition sought to establish a number of select committees—in effect, to bind the incoming Senate. We are still living with the consequences of those decisions by the opposition before the new Senate came into being. I think it is important that this chamber be mindful of the resources of the Department of the Senate to adequately serve the committees of this place.

                I am very concerned about what is going on here. When this was reported last week, it was put in the paper that the government would support this committee, on condition that the crossbench voted to delete one of the other Senate committees. We cannot have longstanding procedures of the Senate and understandings of the Senate compromised in this way. We simply cannot do that.
