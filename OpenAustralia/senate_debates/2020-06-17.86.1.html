        My question is to the Minister for Aged Care and Senior Australians, Senator Colbeck. Last fortnight it was revealed that just 38 food boxes had been delivered under a program that was intended to provide 36,000 food boxes to older Australians. Who is responsible for this failure, and why did it go so wrong?

         , at the outset, reject completely the premise of the question from Senator Brown. This government, I think quite wisely, made provision to support senior Australians—when there were issues at the supermarkets, when there were issues with senior Australians being able to get out—to be able to access support that they might require. We put in place a range of measures that supported senior Australians to be able to get the services that they required. In fact, I'm pleased that not so many people needed to have emergency food supplies provided to them.
        </p>
        <p>
         But I do know that a number of the other measures that we put in place to assist senior Australians, to provide food, to provide meals, were extremely successful. For example, in some areas the number of people receiving Meals on Wheels services increased by 50 per cent. That was another of the elements that we put in place to assist senior Australians that were having problems getting food. We made provision for what we estimated might be required by senior Australians under that particular program. Senior Australians were freely able to apply for the food boxes. It was a demand-driven process. The fact that we did not need to send out those boxes, I think, shows the success of many of the other measures that we put in place, including the extraordinary additional support that's been provided to senior Australians through programs like Meals on Wheels, who have, as I said, in some places had up to a 50 per cent increase in demand and service provision.

           My first supplementary question is: when did the minister first learn that the program would deliver 0.1 per cent of the food boxes promised to older Australians? Does the minister believe that the program has been a success? If not, what lessons has he learned?

            I don't believe that making provision for something that we think might happen during a pandemic is a failure. In fact, I think the fact that not so many people required that service is a good thing. The fact that the estimate that we made of what the demand might be hasn't been met is a clear demonstration that the number of other services that we put in place to support senior Australians—

                 I'm going to rule on the point of order. The minister is being directly relevant if he's talking about the program about which he was specifically asked. It is not appropriate for a point of order to simply ask me to instruct the minister to answer part of a question or instruct him how to answer a question.

As I said, in some places there has been up to a 50 per cent increase in the number of meals that have been provided through the Meals on Wheels service, and an extra $50 million was provided—

                    Why is this minister incapable of delivering older Australians anything more than empty slogans and unfulfilled promises?
