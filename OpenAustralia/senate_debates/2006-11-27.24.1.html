        My question is to Senator Coonan, the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Can the minister confirm that AusAID took over an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWB" rel="nofollow">
         AWB
        </a>
        Iraq contract on the eve of the invasion of Iraq because of AWB’s concern that they would be left stranded by the outbreak of war? Can the minister confirm that this meant that AusAID endeavoured to finalise internal distribution mechanisms to enable wheat to be delivered to meet urgent food aid requirements in Iraq? Can the minister advise what communications there were between AusAID officials and AWB’s sole agent and exclusive trucking company in Iraq, Alia? Did AusAID report to the Minister for Foreign Affairs or his office about either the pricing of the contract or Alia’s capacity to provide trucking services?

         I thank Senator Hutchins for his question. What I can say about this is that a full ministerial statement and the report of the commission of inquiry is due to be presented in the Senate later today. So I am certainly not going to respond to Senator Hutchins’s invitation to pre-empt the full disclosure that is forthcoming. I certainly do not propose to respond to Senator Hutchins’s question at this time.

          Mr Deputy President, I ask a supplementary question. I hope you will be able to respond to these two, Minister. Can the minister indicate whether AusAID’s involvement in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWB" rel="nofollow">
           AWB
          </a>
          ’s corrupt wheat contract with Iraq was considered by the Cole commission? If not, will the government now establish a new inquiry to ascertain the full extent of AusAID’s involvement in the AWB kickback scandal?

          <p>
           Thank you. I abide by my former answer. I think Senator Hutchins is referring to a comment by Mr Kelvin Thomson. But he has got that wrong, on my information, yet again. AusAID has not contacted nor dealt with Alia. The international partners referred to were the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Food_Program" rel="nofollow">
            World Food Program
           </a>
           and other governments that AusAID contacted to explore food distribution options. The information that I have and that I am prepared to provide to the Senate is that AusAID has never contacted nor dealt with Alia.
