         I indicate to the chamber that there will be some amendments that I will not be proceeding with. I am reading the sense of the chamber that I am going to go down in a screaming heap on a number of my amendments. However, there are a number of broader issues that I still want to canvass and ask the government some questions on and to get certain things on the record for implementation of the bill and also for interpretation of the bill. So I indicate that I will be withdrawing some of our amendments, because I have canvassed the broader issues that some of them relate to and some of them are dependent on other amendments that have already gone down.
        </p>
        <p>
         The CHAIRMAN: It may be easiest if we continue through the running sheet and, as we approach those particular amendments, you indicate them then.
        </p>
        <p>
         I provided the information to the chamber so that people know where I am going with this debate.

         This amendment relates to an environmental biosecurity strategy and action plan, specifically to the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for the Environment taking all reasonable steps to ensure that an environmental biosecurity strategy and action plan is developed and prepared in written form as soon as practicable after the commencement of this act. This is important because it is an essential component and complement to biosecurity laws.
        </p>
        <p>
         We believe that biosecurity strategy and action plans that identify the priorities, targets and actions necessary to achieve national environmental goals are absolutely essential and must complement this process. The guiding principles for the implementation of article 8(h) of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_Biological_Diversity" rel="nofollow">
          Convention on Biological Diversity
         </a>
         emphasise their importance and identify important elements. The proposed biosecurity strategy would encompass and build on existing strategies and address other invasive species categories, such as invertebrates, fungi and pathogens, and prioritise gaps. It is important to note that invertebrates, fungi and pathogens are often left off people's thinking, and we know how important they are. The development and implementation of these plans should manifest a partnership approach and meaningfully involve the community and the environmental sectors. The community has been arguing very strongly to have in place this strategy and an action plan, which is basically an implementation plan. We think these are important amendments, and those have been our reasons for wanting these amendments. I suspect that the government does not support this amendment, but I would like to hear from the government what it intends to do about putting in place a strategy and action plan/implementation plan.

          I am advised by my ministerial colleague that the government will not be supporting your proposed amendment to develop and publish an environmental biosecurity strategy and action plan. It is difficult to isolate environmental biosecurity risks within the overall system, because the system operates to manage all biosecurity risks. Dealing with environmental biosecurity as a separate issue or function may actually act to the detriment of the system as a whole.

           That is where I thought the government would go on this amendment, but I did ask a question about what the government does intend to do. I would like a little bit more detail around that. I am not trying to detain the chamber, but I do want an indication of where the government is going with this process.

             With all due respect, that does not answer the question and neither does the report. I am seeking to know whether the government has this on its agenda, what process of strategy development and implementation planning it is going to be undertaking and, importantly, whether it is going to involve the community. I mean community in the broad sense of the word: industry and the broader community, including environmental organisations.

                   These amendments are about injunctions by interested persons and relate to issues around third-party review and injunction rights. They provide third-party rights for review of decisions to seek injunctions to restrain unlawful activity equivalent to those available under the

                   should improve the quality of decision making and increase accountability. We think it is particularly important that others are able to seek these injunctions and take these actions. As I articulated, we are looking for the equivalent activity that is available under the EPBC Act. Unfortunately, this bill does not provide for that. As I said, the appeal rights are lopsided. We think these are important amendments that deal with very significant issues.

                   This amendment relates to the biosecurity advisory council. It is an issue that both industry and environment groups are particularly interested in. We believe that there is a need for greater ability for the government to seek advice from a process that is outside government and that the government should be putting in place a process that enables them to seek advice from those that are outside the system, from people with a range of expertise in biosecurity issues, from an industry perspective, an expert perspective and an environmental perspective. If the government are not prepared to support this amendment, what are they prepared to do?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The functions of the biosecurity advisory council would include: to promote a coordinated strategic response to biosecurity issues; to promote the shared responsibility in minimising all levels of biosecurity risk; to provide a forum for discussing significant biosecurity issues in relation to meeting Australia's ALOP; to provide policy advice on biosecurity issues to the minister for agriculture and the states and territories; to liaise with the Inspector-General of Biosecurity, which the government has now very significantly put in place; if requested to do so, to provide advice on matters of biosecurity to the minister for agriculture; to engage in public consultation; and any other functions conferred on the council by this act and another law of the Commonwealth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   We think this is a particularly important function. As I said, if the government are not prepared to support this amendment, I would ask them what arrangements they are prepared to put in place that extend the ability for input from such a body of experts in industry, environmental protection or academia and other areas of expertise needed to address biosecurity issues.

                    The government does not support Greens amendment (45), which, as Senator Siewert has outlined, seeks to establish a biosecurity advisory council. The proposed council does not need legislative powers to support its role. It could be established administratively. The department regularly utilises the expertise of consultative committees and groups to provide advice and coordinated approaches to management of biosecurity, including with state and territory governments, scientists, primary producers, farming associations and environmental

                     I note the government said that it could be put in place administratively. I make two points there. We want this in the legislation so that it is permanently there, because the current government may be committed to doing something—and I will seek that commitment in a moment—but it does not bind future governments, and that is our concern. I know there is a bit of difference of opinion between the way we see legislation and the way the government sees legislation; we actually believe there are certain things that need to be embedded in legislation and not left to administration—whether it be purely by a process that is set up, or by a regulation or a delegated instrument; those things actually need to be the legislation. That is why we think this should be in legislation—because it is such an important issue. So I will get that on the table: we think this has to be there in legislation and not left just to administration.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I ask the government: are they intending to set up such an advisory committee? And what is their time frame for setting up such an advisory committee? Is it going to be done by regulation? And if so, when do we expect to see those regulations?

                      The minister already has a ministerial advisory council with significant biosecurity expertise. Is the government intending to set something up specifically on the basis that you have proposed—not at the moment. But the government is very happy to have discussions with you, Senator.

                       I thank the minister for that response. We are very keen to progress those discussions, at least—given that you are not going to support this amendment—to get a firmer process, such as one using a delegated instrument or a regulation, by which to put in place an advisory committee.

                      <p>
                       I accept that invitation to hold further discussions about how we can progress that advisory committee and about how we can put such a committee in place in a way that is not just administrative; in terms of not having any form of protection for its existence. I thank the minister for that commitment.

                       As we know, the Eminent Scientists Group is a body for which there is a lot of strong support. We believe that this is an essential component of how we deliver biosecurity, and that the Eminent Scientists Group is a key part of delivering for biosecurity.

                      <p>
                       The functions of such a group would be to review and report on biosecurity—draft BRIA reports prepared by the department; submissions received on any draft BRIA reports; whether all relevant matters relating to the likely economic, social and environmental consequences of a disease or pest emerging, entering, establishing itself or spreading in an Australian territory or a part of the Australian territory have been considered in such reports; and whether the conclusions of a provisional BRIA are scientifically reasonable based on material presented.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       We have articulated in our amendments that the Eminent Scientists Group must give the report on a review under section 1 within 60 days of receiving the draft BRIA report; that the group be appointed; that a member of such a group holds office for a period determined by the department; that a member of the group holds office on terms and conditions—in relation to matters not otherwise covered by this act—that are determined by the minister; that a member of the group must resign his or her appointment by giving a written resignation; and that—obviously—we believe that we need a group of eminent scientists who are able to conduct independent review of the BIRA reports. As I said, we believe this is an essential component of biosecurity risk analysis, and it is concerning to us that this has not been better considered in this legislation. We know that there is a lot of a strong support both in the industry and particularly in environment groups for such a group. Such a group has existed in the past and has provided excellent support, so we ask the government to reconsider this amendment to establish such a group.

                         I understand the government would not be supporting this amendment. I am deeply concerned. Again, it is the same argument as for the advisory group: we do not think it is appropriate to include this in delegated legislation and regulation. It is a key part of the approach that we take to biosecurity risk assessment and, therefore, it should be part of the legislation. The same argument stands: if it is in regulation, it is much easier to get rid of that regulation under a new government. This is long-term legislation. The Quarantine Act was in place for a very long time, and it has taken a long time to amend. You could not get rid of such a scientific group if it was actually in the legislation as easily as you could if it was in regulation. It takes a lot more thought to get that process changed. So our argument stands that the establishment of this particular group, because of its essential role in biosecurity risk assessment, should actually be part of the legislation.

                        <p>
                         I ask the government: when is the regulatory process going to be undertaken to put this body in place? What is the time frame for that and how soon can we expect to see it?

                           Thank you. 'As soon as practicable'? I have heard that before! Are we talking about the same sort of time frame as mentioned before, within the next three or four months? Also, will there be consultation about the process?

                               This amendment relates to the general biosecurity obligation that requires all biosecurity participants to exercise a general biosecurity obligation to take all reasonable and practicable measures to prevent and minimise biosecurity risks with provisions similar to those in Queensland's Biosecurity Act 2014, which is one of the most modern of the acts around Australia.

                               The amendment will create an offence of accepting goods knowing, suspecting or in wilful disregard of whether the goods are illegally imported or derived from illegally imported goods. We think this is important because, no matter how comprehensive biosecurity laws are, there will inevitably be myriad actions and omissions contributing to biosecurity risks that are not addressed.

                               The bill review expressed and emphasised the importance of biosecurity as a shared responsibility which requires that biosecurity participants not only obey the law but generally take care to observe, report and minimise biosecurity risks, requiring all biosecurity participants to take all reasonable and practical measures to prevent and minimise biosecurity risk. This will help achieve shared responsibility. This type of obligation was included in Queensland's Biosecurity Act 2014 and was proposed by the

This whole bill is about our recognition that biosecurity is so important to our environment and to industry. This amendment will enforce that process. I ask the government why it will not support this amendment, particularly as the subject matter has already been included in the modernising of state and territory biosecurity legislation.

                                The government, as Senator Siewert knows, does not support this proposed amendment. A broad, general obligation on the community with potentially higher penalty levels is problematic to administer. In relation to an additional provision on biosecurity industry participants, an offence on biosecurity industry participants—clause 428 of the bill—makes it an offence for a biosecurity industry participant to fail to carry out biosecurity activities in accordance with their approved arrangement. The primary outcome of these agreements is to manage biosecurity risk, so the government believes that the amendment is not necessary. The bill, through division 8 of part 1 of chapter 3 and clause 431, also imposes obligations on persons in charge of goods and biosecurity industry participants to report biosecurity incidents, with penalties for non-compliance.

                                 I indicate that these will be the last amendments that I will be moving. These amendments relate to the public release of approved arrangements to be published on the departmental website. The problem that a lot of community members are having—and there has been a long history of this—is that biosecurity is in fact characterised by a lack of transparency. We believe that publishing of approved arrangements would allow greater oversight. These amendments have the support of a wide variety of stakeholders. We believe it is important that these arrangements are released. I understand that some arrangements may be commercial-in-confidence. I understand that process, but we think that this should not stop some form of the release of these approved arrangements.

I think it would help a lot in terms of people understanding how they come to decisions and the broader community's understanding of biosecurity.

                                  On this matter at this time, we will need to agree to disagree. The government does not support proposed amendments (36) and (37). As approved arrangements are voluntary agreements between private entities and the government, the information is protected information and may represent confidential, commercial or sensitive information which is not appropriate to publish. Having said that, over the implementation period the government is happy to examine ways of progressing further transparency, but being ever mindful of the importance of commercial confidentiality.

                                   seek a commitment from government that they will look at this issue of transparency, that there is a recognition that there is a lack of transparency in understanding these arrangements, and that they will seek to consult? I would like to be included in that process.

                                    The government will consult on these issues. I note Senator Siewert's desire to be consulted. In response, I would say that obviously there is no show without Punch.

                                     I thank the minister for that. I ask whether that means that they do understand the issues around transparency and the need for greater understanding by the community, particularly key stakeholders, in respect of some of the decisions and arrangements that are made.

                                      Yes, the government does obviously appreciate the desire for maximum transparency, but that has to be balanced with other considerations of commercial confidentiality. That is always the balance. We are aware of the tension and the issues, and we will consult.
