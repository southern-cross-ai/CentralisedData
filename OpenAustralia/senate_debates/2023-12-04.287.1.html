        There is no question that we are facing significant shifts in geopolitics, safety and security. It is imperative that we as a nation take proactive measures to safeguard our sovereignty and protect the interests of our citizens. Australian security and prosperity hinges on stable oceans, with 99 per cent of our exports relying on maritime transport. Our exclusive economic zone, the third-largest globally, further underscores the critical importance of maritime stability.
       </p>
       <p>
        Amidst the evolving global security dynamics, the AUKUS deal represents a generational opportunity, showcasing our dedication to collaborating with our allies to enhance global security. By committing to a collaborative effort in the development of advanced defence technologies, intelligence-sharing and the pursuit of nuclear-powered submarines, the AUKUS deal is a testament to the shared values and strategic interest that bind our three nations. The trilateral agreement with the United Kingdom and the United States reinforces security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region, particularly through the acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines, which is a strategic move that enhances our maritime capabilities. These state-of-the-art submarines will not only ensure the safety of our vast coastlines but also serve as a powerful deterrent, signalling to potential adversaries that Australia is steadfast in its commitment to national security. The technological edge provided by these submarines is a game-changer, enabling us to navigate the complex waters of the 21st-century with confidence.

        , continuing our tradition as the home of the Australian submarine fleet. I'm acutely aware of the strategic significance of my home state attracting, developing and retaining a highly skilled workforce in Western Australia. It is crucial for the timely execution of this historic agreement, focusing on and developing the skills and training sector in Western Australia is paramount to bolstering the success of the AUKUS deal. As the agreement brings advanced naval capabilities, a skilled workforce is essential for the maintenance and operation of nuclear-powered submarines. The advanced technology integral to this alliance requires a highly skilled and specialised workforce, necessitating investments in

        s not only for future jobs but also to contribute meaningfully to the AUKUS deal's research and development initiatives. By developing local expertise, we not only enhance our state's contribution to national security but we will also create more highly skilled jobs, fostering economic growth and strengthening the local economy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Additionally, critical to delivering on this capability will be insuring that the surrounding infrastructure—such as roads and housing—has the capacity to handle and support a project like AUKUS. This means that Anketell Road and Stock Road will need serious upgrades to accommodate satisfactory connectivity. Similarly, the influx of military and auxiliary staff will need to be housed in the southern suburbs of Perth. The Western Australian government must be ready and begin planning now on how it will deliver the additional road and housing infrastructure on top of the existing commitments that are already in the pipeline.
       </p>
       <p>
        The AUKUS deal stands as a testament to our commitment to national security and global stability. As a senator for Western Australia, I'm dedicated to ensuring that our state plays a central role in this transformative agreement, emphasising skills development to involve more Western Australians in this historical moment. Strategic focus ensures that Western Australia becomes a vital hub in the AUKUS partnership, leveraging our unique geographic position and existing infrastructure. In turn, this strategy between defence needs and workforce development becomes a catalyst for job creation and economic prosperity in our state. Let us embrace the opportunities that AUKUS presents, fortifying our nation's defences and securing a prosperous future for Western Australians and, indeed, for all Australians.
