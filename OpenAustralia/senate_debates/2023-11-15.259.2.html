          Bankruptcy Act

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Pursuant to section 149 of the Bankruptcy Act, the automatic discharge of a bankruptcy is three years and one day after a statement of affairs is filed with the Official Receiver. The Australian Financial Securities Authority and its predecessors have been treating filed as the date that the statement of affairs is accepted and endorsed by the Official Receiver. However, an alternate interpretation is that discharge should occur three years after a statement of affairs is
        <i>
         submitted
        </i>
        to the Official Receiver, rather than when it is accepted. This has caused legal uncertainty for those engaging in the bankruptcy system over this period of time.

       <p class="italic">
        The purpose of the Bill is to amend the
        <i>
         Health Insurance Act 1973
        </i>
        to enable the Professional Services Review (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR" rel="nofollow">
         PSR
        </a>
        ) to more effectively review inappropriate practice, thus improving the operations of the PSR and, in turn, supporting the integrity and ongoing sustainability of the Medicare system.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Reasons for Urgency
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill contains measures to support the integrity and sustainability of the Medicare system by addressing issues and ambiguities in the legislation relation to the PSR.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill will align requirements for qualifications of PSR Committee members with the legislative definition of inappropriate practice and clarify how these requirements should be applied. This will ensure that PSR Committees can be established for a practitioner with an unusual mix of specialties where there are few exact peers or where the practitioner is providing services in a different field from their formal specialist qualifications.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Passage is required by the end of the 2023 Spring sittings to ensure the PSR can validly refer practitioners to PSR Committees for investigation before cases reach the end of their statutory timeframe.

        Purpose of the Bill
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill will amend the social security law to strengthen support for the transition to employment for income support recipients, including working age payments and the Age Pension. This is consistent with the Government's commitment to supporting people to move into employment, while continuing to provide a strong, sustainable and fair social safety net.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Reasons for Urgency
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Passage of the bill in the 2023 Spring sittings is required because the Bill will extend the temporary enhancements to the Pension Work Bonus, which currently terminate on    .31 December 2023. The Work Bonus provides financial incentives to pensioners over Age Pension age to participate in paid employment.
