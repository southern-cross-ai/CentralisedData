        As a servant to the many different people who make up our one Queensland community, polling has turned against the Voice because the Prime Minister has told a lie too far. Prime Minister Albanese said repeatedly that the Uluru statement fits on one A4 page and that he was committed to implementing the statement in full. The Uluru statement is 26 pages; the remaining pages have been released under freedom of information. These contain a clear path for the partition of Australia into two separate nations that closely resemble

            I'm going to seek guidance because I did not hear it. Thank you very much to the Clerk. I've been informed, Senator Roberts, that you did actually accuse the Prime Minister of lying. That is out of order, and I'm going to have to ask you, please, for the purposes of complying with the Senate's smooth running, to withdraw that statement.

                A mistruth too far. As opposition leader, Prime Minister Albanese said the Voice must be followed by a makarrata commission to inform a national treaty, yet he failed to tell Australians that without the Voice passing there is no national body of Australians with which to sign a treaty. The Prime Minister's decision to not admit that without a voice there can be no meaningful treaty is a mistruth too far. When asked on ABC radio if he will move on to treaty if the Voice is passed, the Prime Minister said no; his exact word was 'no'. Yet the Uluru statement includes a high-level treaty and the Prime Minister has called in parliament for a treaty. It's on record, and he has the T-shirt to prove it!
               </p>
               <p>
                The Prime Minister's denial of his intention to proceed to treaty is a mistruth too far. The Uluru statement calls for reparations in the form of an annual cash payment calculated as a percentage of
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
                 GDP
                </a>
                . Even one per cent would be $20 billion a year in cash to 800,000 Aboriginals, or $100,000 for a family of four, which, as compensation, is tax free. The Prime Minister deliberately hid his true agenda. He's been found out and he's now lost any chance of a settlement with the real Aboriginal community that looks to a shared future of mutual respect and equality of opportunity. Loss of shared community is a heavy penalty for one man's mistruth too far.
