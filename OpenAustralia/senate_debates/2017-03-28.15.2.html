        My question is to the minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Brandis. Yesterday, in response to a question I asked the minister in relation to Prime Minister Turnbull's support for a pay cut of up to $77 for up to 700,000 Australian workers, the minister said, 'The Prime Minister has said no such thing, and your assertion that he has done so is not the truth.' On 17 March, when asked by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Mitchell" rel="nofollow">
         Neil Mitchell
        </a>
        of 3AW whether he supported the cut to penalty rates, the Prime Minister said, 'Well, we do support it Neil, and I've been very clear about that.' Given the Prime Minister's very clear support for the pay cut, when will the minister correct the record?

         The problem with your question, Senator Urquhart, is that is not what I was asked. You asserted, and others among you, including Senator Cameron, asserted, that the government had recommended or argued that there ought to be a pay cut, and it did no such thing. You know it did no such thing, Senator Urquhart, but it did not stop you from making a false claim to the contrary. It is the case that the government supports the independence of the Fair Work Commission and, therefore, supports every determination of the Fair Work Commission, because if you support the independence of a court, a tribunal or an arbitral body of course you uphold its decisions. That is what the government has done. That is what the Prime Minister said. But that is not what you put to me yesterday.

In relation to the words that the Attorney-General has withdrawn, I am satisfied that those words have been withdrawn. On 'secret commissions', Senator Carr, I will reflect upon that. But I do not believe, in the context that was used by the Attorney-General, that that would breach that provision of the standing orders, but I will reflect upon that. Senator Urquhart, a final supplementary question.

                               I addressed that yesterday. As the commission itself has said, there is absolutely no reason for you to assert that, because it made a determination in relation to the hospitality industry, it will make a determination of a similar or like character in relation to any other industry. I know the lying machine of the Labor Party is trying to spread that story around the place, but it is not true.

                                   Order! References to that have stood in the past. What I will also do, Senator Wong, in relation to that matter is reflect upon that. My understanding—and I have in fact witnessed that here in this chamber on many occasions—is references from both sides have been made to collective groups in that manner before. Again, I will reflect, and I will come back to the chamber if I need to. On the same point of order, Senator Wong?
