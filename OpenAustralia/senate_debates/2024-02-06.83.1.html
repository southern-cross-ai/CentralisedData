           You're right: 'Wow'—to help tackle the cost-of-living pressures felt by families right across this country. These tax cuts are on top of the other significant supports introduced by the Albanese government through our $23 billion cost-of-living relief package, which is already helping ease the pressure on families and workers right across Australia. This includes: cheaper child care and extending paid parental leave; cheaper medicines and making it cheaper for more Australians to see a

           ; and increasing income support payments for Australians who need them.
          </p>
          <p>
           Now we've taken these measures even further by delivering Labor's tax cuts, which are going to put more money back into the pockets of workers and families. Under Labor's tax cuts, Australians earning low and middle incomes will receive a greater cut compared to the

           He's no thug; he wasn't a thug—including an additional 2.9 million people who have received nothing. Thanks to our changes to the Medicare levy low-income thresholds, more low-income families and individuals are going to pay less each year. Tackling cost-of-living pressures is the No. 1 priority of the Albanese Labor government. That's why we're working to cut taxes, boost wages, bring inflation under control and deliver—

              for her first supplementary question. Labor's tax cuts, our policies, deliver cost-of-living relief—great news for
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
               New South Wales
              </a>
              . Under Labor's plan, around 83 per cent of taxpayers in New South Wales will receive—I'll repeat that; 83 per cent—a bigger tax cut. This is in addition to the cost-of-living relief that we've delivered for people in New South Wales, with 338,000 people benefiting from our increases to JobSeeker payments and 308,000 households eligible for the increased maximum rate of Commonwealth rent assistance. These measures will assist cost of living, and Labor's tax cuts will put more money into the pockets of families, workers and taxpayers right across New South Wales.

                  Peter Dutton

                 , and the coalition have stood in the way, including when it comes to our actions on electricity bill relief, cheaper child care, cheaper medicines, fee-free
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">

                 </a>
                 , more social and affordable housing and getting wages for Australian workers and their families moving again. Cost-of-living relief remains our No. 1 priority, and we will continue to take action, even if the coalition continues its negativity and its obstruction. Labor's tax cuts are the next step in our broader plans to ease cost-of-living pressures by boosting incomes, reducing costs and delivering relief for families.
