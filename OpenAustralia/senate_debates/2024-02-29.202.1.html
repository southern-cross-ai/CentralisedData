        This week I had the opportunity to speak with educators from Goodstart Early Learning, who devote themselves to their profession out of profound love for children and are driven by an unwavering passion to foster their growth and impact their lives for the better. But, unfortunately, because of a decade of the coalition's deliberate policy to keep wages low, educators have been forced to leave the sector, resulting in a workforce crisis. We all know that love and passion unfortunately don't pay bills. I spoke to a young woman who had to move back with her parents because she couldn't make ends meet on her own due to the rising cost-of-living pressures. This story resonated with many of the other educators present at the meeting.
       </p>
       <p>
        In a snap poll conducted by the United Workers Union, 100 per cent of the respondents reported that staff shortages are impacting the quality of care and education that children receive. This is why the Albanese Labor government, through the work of our incredible minister, Anne Aly, are working closely with stakeholders to accelerate the implementation of the National Children's Education and Care Workforce Strategy to address the workforce challenges in the short to long term. We know the incredible impact Labor's cheaper childcare policy has had on our economy, driving women's participation in the workforce to record highs and assisting families who utilise early childhood education to tackle the cost of living. This initiative must be supplemented by a valued and well-supported early childhood education workforce if it is to reach its full potential. A real wage increase will go a long way to retain and attract workers to this vital industry. I'm proud to stand with these workers and support them in their calls for a pay rise that reflects the importance of the work they do.

        On another note, earlier this month, the Albanese and Cook governments signed a landmark agreement which will make
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        the first state in our country to fully fund all public schools. We know that Australia has a good education system, but it can be made a lot better and fairer, because every child deserves access to quality education. WA is the first state to endorse a statement of intent which will see the funding for all public schools increase from 95 per cent of the school resourcing standard to 100 per cent by 2026. This represents an additional $777.4 million investment by the Albanese government in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australian
        </a>
        public schools from 2025 to 2029. Currently, the Commonwealth provides 20 per cent of the funding, which will increase to 21.25 per cent in 2025 and 22.5 per cent in 2026. As part of this agreement, WA's most disadvantaged schools will be fully funded from next year, and all schools will be fully funded by 2026.
       </p>
       <p>
        The funding will be tied to things that help children keep up, catch up and finish school—and this is just the first step. The Albanese government is committed to working with all states and territories to fully fund all schools. This deal was a great achievement in the history of public education in WA and is a testament to what can be achieved when state and federal governments work together for the people instead of working against each other for political gain.

       </p>
       <p>
        With the Cook Labor government leading our state and the Albanese Labor government leading the country, the people of WA will come first.
