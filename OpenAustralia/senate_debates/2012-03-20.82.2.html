          Thank you, Senator Collins, for the indulgence. I claim to have been misrepresented by Senator Bob Brown. Yesterday in the debate on the 150th report of the Privileges Committee on whether there was any improper influence in relation to political donations made by Mr Graeme Wood—and in questions without notice asked by Senator Bob Brown and Senator Milne—Senator Brown, in reference to me, said, and I am reading from page 65 of yesterday's proof
          <i>
           Hansard
          </i>
          :
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          … Senator Brandis … after two months was forced to recuse himself from this committee …
         </p>
         <p>
          That is capable, Mr
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_President" rel="nofollow">
           Deputy President
          </a>
          , of creating a misleading impression. I am, as you are aware, a member of the Privileges Committee—indeed, a former chairman of the Privileges Committee—and it is a fact that I did recuse myself from that inquiry, a fact that was noted by the chair in presenting the report and is noted in the report itself. It is quite misleading to say either that I was forced to or that I was forced to after two months.
         </p>
         <p>
          Senator Brown made some observations in a debate in the Senate on Tuesday, 7 February 2012 in which he said words to the effect that, because I had given a parliamentary speech in the chamber in July of last year which dealt with matters that were before the Privileges Committee after Senator Kroger's reference in November of last year, I ought not to participate in the inquiry. That speech by Senator Brown was brought to my attention by Senator Johnston, the chairman of the committee, the following day, Wednesday, 8 February. I thought about the matter overnight and I decided that the point made by Senator Brown was a fair point and that, because I had raised in a parliamentary speech matters which could potentially arise during the course of the inquiry, I ought to take the course of recusing myself. So I wrote to Senator Johnston on 10 February 2012 doing so. In the course of that letter, which I seek leave to table, I said:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Although I stand by what I said in the course of the debate, it is incorrect to say that I have pre-judged the issues which the inquiry is likely to address. Nevertheless, having considered the matter carefully, I have decided to recuse myself.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          As you are aware, the law recognizes two categories of case in which a judicial officer or other relevant decision-maker should stand aside from a hearing: where there is actual bias (for instance, where there is a direct conflict of interests) and apprehended bias (where, although there is no actual bias, a reasonable objective observer might conclude that there could be).
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Although the Privileges Committee is not, of course, a court or a quasi-judicial tribunal, it is nevertheless of central importance that it both act with neutrality and be seen to so act. For that reason, I consider the legal principles to which I have referred provide useful guidance and should generally be followed in a case such as this.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          In view of my contribution to the debate concerning Senator Brown's relationship with Mr Wood and his interests, I have concluded that there is a sufficient basis for the principle of apprehended bias to apply to this case.
         </p>
         <p>
          It will be obvious from what I have said that the decision to recuse myself was a decision taken entirely of my own volition. The suggestion that I was forced to do so is incorrect.
         </p>
         <p>
          Senator Brown anticipated in his speech to the Senate on 7 February that the following day he would deliver to the Privileges Committee a letter setting out the grounds why ought to recuse myself. I in fact did not read that letter and have not read it to this day. The principles are well known to me and I applied them to myself.
         </p>
         <p>
          It is also incorrect to imply, as Senator Bob Brown's remarks do, that there was a reluctance on my part over some two months to recuse myself. It may be the case that two months earlier Senator Brown had made a statement that I ought to recuse myself, but if he did I was unaware of it. Senator Brown may think the world hangs upon his every word, but I do not. I first became aware of Senator Brown's complaint when Senator Johnston drew it to my attention on 8 February following Senator Brown's parliamentary speech on 7 February and, having reflected on the matter overnight, I decided on 9 February—in other words, effectively immediately—under no pressure but of my own volition to apply the appropriate legal principle and to recuse myself, which I think in the circumstances was the proper thing to do.

                  . That is an extraordinary negation of the right of senators to speak when named in this place. I ask you to look at whether that is in order and whether that is a precedent that is going to be followed by this place.

                    , I do submit that there is no point of order, but in making that submission, may I say that in the remarks I just made I did not suggest that Senator Brown yesterday deliberately misled the Senate. There is nothing in my statement, which merely charts the chronology or sequence of these events.

                       Committee of Privileges
                      </a>
                      . The matter of Senator Kroger, which was devised by Senator Abetz and brought before this Senate on 23 and 24 November last year, has now been thrown out by the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges. It was found to be baseless, lacking in any substance and containing misinformation which effectively would, if taken up, have misled the Senate. That was Senator Kroger's submission dealt with by the committee of privileges.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      But the submission from our legal representatives, Mr Merkel, Ms Gordon and Mr Browne, to the committee of privileges in February at the time Senator Brandis is talking about was that he should be recused from the committee of privileges because, on any matter of judgment which took notice of High Court rulings in the past, Senator Brandis had no place on the committee.

                               Senator Brandis breaks the rules, but you have pulled him up quite properly,

                               . This fatuous claim by Senator Brandis that it took me to draw his attention to his own tirade against Senator Milne and me—quite false—in the Senate last July, and that we had to draw his attention to his own behaviour in this place before he got off that committee because he had no legal right to be there, is a pointer to what disregard this senator, this

                               —to be guilty of behaviour that never occurred. What a remarkable failure of this legally trained member of the coalition to do the right thing by the law.

                               tore to shreds his right to be on that committee, and he got off it for that reason. He says here he did not know about Senator Brown's complaint or Senator Milne's complaint. He ought to have known because he was the one who misbehaved in the Senate in July last year when he made accusations, falsely, against Senator Milne and I. And let me tell you this, Mr Deputy President: had we not got that legal advice he would have stayed there and we would now be facing an open hearing before the Committee of Privileges. Yet Senator Abetz has the hide to say on radio in Tasmania this morning that this is a 'legal folly'—in other words, he was not serious about this matter, he says, that put two senators before the Committee of Privileges. What a disgrace to the legal profession he is, that he should say such a thing or that he should abuse the Committee of Privileges in this way. What a performance from these two legally trained members of the Senate. They should be ashamed of themselves.

I recused myself from an inquiry concerning serious allegations against him and Senator Christine Milne freely and of my own volition when it was drawn to my attention by Senator David Johnston that Senator Brown had made a complaint in this chamber about my participation. I thought, having reflected on the matter and having reflected on my knowledge of the legal principles, that the complaint was fairly made. That is a fact. And if you can controvert that, Senator Brown—

                                     Let me state it directly for the record, which Senator Brown has asserted falsely to be otherwise. I recused myself from that hearing by a letter written on 10 February after a decision I made on 9 February, having been told the previous day, 8 February, that the day before that, 7 February, Senator Brown had made a complaint in this chamber. That was the first I became aware of Senator Brown's assertion that I ought not to serve on the committee.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                     The statement that Senator Brown has made that I knew 2½ months before is utterly, utterly, false. The statement that Senator Brown made that I knew about Mr Merkel's letter is utterly, utterly, false. I did not read Mr Merkel's letter, and I have not read it to this day, because I did not need the letter to be able to make the decision I made because I am well acquainted with the legal principles and I applied them in my own case.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                     The statement that I ought to have excused or recused myself at an earlier time is also utterly false. The committee had not proceeded upon the consideration of the reference and I was unaware of any matters in relation to what Senator Brown had been saying until they were drawn to my attention by Senator David Johnston for the first time on 8 February 2012. As I have said in my personal explanation I recused myself, after reflecting on the matter overnight, effectively at once. Senator Brown's assertion that the situation was otherwise, based on absolutely no evidence whatsoever but that can only be construed as an assertion that I have not been telling the truth to this Senate, is a deep outrage and he ought to withdraw it and be ashamed of himself.

                                      That is a very interesting speech from Senator Brandis in relation to what evidence there is or there is not. I draw to the attention of the Senate a number of documents. On 22 December 2011 a letter went to the Chair of the

If that is correct then Senator Milne should not be canvassing the substantive issues but should be telling the Senate why it is essential that standing orders—the standing orders, I might say, that the Greens and the Labor Party have guillotined through this chamber—should be set aside to allow the statement to be made.

                                         . It goes to a statement by Senator Brandis, a senior counsel. This is not just somebody who does not know the law; this is someone who was appointed a senior counsel in exceptional circumstances in Queensland after he became a senator. This person stood in the Senate and said:
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="italic">
                                         But what makes this a particularly serious case, what makes this case approach the borders of corruption is that we now know that in public speeches both beyond parliament and within the Senate chamber Senator Brown and Senator Milne have sought to advance the commercial interests of that donor …
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                         That is completely untrue and without evidence or substance, as was shown to be the case. Therefore, when this matter was referred to the Privileges Committee, a person who has a senior counsel attached to his name ought to have recused himself at the point of reference because he should have realised that he had already compromised himself, but he did not do so.
                                        </p>

                                         As to the next point, the letter went there. It should have happened straight away when the reference was made. The letter was received by the chair of the committee, Senator Johnston. It was sent on 22 December 2011.

                                                As I was saying, the letter was sent on 22 December. The chair of a committee has an obligation to circulate matters of this kind, especially since, as it has been said, matters before the Privileges Committee need to be resolved as a matter of urgency to protect the reputations of people involved. However, apparently, based on what Senator Brandis said, the chair of the committee failed in his duty to the rest of the committee to circulate that letter. However, having said that, the legal advice went to the chair of the committee—and this is important, Senator Macdonald; you listen to the sequence of events—on 8 February.

                                                            As I said, on 8 February a letter was received by the chair of the Privileges Committee, which gave the legal advice supporting the call made in December asking for Senator Brandis to recuse himself. Subsequent to that, Senator Brandis, on 9 February, did recuse himself. That legal advice had been received by the chair and I note we are still hearing from Senator Macdonald about substantive matters which were proved to be false and he is continuing to prosecute falsities in this Senate.
                                                           </p>

                                                            The facts of the matter are: a request for recusal on 22 December 2011; legal advice on 8 February 2012; Senator Brandis recused himself on 9 February 2012. It is pretty obvious and the real question here is: why weren't matters dealt with in a timely manner and why weren't they circulated to all members of the committee as requested?

                                                             Let us remember what the actual issue is here. Senator Brandis gave a very restrained, very tight personal explanation. The usual forms of this place are that people give personal explanations to try to de-escalate issues, to give a quick explanation as to where they have been misrepresented. I think nobody could argue that Senator Brandis did it in a very gracious way, even acknowledging that Senator Brown's technical point was, in fact, correct. When Senator Brown wanted to speak, I wanted to know whether Senator Brown had been misrepresented by anything that Senator Brandis had said and that was not forthcoming. Senator Brown just wanted to waste five minutes time of the Senate to argue against what Senator Brandis had said. That is not the normal way we conduct business in the Senate on these matters.

                                                             Let us be perfectly clear on this: Senator Brandis was very tight. I think he gave a very good example of what a personal explanation ought to be. But what we have had since is both Senator Brown and Senator Milne using the forms of this Senate to then misrepresent the situation. Indeed, Senator Brandis on points of order indicated that he recused himself from the committee's deliberations before he was aware of the legal opinion.

                                                             Senator Brown's very personal, nasty attack on Senator Kroger suggesting that she does not have a mind of her own is the sort of attack that female senators can do without from male senators—

Facts are something that Senator Bob Brown has a great deal of difficulty dealing with, as does Senator Milne. As a very quick example: yesterday we were told how the Greens were subjected to a delay in relation to the Privileges Committee hearing: 'We were the ones who were being subjected to defamation, and yet the committee decided to go on holidays and not respond to any of the correspondence until the summer holidays were over.' Let's read the

They sought the extension of time, and yet we had senators Brown and Milne deliberately seeking to mislead this Senate in relation to the time delay. Similarly, we had Senator Brown just then asserting that what I had said on radio about the Greens being engaged in a legal frolic of their own was somehow me saying that this reference to the Privileges Committee was just a legal frolic of mine—a complete misrepresentation of the facts, a complete misrepresentation of what has actually occurred.
                                                                       </p>

It was not debating the issues; it was setting out the facts. No evidence has been suggested that anything in that statement is untrue. There is nothing that is suggesting that Senator Brandis has misled the Senate. Therefore, from the coalition point of view, there is no need to suspend standing orders to waste the Senate's time to allow Senator Brown to go yet again on another one of his very nasty personal attacks. We are getting sick of this Leader of the Australian Greens attacking the

We have a general proposition that, where people act appropriately, we try to treat them with respect and allow them to make their point within the bounds of managing the chamber more broadly. So we were prepared to give leave. I know this is highly contested space. It seems to me it would have been appropriate for Senator Brown to be given the opportunity to reply to Senator Brandis and then have that be the end of the matter. Clearly that has not occurred. That is unfortunate, but I do think the issues have been aired. I think this will continue to be contested space, but I think the interests of the Senate are best served if we deal with it, and I move that the motion be put.
