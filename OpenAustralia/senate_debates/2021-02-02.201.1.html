        Honourable senators, I've just read a few words from the beautiful poem by Major Edward de Stein, late of the Kings Royal Rifles, titled
        <i>
         Elegy on the Death of Bingo, Our Trench Dog
        </i>
        . It was written in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">
         World War I
        </a>
        , and it is estimated that over 50,000 dogs accompanied armies on both sides of that terrible conflict.
       </p>
       <p>
        I wish to bring to the attention of honourable senators the great work the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        for the Blind is doing in Adelaide, which has national significance. I understand that the first archaeological evidence of the domesticated dog is in a 10,000-year-old grave in Greece, which contained human remains and those of a puppy. Humans and dogs have evolved together and became partners for their mutual benefit and sustenance. The bond has not been broken despite the passage of time. Even today, we rely on dogs to keep our soldiers safe and also to bring joy to the lives of our old soldiers. For the last seven years, the Royal Society for the Blind has expanded its internationally accredited assistance dog program to support veterans who have been clinically diagnosed with post-traumatic stress. Their program has been given the title 'Operation K9'.
       </p>
       <p>
        The society was founded in 1884 by Sir Charles Goode and Andrew Hendry, who himself was blind as a child. It was called the Institute for the Blind and became the royal society in 1974. The organisation provides services to over 11,000 South Australians who are blind or vision impaired. As of January 2021, Operation K9 has provided 42 dogs to veterans and has a near 100 per cent success rate in matching dogs to those veterans in need. These assistance dogs are individually trained to perform tasks such as interrupting destructive behaviours as well as providing comfort, support, independence and social interaction. Each dog's training is tailored to the individual veteran's needs, including even retrieving medication. Clinical research undertaken by the University of Adelaide's centre for trauma research has demonstrated that, within six to 12 months of receiving an assistance dog, veterans were reporting a 20 to 45 per cent improvement in their social and family functioning, a 20 to 40 per cent decrease in depression and anxiety and a 40 per cent increase in their mobility and exercise habits. Veterans are motivated into healthy action for the love of their dog. The average cost to train a dog is around $40,000. The program is being supported by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Veterans'_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Veterans' Affairs
        </a>
        until April 2021 for the supply of 10 dogs. A recent recipient of a Royal Society for the Blind dog supported through the Department of Veterans' Affairs remarked:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Xena has been just wonderful for me. She has made me feel calmer, more settled, and my housemates have commented already on the changes in me. She has kept me close at night, and I just feel more grounded, and less anxious with her by my side. When I go to Uni, she has made me feel more comfortable as a part of the crowd, and better able to engage with my fellow students.
       </p>
       <p>
        Late last year I had the opportunity to visit the training centre for the Royal Society for the Blind, where I met Ivan, a veteran, and his wife, Vera, who spoke to me about the incredible difference their dog, Wattle, has made to both their lives. It was a moving experience to hear their story. Wattle was the most beautiful of dogsâ€”calm, attentive and loving. Wattle was the living embodiment of that loving and supportive trench dog that Major de Stein lionised in his poem. However, unlike Wattle, the trench dog, Bingo, lovingly described in the poem, never played with children on clean grass nor dozed beside the glowing embers, for he was born amid a world of war. Bingo gave comfort in war. Wattle gives comfort after the guns have gone silent and the wounds need healing.
       </p>
       <p>
        I encourage honourable senators to support this initiative. I congratulate the government for investing in a program that provides so much benefit to veterans who are on their own difficult journey to heal themselves of the scars of war.
