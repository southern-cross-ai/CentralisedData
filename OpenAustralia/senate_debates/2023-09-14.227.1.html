         Invictus Games
        </a>
        2023 kicked off in Dusseldorf in Germany on 9 September and runs for one week. The Australian team is made up of 31 current and former ADF personnel who have, sadly, have been wounded, injured or become ill during service. The Invictus Games is an international, adaptive, multisport competition of individuals and team sports. These include athletics, indoor rowing, powerlifting, road cycling, sitting volleyball, table tennis, swimming, wheelchair basketball and wheelchair rugby. It's a great event that demonstrates the power of sport to provide a sense of community and purpose, and a great celebration of the resilience of our veterans. Importantly, the message of the power of sport to assist in recovery, rehabilitation and reintegration applies at all levels, from the local club all the way to the Invictus Games.
       </p>
       <p>
        The word 'invictus' means unconquered, and this is a very fitting description for our veterans. It embodies the fighting spirit of wounded, injured and ill personnel. Importantly, the Invictus Games highlight that injuries do not define our veterans and demonstrate what they're able to achieve post injury, and I have met quite a number of these remarkable individuals. The Invictus Games was launched in March 2014 by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry" rel="nofollow">

        after he was inspired by a similar concept in the United States, the Warrior Games. Since then, the games have grown to include 21 nations, 10 sports, over 1,500 volunteers and 550 competitors.
       </p>
       <p>
        I had the pleasure of learning much more about the Invictus Games when engaging with veterans through the Senate's Adaptive sport programs for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        veterans inquiry earlier this year. It was really an experience that I will remember for a very long time. All those who participated in the inquiry were unanimous in their belief that adaptive sports, the sports that our veterans compete in at the Invictus Games, are beneficial in aiding many of them in their transition out of military life into civilian life. Benefits we heard about included lowering of stress and anxiety; easing of socialisation; and boosting self-confidence and self-esteem. Sport offers a kind of common language that allows veterans to reconnect with their local community and mitigate feelings of loneliness and lost identity. I again thank all of those who took part in that inquiry, particularly those who took the time to make a submission or to attend one of our public hearings. It certainly made it very clear to me and many other senators, as we heard in this place when the report was tabled, how important the Invictus Games are and how important sport is more generally to the veteran community.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Invictus Games are a great example of the healing power of sport, and it also brings together the families and friends of our veterans. Almost 90 family members and friends have made the journey to Germany to support the 31 members of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Team Australia
        </a>
        . So I want to pay tribute to those supporting our veteransâ€”and not just at the Invictus Games but in everyday life. Family and friends are so often essential to the transition from service to civilian life, and even more so when recovering from an injury or illness.
       </p>
       <p>
        Invictus Games competitors are fantastic role models, not just to other veterans but to all other people. They demonstrate that, regardless of disability or illness, we can all participate and succeed in sport and, by extension, be active in our communities. Through their participation in the Invictus Games our veterans are demonstrating once again how sport can lift people up, support their recovery and help them overcome challenges.
       </p>
       <p>
        I encourage everyone to get behind our Aussies as they complete in the final days of this competition. Team Australia has already secured several medals with success across many sports, including swimming, weightlifting and wheelchair rugby. But it's important to remember that all our Invictus Games competitors have already made their country very proud through their service. I again want to thank them for their service and wish them all the very best for the remaining days of the competition.
