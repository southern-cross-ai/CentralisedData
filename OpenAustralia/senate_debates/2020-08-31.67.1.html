         I thank Senator Henderson for the very important question. Of course, during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health has been a challenge not just in Australia but around the world. The Morrison government recognise that the ongoing restrictions in place to stop the spread of COVID-19 are having a significant impact on the mental health of Australians, but, in particular—as Senator Henderson well knows—in communities in Victoria, who continue to be subject to severe lockdown measures.

         Since March of this year, the government have announced a number of emergency response measures to support the mental health and wellbeing of Australians through COVID-19. Access to telehealth services under the Medical Benefits Scheme has been expanded to include mental health, allied health professions and general practice. From 16 March to 16 August 2020, over 5.4 million Medical Benefits Schedule subsidised mental health services were accessed, with 35.1 per cent of mental health services delivered by telehealth. We're also investing in our frontline mental health services through our $74 million COVID-19 mental health support package, with $3 million for a dedicated mental health and wellbeing program for frontline workers, $10 million in funding to support older Australians through a community visitor scheme, $6.8 million for the expansion of headspace's digital work and study service, $10 million to establish the Coronavirus Mental Wellbeing Support Service and $14 million to bolster the capacity of mental health providers such as Lifeline and

           What additional assistance is the government providing to Victoria as second-stage lockdowns force Australians back into isolation, potentially cutting them off from family and social supports?

            As Senator Henderson has said, Victorians in some parts—they're doing it really tough. The government understand the severe nature of the COVID-19 restrictions in parts of Victoria, and we have therefore provided additional assistance to Victorians at this time, including the doubling of funding for the Better Access plan to increase access to mental health practitioners through Medicare. For support for young people through youth support, there's $12 million for service surge capacity to Victorians, including $5 million for headspace, with a particular focus on those in year 11 and year 12. Across all of Victoria, we are funding an additional 10 Medicare-subsidised psychological therapy sessions for people who are affected by the further restrictions or who are in quarantine or are required to self-isolate and have already used the 10 existing sessions that they have. We're also establishing 15 dedicated mental health clinics across Victoria and—

               The government are closely monitoring mental health service usage to respond quickly and lessen the mental health impacts of COVID-19 and the recovery phase. In the past four weeks, Victorian access to support services was 90 per cent higher than the rest of the country for
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_Blue" rel="nofollow">
                Beyond Blue
               </a>
               , 22 per cent higher for Lifeline, and five per cent higher for the Kids Helpline. Also, though, in light of this and in conjunction with the Victorian government, we have agreed to establish a new Victorian mental health task force to ensure the latest initiatives are implemented as quickly as possible. This is important additional assistance for Victorians at this time.

               In terms of the Beyond Blue Coronavirus Mental Wellbeing Support Service, it's available to all Australians needing support through the COVID-19 pandemic and can be accessed via telephone or online, and through these services—
