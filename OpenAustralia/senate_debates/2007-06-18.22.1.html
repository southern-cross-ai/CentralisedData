        My question is to Senator Coonan, the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Is the minister aware of comments by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        commander in Iraq that American troops may remain in Iraq on a long-term basis, with references to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea" rel="nofollow">
         South Korea
        </a>
        as an example? Don’t these comments reflect recent reports that the US is planning a long-term presence in Iraq after the bulk of its forces withdraw by late 2008? Has the US approached Australia about its withdrawal plans next year or requested that our current commitment remain as part of the 40,000-strong force that would stay in Iraq on a long-term basis? Does the government agree with the need for a long-term military presence in Iraq, and does the government see a role for Australia in this force? Is that what the government really means when it says it will stay until the job is done?

           Thank you; I was having trouble hearing. The new strategy does remain the best hope for the Iraqi people.

            The United States

           has consistently said that a full assessment cannot take place until all additional forces are in place and have been on the ground for several months. The Iraqi government has the lead in implementing the security plan and recognises the importance of demonstrating strong national leadership and encouraging reconciliation, including through the progress on issues such as constitutional reform and de-Baathification legislation.
          </p>
          <p>
           They are very difficult matters, as I think we all recognise, and much work needs to be done. Australia has consistently expressed full support for both the security and political components of the plan and the need for progress. We also share the view with the United States that the alternative is greater bloodshed and chaos and victory to terrorists in Iraq and around the world. I understand that
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Bush" rel="nofollow">

           reaffirmed his confidence in Prime Minister Maliki when they spoke as recently as 21 May. He noted that in a very difficult and challenging year Prime Minister Maliki has done what he could in very difficult situations. I will get some information as to what Australia’s current position is if it is any different from what I have indicated in my answer to the senator.

            , I ask a supplementary question. I note that the minister did not in any sense address the part of the question that dealt with whether there would be any long-term presence in Iraq, but I will continue. Is the minister aware that the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
             US
            </a>
            in Iraq has begun arming Sunni insurgent groups in exchange for halting attacks on US forces? Couldn’t some of these groups have been responsible for attacks against Australian troops? What guarantees can the minister give that the arming of insurgent groups will not cause these groups to attack Australian troops while we are there?

             Admittedly I did not initially hear the question—whether it was the United Kingdom or the United States—but I do not see how that supplementary question arises out of the original question. Assuming that what the senator is really asking me is ‘Would our withdrawal damage the alliance?’ I can say—and repeat—that, as the Prime Minister said on 25 February, America both appreciates our presence in Iraq and wants us to maintain our current commitments. And, as I said in my primary answer, premature withdrawal would embolden terrorists and abandon the Iraqi people. We do not intend to do that.
