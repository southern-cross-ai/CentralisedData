        I wish to inform the Senate that this morning the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_House" rel="nofollow">
         Speaker of the House
        </a>
        , the member for Casey, Mr Tony Smith, submitted his resignation as Speaker to the Governor-General, as he indicated in the last sitting period that he would do. Being new to the role of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_President" rel="nofollow">
         Senate President
        </a>
        , I had only a brief time to work with Tony as my counterpart, but that was all that was necessary to gain an appreciation of the quality that he brought to the role, not only as a facilitator of fair parliamentary debate but also as a manager of this building, its people and its varied workings. Tony became Speaker in 2015, making him the longest serving in the role since
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Snedden" rel="nofollow">
         Billy Snedden
        </a>
        , who served from 1976 to 1983. He put his personal stamp on the role by ensuring that he did not impose himself on proceedings. It should never be about the Speaker, and Tony always understood that. Tony got certain responsibilities that I didn't. He got to exercise 94(a) and also not attend party room, two things that I was slightly envious of but I'm glad I don't have! I wish to thank Tony and his office for all their support and assistance as I transitioned into the role of Senate President. Tony's corporate knowledge, judgement and support on so many matters over the past few weeks have been invaluable in my entry to the role. Although our roles differ as surely as our respective chambers do, I've noted, in particular, Tony's ability to work with parliamentarians of all parties to ensure trust in the process. It is a quality in his performance admired by many, including me, and one that I will endeavour to emulate in my role in this place. On behalf of the Senate, I wish to acknowledge his service.

          Deputy President
         </a>
         , I join my remarks to those of the President. I worked with Tony after becoming Deputy President of the Senate, and I can also say that he was very inclusive. Certainly the President and I did a lot with the Speaker, and I had the honour of attending a couple of conferences with him. He was very inclusive and certainly never played the political card in any of the roles that I saw him in. I'm sad that he's going, but I wish him well in whatever he does next. I thank him particularly for supporting me as the Deputy President.
