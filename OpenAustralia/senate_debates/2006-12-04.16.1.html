        My question is to Senator Abetz, the Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation. Will the minister update the Senate on the current status of the fight against illegal foreign fishing in our northern waters. What recent developments have enhanced the government’s response to this scourge? Further, is the minister aware of any alternative policies?

         I thank Senator Boswell for his question and acknowledge his genuine interest in Australia’s fishing industry. I also congratulate him on securing his party’s support at the weekend so that he can continue to stand up for Australia’s fishing industry for another six years. I am pleased to report to the Senate that encouraging progress is being made in the fight against illegal foreign fishing in our northern waters. As state Labor fisheries ministers agreed when I met with them a few weeks ago, progress is ‘very encouraging’.
        </p>
        <p>
         Let us look at the facts: 357 illegal foreign fishing boats were apprehended and destroyed in our northern waters this calendar year—that is more than one a day; Coastwatch flights are up by eight per cent; and sightings up to the end of September were down 27 per cent on the same period last year. I can tell Senator Boswell that, in his home state of Queensland, sightings up to the end of September are down 35 per cent since the budget when we committed an extra $390 million.
        </p>
        <p>
         More recent figures are also very encouraging. October normally represents a spike in illegal fishing activity. This year, there was a 70 per cent reduction in sightings during the month of October. It is not just the figures saying this; it is the fishermen as well. Recently the Northern Shark Industry Association, whose members work in the waters off the Kimberley, wrote to me saying that they have not seen any Indonesian fishermen over the last two months.
        </p>
        <p>
         But there is more to be done as we strive to keep the number of incursions falling. Recently I met with the Indonesian Minister for Marine Affairs and Fisheries,

         countries met in Jakarta to discuss regional approaches to tackling illegal fishing. This is ahead of a proposed ministerial level meeting in April next year.
        </p>
        <p>
         While Labor squabbles, the Howard government gets on with the process of protecting our borders. While Labor members and senators fall over themselves to defend the rights of fish poachers, the Howard government remains committed to a tough but fair approach. The early results are in and the facts are clear: the Howard government’s tough policies on illegal fishing are having an impact, despite the protestations of the likes of Senator Ludwig and

         I conclude by congratulating the men and women of the
