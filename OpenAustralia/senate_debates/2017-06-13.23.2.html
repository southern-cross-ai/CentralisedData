        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Brandis. Since senators last had the opportunity to ask questions of ministers in question time, there have been further horrific terrorist attacks around the world. These include attacks in Manchester, London, Kabul, Tehran and Minya, and we have lost Australian lives in Melbourne, Baghdad and, of course, most recently in London. I know all of us in this chamber express our deepest sympathies to the families and friends of those lost or harmed in these recent attacks. Can the minister outline how the government is working to assist Australians impacted by these attacks?

         Thank you very much indeed, Senator Wong, for a very timely and important question. Of course, I am sure I speak on behalf of all members of this chamber in expressing our horror and outrage at the terrorist attacks that have occurred since the Senate last met, and, in particular, our grief at the news that Australians have been among the victims both here, in Melbourne last week, and overseas. It is a reminder to us that this is not a problem that exists on the other side of the world; it is not a problem that is not our problem; it is a problem that reaches out, both in a familiar and hospitable city like London and in our own suburban streets, as in Brighton last week, to threaten and take the lives of Australians.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Wong, I want to thank you and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Labor Party
         </a>
         for the spirit of cooperation that you have shown over the past several years in supporting the government in passing the eight tranches of legislation with which we have dealt which have been designed to make Australians safe. The point I would make to the Senate is this: in none of those cases have we been reactive. In none of those cases have we been in the position of, after a terrorism attack, saying, 'We have to rewrite our legislation.' We have anticipated the need so as to avoid it and, as a result, we have saved Australian lives through the work of this chamber and the work of the

               We have worked very closely with regional neighbours. In December 2015 Australia and Indonesia held the first Australia-Indonesia Ministerial Council on Law and Security in Jakarta, and that regional council has met on three occasions thus far, most recently in Jakarta earlier in the year, and will meet again at a venue to be announced in Australia in the second half of this year.
              </p>
              <p>
               Our agencies work with Indonesian agencies in a close and collaborative way, but our cooperation does not merely extend to Indonesia. This is a regional problem and we work with regional neighbours. I recently spoke to the visiting
