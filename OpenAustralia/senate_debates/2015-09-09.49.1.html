         As the honourable senator would know, this is a matter that has been provided to us as a proposal from the Harper review. The government is going through the Harper review and its proposals and giving consideration to the many suggestions therein. We are consulting widely and we will be in a position in due course to announce what our final decision is.
        </p>
        <p>

               , perhaps subsequent to question time it could be clarified with the chamber whether the scope of your ruling is that a minister can say anything she or he likes on any topic if they address the question in the first sentence, because if that is the ruling I would like some clarification. Thank you.

                   Order on both sides. Just a moment, Senator O'Neill. Firstly, we will take that as a genuine error and, secondly, start again with your question.

                    . Do the comments by the small business minister that section 46 of the competition law, 'is a dud, does not work, and is like a hunting dog that won't leave the porch' reflect government policy? If not, what is the government's policy?

                     Mr President, I think you warned all senators, including Senator Wong, about section 203 of our standing orders. I would invite you to enforce it, if the Labor Party want any answers at all.

                       Professor Ian Harper, who undertook a review for and on behalf of the government, has put forward certain suggestions to us, including about section 46. We are working through those in a methodical and purposeful manner and will determine our approach in due course. Having said that, I do not think anybody would doubt that Mr Billson is a true champion of small business.

                        I ask a further supplementary question. I refer to comments by Senator Matt Canavan, who said, 'To protect small businesses we need stronger competition laws, like an effects test.' Who speaks for the government on this—Senator Canavan or the small business minister or the Treasurer? Is Senator Canavan correct when he says there is 'strong support in the party room for an effects test'?

                         Within the coalition, we actually allow debate. We actually allow people to have a view and, indeed, until such time as the government have determined a view, even cabinet ministers can express a view. As there is a debate within the community that is being expressed as to particular approaches to section 46, it is appropriate for my good friend Senator Canavan to also champion the cause of small business as he sees fit, as he believes is within the best interests of his constituents in Queensland. The fact that there might be a diversity of ideas might come as a shock to all those who come out of trade union school and are told exactly what to say, how to say it and when to say it. We actually allow freedom of thought, we socialise those views and as a result—
