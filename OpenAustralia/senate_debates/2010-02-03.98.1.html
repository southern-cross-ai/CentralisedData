         Criminal Code Amendment (Misrepresentation of Age to a Minor) Bill 2010
        </a>
        is an attempt to provide a 21st century solution to a 21st century problem.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The internet has brought many incredible changes into our world, but it has also been abused by people who seek to abuse others.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This bill is a response in part to the tragic murder of 15-year-old Carly Ryan who was killed in 2007 by a 50-year-old man who had posed as a 20-year-old on an internet chat website in order to win over Carly’s trust and ultimately meet with her.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There is no lawful reason why any adult would need to misrepresent their age to a minor while online.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This bill doesn’t seek to censor the internet. It is simply designed to ensure that adults act appropriately in dealing with minors.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This bill will make it a crime for an adult to intentionally misrepresent their age while communicating with someone they believe to be under the age of 18, online.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Currently in many jurisdictions police have to prove a sexual predator has a prurient interest in misrepresenting their identity.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This can be a difficult task and can result in police being unable to act, even when they believe there is a threat.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This bill would remove any doubt. If an adult knowingly lies to a minor about their age online, they have broken the law.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There are three levels of this crime.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The first is when a person over the age of 18 misrepresents their age to a person under the age of 18, and carries a maximum penalty of three years imprisonment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The second is when an adult misrepresents their age to a person under the age of 18 with the intention of making it easier to meet them, and carries a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The third is when an adult misrepresents their age to a person under the age of 18 with the intention of committing an offence and carries a maximum penalty of 8 years.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I note there has been little criticism of this bill since I announced it, with the rare exception of the South Australian Council for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Liberties" rel="nofollow">
         Civil Liberties
        </a>
        who said the solution to online sexual predators is educating children.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Respectfully I must reject this naïve statement and I would say to those who agree with this position, ‘Stop blaming the victim’.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Children are children and it is up to adults to protect them. This Bill assists in doing that.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I seek the support of my fellow parliamentarians for this bill.
