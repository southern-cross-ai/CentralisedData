        I seek leave to move a motion to enable the ballot relating to the appointment of a member to the Joint Select Committee on Cyber-Safety to be recommitted. I also seek leave to provide an explanation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank the Senate. By way of explanation, I advise the Senate that, as there was no advance notification to the Senate in relation to the message that was coming back for that vote, there were some senators absent from the building and unaware that pairs were not operating at that time. As a consequence of not having that notification, they could not then participate in the ballot. It is of course the usual thing that pairs do not operate during a ballot of such a type, but without advance notification senators were unaware that the pairs system would not operate at such a time. Therefore I ask the Senate that the ballot to appoint a senator to the position to be nominated by a minority group or Independent senators to the Joint Select Committee on Cyber-Safety take place on the completion of item 8 on today’s
        <i>
         Order of Business
        </i>
        . That will then allow senators to have sufficient notification, by my statement today, should this motion be agreed to by the Senate. I move:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That the ballot to appoint a senator to the position to be nominated by a minority group or independent senators to the Joint Select Committee on Cyber-Safety take place on the completion of item 8 on today’s Order of Business.

         We accept, albeit reluctantly, the government’s position. I have a question, through the chamber, to the minister. Can he assure the Senate that any errors that occurred in communication will be rectified so this will not happen in the future? I commend
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_Fielding" rel="nofollow">
          Senator Fielding
         </a>
         , who did not object to leave being granted. That is meritorious of Senator Fielding. I also indicate that the advance notification that Senator Ludwig just indicated cuts both ways. One of our senators who went on shadow ministerial duties outside Canberra may well have not gone if we had been given advance notification of the ballot taking place today before he flew out of here yesterday afternoon. The advance notification issue can cut both ways. I do not know what the suitable form of notification is, but maybe that is something for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_Committee" rel="nofollow">
          Procedure Committee

         to examine at a future time. The opposition will be supporting this motion.

          I indicate, responding in reverse order, that with messages provided to the Senate there is usually sufficient notification for people to be aware that a vote will be taken in relation to the message, and usually the whips have sufficient time to advise that there will be no pairing arrangements for that time. I am open to the suggestion that the matter could be referred to the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_Committee" rel="nofollow">
           Procedure Committee
          </a>
          . I certainly would not oppose the opposition referring the matter to the Procedure Committee to examine ways to ensure that clarity is provided in relation to notification.
         </p>
         <p>
          In respect of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_Fielding" rel="nofollow">
           Senator Fielding
          </a>
          , I concur with the remarks made by Senator Parry. In respect of the pairing issue, it is always a challenge around the Senate to get the votes right. That is an easy way of putting it. I do take on board the issues that have been raised, although in this case it was unusual in the sense that it was not a matter, as I understand it, that was mentioned at the whips meeting on the previous evening where messages would normally be provided.
