           On a point of order to the chair, and the President might like to consider this: when a group of farmers expressed a view and applauded in the chamber earlier in the week, they were threatened with removal. They were threatened with removal. My simple point is, quite frankly, if there's going to be applause from the gallery and stuff like that, that's fine, but I know what the standing orders say. But there should be equal treatment of people within the chamber. So, when a farmer comes here and they're threatened with removal from the chamber for applauding from the gallery, I don't see why it's different to somebody from a trade union who comes here and applauds something from the gallery. I do note that you called them to order, but they weren't threatened with removal from the gallery. I just would ask—a simple request—for equal treatment for people in equal circumstances.

            Thank you, Senator Colbeck, for your comments. What I would say to you is that, in relation to the gallery the other day, I called them to order three times, and it was on the third occasion that I threatened to have them removed. With the current gallery, I called them to order twice, and on the second occasion they came to order. I would like to think that I am very fair and impartial at all times. Certainly, in the gallery the other day, on the third occasion, I threatened to have them removed because as President of this place I should not have to do it three times, whether it's in the chamber or in the gallery. So I thank you for your comments.
