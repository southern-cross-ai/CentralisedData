        My question is to the Minister for Aged Care and Senior Australians, Senator Colbeck. On 11 March the minister said in a media release that the Morrison government would:

       <p class="italic">
        … support aged care providers with personal protective equipment (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPE" rel="nofollow">

        ) resources for staff where it is needed, as part of the infection control measures.
       </p>
       <p>
        The royal commission heard evidence that aged-care workers were told they could use only two masks per shift and only one glove. How did the minister allow this to happen?

So every aged-care facility that has had a COVID-19 outbreak has had PPE provided to it. In fact, if you go back to that point in time you will note that there was a global shortage of PPE. This government has built a significant stockpile of PPE to provide—

           It's on direct relevance. There was a direct question about two masks per shift and only one glove. It's reasonable, I think, for Australians to know why that occurred on this minister's watch. I would ask him to respond to that aspect of the question.

              I'm listening carefully to the answer. The minister is talking about personal protective equipment and its provision, which is directly relevant to the question. There's an opportunity to debate questions after question time, but the minister is being directly relevant.

                     Senator Wong, that was part of the question. The minister's talking about the provision of and requirement for this equipment. I hold that he is being directly relevant. There is an opportunity to debate it after question time.
