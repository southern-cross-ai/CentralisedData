        Yesterday, Senator Bushby asked me a question in relation to Tasmanian rail freight services. I seek the leave to incorporate further information in
        <i>
         Hansard.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.

        The answer read as follows—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Senator Bushby—Tasmania: Rail Infrastructure—Further Information
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The former
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Government
        </a>
        agreed to a rail rescue package in Tasmania during the course of 2006-07. As part of the package the Australian Government agreed to provide $78 million over a 10 year period to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmanian_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Tasmanian Government
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Separately, the Tasmanian Government entered into a Memorandum of Understanding in August 2006 with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_National" rel="nofollow">
         Pacific National
        </a>
        which established a number of commitments by Pacific National regarding its rail operations in Tasmania.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The key elements of the overall rescue package agreed to by the Australian Government entailed the following:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Pacific National, which owned the Tasmanian track, passed ownership to the Tasmanian Government at no cost;
        </li>
        <li>
         The Tasmanian Government, as track owner, established an access regime with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
          ACCC
         </a>
         . Under this access regime it is open to any company or group to run trains in Tasmania, not just Pacific National;
        </li>
        <li>
         Pacific National committed to providing a non-bulk rail freight service for 10 years unless certain trigger events occurred such as a fall in loads;
        </li>
        <li>
         The Australian Government committed to provide capital funding for upgrading the railway line at a cost of $78 million over 10 years.
        </li>
        <li>
         The Tasmanian Government committed to fund maintenance costs estimated at $4 million a year to ensure the line is kept in good repair; and
        </li>
        <li>
         Pacific National was to contribute at least $38 million, to be provided within three years, for rolling stock replacements and improvements.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government is not a party to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOU" rel="nofollow">
         MOU
        </a>
        between the Tasmanian Government and Pacific National—our agreement is with the Tasmanian Government only who are responsible for the rail network in Tasmania.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To date the Australian Government has paid $16.871 million to the Tasmanian Government as part of the $78 million, 10 year rail rescue package. Payments commenced in 2007 with $1.582 million being provided in 2006-07. $15.289 million has been paid to date in 2007-08.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I understand this funding to date has been used to purchase rail sleepers which will be used by the Tasmanian Government as part of the upgrade of its lines.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        has sought confirmation from the Tasmanian Government that Pacific National has met its contractual arrangements with the Tasmanian Government.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government is committed to increasing rail’s share of the national freight task and we have made a number of substantial commitments to rail in Tasmania.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Ultimately decisions related to services on the Tasmanian rail network are matters for the state government as track owner, and Pacific National, as the current service provider, to determine.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government welcomes the statements made by Pacific National that it is working with the Tasmanian Government to ensure rail services continue while the sale process takes place.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government will be having discussions with the Tasmanian Government about our current and future funding commitments and the legal and other implications of the announcement by Pacific National.
