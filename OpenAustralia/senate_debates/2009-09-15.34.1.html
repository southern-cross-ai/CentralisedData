         Local Government
        </a>
        , Senator Conroy. I refer the minister to the decision of the government, announced in the green paper of 2 December last year, to exclude

         Badgerys Creek
        </a>
        as a potential site for Sydney’s second airport. Can the government now provide a guarantee to residents of the Sydney basin that it has also ruled out Kurnell, Holsworthy army base and Richmond as potential sites for a second airport?

         I will attempt to give you as much information as I have at this stage, Senator Payne. While approving the 2009 Sydney Airport Master Plan, the government made it clear that Sydney will require new airport capacity in the future. The process of identifying additional airport capacity needs to be considered in the context of strategic transport planning for the Sydney region. The Australian government has invited the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         government to participate in a joint study to assess options, potential sites and investment strategies for additional airport capacity for the Sydney region. This joint study will also consider ways to improve the public transport links and roadways to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingsford_Smith" rel="nofollow">
          Kingsford Smith

         airport and, in due course, the potential second Sydney airport. It will also consider the future of the

          Badgerys Creek
         </a>
         site, given the government has ruled it out as an option for a second Sydney airport. I will not be speculating on possible sites for a second airport. If there is any further information that the minister is able to provide in answering the question, I will seek it and get it to you as fast as possible.

            That is right. Senator Minchin, any time you want to go there, the address is www.dbcde.gov.au. Senator Payne, I am happy to seek any further information from the minister in answer to those questions and come back to you as soon as possible.

             I thank the minister very much for the undertaking as to further information and I ask a further supplementary question. Can the minister also advise whether it is the government’s policy that the provisions of the long-term operating plan for Sydney (

             ) Airport only apply to aircraft flying below a certain height and only to certain airspace around the airport and whether the government believes it is acceptable for families to be consistently disturbed by significant amounts of aircraft noise?
