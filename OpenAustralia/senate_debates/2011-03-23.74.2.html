         by leave—During this parliament we have had by and large a non-political approach to disability issues. It is somewhat disappointing that the coalition and the Greens have put up this motion in this way. The government clearly supports—can I put it on the record—the first four points of the motion but cannot agree with the final point.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is a well respected principle that parliaments are not the best place to make operational decisions on the delivery of programs or select the preferred providers of programs such as this. Whilst Ai-Live have demonstrated to the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers, there are a range of other technologies both in current use and in development that may also assist children who are hearing impaired or who are deaf with their education. This government is committed to providing world-class education for all children and has demonstrated that through delivering the national curriculum, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BER" rel="nofollow">

         program and the current review of funding for schools under Mr David Gonski. We will not and should not decide in this place which company should be funded to provide assistive technologies to our children. Surely, with respect, this is best done through the appropriate processes.

            Firstly, if the government had wanted to ask us to amend this motion, they should have contacted me. I had no contact from the government about this. It is usual practice for them to contact people, and I am sure that Senator Fifield would have joined me in accommodating a discussion with the minister about this.
           </p>
           <p>
            Secondly, this is an excellent program. I have seen it demonstrated a number of times and it has shown excellent and promising results. The problem at the moment is that there is no proper system through which people can get support for this type of project. There is no clear path. What happens is that people have to jump through a variety of hoops with there being no clear process to get funding for good projects. What we have here is good technology that is showing promising results and that is worth funding. And this could apply to another type of technology. We have seen a student, for example, go from the bottom of a class to the top of the class in three weeks using this technology. It is time that we saw this work at a larger scale. I do not like people not having clear access to this sort of technology, which would really help people with hearing impairments. We are saying to the government that they should please look at this. People have been jumping through hoops and not getting anywhere, which denies people with disabilities access to this sort of good support. If the government wants to come back to us and modify the motion, please talk to us.

              <p>
               I agree with Senator Siewert. The opposition would have been very happy to make amendments to this motion so that there could have been unanimity. One of the reasons that the opposition is keen to support this motion is because funding a pilot program would enable this particular product to be made available to students with hearing impairments throughout Australia. Should a coalition government be elected, this is the sort of support for students with disabilities that the coalition’s education card, announced at the last election, would support. Up to $20,000 would be available to be directed to the school of the parent’s choice. This is exactly the sort of technology that that education card should support.
              </p>
              <p>
               This is an extremely worthy project. The money in question to support the trial is not large. I and Senator Siewert would be absolutely delighted if shortly the government found its way clear to supporting this sort of project. It is a good project because it has demonstrated its effectiveness by lifting dramatically the educational outcomes of individual students in a short period of time. This is something very practical, very achievable and very doable. It is something that could be rolled out in a very short period of time. This particular pilot project or trial is well worth the government supporting and I hope that they see their way clear to doing so.
