        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Birmingham. Can the minister tell the Senate who was the social services minister in 2016 when the robodebt scheme was first introduced?

         I don't have the precise dates of various ministerial arrangements committed to memory. However, I am willing to assume—particularly given, I assume, that this is meant to be a clever set-up of the next question—that Mr Morrison would have been the minister at the time.

           Can the minister advise who was the Treasurer that bragged that robodebt was proof of the social welfare system being 'better managed'?

            Unsurprisingly, I don't have the quotations of every single individual committed to memory. But I am again willing to assume, in terms of clever Labor Party tactics, that Senator Wong already knows the answer to that. Senator Wong is assuming that the answer to the question is Mr Morrison. In fact, she already knows that that is probably the answer to the question. Senator Wong and, I expect, everybody in this place would believe that debts ought to be recovered. Obviously, there have been issues in relation to this matter; the government has worked through those matters, including repayments in relation to it.

               As I just said, repayments have been made in relation to this program; a process has been gone through and repayments have been made. In no way should that take away from the fact that, where claims are made and repayments ought to be recovered, governments ought to find ways to undertake to recover those funds. That's an important principle that ought not be lost, notwithstanding the challenges in relation to this program and the fact that those repayments have had to be made.
