        My question is, I believe, to the Minister representing the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Social Services
        </a>
        , Minister McAllister, but I'm also happy if Minister Gallagher thinks it's more in her patch. There have been now at least 45 women murdered this year, and the rates of violence against women are increasing. The women's safety sector has repeatedly called for $1 billion each year for frontline services, including legal services, to ensure that no-one who seeks help has to be turned away and go back to violence. Today, the Domestic, Family and Sexual Violence Commissioner warned that the women's safety sector is already buckling, and she said that, when there's an increase in reporting, frontline services need more support to meet increased demand. When will the Albanese government commit $1 billion per year to properly resource frontline services?

         We know that too many women are killed by their current or former intimate partner. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIC" rel="nofollow">
          AIC
         </a>
         's latest data update indicates that there were 43 female victims of intimate-partner homicide in 2023-24. It's a pretty stark reminder of the human cost of this violence and it is why the government is deeply committed to addressing this national crisis. In the two years since coming to government, we have taken the crisis of men's violence against women seriously, through a range of measures including the introduction of paid family and domestic violence leave.
        </p>
        <p>
         You ask about funding. Funding in the 2024-25 budget brings government investment to over $3.4 billion to support women's safety and implement the National Plan to End Violence against
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_and_Children" rel="nofollow">
          Women and Children
         </a>
         . That plan was developed in partnership with the sector and with victims-survivors and was agreed with all states and territories. That funding brings together the investments that we have made across our budgets in support of the national plan. We've been focused on supporting economic security so women don't have to choose between poverty and violence. We've been investing in housing so women know they have a place to go. We have been strengthening the legal system's response to gendered violence, implementing all of the 55

         to prevent sexual harassment. We have been working with the states and territories to fund frontline services. We've extended the national partnership on frontline service funding and provided funding to states for 500 more frontline service workers, and we are sharpening the focus on prevention so we can end violence in a generation.

            The government appreciates greatly the work that has been done through the committee that Senator Cox contributed to with such distinction and that I understand was chaired by Senator Scarr. We appreciate that the statistics and experiences of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
             First Nations
            </a>
            women in relation to violence are unacceptable and need to be addressed. It's on that basis that an action plan has been developed and agreed with First Nations women as part of the national plan to end violence against women. The government has a continuing commitment to work with First Nations women to improve this in a collaborative way that meets their needs and their priorities.

              The commissioner also said today that sexual violence is often left out of the conversation, and yet there's been an 11 per cent increase in sexual violence in the last year. Will the government commit to increasing funding, specifically for sexual violence services? And can you please answer this question? One out of three is better than none.

               No woman or girl should have to experience sexual violence in their life, and the government is leading national efforts to prevent sexual violence and support the victims-survivors who experience it. We are partnering with states and territories to strengthen and harmonise the laws in relation to sexual assault and consent, and we're providing $14.7 million in the 2023-24 budget to strengthen how the criminal justice system responds to sexual assault. We are funding an
