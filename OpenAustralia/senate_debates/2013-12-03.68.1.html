        My question is to the Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Senator Cash. At the election, voters in my state strongly supported the reinstatement of temporary protection visas. Can the minister explain how the government will honour its promise to deny permanent residency to people who illegally arrive in Australia by boat?

         I thank Senator Smith for his question. I advise the Senate as follows. As the Prime Minister said today in a press conference prior to question time: this government will never allow people who come here illegally by boat to obtain permanent residency in Australia. The message to people smugglers is clear: 'You should not come, because you will not stay'.
        </p>
        <p>
         Just like the former Howard government, the Abbott government is the most potent weapon that we have against people smugglers. What this government has that the former government never had is resolve. Unlike those opposite, who were prepared to grant permanent visas to over 33,000 people who are in this community on bridging visas, sending a clear sign to people smugglers that Australia is open for that type of business, you will not see the Abbott government making that mistake.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our resolve is clear; our commitment to the Australian people is clear, despite the very best efforts of those opposite. You can try as hard as you like, but you cannot deny the fact that this government is implementing policies that work. In relation to those who arrived illegally by boat under the former government and who have not yet been processed, the resolve of this government and our commitment to the Australian people is that they will not receive permanent visas.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Are there any threats to the government's efforts to stop people smugglers luring people into making dangerous boat journeys to Australia on the promise of attaining permanent visas?

           I think it is very clear to all of those present that the only threat to the coalition's strong border protection policies is those opposite. That was made clear to the people of Australia last night. Those opposite should listen to words of the previous Minister for Foreign Affairs,

           , who offered them one piece of advice, but it was a very good piece of advice. He said that there 'should not be a bit of daylight' between

           and Labor on irregular migration; 'If you want to embrace the Greens-Left-Fairfax-ABC position, you are going to go backwards at the next election'.
          </p>
          <p>
           The opposition may want to continue to be in an unholy alliance with the Greens but that will not stop the resolve of this government.

             As the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection said today, whether you came here illegally three weeks ago or three months ago, you will not receive a permanent visa under this government. And in relation to those who have come post-19 July, again, the resolve of this government is very clear: you will be processed offshore, you will be sent to Nauru, you will be sent to
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manus_Island" rel="nofollow">
              Manus Island
             </a>
             , you will settle there unless you choose to return home, but—unlike with the former government, who quite happily worked with the people smugglers to assist them in plying their evil trade—you will not come to Australia. We have implemented Operation Sovereign Borders and we know that, unlike those others, these policies will work.
