       <p>
        I wish to make a statement in relation to unparliamentary language. Before question time today, senators may recall that Senator Bernardi asked whether there were precedents for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_President" rel="nofollow">
         Deputy President
        </a>
        s making what could be characterised as partisan speeches. I can assure the Senate that researchers have revealed that there are many such speeches by former Deputy Presidents, including on the address-in-reply. The election of a senator to the position of Deputy President does not require that senator to refrain from expressing a partisan point of view, where they consider it is appropriate. But, of course, they are completely impartial in the chair.
       </p>
       <p>
        Senator Bernardi also asked me to review part of Senator Lambie's contribution on the address-in-reply debate earlier today. Senator Seselja took a point of order suggesting that Senator Lambie should be asked to withdraw reflections upon Senator Bernardi. The Acting Deputy President suggested that Senator Lambie should consider rephrasing her comments, and Senator Lambie resumed her speech. Senator Seselja took a further point of order again asking that the initial reflections be withdrawn. Senator Collins, on the same point of order, indicated her view that Senator Lambie had been in the process of rephrasing her comments, as requested by the chair. The Acting Deputy President appears to have accepted this to be the case and did not require a withdrawal. Senator Seselja did not press the point any further.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not entirely clear to me that Senator Lambie was, in fact, in the process of rephrasing her earlier references, but it appears to have been accepted by the chamber that this was the case. Certainly, it would have been inappropriate for the original remarks to stand, and the suggestion that Senator Lambie withdraw or rephrase the comments was appropriate.
       </p>
       <p>
        During this point of order Senator Seselja also suggested that Senator Lambie should be asked to withdraw the use of the term 'hypocrites'. Senator Collins, again on the point of order, suggested that the use of the term in that collective way was not out of order, and this appears to have been accepted, also. I remind the Senate that unparliamentary language does not cease to be unparliamentary merely because it is directed at a group of members or senators rather than to an individual. I remind all senators that they should refer to other members of this place appropriately.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also remind senators that requests for withdrawal of words must be made at the time. Such requests cannot be made retrospectively. This is in accordance with rulings of past Presidents over many decades, and reflects the duty of the chair to maintain order. It would simply not be feasible for senators to be able to revisit past debates and insist on the withdrawal of words after the event.
