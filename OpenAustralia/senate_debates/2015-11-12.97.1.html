        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Brandis. I refer to the foreign minister who said earlier today that she was aware that her chief of staff attended a meeting of conspirators at Mr Hendy's house on the eve of the leadership coup, because:

       <p>
        Is it part of Ms Bishop's job to orchestrate challenges against the sitting Prime Minister?

I will invoke the provisions of standing order 203 if you continue on this track. You do not have the right to speak, until I call you. You have been constantly

               Honestly, Senator Gallagher, I believe that Professor Peter van Onselen, who is a well-known political scientist and political historian, has written a book about these events. It is a history book. These events are now a part of history. They are so much a part of history that political historians have consigned them, literally, to history. We know that there was a change of leadership of the Liberal Party some two months ago. We know that that happened two months ago, and it is now part of Australian political history. If you want to read about it, I suggest you read Professor Peter van Onselen's book.
