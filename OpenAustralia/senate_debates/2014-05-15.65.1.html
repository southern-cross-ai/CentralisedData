       <p>
        The Labor Party has two amendments to this bill, but, before I go to the detail of the amendments, let us deal with the ideology of the coalition in this bill and the ideology that has been espoused by Senator Ryan on behalf of the coalition. This is about penal provisions against young people in this country. When you add this bill to what we have seen announced in the budget, we have one of the most draconian systems for young people anywhere in the world. I never thought we would see a position where an egalitarian society like Australia would walk away from some of the most vulnerable people in our country—that is, young people—but we are walking away from young people, imposing these draconian rules and regulations on young people and treating them as if they are lazy, treating them as if they are not prepared to actually get a job. It is the old dole bludger syndrome.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have to say that, when you look at all of the welfare approach by the coalition, the coalition has more in common with Mississippi than Melbourne. It has more in common with Mississippi. It is down there with the worst aspects of social engineering. I am sure that the IPA is up to its neck in it. That is why Senator Scott Ryan is up there running all this right-wing agenda that says: 'If you can't get a job then you're a dole bludger. If you can't get a job, we're going to take penal provisions against you.' This is outrageous from the coalition. This is outrageous.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to see some of the senators across there go out to Penrith and talk to the young people out there. Go to the real world and talk to their mothers and fathers. Talk to the young kids who cannot get a job. Go to

        . Talk to the kids who cannot get a job out there. Tell them they have to live with nothing for six months. What is it with you guys? This is not an egalitarian society; it is Mississippi, or maybe it is even Tennessee. I do not know which one is the worst, but you guys will go for the worst aspect of both of them. You hammer the pensioners. You hammer young people. You are just unreasonable in your approach. The end of the egalitarian society is here with this budget.
       </p>
       <p>
        Well, we are going to fight it. We will fight it. We are not going to allow you to destroy Medicare. We are not going to allow you to destroy a decent social system in this country because of your ideology. It is absolutely outrageous—on the beck and call of

        , on the beck and call of Twiggy Forrest, on the beck and call of the people who line your pockets. That is what it is. They want to bring the 457 visas in. They want to rip off the welfare system. They want to make sure that you guys pay for the money that goes into your pocket from Gina Rinehart. That is what it is all about.
