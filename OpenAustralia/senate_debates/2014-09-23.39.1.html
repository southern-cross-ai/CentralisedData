        My question is to Senator Fifield, the Minister representing the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Social Services
        </a>
        . I refer to a recommendation in the Forrest report for a 'cashless healthy welfare card', and to suggestions that it might continue income management in an expanded scheme. Is the government planning to continue income management with the so-called cashless welfare card? If so: to whom will it apply; how many people will be affected; and what are the time lines for its implementation?

         As Senator Siewert implies in her question, it is recognised that the Forrest review is a watershed moment in Indigenous affairs, and provides a strong framework for Indigenous reform. Many Indigenous leaders—as is well known—have supported the call for reform, including people like

         and

         and members of the Prime Minister's Indigenous Advisory Council.
        </p>
        <p>
         Public consultations on the review—including town hall style meetings and roundtables with key stakeholders—have taken place around the nation. The government is considering future directions for the current income management program in light of the Forrest review and the review of Australia's welfare system.
        </p>
        <p>
         The findings of evaluation reports on various trials of income management are expected to be finalised in coming months and will feed into the next steps. The government will look at options to streamline the program and improve effectiveness, including opportunities provided by emerging card technologies. The government is very committed to helping stabilise the finances and lives of the most vulnerable families and to reducing social dysfunction where it exists in some communities.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government also announced in the budget that income management will continue in a number of existing trial sites until 30 June 2015 as well as being rolled out to the Ceduna region of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         for a one-year trial following positive community consultations.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are currently over 25,000 people on income management in locations across Australia. I can indicate that evaluations have shown that income management has had positive impacts in meeting priority needs, reducing financial harassment and promoting socially responsible behaviour.

          , I ask a supplementary question. There is no evidence of a conclusion that income management is effective. What is the 'evidence' that the minister refers to that shows that income management works? Has the government received the final report of the evaluation of the new income management in the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
           Northern Territory
          </a>
          ? If so, is it considering that as its so-called evidence?

           The most recent report—a review of child protection income management in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            Western Australia
           </a>
           , released in March this year—shows that income management has helped families in Perth and Kimberley to buy essentials for their children and that it has contributed towards a reduction in violence and substance abuse—and their negative effects—and towards improving housing stability.
          </p>
          <p>
           As I have indicated, it is the work of the Forrest review which will be taken into account—also the work of the other welfare review that is being undertaken. And obviously the government will consider any and all evaluations.

Could the minister please answer the question as to whether the final report of the evaluation of the new income management has been received by the government? If it has—and even if it has not—will the government undertake to release that report as soon as possible so that that information is available to the public?
