        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Brandis. I refer to the resignation of Professor Clive Hamilton from the

         Professor Hamilton
        </a>
        resigned saying that it was 'perverse' that the government would be boosting coal when 2016 marked the hottest year on record. He also bemoaned the fact that the Climate Change Authority no longer had any role in the development of climate policy in Australia. Minister, with Sydney just having experienced its hottest month on record and

        now in the midst of climate change related bushfires, do you accept the independent advice of the Climate Change Authority that burning more coal will lead to more extreme weather and bushfires such as those being experienced currently in New South Wales?

          Senator Di Natale, with all due respect to Professor Clive Hamilton, I doubt his resignation from the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
           Climate Change
          </a>
          Authority is going to increase the temperature, any more than I think his continuation as a member of the Climate Change Authority was going to reduce the temperature. Nevertheless, I have been advised that
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor_Hamilton" rel="nofollow">
           Professor Hamilton
          </a>
          has resigned as a member of that authority. But I point out that his appointment was due to expire on 30 June in any event. So the departure of Professor Hamilton from the Climate Change Authority has brought the matter forward by some 4½ months. He has served on the Climate Change Authority since 2012.
         </p>
         <p>
          I am aware as well that Professor Hamilton has expressed some very, very strong views on the issue of climate policy. We on this side of the chamber welcome all views on this important issue of public policy. We welcome all views, including the views of Professor Hamilton. We welcome the views of people we agree with and we welcome the views of people we disagree with, because that is the way policy and legislation should be formed in a liberal democracy. The fact is, Senator Di Natale—as you should know—that as a result of our signature to the Paris climate change convention Australia has adopted, per capita, the most ambitious emissions reduction targets in the world. And Australia is on track to meet its emissions reduction targets. So, Senator Di Natale, we do not believe, as you do apparently as a matter of ideology, that renewable energy—

                   I will deal with Senator Macdonald's point of order first. I have noticed in recent months—in fact, probably in recent years—that supplementary questions have not strictly been related to the primary question exactly. However, I have allowed a lot of latitude and I think that is something that I will continue to allow, because it is on topic although not directly related to the primary question. So, Senator Macdonald, in that sense you are right, but I have allowed this to happen for some time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   In relation to the first point of order, Senator Di Natale, apart from your preamble, your sole question was: can you explain why the Prime Minister lied to the Australian people? The Attorney-General up-front rejected that, so the Attorney-General has been relevant to your direct question. Attorney-General, you have the call.

                    I am simply pointing out to you, Senator Di Natale, that the Australian Energy Market Operator's analysis supported what the Prime Minister had to say.

                       Well, Senator Di Natale, with a question as broad as that, you do give me a lot of latitude, so let me take advantage of the latitude you have given me. As I said in answer to your primary question, under the leadership of Mr Turnbull, at the Paris climate change conference Australia adopted per capita the most ambitious emissions control targets in the world—the most ambitious targets in the world. But also under the leadership of Mr Turnbull the Australian government takes a technology agnostic approach, not an ideological approach, as you do—the very opposite of the science which you constantly invoke, Senator Di Natale, but an ideological approach which refuses to countenance the fact that the best results will be delivered to the Australian public, as they ought to have been delivered to the public of
