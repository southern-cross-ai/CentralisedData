         I thank Senator Ferguson for his question and his deep interest in this portfolio. I am sure that all senators are very interested in this very vexing question. Senators would be aware of

         ’s claim that it conducted a nuclear weapons test despite Australian and international calls to exercise restraint. Reports suggest that the test occurred at approximately 10.36 am local time yesterday at Hwaderi, near Kilju. The seismic tremor was estimated to have been 3.5 on the richter scale. The test represents a grave setback to the peaceful resolution of Korean peninsula tensions and it is a fundamental blow to regional stability. North Korea’s record in the region is poor and the region has long endured its provocations, but this nuclear test is the most outrageous action to date.
        </p>
        <p>
         North Korea acts in flagrant disregard for the international community and its resolve for a strong international nuclear non-proliferation regime and opposition to nuclear testing. These tests also fly in the face of North Korea’s oft-repeated claim that it desires a nuclear-free Korean peninsula. They also defy the spirit in which the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council" rel="nofollow">

         resolution 1695 was unanimously adopted. National security and prosperity will never result from the possession of weapons of mass destruction and threatening behaviour. It can only be found in dialogue, we suggest, and peaceful coexistence and commerce with neighbouring countries and the international community. The

         government must understand that its offensive and ill-considered actions will have severe consequences and that provocative behaviour will not secure its future.
        </p>
        <p>
         The foreign minister, Mr Downer, called in the Ambassador of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_People" rel="nofollow">
          Democratic People
         </a>
         ’s Republic of Korea, His Excellency Mr Chon Jae Hong, this morning to register these concerns in the strongest possible terms. The government has also decided to block the future granting of visas to North Korean citizens and has initiated the cancellation of all existing visas for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPRK" rel="nofollow">
          DPRK
         </a>
         citizens, with some very limited exceptions. At this time the government is choosing to continue to engage in dialogue with North Korea. It is not presently proposed that Ambassador Chon will be asked to leave. Australia’s financial sanctions against companies and an individual connected with involvement in financing North Korea’s continuing efforts to develop its nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction programs will continue, consistent with similar action taken by Japan and the United States.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government will remain vigilant on this issue and will actively promote a concerted, strong international response to North Korea through key regional mechanisms such as
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APEC" rel="nofollow">

         and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN" rel="nofollow">
          ASEAN
         </a>
         Regional Forum. Other bilateral actions will be considered in due course. North Korea’s own actions have only sharpened the country’s isolation from the international community. North Korea is denying its people a more promising economic future. So far as this government is concerned, it is the North Korean people who matter the most. The Australian government remains seriously concerned about their welfare and will continue to provide humanitarian support through multilateral agencies in the form of food and other aid to the North Korean people.
