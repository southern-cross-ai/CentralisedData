        My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Watt. Yesterday in question time, when pressured on how many passengers have walked through sanitised foot mats, the minister said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A hundred per cent of passengers have been walking through sanitised foot mats.
       </p>
       <p>
        The minister has clearly misled the Senate. In fact, tens of thousands of passengers have disembarked from Bali since the outbreak in Bali on 5 July and the installation of the foot mats only this week without footwear being disinfected. I wrote to the minister informing him of this misleading statement yesterday, and he still has not taken the opportunity to correct the record and make a ministerial explanation to the Senate.

           Well, that's a pretty sad way for this question time to start out today, given that I think on three or four occasions yesterday I actually answered the question that you are asking. I have received a letter from you, which I have signed a response to. You may have even received it by now.
          </p>
          <p>
           Well, maybe talk to your office, but we certainly have signed off a response. I will confirm yet again—I'm probably up to five times, six times, seven times—that 100 per cent of passengers who have returned to Australia from Indonesia since the foot mats were in place on Monday and Tuesday—

               It is rather interesting that it is only since the election and their going into the opposition that the opposition have become interested in foot mats, because, of course, this outbreak reached Indonesia on 9 May. What did the opposition do about foot mats or biosecurity zones or any of the things that we've done in response to the outbreak? Well, I'll tell you what they did. The former minister, Mr Littleproud, when the outbreak reached—oh, come on!

                       As I was saying, I am pleased the opposition has become interested in foot mats, because when this outbreak reached Indonesia on 9 May, what did the former Minister for Agriculture Mr Littleproud do? Did he introduce foot mats? Did he introduce a biosecurity response? No. Do you know what he did? He sent a tweet! He sent a tweet; that is the only thing Minister Littleproud did at the time. And then he didn't say anything until 6 July.

Former Minister Littleproud was not the only person to say nothing about foot mats or the outbreak until it got to Bali. We heard nothing from Senator

If the minister wishes to answer, obviously, it's a matter for him, but that is not, in my submission, a supplementary to the primary question.

                                         President, on the point of order: both the question and the supplementary question relate to the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in Indonesia. Both of them relate to answers given by Senator Watt in question time yesterday on the same related issue. It is demonstrably a supplementary question to the primary question, and you should rule Senator Wong's point of order out of order.

                                                  Thank you, President. As I was saying: we have ordered vaccines for Australia and we have them in a vaccine bank to ensure that we are properly prepared for a foot-and-mouth disease outbreak, should it reach Australia. The former minister's question goes to Indonesian vaccines. Now, I know this might come as a surprise to the opposition, because it's something they never practiced when they were in government, but, when you work with other countries, you need to do it cooperatively. You actually need to develop a partnership relationship as opposed to the kind of relationship your government cultivated with our friends in South-

                                                  So, when the Prime Minister was in Indonesia—where he was very well received, I might point out—he offered assistance in the form of vaccines to the Indonesian government. At that point in time, they decided to pursue their own interests. We have since, as a result of my visit, offered a million, and they're coming.

                                                    Yesterday, the minister said, 'Biosecurity officers will not only be deployed into airports; they will be deployed into mail centres' as well. How many of the 18 new biosecurity officers are currently operational at mail centres? Which mail centres are they, and what is their specific foot-and-mouth disease passenger intervention task?

                                                         My intention, as is normal practice, is to answer the questions that I took on notice yesterday at the end of question time today, which is what many ministers on your side of the chamber have done.
                                                        </p>

                                                         The answer is that my announcement was that our new funding, funding that your government, when you were in power, did not commit and did not implement, will deliver 18 new biosecurity officers. They are currently being recruited, and, in the meantime, we have employed 65 contractors and 10 other officers. Again, I make the point that every action we have taken—sanitation foot mats, biosecurity response zones, extra biosecurity officers—were never taken by your government when this outbreak got to Indonesia. All you did was send tweets.

                                                              Whilst undertaking that review, I would encourage you to look back at past consideration of questions that were asked. I think you will find that, in terms of the relationship between the question that is asked and the supplementary questions, oftentimes that relationship relates very specifically to the subject matter and the flow of the small issues related to those subjects. In this case, the discussion of foot mats and the discussion of vaccines being supplied to Indonesia clearly all relate to the foot-and-mouth outbreak and are following the very common practice since the process of having a primary question and two supplementary questions was introduced into the Senate.

Question time yesterday had a very small number of questions asked and time was consumed by excessive points of order. I just simply ask senators, including Senator Wong and Senator Birmingham, to consider the passage of time while they are making their points of order.
