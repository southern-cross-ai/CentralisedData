        My question is to the Minister for the Arts and Sport, Senator Kemp. Will the minister update the Senate on the results of the Melbourne

         I thank Senator McGauran, my colleague, for that very important question. It is very important that colleagues take an interest in sport, and I encourage the shadow minister to also take a very active interest in this area. I have gone through the many achievements of the

         . The Commonwealth Games, by every measure, were an outstanding success.
        </p>
        <p>
         One point I did not make yesterday was that another significant achievement of the 2006 Commonwealth Games was the antidoping program conducted by the

            Senator Campbell, you might be bored by it, but a lot of Australians are very interested. That is another example of the Labor Party being out of touch. According to the

            , the games’ antidoping program met its target of conducting some 1,000 tests, substantially more than the number of tests conducted at the Manchester games.

              <p>
               As I was trying to say over the rowdiness of the Labor Party, in the lead-up to the Melbourne
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Games" rel="nofollow">
                Commonwealth Games
               </a>
               , I announced the creation of a new antidoping body,
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASADA" rel="nofollow">
                ASADA
               </a>
               , which underscored Australia’s absolute commitment to maintaining its fight against drugs in sport. ASADA, I am pleased to say, is open for business, and I thank those opposite for their support of the legislation which enabled ASADA to open for business throughout the Commonwealth Games. ASADA is the focal point for Australia’s antidoping activities, which include testing, investigation, presentation of cases, research and education. Those who know the Black report will recall that in 1990 Senator John Black, a Labor Party senator, proposed a similar body. Regrettably, the Labor Party in that period failed to take up that proposal from Senator John Black, but I am very pleased to be the sports minister that has brought in this new, very important antidoping body.
              </p>
              <p>
               It is important that I bring to the attention of the Senate the reaction of other important bodies to the creation of ASADA. David Howman,
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_General" rel="nofollow">
                Director General
               </a>
               of the World Anti-Doping Agency, said that ASADA is the model for the rest of the world. He also said that he will be promoting the ASADA model—the model that Australia has created—to a world antidoping conference which will be held in June this year. All Australians can be proud of our international name for achieving great sporting success without the use of drugs. The establishment of ASADA will continue to further the reputation of Australia in leading the fight against antidoping in sport.
