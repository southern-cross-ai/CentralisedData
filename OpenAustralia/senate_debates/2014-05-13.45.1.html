        My question is to the Minister for Indigenous Affairs, Senator Scullion. I refer to the conflict of interest in the minister's office that caused the resignation of his adviser Mr William Johnstone. When did the minister first learn of Mr Johnstone's interests as director and majority shareholder of the Indigenous Development Corporation and as founder and leading executive of Indigenous Corporate Partners?

         I thank the senator for the question. I can assure you that, like all members of this government, I take the Statement of Standards for Ministerial Staff very seriously. This government recognises the importance of appropriate governance arrangements for staff. Mr Johnstone came on board to assist in the set-up of the Remote School Attendance Strategy in late 2013. There was no intentional impropriety by a member of my staff. However, Mr Johnstone has resigned. He is committed and passionate about advancing the wellbeing of

         and I am sure that he will continue to make an invaluable contribution to this area.

           Mr Johnstone advised me—that is, in relation to your first question, Senator—that the Indigenous Development Corporation is a company comprising himself and one other which conducted occasional consultancy work. Mr Johnstone has advised that he was not doing any work for the company whilst in my office.

            , I rise on a point of order going to relevance. The specific question is about the timing of this information exchange. The minister so far has not talked to any position of timing. Mr President, I ask you to draw the minister's attention to the specific question, which is about when this information was exchanged.
