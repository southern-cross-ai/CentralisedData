        , Senator Watt. The 2017 Launceston City Deal identified 33 projects to increase job growth and support an increase in population, all while creating a vibrant liveable city. Five more projects were later added. The city deal has delivered a number of projects that bring new life into my home city of Lonnie, including the

        revamp and the Tamar Estuary improvements. In 2019, the Launceston City Deal was extended to be a 10-year plan ending in 2027. Minister King has committed to finishing off the existing programs. Of the 38 projects promised to the people of Launceston, how many have actually been delivered?

         Thank you, Senator

         . I recognise your commitment to seeking better and more modern infrastructure for Tasmania. When it comes to Launceston, I know that's an ambition that's shared in particular by Senator Polley, who's based in Launceston.
        </p>
        <p>
         I'll come back to you as quickly as I can on the Launceston regional plan specifically, but, first, you might be aware that in this year's budget the Australian government committed around $2.1 billion towards major infrastructure projects in Tasmania over the 10 years from 2023-24 under the Infrastructure Investment Program. That Infrastructure Investment Program also provides $237.7 million over the 10 years from 2023-24 for smaller projects in Tasmania. I'm confident that at least some of them would be in Launceston, which is obviously the focus of your question. They'll be delivered through programs search as the Roads to Recovery Program, black spots, bridges, renewal and the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program.
        </p>
        <p>
         It was only last week, actually, that I was in Launceston again. It was when I was on my way to Strahan, with Senator Urquhart, to meet with representatives of the salmon industry and local members of the community about their concerns. That was a trip I don't think Senator Duniam took last week. He preferred to stay in Hobart. I'm not sure what Senator Duniam was up to in Hobart last week, but he wasn't in Strahan talking to people from the salmon industry and he wasn't in Launceston either.
        </p>
        <p>
         I was reminded of the incredible development that we've seen in Launceston over the last 10 to 20 years, where it's become a really modern, vibrant city. It has a flourishing art scene.

           , Senator Watt. You should give it a go; it's great! The department publishes annual progress reports, but the last annual report was released in 2021. Why hasn't the department published its 2022 and 2023 reports? Does the department have something to hide?

            . I'll have to come back to you on notice as to why those reports haven't been tabled and what the intention is around tabling them. I'm sure that it wouldn't be that there's something to hide there because, as I said, to the contrary, our government has invested very heavily in infrastructure and other services in Tasmania, including through the regional deal that you're talking about.

             If I
            </a>
            might stray slightly from the question, the other thing we've significantly invested in in Tasmania is urgent-care clinics, because we know that Tasmania, like many other parts of the country, has not had adequate
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
             GP
            </a>
            bulk-billing services to cater for growing populations and ageing populations. That's why I think we're up to three urgent-care clinics in Tasmania that have been opened. That is going a long way to deliver on the health needs of Tasmanians, in addition to the infrastructure issues that you're talking about.

              By not upholding the transparency measures of public reporting, which even the Morrison government managed to keep, the people of Launceston remain in the dark about the Albanese government's progress on these projects. How can the people of Launceston be confident that the Albanese government will deliver on the remaining projects, especially when we don't know how many are being delivered?

I can tell you that there would be no way that we could get away with not delivering on that regional plan, given the calibre of Tasmanian Labor senators that we have in these ranks and you, Senator Tyrrell.
