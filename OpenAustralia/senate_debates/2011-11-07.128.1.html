        from coal and coal seam gas ports, including those in Gladstone harbour. The Gladstone environmental disaster has seen vast numbers of turtles, dugongs and fish die and a three-week suspension of fishing in the harbour—all after two million cubic metres of dredging has occurred of the 46 million that has been approved by the minister. The

The minister's response was to impose water quality conditions, but dredging has had to be suspended three times already when turbidity has gone off the charts in breach of those conditions. Last Friday levels of heavy metals also breached federal water quality guidelines. When will the federal government suspend its approval for this largest ever dredging in the World Heritage area and act to protect the Great Barrier Reef?

         I thank the senator for her question on this topic. As she has noted, a three-week temporary fishing banned was imposed in Gladstone harbour and it was lifted on 6 October. The ban was imposed by Fisheries Queensland while tests were conducted to assess reports of an infection outbreak in barramundi and other fish species. Water quality analysis and fish testing have confirmed that fish in Gladstone harbour are not a food safety or human health issue. Health issues reported by commercial fishermen have been investigated. No links were found to the fish disease or to water quality. Water quality testing has shown little change other than seasonal variation in water quality since dredging began.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities is continuing to ensure that the dredging is undertaken in accordance with the stringent conditions of approval and the approved environment management plans. Contingency measures under the approved plans may include suspension or variation of dredging operations. The latest test results on further marine life samples taken from Gladstone have confirmed a parasitic flatworm as the cause of cloudy eyes in barramundi and found no parasitic, bacterial or fungal pathogens on either species tested so far.

           Fisheries Queensland is continuing to conduct further fish sampling in the Gladstone area and Biosecurity Queensland will continue to test samples submitted. In addition, toxicology testing on current samples to examine fish tissue residues of heavy metals, agrichemicals and hydrocarbons is in progress, with the results expected by late November this year. The state government has established a scientific panel to oversee the investigation to provide independent scientific and health advice to the government.

            export facilities in Gladstone and said that they may be jeopardising the World Heritage status of the reef. They called for a strategic assessment of all coastal development. The federal government says that this will not happen for another two years and that it will take about three years to complete, but nothing—no approval or application—will be suspended in that time. Minister, what will be left to assess in five years time when there are already at least six major port developments planned or underway?
