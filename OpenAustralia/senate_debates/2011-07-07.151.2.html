        I rise this evening to talk about one of the government's great initiatives, the

         Building the Education Revolution
        </a>
        program. I have spoken many times in this place on this fantastic program, which saw 9,500 schools across Australia receive the new facilities that they yearned for but never could afford. When the world was facing the global financial crisis in 2009 the government knew it had to take immediate action so that Australians would not face the same fate as many in the United States who lost their jobs.
       </p>
       <p>
        We took swift action and implemented our $42 billion Nation Building and Jobs Plan to stimulate the economy and keep working Australians in jobs. We put thought into projects which have lasting benefits for communities across the nation through boosting local infrastructure and supporting jobs. We injected more than $14 million into 10,521 new 21st century facilities for primary schools, $822 million into 537 science or language projects, $1,289 million into 12,680 school maintenance and refurbishments projects, $5,238 million into 19,300 new social housing dwellings, $246 million into 829 new Defence Housing dwellings, $400 million into repairs for 75,000 social dwellings, $150 million into about 600 black spot road projects, $150 million into 300 new boom gates at high-risk crossings, $800 million into 3,351 community infrastructure projects, $711 million into advancing the allocation of funds for 14 major road projects, $1,189 million into 17 rail infrastructure projects and $1,688 million into strengthening facilities for training and higher education.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the key aspects of the stimulus package was the $16.2 billion
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BER" rel="nofollow">

        program. Our plan was to invest in the education, skills and training of our young people to boost the productivity and prosperity of our nation for future generations As of 31 January there had been 23,711 projects approved under the program, with 19,975 projects completed. I have been to many BER openings in the past 18 months—too many to count—and there will be another 40 coming up before the end of the year. I have heard nothing but praise for this fantastic Labor government initiative.
       </p>
       <p>
        This much-longed-for funding enabled schools to build halls and libraries when in the past they did not even have access to these facilities. For some schools, it was the first time they had a multipurpose hall, and the very first time they were able to fit the whole school into one area. For some, it was the first time they had an actual library and no longer had to share a classroom with a room full of books. I have seen new kitchens to complement participation in the Stephanie Alexander Garden Kitchen Program, another fantastic government initiative. I have seen new music rooms and dance studios. For some schools, this is the biggest thing to happen in years. I have seen new stages for performing arts projects and covered play areas and new playground equipment.
       </p>
       <p>
        All of these are projects that the schools never would have been able to build without this type of funding. And how do I know this? They have told me. Every single opening I have been to in Queensland has been a joyous occasion for the school—a celebration—and a far cry from the 'monumental failure' the member for Sturt,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Pyne" rel="nofollow">

        , has described.
       </p>
       <p>
        Principals and P&amp;C presidents have talked of the benefits these new facilities bring to their schools. Unlike the 'glorified garden sheds' that Senator Boyce has described the BER projects as, we have 21st century facilities which will allow our nation's students to use new technology in their everyday learning. Most classrooms that I have seen have interactive whiteboards, a far cry from the blackboard and chalk and the whiteboards of my generation. I have even seen green rooms attached to new libraries where students can film themselves doing presentations and then edit them in the facilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        To some principals, these new facilities are a dream come true. Some have been teaching for more than 30 years and never imagined that they would see new buildings like these in their schools. On many occasions I have been asked to send my regards and thanks to the Prime Minister, Senator Evans and the government for providing these new halls, libraries, class­rooms and science and language centres. Judith Seery, the principal of St Anthony's Primary School at

        , said:
       </p>
       <p>
        We are indeed grateful to the federal government for their generous gift to St Anthony's. It's an extraordinary privilege. Senator

        , please pass on to Prime Minister Julia Gillard and the federal government our sincere thanks as a result this funding has assisted local trades people, families and communities to participate in activities to support achievement to develop learning potential …
       </p>
       <p>
        Belinda Leavers, the principal of Loganlea State High School, said:
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the staff and the students and all members of the Loganlea State High school community I would like to extend our very sincere thanks to the federal government for this wonderful facility with leading-edge technologies and modern multi-purpose learning spaces.
       </p>
       <p>
        Steve Ariel, the president of Carbrook State School P&amp;C, said:
       </p>
       <p>
        For some of you, having these fantastic new facilities will impact your lives in ways you cannot begin to imagine. They will make huge differences to your future. So on behalf of your mums, dads, guardians and the Carbrook community, I am here to say thank you. Thank you for giving us these great buildings, this fantastic gift. Thank you for investing in our children and the future of Carbrook.
       </p>
       <p>
        Roz Cooper, the council chairperson at Living Faith Lutheran Primary School, said:
       </p>
       <p>
        We are just absolutely delighted because we couldn't have got as high quality or well appointment in the buildings without the funding of the state and federal governments for both this hall and our third year one class. Given that this is our 10th year, that would have been well down the track before we could achieve that, so we're very very grateful.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lastly, I thank the students from the Canungra State School. They were so grateful, they provided me with beautifully coloured posters and cards from their BER opening—and these now fill my office. To celebrate the opening, every class came up onto the stage and presented their hard work to me, which they had spent a long time in developing,
       </p>
       <p>
        The BER initiative has benefited not only our teachers and students but also the wider community. All of these new facilities are or will be available to community groups to access. Already some schools allow taekwondo clubs and dance schools to use their new halls. While the government has heard nothing but positives about the BER program, the opposition criticised this key investment in education.
       </p>
       <p>
        In conclusion, the Labor government's BER program has been an absolute success. Not only have we provided 21st century facilities to our students; we have given schools the boost, the encouragement and the tools to prosper. I have seen the members for Longman, Forde, Moncrieff, Wright, Ryan and Hinkler at some of the BER openings, which shows me that they support the BER initiative. I look forward to seeing them at more openings in the coming months.
