        The committee is considering message No. 494 from the House of Representatives relating to the Tax Laws Amendment (Combating Multinational Tax Avoidance) Bill 2015. The question is that the Senate does not insist on amendment (1) to which the House has disagreed.

         As we know, yesterday marked the six-year anniversary of the Greens joining with the Liberals to vote down the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_Pollution_Reduction_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
          Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme
         </a>
         . Today will go down in history as another remarkable day when the Greens again have joined with the Liberals to help Australia's richest companies keep their tax dealings secret—selling out on ordinary Australian taxpayers in the process. Not only have the Greens sold out on themselves; they have sold out on everyday Australian taxpayers. Let us be clear about that. This goes beyond their own base but goes to everyday Australian taxpayers. I think that is completely immoral.
        </p>
        <p>
         The other thing that I think would sit very uncomfortably with the Greens is what their former leader,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Milne" rel="nofollow">
          Christine Milne
         </a>
         , would think of this dirty deal that they have done with the Liberals. It was Christine Milne who helped initiate the multinational tax inquiry to start with—and I give her credit for that. The former Greens leader, Christine Milne, certainly has more respect and integrity when it comes to issues of multinational tax avoidance than any Green in this place today, because all of them are selling out on that legacy that she leaves behind—a legacy where she knew that it was not fair and it was not right that hundreds and hundreds of Australian multinational companies were getting away with not paying their fair share of tax.
        </p>
        <p>
         Let us go specifically to what this deal means for Australians. It means that, in effect, where there was going to be a threshold of $100 million where transparency laws would apply to about 900 private firms, now the Greens, siding with the government, will exempt two-thirds of those companies.

           Two weeks ago the Senate sought to restore the previous tax transparency laws. Labor, the Greens and a number of Independent senators demanded that the government bring the tax transparency threshold back to $100 million for all companies so as not to increase the complexity in the system and to ensure that the private and public companies were treated alike. Now, as a result of an enormous backflip, as a result of the enormity of what occurred yesterday, some six years after the Greens joined the Liberals to vote down the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_Pollution_Reduction_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
            Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme
           </a>
           , two out of three of the private companies that would have been caught in the tax transparency net will be taken out—thanks to the deal that the Greens have done with the government.
          </p>
          <p>
           The decision of the Leader of the Greens, Richard
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Di_Natale" rel="nofollow">
            Di Natale
           </a>
           , is I think a repudiation of the hard work that his own senators had done in the weeks and months prior to protect the tax transparency laws and to ensure big companies were held accountable. This decision flies in the face of their own Greens senators and what they agreed to.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Australian community and the Greens' own members will be rightly outraged at the new leader's capitulation in the face of pressure from the government. Perhaps it is appropriate that we reflect on the fact that, as I said, yesterday marked that six-year anniversary of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPRS" rel="nofollow">
            CPRS
           </a>
           . In some attempt to become more mainstream the Greens are perpetuating a tax system that Australians see as unfair and which the Greens saw as unfair only two weeks ago. Now, all of a sudden, it is okay because the Greens want to move into this mainstream space—and, looking for relevance in that process, they have decided on some incredibly poor policy outcomes.
          </p>
          <p>
           As we are all aware, the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATO" rel="nofollow">
            ATO
           </a>
           gave evidence that one in five Australian private companies earning over $100 million paid no tax at all last year. But it is okay for hardworking Australian taxpayers to pay their fair share of tax. They cannot hide the amount of tax that they are supposed to pay. They are hardworking Australians and they pay all their tax, as they should and as we expect all people and companies in this country to do. We do not expect companies to hide their tax. If there is a loophole in the law, let's fix it, let's expose it, let's recognise the lack of transparency and do something about. That is what we did in this place a couple of weeks ago with the support of the Greens and the Independents. What they have done today flies in the face of that commitment that they gave to Australian taxpayers two weeks ago. It is sheer hypocrisy—absolute hypocrisy—when they know that this is not what they believed in only two weeks ago.
          </p>
          <p>
           This goes to the heart of what the Greens' values are. This goes to the heart of what the Greens stand for and what they believe in. What do they believe in? Who would know? Two weeks ago they believed in transparency for multinational companies; today they do not. Today, the Greens are quite happy to sell out all the Australian taxpayers in this country. Why? Because they want to become 'more mainstream' and more relevant—arising from a fear of becoming irrelevant—or some other bizarre notion that they have concocted. As I have said, I am sure a number of Greens members today are saying, 'Bring back
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Milne" rel="nofollow">
            Christine Milne
           </a>
           , because she stood for something.' She stood for proper Green values that they at one point held dear.
          </p>
          <p>
           Now, we do not know what those values are because, let's face it, they have decided, 'Better to shore ourselves up with the Liberals; perhaps one day we'll get in government with them and then we will be really relevant.' Do you know what you will be relevant for? Nothing; because you will stand for nothing. As long as you come in here and backflip all over the place and sell out Australian taxpayers, as you have, no-one will vote for you. No-one will care anymore about who you are, because you do not stand for anything. We on this side of the chamber do stand for something. We stand for fairness for Australian taxpayers and we want to see those multinational companies pay their fair share of tax. They have gotten away with paying nothing—absolutely nothing. That is a disgrace, and it flies in the face of all of those hardworking Australians who day in and day out work hard and pay their fair share of tax.
          </p>
          <p>
           I say to the Greens that it is not too late; you can actually change your mind again. Do a courageous backflip for once. Do a backflip that actually means something. Go back to your original position—a position which stood for something; a position of integrity—which meant that there would be transparency in our laws for these companies who, for too long, have gotten away with not paying their fair share of tax. If the Greens had not wilted—as I think my colleague Dr
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Leigh" rel="nofollow">
            Andrew Leigh
           </a>
           and our shadow Treasurer,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Bowen" rel="nofollow">
            Chris Bowen
           </a>
           said—like week-old kale, the government would have had no choice but to pass this bill with the transparency amendments included. This would have been the best outcome for the Australian community and for tax fairness—'fairness'; a word which is no longer part of the Greens party after today. Instead, the Greens have delivered the government the votes that they need to gut tax transparency.
          </p>
          <p>
           Let's just go to the heart of what that means. That means the Greens are protecting the Liberal Party's donors for the next election. All of those big companies—we know them;
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Morris" rel="nofollow">
            Philip Morris
           </a>
           et cetera—that donate to the Liberal Party are safe and sound thanks to the Greens. So not only are the Greens delivering no tax transparency; they are delivering the government an election outcome. They are ensuring that the government's pot is full for the next election. We know that it is probably less than a year away, so I am sure that they are doing the numbers already. They are ensuring that the Liberals have the money they need from those companies. That is a disgrace. I am sure that is not what those Australians who voted for the Greens thought that they were getting. They would not have thought that that is what they were going to get from the Greens party in this country. After today, I would be very interested to see how the Greens progress in whatever it is that they are going to go forward with in this place, What we have seen today has been absolutely shameful. It has been a disgrace. It has been a sell-out and it flies in the face of anything that I thought the Greens perhaps did stand for. I thought that, at some point in time, they did stand for fairness. But they certainly do not seem to be standing for fairness anymore.
          </p>
          <p>
           At the heart of all of this what we have wanted to talk about is the need for more transparency and not less, so that we can hold to account those companies that are not paying their fair share of tax. I thought that we had got there, and I thought that this Christmas we would be facing a situation where we had righted a wrong in our laws in relation to companies that were avoiding their fair share of tax. But, after today, if the Greens go ahead and join with the government in voting down what they supported with us only two weeks ago, all has been lost. That would be an incredible shame for democracy in this country and a shame for all of those hardworking Australians who, day in and day out, fight hard to ensure that we have fair and decent outcomes in this country. That is what I thought we were doing in this place—but not so much after today. As we know, that $200 million threshold will mean that fewer than 300 companies in Australia will be covered by this new law. That is an incredible drop from the 900 private firms that this law was going to cover. I think it is an absolute shame, and I ask the Greens to reconsider their position—and save some credibility in the process—so that this country can have fair and decent transparency and companies will pay their fair share of tax.

             You are on your feet again, Senator Conroy. You are supposed to take a point of order when you are on your feet. It was good that Senator Singh made a contribution. We had numerous contributions from Labor senators this morning prior to business changing. I see Senator Urquhart is ready to make a contribution as well, which is good because she was on the speaking list when the kidnap amendment went down but she did not get a chance to speak. Senator Singh did not speak on the kidnap amendment. I went back and checked which Labor Party senators spoke on it. Senator Dastyari spoke on it—so he is off the hook—and Senator McAllister spoke on it. Apart from that the Labor Party put up three speakers. So when the kidnap amendment came to parliament, before the speaking list collapsed—

               Through you chair, I think you are going to need a Strepsil too, Senator Conroy. I think we all are because we are going to have a very healthy debate about this. Let me get back to the kidnap amendment bill. If there is any finger pointing in here as to why we are dealing with this legislation today it is because of the kidnap amendment bill. Labor put up—apart from Senator Dastyari who was introducing the bill—three speakers for the whole bill. Two of them got to speak before the bill collapsed—

               The CHAIRMAN: I can advise senators that we are actually in the committee stage, so if senators want to contribute to the debate there is no limitation on their ability to contribute but you should do it one at a time.

              <p>
               I have visited the original senate chamber in the old city of Rome and sat on the marble chairs, and this is what I imagine it must have been like with the original senators having a very robust debate, but I digress. Let me get back to the issue here of the kidnap amendment bill which went down in this place. As I mentioned earlier today—and I did say it very loudly in case you did not listen—I was sitting in the chair at the time and not only did the speaking list collapse and Labor not put up any speakers—that is how strongly they thought about tax transparency—

               We had two speakers on the list before it collapsed so that is not fair. We had two speakers on the list. Senator

               and I were due to speak before the list collapsed but Labor had put up two whole speakers. We have had about 50 in here today already. It is a shame we did not see that passion defending their original legislation when it was before the Senate. That is a question for the Labor Party. Maybe they decided that the politics were not really in their favour at that stage, whereas now they can see some gain out of it. So outraged were they that their original Bradbury legislation was going to go down that they put up two speakers and then they let the list collapse. When I was in the chair and the division was called, I cannot even say it went to the voices because there were no voices from the Labor Party, so that is why the Greens moved an amendment to bring the tax transparency issue back—

                 Let us talk about respect. Let us talk about respect and integrity. The Labor Party sent an email around today to their supporters, and I have read it as have other people in the Greens. We are sending it to ABC to have it fact checked at the moment because we want someone impartial to look at this—

                 Let me tell you, Senator Conroy, if you want to talk about respect and integrity the list of talking points that you have given speakers is also quite outrageous. It is totally misleading and lacks any factual basis. The Labor Party are saying that this legislation today lets the biggest multinationals—the biggest corporations—off the hook. It could not be further from the truth. We have put in place an outcome that companies over $200 million have to disclose their tax, so how that can be letting the biggest multinationals and the biggest corporations off the hook beats me, but let's let a third party decide.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Also, we have introduced a general purpose accounting standard which makes the biggest multinational corporations—under the definition in the original legislation that the Liberal Party have brought here—accountable with significant information. Once again, how that can be letting the biggest multinationals off the hook beats me. It is absolute

                 . That is what it is. It is a lie and it has presumably gone out to thousands of Australians—

                 I have been answering the phone calls, Senator Conroy, as have my fellow senators. We have been speaking to the callers as they have been coming in and letting them know—as triggered by the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
                  ALP
                 </a>
                 —what the facts are and sending them more information. It is giving us an opportunity to put our side of the story straight and I think things are going pretty well in that respect. We have set the record straight, as we will continue to do so.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I will get back to the fact that the Greens would like to see some substantive debate in here on the legislation in front of us. We would like the Labor Party to explain why they are not going to support the introduction of general purpose accounting and why that is not important, especially in light of the key evidence the Senate inquiry has heard—the economics committee—about the loopholes that are used around special purpose accounting and the types of companies that have been getting away with blue murder. We would like the Labor Party to explain why they are not going to support that. We would like the Labor Party to explain why they are not going to support making 300 companies over $200 million declare their tax position.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The other thing that is totally misleading and deceptive in that email that has been going out from the Labor Party is that they are saying that we are letting 600 companies off the hook. Guess what? None of them are disclosing their tax now because you did not field a speaking list when the tax amendment—the kidnap bill—was before this house. You let it collapse and you did not call a division. You go back and check the tapes. I have got a copy of them—

                     That is true. I learnt that in Senate school. Nevertheless, let me tell you who is misleading the Australian people. There is no transparency in place now. Had the kidnap amendment failed, then yes, the original bill put up by the Labor Party many years ago—and I acknowledged even in my rage this morning that the Labor Party has legacy on this issue, but that has gone because of the failure of this place to make sure we had the numbers to defeat it. We did not. We missed it. I and Senator Xenophon have both admitted publicly that the Senate itself has egg on its face. I have been man enough to admit that we could have done a better job and that the committee had the wool pulled over its eyes by certain front groups who were masquerading as being much bigger representatives than they were in terms of the people who wanted to avoid disclosing their tax and be shielded. We admitted that we got that wrong and that is why we brought the amendment back a few weeks ago and why we are having this debate now.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     We need now to discuss why general purpose accounting—which is an amendment legitimately moved by Senator Xenophon—is so critical to this debate. It has been written on by some very good journalists, like
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_West" rel="nofollow">
                      Michael West
                     </a>
                     from Fairfax and others, and it is an absolutely critical part of this debate. The government has agreed that this will be included in the legislation. That is a win for tax transparency. Whichever way you look at it, it is a significant win that the largest corporations in the world will be compelled to provide detailed information.

                       Senator Conroy, in case you have not read it, there is a 'Statement of Accounting Concepts', with a chapter 'Objectives of general purpose financial reporting', which is a nice summary of why general purpose accounting is really important. I know, because I have chatted to

                       , a member of parliament, about the work the Labor Party wants to do in the future on tax disclosure and on multinational reporting, that things such as profit shifting, thin capitalisation and transfer pricing—this is where you get your information on what actually does need to change.

                       These things are being discussed in the context of the G20, but we have a chance to lead the pack before the G20, to take some action here today to put in place legislation that will kick a goal for multinational tax avoidance. That is what we are dealing with here today. Let us move the debate to why we need general purpose accounting, why that is a good amendment that will be put up by the

                       and was put up originally by Senator Xenophon and then let us discuss why the $200 million threshold is a good start. It is easy to come in here and to say, 'We could've done better. If you'd left it to us, the government would've crumbled,' but I know, and this is what the Greens discussed and is why we have arrived at this great result today—

                         We are proud of it. The reason we have done this today is that we know that once we get the disclosure we will get momentum. Once we get disclosure for those companies of over $200 million, once it becomes the norm for wealthy corporations to disclose their tax affairs, then we can take the next step. This is very good legislation and for anyone who cares about multinational tax avoidance, tax transparency and tax justice in this country, rather than just taking political pot shots, you must support this legislation today. So let us get on with the substantive amendments. Let us debate the detail. Put the politics aside and let the Australian people focus on what is in this bill.

                           Senator Conroy, that is because you want to distract away from the fact that you are going to vote against some very good legislation and you will have a lot of explaining to do when you do it, because that is what is at stake here. Our party firmly believes we have delivered a good outcome. Is it perfect? No, it is not. All the bills we have looked at, including your Bradbury bill, is not perfect either. There is still a long way to go down this road if we are going to defeat multinational tax avoidance. There is still a long way to go but this is a very good and very important first step.

It is just too hard for me. I will come back to you shortly. Let me deal with the Greens first because it is a complete sell out. I just worked myself up. I was going to ask the government some very detailed questions about this bill, but I will come back to that shortly. What is so outrageous about this is the Greens get on their feet and take the high moral ground on every point they can. They could not be more holier-than-thou in their utterances and—

                                    Despite the Senate hearings, community support and a general campaign from the public for greater transparency and the end of multinational tax avoidance, the Senate had already passed the amended version of the bill. The votes were here in the Senate for the legislation, but, no, the Greens have done a deal with the government to lower that threshold. Lower it—not increase it, not expand it, but lower the threshold to exempt more companies from this legislation. Make no mistake: the Greens do not actually believe in anything anymore—if they ever did. If they do, they can certainly be bought. And, judging by what happened today, they can be bought pretty cheaply as well.
                                   </p>
                                   <p>
                                    I would have thought, from the Greens' high moral ground, that they would have asked for something that even the government may have blushed at giving them. The government may have given it to them in the end but would have blushed in doing so. But we do not know yet what the deal is. We assume, of course, that in lowering the threshold and walking backwards from tough multinational tax avoidance legislation the Greens have taken the high moral ground and said, 'Better something than nothing.' I think what the Greens have secured as part of this grubby deal with the government is yet to be revealed. I think Senator Cormann is clever enough to offer them a good deal, and they have taken it. What is that good deal, Senator Cormann? We will only find out in the course of time, when it comes to light and we can see what the Greens got as a consequence of signing up to this grubby deal.

                                    , but this is not the way to do it. It is a desperate attempt by the Greens to grasp relevancy by selling out on multinational tax avoidance. Senator Di Natale said yesterday that he was taking our advice about not just shouting from the sidelines. If this is what happens when the Greens become engaged, then please, please go back to the sidelines from whence you came. At least that way you do not break anything.

                                    and the Liberals are legislating for multinational tax dodges to continue inhabiting the loopholes that exist in our tax system. The Greens and Liberals are in coalition on less transparency for hundreds of companies, to support the big end of town. The rational way of putting this is: you would expect the government, in a multinational tax avoidance bill, to lower the threshold. You would expect this government to try to obscure transparency. They have done that with
                                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOI" rel="nofollow">

                                    . They have an extraordinary record in making sure that there is no transparency in FOI. They have closed it down. They have shut the door, and in this area they are doing the same. They do not want the light of day to penetrate. From anybody's perspective, I can understand why the coalition wants that. The big end of town supports them. They tip their hat to the big end of town. They support the big end of town. They get their donations from the big end of town, so it makes sense. The Greens, on the other hand, have not been able to recognise that—by the way it looks. Because by signing up to this deal you have signed up to the big end of town. You have signed up to ensure that there is less transparency.

                                    in the Senate, to the environment's detriment, we see them now supporting corporate tax dodgers. That is the Greens party of today. I have been here long enough to see the Greens take the high moral ground in many debates in this place over many, many hours of debating from a positive perspective—sometimes I did not agree with them, but they certainly put their arguments forward. Now we have the Greens of today. They are a mere shadow of that party, and are now the party that receives six-figure donations from corporate donors, the party that votes with the Liberals to support a watered down, weak piece of legislation that does nothing to capture the majority of multinational tax dodges. Progressives everywhere should be dismayed at the Greens' position—in fact, the Greens' capitulation.

                                    Senator Cormann has done a good job in corralling the Greens and doing a deal with them. I would not have expected Senator Cormann to achieve that, quite frankly, but he has. He did it either through a brilliant manoeuvre or a brilliant piece of negotiation—actually, I do not think that. I would like to ascribe it to Senator Cormann, but I think they just rolled. I think he got handed it on a plate and was smart enough to take it, because I do not think the Greens would have negotiated this in a fair negotiation. I think they are desperate for relevancy and, as such, they have chosen this course. The question, however, is: for what reason would they do this? Was it simply a case of, as I have described, bad negotiation or sharp negotiation by Senator Cormann? Was it the negotiation skills of a new, weak, inexperienced leader from the Greens? Or, as I said earlier, do they expect to get something out of this which is not transparent today?

                                    They ought to come clean in this debate and tell the Senate what they have traded for this rollover, because we will find it at some point. It will be transparent; it will bubble up to the surface as always. These things cannot be hidden.

                                    We have the wonderful contribution by Senator McKim. I listened to it on Monday, but I thought I would share it with you again. There is the beauty of the speech by Senator McKim. I am not wont to give other senators advice in this place—it is not my place generally—but I will comment on this. It is wonderful. This is on the exemption debate with respect to the Australian citizenship bill. He said:
                                   </p>
                                   <p class="italic">
                                    This is a disgraceful abuse of parliamentary process, an outrageous collusion between the government and their mates on national security in the Labor Party. They are treating this parliament with utter contempt, and I say to the crossbenchers and I say to good longstanding senators in this place: you should stand up for the Senate here. You should vote against the motion that is currently before the Senate and give us all a chance to actually get our heads around the amendments that have been put through the House of Representatives and that appeared in the Senate only moments ago this evening.
                                   </p>

                                    There is the beauty of that paragraph. Within fewer than three days we had Senator McKim completely ignore what he said in the debate on Monday. The only advice I would generally give to anyone is: make sure you remember what you say from one day to the next in this place, because it will come back to bite you if you overstep the mark. He was using much rhetorical flourish that day attacking the Labor Party for being sensible with respect to national security, but he also complained bitterly about our position. Within a couple of days, we find that Senator McKim ought to come back into this place and apologise for those words.
                                   </p>
                                   <p>
                                    In fact, you could read Senator McKim back into that paragraph, because it is a disgraceful abuse of the parliamentary process for the Greens and the government to come together and ram this legislation through with a dirty, outrageous deal. As he went on to say, it was an outrageous collusion between the government and the Greens with respect to that matter and they are treating the parliament with utter contempt. I say to the crossbenchers and the Labor Party: good, longstanding senators in this place should stand up for the Senate here, should vote against the bill that is currently before the Senate, give us all a chance to get our heads around proper amendments to the bill and pass a much better bill than what is currently before the Senate. That would have been a much better speech given today, following on from his contribution with respect to the earlier debate. But, no, we only get that from him.

                                    There is still an opportunity within the debate in this place to not proceed, look at the amendments that Labor have to keep the multinationals honest in this debate and ensure that any multinational tax package is fair for all and asks all Australians to pay their fair share of tax, including the multinationals. On this side of the chamber—notwithstanding that the Greens think they might sometimes be here—we think the priority should be to shut down the loopholes that allow big multinationals to send the profits overseas. We think that the coalition's path is the wrong path. They are on the path of cutting pensions and they are on the path of making sure young Australians pay more tax, while the Greens have now sidled up to them and have completely debased themselves by enjoining with the coalition on this matter.

                                     I have some specific questions that I want to put to the Minister for Finance. They relate to specific questions that I put to him earlier. I understand that there will be some comprehensive responses that go to the substance of this debate, particularly in relation to the general purpose account amendments that Senator

                                     will be moving shortly as part of the debate. It is important to get those matters on the record given that those amendments will be moved.

                                      I thank Senator Xenophon for actually asking me a question and making a contribution that relates to the bill in front of us. It is not normally my custom to provide answers in relation to somebody else's amendments—in particular when those amendments have not been moved yet. However, in the spirit of Christmas and because I feel like I have been ignored in the debate as there was the ferocious debate between Labor and the Greens, I am happy to provide the information that Senator Xenophon is seeking. In short, in answer to his question: yes, the test for application is on a consolidated revenues basis, as defined by the accounting standards. This is stated explicitly in the bill, pursuant to subsection 960-555(2A).

                                               I am indebted today to the Greens for discovering a socioeconomic new creature. It is the blackmailer and kidnapper who distinguishes between people whose companies have $100 million and those who have $200 million. Let's be clear, the only argument the government have advanced for why we should not be doing this is based on the fact that people would be kidnapped.

                                               have managed to discover kidnappers who actually distinguish between $100 million and $200 million. You are geniuses, absolute geniuses. I want to congratulate you on that, because you are voting to accept an argument that says: people with more than $200 million are going to be kidnapped, but people who have less than $200 million are not going to be kidnapped. So I want to congratulate you on finding the socioeconomic kidnapping fraternity, because it is marvellous.

                                                 I do have one question for Senator Cormann. My understanding is that the Liberal party room opposed all of the $100 million upwards being removed. So, did you take this deal back to the Liberal party room, given you have a party room decision not to move from $100 million? Could I just seek clarification? Did you take this deal to cabinet and has it gone to your party room?

                                                       That was not a point of order at all. What has become apparent here, as Senator Cormann knows, is that an existing party room vote has been overturned by his deal with the Greens, and they have not gone back to the party room. You have not gone back to the party room to get approval to change the position of the party room. The processes that Prime Minister Turnbull put in place have been, as usual, rode over roughshod. The backbench party members are deeply unhappy about lack of process. Some of them are so unhappy that they have defected to the Queensland National Party. What a success you guys are. You are on a tare.

It is quite embarrassing when you have a guilty conscience and you want to distract people from the fact that you have just sold your soul and sold out on everything you have campaigned for for two years, and overturned your own party and platform's position and what you have been seeking to do; I understand you would want to try and distract. So you want to fabricate history. Senator Whish-Wilson, the story you have attempted to tell and the story you are telling those poor, upset, ordinary Australians—or possibly even your branch members—when they have phoned your offices is untrue. Okay? Untrue.

                                                       So I want to put this on the public record. Firstly, as you well know, I was not here—I was overseas on a delegation when the debate took place. So do not try and represent that there were not people in the Labor Party willing to speak on this issue. That is the first point.

                                                       Secondly, and more importantly, as Senator Dastyari has said, and I will not need to speak for him because he will be speaking shortly, you have absolutely fabricated—Mr Temporary Chairman, could you ask Senator Heffernan to take his seat, please—

And then the bill collapsed—actually, a bill collapsed, and it was brought on suddenly—

The bill being debated beforehand collapsed, and then there was confusion in the chamber about what happened, and a vote was put, and nothing was recorded. There was not a desire by the Labor senators not to speak on this bill, as Senator Whish-Wilson is attempting to portray. This is a complete and utter fabrication that you are constructing to distract from your guilty conscience. Well, you are not going to get away with this. I know Senator Dastyari is going to speak at some considerable length on this particular issue so that the truth is on

But you do not get to come in here and fabricate history. The Labor Party has campaigned hard on this. Senator Whish-Wilson, I will do my best to avoid revealing private conversations, but I was gratified by what you said to me when I made a contribution on this debate the last time it was in the chamber. I was gratified. What I did not know was that you were a wolf in sheep's clothing—that you were planning on actually thanking me so you could sell me out a few weeks later. But I do actually have a question: were you even invited to the meeting last night? My understanding is that they did not let you go. They did not let you go, did they? Oh dear! It's classic!

He cannot try and pretend that Labor has not been as committed as he has on this issue. There may have been genuine mistakes and things that went wrong on the floor the first time this came through, but we all worked to try and deliver to the Australian taxpayers the truth that the big end of town do not want revealed. There is nothing you can say today that will change the fact that you have accepted an argument that people whose companies earn over $200 million are in fear of being kidnapped if the truth was revealed! That is the only argument the government put forward, and you have now swallowed it and signed up to it. Even Senator Muir, a relative newcomer to the chamber, accepted, when he heard how silly that argument was, that it had to be changed. It had to be changed. But you, Senator Whish-Wilson, always knew that it was a complete and utter load of rubbish.

You let him out of your sight for five minutes and he has sold you down the drain. I could at least have some respect for your leader if he had invited you to come to the meeting. Were you afraid that he would embarrass you, Senator Di Natale? Were you afraid that Senator Whish-Wilson might actually not be quite so willing to roll over? I mean, really! You did not take your shadow spokesperson to this most important meeting even though he has campaigned on this for two years. To not be invited by your leader to the meeting, Senator Whish-Wilson—

There are those of you who will have to try and justify protecting the biggest private companies in this country when you had the numbers. It is not that there was a negotiation and it was in the mix—that there might have been a win here and there might have been a loss there. We had the numbers. We actually got together and got the numbers, and we got an outcome where the government was over a barrel. And you blinked. You let them off the hook. You blinked!

You will not be able to get away from the fact that we had the numbers to get a much, much better outcome than this and you blinked. Stop trying to justify it by saying that they were not going to do it; that this is better than nothing. We could have got better than this, and you blinked. You know it; you blinked. Because your genius leader decided he would not invite you and would not let you actually have the debate with the Treasurer—he was too embarrassed to have you in the room or whatever the excuse was—you blinked. There is no way to hide the fact that the numbers in this chamber were on your side. Two years of work, and you blinked and you let this government off the hook. We would have got a better outcome if you had a spine, a bit of backbone and a bit of political courage. That was not shown by your leader when he left you behind and went off and negotiated with the Treasurer.

They are so committed to it. They think it is so important that when they had the opportunity to talk with the coalition and insist on what legislation should be debated today, no, it was not on the agenda. Do you know what that would have done? It would have meant for companies like Serco: another year off scot-free—don't publish your affairs. Glencore: another year—don't worry about it, we'll let you off the hook.

To those punters at home who were confused by all the huff and bluster and all the theatre and so on, let us be clear about what the situation is at the moment. At the moment those multinational companies do not have to disclose their affairs. At the moment, 281 of Australia's richest private companies do not have to tell the Australian public how much tax they pay. We walk away from today without passing this legislation and those big multinational tax avoiders get off scot-free. The Labor Party wants to shout from the sidelines and yell at the coalition about how terrible the coalition is on multinational tax avoidance, and do nothing about it. That is what the Labor Party wants to do. They want to shout from the sidelines and run up to an election saying, 'You guys are terrible,' but when they have the chance to pass legislation to do something about it they are missing in action. That is the Labor Party's tactic on this issue. Well, we are not going to buy it. We have a responsibility in this place, when we can, to get outcomes for people.

If we do not pass this legislation those companies get off scot-free. That is what the Labor Party wants to do today. How shameful that we have private companies, companies like Transfield, the organisation that has been contracted to run our detention centre network, worth billions of dollars, and the Labor Party is saying to them, 'Don't worry, we don't want you to disclose your tax affairs to the Australian community.' That is what the Labor Party is saying today.

Zero, zilch, nada, nothing. We have the opportunity to disclose the affairs of those multinational tax avoiders by passing this legislation.
                                                                            </p>

The government has said they will not pass that legislation, and we get another year where we have those big companies that do not disclose their affairs, so that the Labor Party have an issue to campaign on right up to the next election. Well, do you know what? I want outcomes. I want to get things done. Our party wants outcomes. That is why we together made a consensus decision to ensure that these laws would be passed.

Without the passage of these laws we do not get it—another year where these companies are off scot-free. This legislation will double the penalties that these tax dodgers face by disclosing their affairs. It gives the

Well, we are not shouting from the sidelines. We are rolling up our sleeves and we are making sure that these companies pay their fair share.

Let's have a look at the logic here. The logic is that if we do not pass legislation that forces multinationals to disclose their tax, that gives increased powers to the ATO, and that ensures private companies disclose their tax affairs, there is less money for schools and hospitals. Thank you very much—what a gift! Where is the brains trust who thought that one up? Terrific—we love it. It is a great opportunity.

We need you to do something on multinational tax avoidance.' We listened. We referred the issue to a Senate inquiry. The reason we are having this debate is that the Greens led the charge and referred it to a Senate inquiry. We did that and, as a result of that, we have laws from this government—one of the few decent pieces of legislation put to this parliament that we have been able to amend and to strengthen to ensure that we give more powers to those organisations that are pursuing multinational tax dodgers. We are getting more transparency for private companies, we are getting more transparency for those multinationals and we are going to ensure that we listen to the Tax Justice Network, who today have said, 'What a great step forward for transparency.' This is a step forward for transparency. Year-by-year, country-by-country reporting will get underway this year. This legislation will ensure that happens.

You had the option to decide what you wanted to do, and yesterday, when you were negotiating with this government on what you thought were the priority pieces of legislation, where was multinational tax avoidance? Where was it? Nowhere. It was not on the government's business for today and next year, kicking the can down the road. Well, we did something. For all the faux outrage, for all the anger, for all the theatrics, there is a key lesson here. When you are in this place you get outcomes. You have an opportunity to ensure that you listen to those people who have campaigned on these issues and you ensure that what you get is companies like Transfield, like Grocon, like Inghams chicken—big donors to the Labor Party, let me tell you—like Pratt Holdings, like Meriton and like 7-Eleven, and you ensure that they disclose the amount of tax that they pay. We have stopped multinationals like News Limited, like Glencore, like

He does not like this outcome for the Australian community. Do you know why he does not like it? Because he has not been able to feed it to his mates in the press gallery and to stand up and start grandstanding about how he is leading the charge. He is missing in action. The man is missing in action. He is all huff, all bluster and no substance—all tip and no iceberg. This is a man who is more intent on grandstanding and shouting from the sidelines than on delivering outcomes. Well, we believe in outcomes. That is why we have supported this legislation—and not just supported it, but strengthened it and amended it—and ensured that multinationals, huge private companies, finally declare how much tax they are not paying. We know that is a driver to more transparency and to ensuring that those companies change their arrangements and justify to the Australian community why they are not paying their fair share of tax.

We can have a fairer tax base, and the way to achieve that is through measures that go after the tax dodgers, the big end of town—measures that go after those high-wealth individuals who use superannuation, negative gearing and capital gains tax reform as a tax break.

It is the Greens who are now showing what is necessary to ensure that we balance our budget, that we address some of the structural challenges in Australia's budget. We are leading the charge to making the country fairer and more decent, to raising revenue and to ensuring that schools and hospitals are funded. You guys can shout from the sidelines, but we are in the business of rolling our sleeves up and getting it done, and we will continue to do it. This is just the start. The next stop with transparency is to ensure that we get more companies brought in under this legislation, that we give more powers to the ATO, that we resource ASIC and the Taxation Office, and that we finally make some progress towards getting a fairer tax base so that we can have the community that the Australian people deserve.

About 18 months ago, I was made aware of a circumstance where private companies' tax affairs were going to be disclosed on the ATO's website. It was Labor Party policy. I raised that with some ministers in my own party. They undertook to examine repealing it and that happened a few weeks ago. The work done by

I rise to talk about some amendments that I am moving today on the Tax Laws Amendment (Combating Multinational Tax Avoidance) Bill 2015. I intend on moving two amendments.

Right from the start of this debate, my concerns have been directly related to the issue of privacy. This should be no surprise to those who have been following my work to hear this. My amendment will ensure that a successful small business is not unintentionally caught up in this legislation. My amendment in this area seeks to use the existing definition under the

I sought to do this via a disclaimer on the ATO website. I even went as far as requiring a direct website link to the full financial information on the ASIC website. This was all done in an attempt to present this information in a fair and balanced way.

I had been hopeful that the Greens and the government could see the common sense in this. I do think that the government see merit in this, and probably support it, but due to the deal with the Greens, they cannot. I would have thought that the government would be supportive of an amendment that limits the number of businesses that would be captured by the tax transparency laws but, to my surprise, they do not. This is a significant shift. Who would have thought that it would be me, a senator from the Motoring Enthusiast Party, standing up for small proprietary companies in the face of government opposition. This leads me to the second amendment that I will be moving to this bill.
                                                                                  </p>

Around 1,500 private companies enjoy an exemption from disclosing financial information to ASIC when they meet the large proprietary company test. It is my understanding that this provision was intended to only last three years, to allow these companies to transition their accounting practices to those required by ASIC. Rather than enforcing this transition period, governments from both sides have decided to keep this loophole in place.
                                                                                  </p>

There have also been allegations made that a significant amount of these companies are not only large donors to the major political parties but also have contracts with the government. I am concerned about how this affects the transparency of politics and government in this country. The major parties, despite various commitments made over the years, have failed to resolve this issue. Therefore, it is my intent to try to clear this up today.

I will be very interested to see if the Australian Greens, and perhaps the government, can have a last minute change of heart. The reality is the Greens are the ones in control on this matter. They are the ones that have the bargaining power on this issue. I call on the Greens to work together on this issue and support the integrity in our country's financial disclosure laws, politics and government to close this transitional loophole.

I would like to say to Senator Conroy, through you, Chair, that I hope this contribution attracts a more favourable response, and I look forward to the rest of the debate.

I want to acknowledge the contribution of Senator Bernardi. I do not hold the same view at all on the issue of tax transparency that Senator Bernardi holds. I acknowledge that Senator Bernardi has always come to this with a point of principle that I disagree with and, unlike others in this chamber, he has maintained that point of principle.
                                                                                   </p>

                                                                                    I also note the contribution of Senator Muir in this debate, which I think has been nothing but constructive and positive. I think, Senator Muir, your amendments are fantastic. The reality is: the major politics of this country for many years did not tackle a lot of these issues, because they were put in the too-hard basket. Frankly, I think that is a responsibility that lies across all the major parties.
                                                                                   </p>
                                                                                   <p>
                                                                                    I acknowledge that we did some good things when we were in power. There were several pieces of significant legislation, but I believe that the last Labor government could have and should have gone further in some of it, and perhaps having crossbench senators such as you here at that point in time would have pressured us to do so. We are better off for having you in this chamber.

The people who have been duped are: the federal cabinet, because the process, the decision and the deal were not taken to the cabinet; the Liberal Party room, who had already met, discussed this issue and reached a position, were not told about this secret deal; and the crossbench senators, who had worked with the Greens—and the Greens had played a great role, great rhetoric, on this issue over a long period of time. As I have said many times before, of the many legacies that Senator Milne left in this place highlighting this issue over many years, this is something she should be rightly very proud of.

We made our position very clear: we said we would not negotiate on any point of principle or policy and, after we had been notified of that—and you know this, Senator Whish-Wilson—I made sure that you were aware of that. I said to you that they had been talking to us and that we had rejected it. We were not going to negotiate on watering down—we call it the Bradbury amendment; other people call it the 'kidnapping' bill—the piece of legislation that we all know we are talking about here. It goes by many different names but, effectively, it was the $100 million disclosure bill, which may become a $200 million disclosure bill.

I believe there was a point of principle here that had we—and we should have—stood firm for a better deal and a better outcome, we would not be exempting right now the number of companies, the 500 or 600 companies, that are now going to be exempted.

On this idea that we are now somehow going to get a future better deal: no, the leverage is gone. The government's position has actually been consistent on this front. I do not begrudge the government.

It takes one night for them to fold completely on this matter. One night with Scotty, one night with the Treasurer, and the world is their oyster. It takes one night, and Senator Di Natale will fold on every matter. It has not even been a one-night stand. They could not even get past question time together. You cannot even call it a one-night stand. There are three parties involved. There are the Greens. There are the Nats. There are the Libs. I think in the Greens party they call that group love! But they do not even make it through a day. They cannot even make it through a day.

You should be appalled. The fact that you are prepared to sell out tax transparency under some desperate, pathetic desire to try to claw some kind of economic relevance—and let us be clear about what Senator Di Natale has actually said. The position, he said, is this: 'If the government tell us they're not going to pass something in the lower house, we can't possibly stand firm and try to fight for things here in the Senate.' That is their position. That is the principle. The principle is: 'We will be dictated to. We will be dictated to by what the government tell us they are prepared to do and not do.' What a pathetically weak party to be doing that! What is the point of principle? What is the point of principle in that matter? What is the point of principle there?

Well, as Adele would have said, you could have had it all. You could have had it all, Senator Di Natale. If it took you more than one night, if it took more than one night to get you, you could have had it all. And that is what you have gone ahead and done on a quick deal.

There is a lie at the heart of the argument because at the heart of the argument they are putting is that, firstly, any deal is better than no deal, which is a straw man, a false argument that does not stand the test of reality. It is a false argument that has been made. Let us be clear. They say, 'Oh, if we didn't do this, it was all going to fall over.' No. What is actually the fact is this. The government needed and wanted to get their legislation through. This was

On one night, with a brief meeting, in a secret room in the Treasurer's office, without key members of your own team present, you fold; you roll over; you are desperate to do it; you are in love with the idea of being some kind of a doormat.
                                                                                             </p>

The way the Nationals are going at the moment, they are going to be double or triple the size of you by the time they have finished, with these Libs defecting. You are learning from their experience about how to be a doormat. You have actually folded and you have given up, and, rather than using the leverage to get the best possible deal on tax transparency, at the first opportunity, the first deal you got, the first chance to fold, you folded. You folded as quickly as you could. You gave up instantaneously. You did not put up any kind of a fight. You did not put up any kind of a principle. You did not say: 'Hang on. How do we get the best possible deal? How do we get the best possible outcome? How do we stand firm for the principles that we have been standing firm on, not just by ourselves but with crossbench senators, with Labor senators, with cross-party, with community groups, with trade unions and with activists?' You said, 'No, the first deal we get, the first chance, we're so desperate to appease a conservative, right-wing government we will fold.' And fold you did, and quickly. It is disappointing, and it is disgusting.

I have to say I am utterly, utterly disappointed in the position that Senator Whish-Wilson has taken in this. I will never know the truth of this, but I do not believe this is the type of decision or the type of selling-out move that someone like Senator Whish-Wilson would otherwise do. He is a person of principle and a person of integrity. He is a person I have had the opportunity to work with very closely through the Senate economics committee process. He is someone I hold in the highest regard, and, frankly, I have to say, Senator Whish Wilson, you are a lot better than this.

The government will not support the amendments proposed by Senator Muir on behalf of the Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party in relation to either the reporting of information about corporate tax entities or the so-called grandfathering arrangements. The government is committed to tax transparency, but it does not believe these proposed amendments contribute to a fairer or more transparent tax system beyond what the government already supports.

The proposed amendments from the Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party in relation to reporting of information about corporate tax entities inserts a definition of 'private companies' based on a definition of large proprietary companies in the

This adds further complexity to the rules around disclosure that do not further the purpose of the transparency rules. As such, the government does not believe these proposed amendments are necessary and therefore shall not be supporting that particular set of amendments.
                                                                                               </p>

This government does not support the removing of grandfathering of proprietary companies, which has been in place for decades. The grandfathering of these entities was a policy that had bipartisan support for decades because without it the new disclosure rules at the time could potentially disrupt commercial activities. The grandfathering of exempted proprietary companies was done to avoid disrupting businesses which would have established themselves under other business forms if they had known they would have additional compliance and reporting requirements which might be subsequently introduced.
                                                                                               </p>
                                                                                               <p>
                                                                                                The removal of the exemption for large exempt proprietary companies was considered in 2001 by the Parliamentary Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities and again in 2006 by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer. The government does not support amending these rules on the fly as part of this critical piece of tax integrity legislation. This issue has been extensively considered in the past and decisions made to keep the current arrangements in place. The government therefore does not support this amendment either.

                                                                                                 I want to speak very briefly to Senator Muir's amendments. In relation to the grandfathering clause amendment I do support that amendment. It is interesting to note that in the context of this debate the information about those so-called grandfathered companies that are able to have their information kept secret from the Australian public was only disclosed after the debate, and I think that it is appropriate that it became a live issue after that and that this is an appropriate bill in which to deal with this amendment.
                                                                                                </p>
                                                                                                <p>
                                                                                                 I note that despite what the minister says there have been a number of views within the Public Service, as I understand, in the tax office and the Treasury. I will be corrected as to who actually said this, but my understanding is that there were concerns that the grandfathering arrangement was outdated and needed to be reformed, so I will support Senator Muir in relation to that amendment.
                                                                                                </p>
                                                                                                <p>
                                                                                                 On reflection I will support Senator Muir in relation to his other amendment for small, private companies, because this applies to what are defined as not large proprietary companies. If a company fulfils two out of the three criteria—either less than $25 million in turnover, assets of less than $12½ million or fewer than 50 employees—I do not think it is unreasonable that they be exempt from that provision. The minister is right. We are doing things not in the most satisfactory of circumstances and doing things on the run, but I think that it is a worthy amendment, so I will be supporting both the amendments from Senator Muir.

I just want to make it very clear that we support the principle of removing grandfathering, and it is very easy for the Labor Party to vote for this tonight when they have refused to publicly make a comment on this in the debate in recent weeks, but it will destroy this bill tonight, which is delivering an outcome on multinational tax avoidance. We support the principle and we congratulate Senator Muir for raising this issue, but we will not be supporting his amendment tonight.

I believe we have had a very long general discussion that has actually tackled a lot of the issues relating to these amendments. I want to make it clear to the Senate, however, what is about to go on here. This is the amendment moved in the name of Senator Di Natale which removes the amendments that had been earlier added to this legislation by the Greens and replaces them with what will be in our opinion—or, I think, a matter of fact—a watered down version in relation to the matter of the threshold but also in relation to the matter of the

It is an important measure in the fight against multinational tax avoidance. We would have preferred if this bill had passed unamended, but, in order to facilitate the passage of this important piece of legislation tonight, the government have agreed not to oppose this amendment moved by Senator Di Natale.

I think there is going to be a series of different amendments. I believe a lot of this confusion would have been avoided if these were amendments that we had not received on the day and we had had an opportunity to properly examine at an earlier point time.
                                                                                                       </p>

It was proposed by Senator Xenophon when this bill first came to the Senate. The government has now taken the drafting of the Senate clerks and replaced it with wording that had been written by Treasury. There is a serious concern that those of us on this side of the chamber have that this is a watered down version of what was initially moved by Senator Xenophon. Unfortunately, getting to the bottom of the significance of the changes that have been proposed has not been an opportunity afforded to us, because this dirty deal was done last night and these are amendments that were shown to the House only a few hours ago. Because of that, the Labor Party cannot and does not have confidence. While some of the language may only have minor impacts, the concern is that some of it—particularly things relating to corporate tax entities being Australian residents or having Australian permanent establishments in order to file a general purpose financial statement—means that this amendment may not be able to capture firms like Google, Apple, Microsoft and major technology companies. These are big issues. These are big concerns. Frankly, we are concerned that, in the rush of drafting this amendment, we do not have confidence it has got it right.
                                                                                                       </p>
                                                                                                       <p>
                                                                                                        I hope the Greens do realise that it actually puts off the reporting by almost three years because of the 2016 start date. It puts it off by almost three years because of the late period in which companies can start to report. But, I have to say, I have more faith in Senator Xenophon than I do in some of the government's and the ministerial drafting. I trust Senator Xenophon more, and, as such, the Labor Party will be voting to insist on the initial amendment as drafted by Senator Xenophon.

I have to say it is hugely disappointing to hear that the Labor Party are going to vote against an amendment which ensures that there is transparency around the financial accounts of those huge multinational companies. We have an opportunity here to support an amendment to the government's legislation that ensures that those companies with a billion dollar turnover publish detailed financial accounts.

In simple terms, you do not have to outline your financial affairs in any detail. This amendment ensures that those huge multinational companies now have to file detailed accounts. They have to justify why they are paying so little tax. I am flabbergasted that we are now hearing from the Labor Party that they will not support that amendment.

This amendment says that we are now going to ensure that you publish in detail your accounts so we can track your arrangements and make an assessment about what a fair level of tax should be, given the profits that you make. And we have the Labor Party saying to News Limited, 'No, we don't want to do that. We're going to let you off the hook.' I have to say it is remarkable that for the past three or four hours we have heard about how important tax transparency is to the Labor Party, and now they are going to vote against an amendment that enforces those companies—Pfizer, Glencore, News Limited—to disclose their accounts, and we are having a debate about whether the Labor Party should or should not support it! Now we hear that they are not going to.
                                                                                                            </p>

All the huff, all the bluster and all of the rhetoric that we have heard for the past few hours have been exposed as nothing more than grandstanding, because we have an opportunity. We are in the parliament. Our words actually do not matter that much. What matters are our actions. And right now we have the opportunity with our vote, the most precious thing that we are given in this place, to support legislation that would force those companies with a billion dollar turnover to disclose their affairs, and we know what that means. We know that when you force companies—as we saw in the

It removes their social licence. So now we have legislation that is going to do that to those multinationals based here in Australia, and the Labor Party are saying no.
                                                                                                            </p>

You have an opportunity to move from the sidelines into this debate and to support legislation that will ensure that those companies pay their fair share. I just urge the Labor Party, and, indeed, the crossbenchers, to support this amendment, because it will be a critical tool in the fight against multinational tax avoidance.

Senator Di Natale is not strengthening a government bill; he is watering down amendments moved by Senator Xenophon that he supported two or three weeks ago. To stand in this chamber and try and pretend that he is delivering a stronger position than is already in this bill is a total fabrication, and you will and should be exposed for trying to perpetrate that untruth on this chamber. We will not let you pretend that you are not voting against amendments that you supported previously that are tougher than what you caved in and rolled over to the government for. That is the truth. You know it. Everybody else in this chamber knows it. Senator Cormann knows it. You have rolled over and you are weakening a bill before this chamber because of your filthy, slimy deal with the government. You are going to need a long hot shower tonight after your performance, because you are trying to pretend that you are toughening up a bill, when you are weakening a bill. You deserve to be exposed for it, Senator Di Natale.

My understanding is that my amendment would pick it up by virtue of the $1 billion threshold. They are the key differences. I will put some questions in relation to that. I do have a couple of questions to put to the government, because they will be responsible for enforcing this. These are technical questions.

We heard all the evidence in our Senate inquiry about the biggest potential tax avoiders, who may be getting away without paying their fair share of tax. They are the ones who are going to be required to meet this level of reporting. That is why this is so significant. I just want to get on record that the Greens have worked this afternoon—and I thank the minister and his staff here from Treasury, who have been very helpful in going through this in significant detail, with not just me and other people within the Greens but also Senator Xenophon and others—and we have looked at this very closely. As much as Labor have tried to pick holes in this, because it suits their argument, what we are seeing is not any weakening of Senator Xenophon's amendment. We have clarified some issues around Senator Xenophon's amendment, but we are convinced from what we have heard—

He did not say that at all. Let us be very clear, to get this on record. This is a substantial part of this legislation. This is the key reason that we have put this legislation and why the Greens have supported this.

It was a nice political attempt to slur, but we have gone through this in detail.

But let's just be very, very clear about what this is. This amendment insists on the $100 million threshold. That is what the proposal that we are about to vote on is. So the question here is: will we insist on the amendment that had already been moved to this legislation, which was supported by a majority of this Senate, or will we not support an amendment that already had majority support?

So we will now find out whether they will go against the amendment that they already voted for that set $100 million as the threshold.

So let's just see how they choose to vote on it.

The board is expected to finalise the code in early 2016. The government has also maintained the Australian Taxation Office's corporation tax transparency publication. The exclusion of certain private companies below a reasonable threshold has no impact on the comprehensive powers of the Commissioner of Taxation to require companies to produce any information that is relevant to making an assessment of their tax liability. It also has no impact on the amount of tax paid by these companies under the law. The proposed public disclosure of taxpayer information will continue to apply to multinational enterprises operating in Australia and to Australian public companies.

Ultimately, this is a question of whether you get 90 per cent of something or 100 per cent of nothing. What the Labor Party is saying right now is that they would prefer to have 100 per cent of nothing. They would prefer to have an issue to grandstand with in the lead-up to the next election. It is critical it is passed today because from 1 January next year we will get country-by-country reporting. That would not happen if this legislation were not passed today, and that is why it is so critical.

The Labor Party is saying, 'We don't want to do that. We don't want legislation on multinational tax avoidance. We don't want it. We want to stand here and grandstand and have the House decide to reject this legislation to give the coalition an opportunity to say, "Hang on, the Senate can't agree. You've given us an out."' We are not going to give them an out.

This is the amendment that will, in effect, replace what we have been insisting on—which is the $100 million threshold—with the $200 million threshold. This changes the question that is going to be before us. This is the sell-out. This is the cop-out. We have discussed the reasons why we will be opposing it. I just want to make it very clear that that is what this amendment does, and that is why the Labor Party will not be supporting it.

If you think this amendment is meaningless, I think the fact that Senator Bernardi has already said that he will be crossing the floor and voting with the Labor Party tells you everything you need to know. The fact that Senator Bernardi came into this chamber a little earlier, stood up and said that he cannot in good faith support an amendment that means that 281 private companies now need to disclose their tax affairs tells you everything you need to know. So you will now have Senator Bernardi joining the Labor Party in shielding the tax affairs of 281 companies. How does it feel? How does it feel to be sitting on the benches next to Senator Bernardi, saying: 'We want to shield 281 companies from disclosing how much tax they pay'? There is a lot more that I could say, but we have ventilated all of the arguments. I think the most telling one is that, when you have the Labor Party and Senator Bernardi together, you do not need to say anything else.

We determine public policy by what is in the public interest. What the government is doing here today is legislating a very robust multinational tax avoidance scheme which will ensure that multinational companies generating profits in Australia pay their fair share of tax in Australia.
                                                                                                                                                           </p>

                                                                                                                                                           </p>

                                                                                                                                                            So the bill in front of us today is a serious measure to combat multinational tax avoidance. These measures will force multinational companies with significant activities in Australia to pay their fair share of tax and level the playing field for all taxpayers. It will ensure that the Commissioner of Taxation can force multinationals that have significant activities in Australia to pay tax on profits from economic activities undertaken here. Multinationals will no longer be able to justify using contrived schemes to avoid paying tax.
                                                                                                                                                           </p>

                                                                                                                                                           </p>

Furthermore, penalties for larger companies that enter into tax avoidance or profit-shifting schemes will be doubled. This means that they will now pay tax on profits and they will pay more tax on profits, if they have sought to avoid paying tax.

We are 20 years down, and nobody has the guts in this chamber to remove them because they are special. The Australian people want to know what makes these companies so special that they are exempt. You explain that to me and the Australian people now, because I want to hear it. I am looking forward to watching you tap-dance.

The government does not support the longstanding grandfathering of proprietary companies from complying with certain ASIC reporting requirements which have been considered extensively in the past. The grandfathering of these entities has been a policy that had bipartisan support for decades because, without it, the new disclosure rules at the time would have disrupted commercial activities. The grandfathering of exempted proprietary companies was done to avoid disrupting businesses which would have established themselves under other business forms, if they had known that they would have had additional compliance and reporting requirements which might be subsequently introduced.
                                                                                                                                                             </p>

                                                                                                                                                              The removal of the exemption for the large exempt proprietary companies was considered in 2001 by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Corporations and Securities and again in 2006 by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer. The government does not support revisiting this issue on the fly as is suggested in this amendment. We want to move ahead and get on with legislating this critical piece of tax integrity legislation. This is an issue that has been extensively considered in the past, and we believe that the principle of not making these sorts of changes retrospectively is a very important principle that ought to be upheld.

There are 1500 companies that have been part of this grandfathering arrangement, so-called. My understanding is that Treasury looked into this back in 2006. It reported, I think, at the end of 2006-07. There was a media release, as I understand it, on the Treasury website that has now been removed. It no longer exists. It has disappeared from the website. I would like to find out what that release said.

Furthermore, ASIC in their submission to the Senate inquiry into multinational tax avoidance in February 2015—chaired by Senator Dastyari at the time—said that this particular exemption could be removed. They did not put up any obstacles towards its removal.

That is what I think we should do and why I support this amendment very strongly.

I think this is a timely measure. I think we have to be fairly honest and not pussyfoot around this issue. This has been a very vexed and difficult matter over many years. The 1500 companies we are talking about—these private companies—do represent some of the wealthiest, most powerful and influential Australians. This is a provision that was given initially on a temporary basis. I think it is the right time and the right move for it to be remove I think the community out there desperately wants more information and more transparency, and I believe it is difficult to explain why particular companies are treated one way simply because of a grandfathering that was initially designed as a temporary provision and are treated differently from other companies. I think the arguments fall flat, especially the transparency arguments or even the privacy arguments or the other arguments, when you realise that there are a certain number of companies that get this special treatment and nobody else gets that same treatment. It is the inconsistency that I believe is really at the heart of it.

The Prime Minister rightly contacted ASIC and had himself removed from the grandfather list. How that process is undertaken is really a matter for them. We will find out at estimates. I want to point out that, when you have a situation where it is such a bad look that even the Prime Minister himself realises that being on this list is so toxic that he has to remove himself immediately from being notified by the media that he is on this list, you have to question why 1,497 companies remain on that list. That is the 2011 list; a few people may have been moved since then.

I believe there has previously been a lot of lobbying for the maintenance of these kinds of grandfathering exemptions. I think it is right for the Labor Party to be voting to remove the grandfathering provision. I believe that we did many, many great things in the area of disclosure and transparency in the last Labor government. Again, I have extensively gone through that in this chamber in previous speeches.

                                                                                                                                                                As I said earlier—and there are more senators here, so I want to say it again—I believe, Senator Muir, that this is a good amendment. This is an important measure. This is increased transparency. Perhaps, had you been in the last parliament and had the balance of power to help hold political and major parties to account as you are able to do in this parliament, you would have been able to improve some of that legislation, which was great legislation. These are the types of measures with which we would all have been better off had you brought them into the parliament. So I want to congratulate you for this amendment.
                                                                                                                                                               </p>

                                                                                                                                                                I have to say that the Greens political party have made it clear—and I raised this with them this morning—that they will not be supporting this amendment. I believe that is a real disappointment. The logic that has been presented both to me and in the media is this: 'Oh, that's okay. We can come back to this amendment. We can come back. There's nothing stopping the Senate having a private member's bill, and there's nothing stopping the Senate from passing this later.' That is absolutely baloney when you come to the reality.
                                                                                                                                                               </p>

The government's position, in fairness, has not been inconsistent on this front. They have actually been incredibly consistent. The government's position has been that they do not support grandfathering. What the government needed to get passed and wanted to get passed was the

As we have said repeatedly, it is not a bad piece of legislation; it just does not go anywhere near far enough. Adding grandfathering as part of the disclosure requirements would have simply improved that bill. Frankly, without the support of the Greens political party, it is unlikely that the amendment will pass in this chamber. The leverage to get that big change, to get that important change, to get these 1,497 companies in that disclosure, is about to be lost. On the idea that there could be some private member's bill and that we pass them all the time in this chamber: as senators know, we have great debates, and unfortunately we know where private members' bills go unless you have the leverage. The leverage was here. The leverage was attaching it to this bill, and the Greens sold it out.

Senator Dastyari suggested that grandfathering was introduced with the intention of it being temporary. That is just false. The grandfathering arrangements were introduced by the Keating government in 1995. If you want to make something temporary, either you give something delayed effect in the legislation or you have transitional arrangements. Grandfathering by definition is that you do not want a new piece of legislation to apply to those that had previous arrangements put in place under the previous legislation.
                                                                                                                                                                </p>

Now, I have not heard the Labor Party suggest that these grandfathering arrangements should have been changed, and of course they should not be changed, because it would be entirely unreasonable. When you make changes to the tax laws, in order for people to be able to have confidence in the system, in order for people to be able to plan their personal affairs with some certainty, people need to have confidence that, when government changes the rules on them, changes when it comes to tax arrangements are prospective changes.

He is just interested in the headlines. He is interested in the colour and movement. He is interested in being able to jump up and down in front of the cameras.

The grandfathering arrangement we are talking about here was put in place by the Keating government. It was kept in place by the Howard government. It was kept in place by the Rudd and Gillard Labor governments. And we do not believe that in the context of an important piece of legislation, given that this has been considered on a number of occasions, we should just, on the fly, make this sort of change. That is why we are not supporting this.

What it reflects is that the debate we have had for the past three hours has been nothing more than hollow, empty gestures. The result was not too bad. So what has all this been about, Senator Dastyari? Why have we wasted the Senate's time with these outrageous accusations when in your heart of hearts you know the outcome is not a bad one? It is not a bad outcome. So here we have an article from Michael West, who says the outcome is not too bad. We actually think it is better than that. We think it is a terrific outcome, because Australians for the first time will see some tax transparency from 281 companies like Transfield, like Grocon and like the Labor Party's donors Inghams chicken, Pratt Holdings and Meriton.

                                                                                                                                                                  It is disappointing that we come to the eleventh hour and Michael West bells the cat. All the huff and the bluster, and this is an outcome that is 'not too bad'. We think it is better than that, but what has all this been about? What has it all been about if the outcome, in your words, Senator Dastyari, is 'not too bad'? Again, what we have is 90 per cent of something versus 100 per cent of nothing. We prefer to roll our sleeves up and get outcomes for the community, and you prefer to shout from the sidelines.

And there are measures that could have made the bill even better than what we will be voting on tonight. So we end up with a bad system. There is a government proposal to make it slightly better, and the MAAL bill does some good things. We have always said that as the Labor Party. Then this chamber moves a whole bunch of amendments that massively improve that legislation, and the Greens cut a last-minute deal to water it back again. So let's be clear: they cave in.

That has been made very loud and clear here this evening. These laws and their regulations are made by their political donors in here. So—through the chair—Senator Cormann, you will have no problem helping me call for a royal commission on political donations in the future.

He said we had the numbers as a Senate. We had the numbers for a political outcome, not for a policy outcome. There is a big difference between actually getting a bill passed into legislation and getting a political outcome that you can go and do a press conference on.

It does not matter that you are grandfathered; you will still have to disclose that basic financial information that this bill outlines.
                                                                                                                                                                        </p>

                                                                                                                                                                         Let's be clear: Senator Muir initially put up this amendment around grandfathering not because he wanted to get rid of it; he did it because of a technicality. His original amendment going back to the first bill made it clear that he did not want people distorting the sensitive information. He did not want tabloids, greenies or whoever beating people up because of this information. And it was a sensible thing. He said: 'Let them go through and look at ASIC's accounts so they can actually get a clearer picture of all the information there.' Following that, he discovered that some companies do not file with ASIC, because they have this grandfather amendment. So he said, 'Well, if I'm going to stick to my principles here, every company has to have their info on the ASIC register.' That is where it has come from. It has not come from a desire to get rid of it per se.

If people want to know more about your financial affairs and they cannot find it, that is going to be a very good incentive to put your accounts on ASIC. This is the important factor that we are dealing with here. We are building momentum towards getting that transparency that we want in place. Do not ignore this fact: if you vote against this tonight, you are voting against having a version of the Bradbury legislation—or the kidnap bill or whatever you want to call it. We have at least got that tonight. Let's be very clear about that. And it does not matter if you have been grandfathered or not; you are going to have to put your information on there. So, we have actually delivered a very good result on this.

But I do want to go back to the overall point from Senator Muir here because this is an amendment from Senator Muir. I want to acknowledge the history of both major political parties and our resolve to tackle these kinds of issues. It has not been as strong as it should have been, and we are better off by having people like Senator Muir, who are able to hold our feet to the fire on some of these matters. Him having the balance of power on legislation like this has the potential to make this a better place and to push major political parties to make sometimes tough decisions that are sometimes easier for them not to make. I congratulate him on that and say again that the Greens will not be voting with us on this.

I believe he ideologically does believe it is the wrong thing. I share that view with him. But I believe he also—
