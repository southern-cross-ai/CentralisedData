         on the weekend were transported to the detention centre built by the former Howard government which provides detention facilities for use by the Indonesian government for persons they have detained there. I am not aware of how many others are in the detention centre because I understand there are others there from what I have seen in media reports. I have no direct knowledge of how many others are there. What we do know, though, is that we are seeking to disembark the remaining 56 of the 78 passengers and we are seeking to have them transported to the detention centre and processed in accordance with the arrangements with the Indonesian government and the

            Order! The question came from Senator Scullion. Interjections are completely disorderly. You know that. If Senator Scullion has a supplementary question when we get supplementary questions, he is entitled to ask that question. I would invite Senator Scullion to do so but, Senator Evans, you have to answer the question that has been asked by Senator Scullion, ignore interjections and address your comments to the chair.

               There are other persons who have been mandated, as I understand it, in Indonesia. I do not have the figures with me, but it is true to say that over the last few years Australia and other resettlement countries have resettled in the order of 1,300 persons who have been found to be refugees inside Indonesia, and we have resettled the largest number of that group. I think we have resettled in the order of 460 to 500, but I will try and find the figure for you. Many of those were, of course, resettled under the previous government. So, yes, we have made a commitment to resettlement out of Indonesia. We have been working with them to improve the time frames—

I allowed a wide-ranging answer in the principal answer and I tolerated the minister neither taking the question on notice nor answering the question. I asked a very specific question in regard to the difference between the treatment of the huge demographic of people who have been declared refugees in Indonesia and the current deal that is being done with the small number of people on the

                 , on the point of order: what we have now witnessed from the opposition is a reformulation of the original question. In relation to the question that was asked, the minister has been answering the question, has been directly relevant to the question and, in fact, has been going to the specifics of the matter. Rather than the statement of a new question, what we are now witnessing is both the coalition and the Liberals using the opportunity of taking a point of order to either restate the question or disagree with the answer that is being provided. I would ask the President to have a look at the tapes in that regard.

                  I believe the question is being answered. I again draw to the attention of the Senate the fact that I cannot instruct the minister or tell the minister how to answer the question. I cannot get a minister to respond to a question that is being asked in the way that might be desired by the questioner. That is something I cannot do. I have said that the minister is addressing the question. The minister has 12 seconds remaining and I draw the minister’s attention to the question. He can add any further remarks he wishes to add in those 12 seconds.

As part of our international legal obligations we then transported those people to Indonesia. It is true to say that those people were disappointed that they were not taken to Australia, and they sought to convince us to take them to Australia. We rejected that demand and advised them that they would be disembarked in Indonesia. As part of that process we advised them of how they would be processed when they disembarked. What we have been very open about is how that process, by way of the agreement with the Indonesian government, will occur. That is what will occur. There is no negotiation occurring.
