        . I would like to pay tribute to the Hunter Breast Cancer Foundation, which is a Newcastle based and founded not-for-profit organisation which provides support services for both men and women living with breast cancer in the Hunter region.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Hunter Breast Cancer Foundation is incredibly passionate about delivering the best level of support and services to those who are dealing with the effects of breast cancer. During the pandemic, they've been busier than ever. While many charities and support services went into hibernation over the pandemic, they've had one of their busiest years ever. They provide extensive, practical support services for those who are dealing with the effects of breast cancer. This includes patient transport, house cleaning and lawn mowing but also wigs and headwear. They've seen a significant increase in services and client numbers. They've had an 80 per cent increase in the number of people supported just this year alone—that's over 135 people—with over 600 services delivered this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        More than 20,000 Australians will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year—that's around 55 every day—and, sadly, more than 3,000 of them will lose their life to breast cancer this year. Organisations like the Hunter Breast Cancer Foundation are vital to supporting our communities. I commend them for their ongoing support and dedication to the Hunter Community. I encourage all men and, in particular, women to have those check-ups early and regularly, because early detection is the best cure.
