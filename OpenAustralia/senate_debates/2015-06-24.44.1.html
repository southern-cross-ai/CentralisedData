        My question is to the Acting Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Brandis. Can he update the Senate on the government's record of achievements and, in particular, its record of legislative achievements?

         Thank you very much, Senator Sinodinos, for that very timely question. Yes, I can, because I am pleased to say that the Abbott government has a great record of legislative achievement. That is partly due to the fact that this Senate—which, of course, the government does not control a majority of—has been passing government legislation. By the start of this week, already 68 bills had passed the Senate this year. We are not at the end of the sitting fortnight, as you know,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
          Mr President
         </a>
         , but already in the last fortnight we have passed 35 bills. On Monday, we passed 11 bills. Yesterday, we passed a further seven. Already this morning we have passed another five. I want to pay a compliment to the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Senator Mitch Fifield, who has managed the government's legislative program so skilfully for so long, but particularly in the last fortnight.
        </p>
        <p>
         For example, Senator Sinodinos, Monday of last week we passed the small business tax cut and instant asset write-off legislation. On Tuesday, the Senate passed the Abbott government's plan to make the pension fairer and more sustainable, with benefits for 170,000 pensioners with modest assets, who will receive an extra $30 a fortnight as a result of that legislation. On Wednesday of last week, $3.3 billion of budget repair measures were passed in the Senate with the passage of the budget's tax legislation—a great achievement, in particular, of my colleague Senator Mathias Cormann, who had responsibility for that legislation. This morning, Mr President, as you know, we passed the diesel fuel legislation.

            Yes, Senator Sinodinos, I can tell you more.
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Senate" rel="nofollow">
             The Senate
            </a>
            has also passed the renewable energy target, which will result in more than 23.5 per cent of Australia's electricity being derived from renewable sources by 2020. As I mentioned a moment ago, as recently as this morning, the Senate passed the biannual petrol indexation, which will improve the budget bottom line by $3.6 billion over five years. We, the Abbott government, are getting on with the job of building for the future. Our economic plan is working. Our legislative plan is progressing. We have created more than 280,000 new jobs since we were elected, and Australia is now back in business.

              Well, Senator Sinodinos, as you well know, none of this would have been possible without the cooperation of the Senate. I am pleased to say that in recent times the Senate has shown a more cooperative attitude towards the government than was the case, perhaps, last year. We understand that it is the opposition's role to oppose, but it is the opposition's role to oppose constructively. I do want to acknowledge and thank the opposition for its support on the renewable energy target legislation and its support on the diesel fuel rebate indexation legislation, just as I acknowledge the support of the Greens in passing the pension reforms which were passed through the Senate last week. The Australian people generally like the idea of a balance of power in our constitution, but they do expect the Senate to be constructive, and in this fortnight it has been.
