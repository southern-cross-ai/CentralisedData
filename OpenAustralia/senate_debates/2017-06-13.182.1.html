        I rise this evening to add my voice to the chorus of congratulations for the recipients of this year's Queen's birthday honours. These recipients, hailing from all walks of life across Australia, have selflessly provided their leadership, their insight and their compassion to the service of their communities and to the nation. As a proud Victorian, I wholeheartedly congratulate all the Victorian recipients of Queen's birthday honours. Each and every one of which is so richly deserved. But first I extend my warmest congratulations to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Green" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , an AO. His electoral insight, especially on election night, has kept us all, on both side of the chamber, on the edge of our seats for many an election. In fact, he has been a feature of every election since I was 19 years old. Congratulations on a worthy and well-deserved honour.
       </p>
       <p>
        More specifically I would like to congratulate and thank the following Victorian recipients who have so significantly contributed to the fabric of our society through their service and dedication in their particular fields. I congratulate Ms Marilyn Patricia Rowe

        </a>
        and the nation's various public services who have also been awarded in this year's Honours List. Victorians number among the many recipients of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Service_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Public Service Medal
        </a>
        , the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distinguished_Service_Cross" rel="nofollow">
         Distinguished Service Cross
        </a>
        and the various other military and civil honours. Many of these brave men and women are not able to be publically named due to their ongoing operational commitments.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to take a moment to offer personal and heartfelt congratulations to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Mayor" rel="nofollow">
         Lord Mayor
        </a>
        of Melbourne, Counsellor
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Doyle" rel="nofollow">
         Robert Doyle
        </a>
        . Perhaps not everyone here is aware of this, but I have known Robert Doyle for many, many years—far more than I care to mention. For me Counsellor Doyle was formerly Mr Doyle, my most beloved English teacher    and a formative mentor. Mr Doyle—Counsellor Doyle, I should say; I still call him by his teacher's name—is the man who later in life brought me to the Liberal Party and encouraged me to run for public office. I owe him a lot—and not just for making poetry interesting, quite a tough gig—and I could not be happier for him for having received our nation's highest honour, being made a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companion_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Companion of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        . Counsellor Doyle has served his country, state, city and his community with distinction for decades, and this award could not be more fitting. I am very proud to call him a friend and I am very proud that he has received this honour.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are two very special times of the year when the government and the community can express our sincere gratitude to those exemplary citizens who represent the very best of the Australian spirit. It is an absolute honour to be able to stand before the chamber today to name and honour those dedicated and conscientious Victorians. I thank the chamber for its indulgence.
