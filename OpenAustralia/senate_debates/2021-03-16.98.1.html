          The committee being proposed would begin the long journey to collect data and identify issues and challenges that may arise at the national level with truth-telling and agreement-making—issues and challenges that presently we all speculate and even hold fears about. It would review what has been happening internationally and identify what legal issues and challenges there may be at a national level if we go down the makarrata pathway. The aim of this exercise is to send a message to those who are focused solely on a voice to the parliament or to the government, but there are other aspects of the Uluru Statement that are not lost on the parliament. The committee would be taking an initial step to help parliamentarians and the community more generally to become aware of what some of the key elements in truth-telling and treaty-making might be at the national level.

             The Morrison government does support a process of local truth-telling. However, the matters referred to are matters best dealt with by the state and territory governments and therefore we don't support the establishment of a select committee on these matters.

                You can roll your eyes at that, but that is the truth that you are in denial of, and that we need peace in this country. And the only way we are going to get peace and equality is to go down the treaty path. Treaty is about truth-telling. Treaty is about acknowledging our past roles. It's not about blame. It's not about taking your backyard. It's nothing to fear. It's about creating a new nation that we can all be a part of so that we don't have the haves and the have-nots anymore. It's about protecting each other as a community and protecting our culture, our country and our water. It's time for a treaty, and it's time to wake up.
