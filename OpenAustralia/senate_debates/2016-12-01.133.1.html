        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Brandis. I refer to the Prime Minister, who on Tuesday said: 'I have an excellent ministry. I am delighted with the work that my colleagues are undertaking.' Was the Prime Minister referring to (a) a backpacker tax that has gone from 32 per cent to 10.5 per cent to 19.5 per cent to 15 per cent; (b) the hateful, divisive, expensive and ultimately failed marriage plebiscite; or (c) the 'continuity with change' campaign that lost him 14 elected members?

         Senator Dastyari, when the Prime Minister said on Tuesday he had an excellent ministry, I will tell you he what he was referring to: he was referring to the excellence of his ministry. Just look at the excellent ministers who sit in this chamber. There is my deputy, Senator Cormann, the best finance minister Australia has had in living memory, who has devoted himself heart and soul to trying to fix up the mess which we inherited from the worst finance minister in Australian history, Senator Wong, who sits across from me. There is Senator Mitch Fifield, the Minister for Communications and the Arts, who has delivered on the

          NBN

         so that it will be brought in at lower cost and years sooner than it ever would have been under the Labor Party's failed plan under former Senator Stephen Conroy.
        </p>
        <p>
         And who can forget the peerless Senator Michaelia Cash, the champion of the volunteer firefighters in Victoria and the Joan of Arc of the owner-drivers, whom the Labor Party wanted to drive out of business? Senator Michaelia Cash, as recently as this week, has secured the passage of two vital pieces of industrial relations reform, the registered organisations bill and the

          ABCC

         bill, bills that will restore the rule of law to the construction industry and ensure that those who run trade unions—the bosses and thugs who pull your strings, Senator Sam Dastyari—are accountable to their members and that their conduct is transparent.
        </p>
        <p>
         Then we have Senator Simon Birmingham, a finer education minister than whom it would be impossible to imagine.

              You know, Senator Dastyari, I was wondering if you might give me something for Christmas, and you have delivered. You have delivered with a very generous Christmas question, the last question of the year. When the Prime Minister was referring to runs on the board, he was referring, for example to the runs that Senator Simon Birmingham had put on the board in his reforms of the

              sector and training, which have saved the Australian taxpayer billions of dollars by salvaging a scheme which your side, in government, made a complete and abject mess of. He is referring to people like Senator Arthur Sinodinos, the cabinet secretary, a wiser and more experienced servant of the Australian people—

                    The Prime Minister also stated:
                   </p>
                   <p class="italic">
                    We are delivering, the 45th Parliament is working, the government is governing …
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Was the Prime Minister referring to (a) trading guns for votes or (b) making history as the first government to vote against itself, which the government did again today? And can I just say, Senator Brandis, if this is the last opportunity in the house to say this: you will be missed.

                     When the Prime Minister said the government is delivering, he was referring to the achievements the government has seen in particular on the floor of this Senate in recent months and indeed in recent weeks and days, like the

                     legislation, to which I will return, because it is such a signal achievement of this government and of this minister, Senator Michaelia Cash in particular, to restore the rule of law to a lawless construction sector. That never happened under a Labor government, of course, because you are the indentured slaves of the union thugs who run the

                     . Nor did the passage of the registered organisations bill, the other trigger piece of legislation, which will ensure that trade union officials have the same obligations of accountability and transparency as company directors. It would not have happened under your watch, Senator Dastyari—never under a Labor government.
