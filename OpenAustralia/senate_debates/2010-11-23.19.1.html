Can the minister confirm whether the NBN will make a return at or above the commercial cost of capital for the NBN?

         Co. has finalised, as I have already said, its three-year corporate plan and a 30-year business plan. The company did submit, as I have said, the plan to government on 8 November. The government is committed to releasing as much information as possible from the business plan. The business plan contains material, as Mr Quigley has advised, which is highly sensitive and commercial-in-confidence. Certain information may be of a commercial significance in a number of competitive procurement processes which NBN Co. currently has underway and those which may be conducted during the life of the project. This includes the commercial—

            . And this includes the commercial negotiations of definitive agreements with Telstra. It would be utterly irresponsible to release this information. The sensitive nature of the business plan was further confirmed by Mr Quigley last week in his letter, and his letter was very, very specific. I am happy to point out and read to the chamber what Mr Quigley said. His letter outlines that the peak equity requirement of the project approximates that predicted by the implementation study. The total capital expenditure is substantially lower than predicted by the implementation study—noting that the plan is based on significantly different assumptions, including a deal with Telstra and independent advice based on borrowing capacity.

              Thank you, Senator Joyce, for those questions, because all of that information will be included when we release the documents so that people can analyse these things. But we do not intend to release this document until the cabinet has had a chance to consider it, until the

               ACCC
