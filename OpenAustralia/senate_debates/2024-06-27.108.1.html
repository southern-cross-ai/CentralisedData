        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. Minister, how will the Albanese Labor government's tax cuts in four days time provide impactful cost-of-living relief and benefit for all Australians and all taxpayers, not just some? Can the minister also outline some of the other ways the budget supports all Australians with the challenges of the cost of living?

         Thank you to my friend Senator Sterle for that excellent question. As he knows and as all of the senators on this side know, in just four days every Australian taxpayer will get a tax cut, and in four days our $300 energy bill relief for every household will also begin. Also, in four days, 2.6 million low-paid workers will get their third consecutive pay rise backed by this government. And in four days, paid parental leave will increase to 22 weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
         What I would say to those opposite who come in here almost barracking for an interest rate rise—the only people in Australia who want an interest rate rise are those opposite because they think it is in their political interests—is that we on this side understand that Australians are under pressure. We on this side understand how important it is to deliver cost-of-living measures to ease cost-of-living pressures. As well as tax cuts for every Australian taxpayer, we are delivering in total some $7.8 billion in cost-of-living relief in the budget. As I said, from Monday, 13.6 million Australian taxpayers get a tax cut—everyone who pays tax, not just some—and the average family will save more than $3,200.
        </p>
        <p>
         Sadly, what is Mr Dutton's plan? Mr Dutton's plan is: 'No.' He is saying no to getting wages moving, no to cheaper medicines, no to power bill relief and no to cheaper childcare. Remember how much they hated having to vote for the tax cuts? Well, they are still saying they were the wrong thing to do. I mean, we really know what the coalition is about, don't we? No to wage increases—

           As a proud member of a Labor government that delivers support for Australians when they need it most, can the minister please tell the Senate why Labor's tax cuts are fairer and better and will support more Australians in more industries, including those who are low- and middle-income earners?

            Thank you, Senator Sterle. I acknowledge your advocacy, and that of so many of our colleagues, over so many years for low- and middle-income Australians. That is one of the big differences between our parties. Those opposite—remember—had tax cuts which vastly benefited those on higher incomes.
           </p>
           <p>
            And now they are still going on about it. I know it really pains you that 2.9 million people on incomes under $45,000 a year who would not have received at cent under your plan now get a tax cut under us. That really pains you, doesn't it?
           </p>
           <p>
            I look forward to Senator Birmingham being very supportive of the fact that nine out of 10 of our taxpaying constituents in
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
             South Australia
            </a>
            will get a bigger tax cut. I look forward to Senator Hume being pleased that 86 per cent of Victorian taxpayers will get a bigger tax cut from 1 July. And I look forward to Senator Cash recognising that 81 per cent of Western Australians will get a bigger—

              I find it concerning that that mob over there, the Liberals and the Nationals, have voted against cost-of-living relief and don't have a plan to provide reliable, clean and cheap power for this decade. Minister, how is the government supporting Australians with energy bill relief now and planning for the future?

               Thank you. As Senator Sterle knows, we are ensuring $300 of relief on power bills from 1 July, on top of the relief we have previously provided. In four days, there will be $300 off your power bills. We know the attitude of those opposite because they have been so opposed to assistance to Australian households. Instead, what have they done? Labor's taken $300 off your power bills. In two decades,

               will serve up the most expensive form of energy there is and he will ask taxpayers to pay for it. That is their plan.

              <p>
               But I'll tell you what, colleagues. Have you noticed something? Have you noticed how they dropped off prosecuting this great political strategy? Have you noticed that nuclear in this chamber is now the policy that dare not speak its name. You know it is a dud. You know it is a dud and you can't even bring yourselves to defend it.
