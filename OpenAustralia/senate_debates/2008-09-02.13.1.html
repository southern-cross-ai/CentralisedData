         I thank Senator Bishop for a very important question. The Labor government regard nation building as a core part of our work, part of our plan to lead Australia through the challenging economic times that lie ahead. Twenty-first century nation building requires responsible economic management and plans to deliver world class infrastructure. We know that inflation is rising and productivity has declined. Over the last five years of the previous government, despite the good economic times, productivity growth averaged its lowest in more than 16 years. We know that demand for resources is growing, urban congestion means parents are robbed of precious time with their families and our internet connections are way too slow. That is why the Rudd government have taken the responsible economic approach and have allocated $41 billion to nation-building investment funds. This includes a $20 billion investment in the Building Australia Fund for rail, roads, ports and broadband, an agenda the previous government ignored. On top of that is a $26 billion investment in rail and roads through
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AusLink" rel="nofollow">
          AusLink
         </a>
         2, $15 billion in education infrastructure through the Education Investment Fund and $10 billion in health and hospitals infrastructure through the Health and Hospitals Fund.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are using our surplus for a purpose. The purpose is to boost productivity, put downward pressure on inflation and interest rates and lock in the countryâ€™s long-term prosperity. But you cannot use the surplus to fund long-term nation building if those opposite seek to vandalise the budget and rip $6.2 billion out of its core. That money is essential to our long-term plans and is central to the long-term economic security of Australian families. So when the opposition in their negativity move to block nation-building investment they are putting at risk the long-term living standards of Australians.

          Infrastructure Australia
         </a>
         the Rudd government are working hand in hand with the states and territories and the private sector to pursue our nation-building agenda. Infrastructure Australia is working to ensure investment goes where it is needed most. Beyond the cities our wider national economic infrastructure must function properly as well. In the long term, this will underpin productivity, competitiveness, exports and prosperity. And these plans have been welcomed by business because they appreciate the importance of them. To solve our most pressing economic and social issues we have to help get parents out of traffic jams and home to the kids, get our exports to market without delay, drive the digital revolution, make public transport a viable alternative to the car, get families the best possible education and health and help Australia transition to a low-carbon economy. The Labor Party have always been about nation building and our infrastructure plans are part of our plan for the future of this country.

         In my own area of immigration, part of our plan and our response is to build the skills capacity of the nation. Under the previous government, capacity constraints choked business opportunities to grow and develop. Together with training our local workforce, plans to increase the skills coming into this country will allow us to break through those restraints.
