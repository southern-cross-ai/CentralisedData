        , representing the Prime Minister. Attorney, I refer you to the humanitarian disaster currently unfolding in Myanmar, and the ongoing persecution of the Rohingyan people by the Myanmar military. The most recent figures, I am sure you will agree, show that almost 300,000 Rohingyan people have fled

        in the last 10 days—that is 30,000 a day—and crossed the border into Bangladesh. Is the funding of up to $5 million announced on the weekend the entirety of the Australian government's response to this crisis? And when will the Prime Minister follow the lead of other global leaders and personally express concern about the situation in Myanmar?

         Senator McKim, I think you're wrong. The Prime Minister, I understand, has already expressed on behalf of the Australian people his concern about the humanitarian issues of the people in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakhine_State" rel="nofollow">
          Rakhine State
         </a>
         . The foreign minister, as well, on behalf of the government on Saturday, set out the Australian government's response, including a commitment of up to $5 million to address immediate needs. The government has spoken directly to Myanmar and we've called for restraint, the protection of civilians, and unfettered access for humanitarian workers. We have also spoken directly with our regional partners. The foreign minister personally spoke with President Widodo and will continue to closely engage with Indonesia and others. We, like everyone in our region, are very focused on this crisis.
        </p>
        <p>
         At the moment, Senator McKim, what Australia—like other regional partners—needs to do is to focus on immediate issues. Our focus must be on meeting the urgent need for food and shelter, and supporting agencies like the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
          UN
         </a>
         HCR. Australia recognises the heavy burden placed on Bangladesh. We have committed up to $5 million for our immediate response to the crisis. That funding will bring Australia's assistance for Rohingya and other affected communities to over $50 million since 2012. We also welcome Myanmar's commitment to ensure assistance reaches communities through the

          Red Cross
         </a>

           Attorney, the Greens welcome the response to date from the Australian government. But could you explain what steps the government intends to take to resettle, or to assist in resettling, the Rohingya people who have been displaced? Do you agree that Australia has a leadership role to play in our region and that it has a much greater capacity to assist the Rohingya people than most other countries in the world?

            Before I respond, I will just correct something I said in answer to your primary question, Senator McKim. The conversation to which I referred was a conversation between the Prime Minister and President Widodo. I think I said it was between the foreign minister and President Widodo.
           </p>
           <p>
            Senator McKim, I have outlined what the Australian government's response is to this humanitarian crisis. As I said, it is an aspect of the broader assistance of over $50 million that Australia has provided since 2012 for the Rohingya and other affected communities. That has been a generous response. It is a response in which Australia has been one of the leading regional participants, and that is the response that the government proposes to make.

              Attorney, I refer you to the letter written by Senator Di Natale and me to the Prime Minister over the weekend. It calls for a special intake of 20,000 Rohingya refugees over and above our current annual humanitarian intake. Could you advise whether, in good faith, the government will at least consider this request, noting the urgency of the situation?

               Senator McKim, first of all, the urgency of the situation demands the urgent response which I've outlined in answer to your primary question. The government is presently not minded to accede to calls, including those from you and Senator Di Natale, for increases in the humanitarian intake. But, as you know, Senator, we do operate a most generous humanitarian refugee program.
