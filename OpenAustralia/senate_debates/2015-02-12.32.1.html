           Violence against women and children is a scourge on our society. It will not be tolerated and we must all work together to eliminate it. The government is showing tremendous leadership in this area, most recently demonstrated by the Prime Minister's announcement that the 2015
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Australian_Governments" rel="nofollow">
            Council of Australian Governments
           </a>
           agenda will address the issue of violence against women at a national level. In terms of the alleged funding cuts, there have been no funding cuts to the national plan. The federal government is committed to the implementation of the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children.
          </p>
          <p>
           Funding for services under the National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness and Family Violence Prevention Legal Services will be determined shortly. Through our legal assistance programs we are focused on making sure the $1.3 billion we have invested over the next four years for legal assistance is targeted to front-line legal services.

           attempt to propagate a campaign of misinformation and fear is disappointing, particularly given their flagrant disregard for fiscal restraint and their pivotal role in ensuring all Australians have been saddled with chronic debt.
