        I seek leave to incorporate an answer to a question from Senator Boswell yesterday. There was a bit of confusion yesterday. We have been able to work our way through that and I am hoping his office has already got a copy of this answer.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The answer read as follows—

         Taking Notice —Marine Sanctuaries
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 17 November 2010, Senator Boswell asked questions concerning marine sanctuaries of me (Senator Conroy) in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Question 1
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Minister, can you assure the Senate that the study conducted by the Ecology Centre of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         University of Queensland
        </a>
        for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pew_Charitable_Trusts" rel="nofollow">
         Pew Charitable Trusts
        </a>
        that was publicly released last week, which recommended that 50 per cent of the south-west marine bioregion be locked up in sanctuaries, will not be a consideration in the development of the draft marine plan for either the south-west region or any other bioregion?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Answer
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The recent report by the University of Queensland on possible marine reserve design options in the South-west marine region is, like any other material provided as part of the ongoing community dialogue on marine conservation, one input into the overall process.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        welcomes the views and information provided by all stakeholders.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Question 2
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Can the minister to assure the house that no Commonwealth funds were used by the Pew Charitable Trusts to fund the study undertaken for the trusts by the Ecology Centre of the University of Queensland?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Answer 2
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        No Commonwealth funds were used to fund the study.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Question 3
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Can the minister inform the Senate if it is still the Government’s intention to release the displaced effort policy and the draft marine plan for the south-west this year?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Answer 3
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Minister is having ongoing consultations with stakeholders on both the displaced activities policy and the release of the draft South-west Marine Bioregional Plan. At this stage the Government’s commitment to consultation on Marine Bioregional Planning means a formal release of these documents is likely early next year.
