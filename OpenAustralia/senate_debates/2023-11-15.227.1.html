        My question is to the Minister for Emergency Management and the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Senator Watt. Already this year we have seen bushfires raging across Queensland,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        , the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and Tasmania. We have seen people die already, and we have seen homes destroyed, and it's only mid-November. During emergencies reliable and timely information is essential to protect both people and property. Will the government boost ABC funding to ensure that the ABC, our national emergency broadcaster, can continue to keep Australians informed and safe?

         Thank you, Senator Hanson-Young. As I've pointed out repeatedly in this chamber, the Albanese government are strong supporters of the ABC—and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SBS" rel="nofollow">
          SBS
         </a>
         , for that matter—as our national public broadcasters. We were very proud of the fact that in our first budget, I think, we reversed a substantial portion of the funding cuts that had been imposed on the ABC by the former coalition government, who we know are no friends of public broadcasting or the ABC.
        </p>
        <p>
         I absolutely recognise the vital role of the ABC when it comes to emergency broadcasting. I've personally relied on it, and I've certainly met a lot of Australians who have. Of course, one of the reasons that people become reliant on ABC emergency broadcasts is that, as you point out, there are occasions when our communications networks do fail because of the impact of disasters. Literally, the way that people stay aware of emergency situations is by having a portable radio—battery powered, not reliant on the electricity network—to receive those emergency warnings.
        </p>
        <p>
         You would be aware, I'm sure, Senator Hanson-Young, that, in addition to restoring the funding cut by the former coalition government, this government has taken a number of steps to lock in certainty around future ABC funding, in particular locking in five-year funding terms of increased funding so that the ABC, whether it be the emergency broadcasting section or any other, is not subject to the whims of the government of the day and is not subject to the risk of political interference through fear of losing their funding. That will assist the emergency broadcasting role of the ABC in addition to the many other important roles that the ABC plays. We're, of course, also conducting a review into options for strengthening the independence of the ABC to safeguard against further arbitrary funding cuts that we might see from a future coalition government.

           does not receive extra funding to do this vital work of keeping Australians informed and safe. We know that we can't rely on telecommunications services such as Optus. We've seen that over the last week. Next month, your government is going to be handing down MYEFO. Ahead of this horror summer, will you commit to extra funding to keep Australians safe and informed and help the ABC do their job?

            I know that Senator Gallagher would have a lot to say if I were to reveal MYEFO commitments before the day itself. As I say, the actions that we have already taken in restoring to the ABC the funding cut by the former government and in locking in that guaranteed funding for five years for the ABC obviously will partially benefit the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC's" rel="nofollow">
             ABC's
            </a>
            emergency broadcasting section in addition to its other services. But this is not the only thing that this government is doing to improve our preparedness for this disaster season. I've already said that this year we will have the largest-ever fleet of aerial firefighting planes that we've ever had in this country—around 500. We've obviously taken steps through our disaster ready fund, and, even in communications, we're well on the way to delivering a much better and faster messaging service for people in emergency situations as well.

              At Senate estimates only a couple of weeks ago, the ABC revealed that they have received no extra funding to help them do this vital work. It's essential. It's important.

               Thank you, Senator Hanson-Young. Again, you would be familiar with the fact that the ABC does operate independently of government, and we don't direct them as to how they should use the funding that's provided by government. It's a matter for ABC management to decide whether they dedicate the extra funding that we've provided to emergency broadcasting or to their other activities. I will note, though—Senator McAllister has drawn my attention to a speech the Minister for Communications gave to the ABC Friends of Victoria, I think in November last year, in which she talked about the reinstatement of funding that had been cut by the coalition. Minister Rowland said on budget night in October last year that she was pleased to see the ABC welcome the extra funding commitment, issuing a statement that said, 'The increase in funding will mean greater capacity to deliver emergency broadcasting services to provide crucial information.' So it would appear that, in the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC's" rel="nofollow">
                ABC's
               </a>
               own words, they have received funding that will assist them with that service.
