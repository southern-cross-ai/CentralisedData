        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Brandis. I refer to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea" rel="nofollow">
         North Korea

        's latest launch of a missile, which occurred early this morning and is reported to have travelled higher than any previous North Korean

         Yes, Senator Wong. Thank you for that important question.

          North Korea

         poses a grave and increasing threat to regional and global security. Its test this morning of another ballistic missile further highlights its disregard for the safety and security of our region. Australia will not accept North Korea's illegal nuclear and ballistic missile tests and its threats. Increased diplomatic and economic pressure is an essential pillar of the collective strategy to put pressure upon Pyongyang. It is vital that all members of the international community fully implement the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          United Nations
         </a>
         Security Council resolutions, and Australia is moving quickly to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia, as honourable senators will be aware, has its own autonomous sanctions regime aimed at limiting North Korea's ability to develop weapons of mass destruction. The foreign minister has agreed to designate another 11 individuals and nine entities under the autonomous sanctions for their association with North Korea's illegal weapons program or for flouting the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council" rel="nofollow">
          United Nations Security Council
         </a>
         resolutions. We constantly review our autonomous sanctions to ensure that they are coordinated with those of the United States and other like-minded partners. We will continue to work with those partners, including the Republic of Korea, the United States, Japan and China, to maintain pressure on North Korea to change its behaviour.

            Senator Wong, I really addressed that issue in my answer to your primary question. We are working with our partners. We are observing the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
             United Nations
            </a>
            Security Council resolutions—in particular, the sanctions regime—and we have our own autonomous sanctions regime, which has included, as I said in answer to your initial question, the designation of another 11 individuals and nine entities under that sanctions regime. Australia now has sanctions against 31 entities and 37 individuals under the autonomous sanctions regime. When the designations to which I have referred come into effect, those numbers will rise to 40 entities and 48 individuals.

               The global community, of course, remains very concerned about the threat, and that concern has only been ramified by this morning's testing of another ballistic missile. The international community—in particular the partners whom I have mentioned with whom Australia works—are concerned to enforce the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
                United Nations
               </a>
               sanctions regime; to adopt, as Australia has done, their own autonomous sanctions regime; and, through diplomatic and other means, to maintain pressure on
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea" rel="nofollow">
                North Korea
               </a>
               to change its behaviour. Obviously, as you know, Senator Wong, China in particular is a very important actor here. Not only China but also other nations with whom Australia works in partnership all seek to put pressure on North Korea to change its behaviour.
