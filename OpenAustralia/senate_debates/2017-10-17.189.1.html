       </p>
       <p>
        One of these events took place last Friday, 13 October, when I had the great pleasure of representing the Prime Minister and presenting his address at the India Australia Business &amp; Community Awards ceremony, held in

        I'd like to recognise the winner of the most coveted IABCA award, the India-Australia Ambassador of the Year, Neville Roach AO, Chairman Emeritus,

        restaurant and to assist the owner, Ben Stockbridge, in serving customers. I was on the drive-thru. It was a wonderful time, with all sorts of activities, from car shows to face painting. Two dollars from each
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Mac" rel="nofollow">

        sold on the day was donated by McDonald's to Ronald McDonald House, which is a truly amazing charity. Those who have experienced it and seen it in action know that it gives support to so many families who are doing it tough, whose kids are in hospital. The first Ronald McDonald House opened in Camperdown in 1981. It has been one of our great charities. There are now 16 Ronald McDonald Houses in Australia and more than 360 worldwide. So, in the time I have left, I want to say well done to McDonald's, well done to Ronald McDonald House and well done to Ben Stockbridge at Erindale McDonalds and all the other proprietors of McDonald's who support this wonderful charity.
