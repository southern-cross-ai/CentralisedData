This covered the cost of hot cells, targetry and radiochemical equipment. The cyclotron was already funded and established by Austin Health/Ludwig, meaning that ANSTO's funding leveraged this underlying investment. In addition, ANSTO receives a weekly delivery of one of four radioisotopes (for research purposes) and training in solid targetry which would not otherwise be available to ANSTO staff.
