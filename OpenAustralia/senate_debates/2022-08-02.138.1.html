        Today, of course, is 2 August, and for well over a year we've had the vaccine rollout. Every day I still hear from people that have suffered injuries from the vaccine or suffer through mandates or suffer some form of discrimination. We have recently passed through about 10,000 cases of COVID in the last six months. If that's not evidence to say that the vaccines aren't effective, then I don't know what is. However, I'm not here tonight to talk about the ineffectiveness of the vaccine, which didn't stop transmission. I'm here to talk about how unsafe the vaccines are, and I want to explain why; I want to go through the biochemistry.
       </p>
       <p>
        The COVID virus has 29 proteins in it. Normally, if you gave someone a deattenuated vaccine, you would take out the ionised molecule of that virus. So, if you've got 29 molecules, you'd take out one, and the one you'd take out is the ionised molecule. An ion either has more electrons than protons or, likewise, more protons than electrons. Either way, it's a charge, and that's what they call the active ingredient in a vaccine. If you've got two magnets, one with a north pole and one with a south pole, and the magnets go past each other, they want to attach. That's why a vaccine is normally deattenuated. They take out that ionised molecule so it doesn't go around jumping on everything. But what that does is it allows the antibody to attack the antigen, end of story.
       </p>
       <p>
        The other thing is that, because that molecule is still quite large—with 28 molecules remaining in a normal deattenuated vaccine—it is too big to cross the endothelium. What is the endothelium? It is the small capillary between your muscle tissue and your bloodstream. In order to cross that capillary, you've got to be small enough, in a process called endocytosis, to cross into the bloodstream. What this particular vaccine does is it delivers a lipid nanoparticle. It is a very tiny particle, much smaller—by a factor of 1,000—than a normal virus. What that means is it can travel from the tissue, through the endothelium and into your bloodstream.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now, we know that's the way this particular vaccine works because if you go to table 4.2 in the TGA nonclinical evaluation report, you will see where they have done the distribution of the lipid nanoparticles on the lab rats—literally—when they injected this particular vaccine. I'll read out some of the body organs that it went through and the concentration increases. For a start, I want to focus on the ovaries. The concentration levels are milligrams to each gram. By the end of the first 25 minutes, it was 0.1. By the end of the first day, it was 5.25. By the end of the second day, it was 12.26. That has doubled after two days.
       </p>
       <p>
        And that's not the only organ. It went into the liver, the heart, the eyes, the brain, the bone marrow, the bladder and the adrenal glands. Just about half of the vaccine's lipid nanoparticles go into organs other than the injection site. This is despite the fact that we were told that a normal vaccine goes into your deltoid muscle and that's where it stays. Well, that's not the case with this particular vaccine. And what's particularly scary about this is that they knew this in the animal trials, and despite the fact that the concentration was still increasing after 48 hours, do you know what they did? They stopped the trial. Don't you think you would run the trial right through to the point of where the lipid nanoparticles had left the body? They didn't do that.
       </p>
       <p>
        But that's just the start of it, because once it gets inside the cell and starts creating the spike protein, that can last for days longer. But here's the thing—in the animal trials they never delivered the spike protein mRNA inside the lipid. They delivered a benign enzyme by the name of luciferase, which is the stuff you see in fireflies, and that lights up so that they could trace it. But, as the TGA nonclinical report says, they never tested the distribution and degradation of the spike protein for this particular vaccine in any humans or animals before they rolled it out.
       </p>
       <p>
        Normally, when you get the virus, it comes in through your mucosal system, and if the immunoglobulin A in your mucosal system doesn't kill the virus it'll eventually get into your systemic blood system. Your mucosal system is driven by immunoglobulin A; your systemic blood system is driven by immunoglobulin G. Once the virus gets in, in order to get inside the cell, it needs to rely on what they called the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACE" rel="nofollow">
         ACE
        </a>
        receptor—which is the angiotensin-converting enzyme—and also the transmembrane serine protease, which is another enzyme. That has to carry the virus across your cell membrane, because your membrane is there to protect the organelles inside the cell—i.e., your nucleus, your ribosome and your mitochondria in particular—from external forces. What this particular vaccine does is it makes the lipid catatonic. That means it uses transfection—it's like when you're cooking sausages on the barbecue and you see blobs of fat merge together. That's exactly what happens with transfection. There is no barrier with this particular vaccine to the lipid going into any cell. Not only does it not stop at the deltoid but it also goes all throughout the body, and it can go into any cell because of the way they designed this lipid nanoparticle.
       </p>
       <p>
        Once it's inside the cell, normally—now this is a first. Normally, when you get the vaccine, you get the antigen and it doesn't go anywhere near your cell. Once it goes into your cell, it goes into the part of your cell called the ribosome, which translates the mRNA. That ribosome will produce a protein. Normally, the spike protein on the virus is not the same as the spike protein in the vaccine. But, no, what they've done is replace the nucleotide uracil and put in a new nucleotide called methylpseudouridine. That was shown in studies, in 2005, to actually evade the immune system and have greater self-amplifying properties. In other words, it creates more proteins.
       </p>
       <p>
        Not only did they modify the mRNA that way; they added another 70 adenine nucleotides at the end of the mRNA strand. Normally, there are about 30 adenine nucleotides at the start of the mRNA strand, but they've added another 70. What does that mean? It means the spike protein lasts a lot longer inside your cell, creating a toxic substance or a toxic molecule that is ionised in an unregulated manner. What I mean by an unregulated manner is that it relies on your immune system to kick in, come in, and destroy your cells. A normal vaccine doesn't do any of that. It stays inside your deltoid muscle. It doesn't go anywhere because it's too big to travel.
       </p>
       <p>
        So what we've got now is a vaccine that has delivered a protein in an unregulated manner. That's similar to a pathway of cancer, where, basically, you get the unregulated reproduction of toxic molecules. Then it relies on your own body's immune system to attack your cells. Where you have your body attacking your own cells, you're now creating a pathway similar to acquired immune deficiency syndrome. If it goes wrong, you do not want your own body attacking your own cells.
       </p>
       <p>
        The next step after that is, effectively, a concentration. When it comes through your mucosal system, if you have a strong, healthy immune system, the immunoglobulin A in that immune system should stop it from getting into your bloodstream. When it's injected directly into your bloodstream, all you're getting is an IgG response. You are not getting an IgA response. So when they said, early on, it was going to stop transmission, that was a blatant lie. And why was it? Anyone that understands anything about immunology knows that you need and immunoglobin A response to kill the virus in your mucosal system, because if you don't kill it in the mucosal systemic you can still transmit it.
       </p>
       <p>
        The paper did show that you got in immunoglobin G response, and that lasted for up to 35 days in monkeys. But those monkeys only weighed 10 kilograms and they were given three times the dose given to humans. It was a greater dose of about 20 times. You could argue that—35 divided by 20 days—maybe, the immunoglobin G response might have lasted for two days.
       </p>
       <p>
        The other point is that, by doing it this way—the pathways they were using—they never tested this before they put it into humans. They never tested it for genotoxicity studies, despite the fact that this was the first time they ever put genes inside a body, and it's synthesised genes. They never did longitudinal testing, they never did carcinogenic testing and they never tested it for other drugs. So people who take other drugs, especially immunosuppressants—they never tested for that.
