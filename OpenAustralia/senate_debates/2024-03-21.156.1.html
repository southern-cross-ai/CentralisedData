        figures show that 518,000 net overseas migrants arrived last year and 55,375 migrants arrived in January this year alone—55,375 migrants in one month. That's 40 per cent higher than the previous January record way back in 2009. Minister, how many migrants is this government going to let in this year?

         Thank you, Senator Roberts. The first thing I'd like to say is that the Albanese government is very proud of the multicultural nature of the Australian population. I heard you earlier today in another debate, Senator Roberts, acknowledge that your own family has a fairly recent history of migration, and I think we should all recognise the very valuable contribution that migrants have played, and continue to play, in Australia. Having said that, we do acknowledge that there has been an increase in migration to Australia, particularly as a result of the pause to migration that occurred through the pandemic. The figures that have come out today are entirely expected and are consistent with the forecasts for net overseas migration that we set out in the mid-year budget review at the end of last year.
        </p>
        <p>
         Migration levels are expected to have peaked in 2022-23 and are forecast to drop in half by next year. Our government is doing the hard work not done under the former government to bring migration back to sustainable levels—after all, comparable countries also experienced a surge post the pandemic. The changes that we made late last year are having a significant and immediate impact. For example, student visa grants are down more than 35 per cent on last year's level, and I know for a fact that Minister O'Neil, Minister Clare and Minister O'Connor have been working very hard on trying to tackle some of the rorts that were left behind in the international student visa system. That is having results in terms of bringing those student visa grants down by more than 35 per cent on last year's level.
        </p>
        <p>
         The data that has been released today doesn't take into account the very substantial actions that our government has taken to bring down net overseas migration, and that's because most of those actions were implemented mid to late last year. But we recognise that this as an issue for Australians, and we're taking action to deal with it.

           With people in Queensland, including working families with real jobs, now living in tents, in caravans, in parks, in cars and under bridges, there is a human catastrophe unfolding in this country, in our state. Will you suspend further immigration until everyone who is here now has a bed to sleep in with a roof over their head?

            Thanks, Senator Roberts. I absolutely acknowledge that our country has a housing shortage. We have acknowledged that since the day that we were elected and had to deal with the massive housing shortage and housing affordability crisis that was left behind by the former government. That is exactly why we have been presenting a range of options to this parliament to deal with housing shortages, including the creation of the $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund. Senator Roberts, for someone who says that we should have more housing to deal with this, I'm surprised that you and Senator Hanson voted against the Housing Australia Future Fund. In fact, I was reminded that Senator Hanson, in the last 24 hours or so, has described the Housing Australia Future Fund as 'useless'. You continue to argue that we need more housing, just as the coalition argues for more housing, but when you have an opportunity to do something about it, what do you do? You vote no. We know that you're intending to vote no to the help to buy legislation as well, so be consistent. If you want more housing, vote for it.

               Thanks, Senator Roberts. The government is already taking action to try to deal with the increase in migration that we experienced after the pandemic and just as all other comparable nations experienced after the pandemic. That's why we've made changes to student visa grants. They are down by more than 35 per cent on last year's level—the settings that were left behind by the former government. That's why we've taken a range of other actions to fix the utterly broken migration system that was left behind by Mr Dutton, the former home affairs minister. Yet again we're fixing up the former government's mess while at the same time we're trying to build homes, even though we are obstructed every step of the way by the coalition,
