        This morning I voted with the majority of my colleagues here in support of the motion that supported Israel, and I just want to make some comments about that now. I want to say, firstly, that I strongly condemn the attack on Israel by Hamas terrorists and fully support Israel's right to self-defence. This attack on Israel is the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust. I call upon all Australians to show their support for Israel and for the Jewish people.

       <p>
        Early in the morning of 7 October, Hamas terrorists launched a horrific and unprovoked attack upon Israel, firing rockets and commencing an invasion by air, land and sea into Israeli sovereign territory. Since then, thousands of rockets have continued to target Israeli cities and regions. More than 1,400 Israelis have been murdered and innocent civilians have been taken hostage. These brutal and aggressive actions by Hamas do nothing to ensure stability in the region. Instead, their aim is to wipe the state of Israel off the face of the earth.
       </p>
       <p>
        The state of Israel deserves to have its borders respected, just like any other nation deserves that same right and respect. There can be no justification for the acts of terror that have been committed by Hamas. I strongly condemn the invasion of Israel by Hamas terrorists, and I also strongly condemn the disgraceful conduct of those at the pro-Palestinian rally at the

        Now and always, I stand with the people of Israel. In the words of former prime minister
