        My question is to the Minister for Employment, Senator Abetz, representing the Minister for Agriculture. Can the minister inform the Senate how the Australian wine industry—particularly in my home state of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        , ably represented by good people from the south-east in the gallery here today—will benefit from the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement? Can he also provide some industry views on the need for this agreement to be ratified as soon as possible?

         I thank Senator Edwards for his question and acknowledge his longstanding interest in this particular sector of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         n economy. It is astonishing that Senator Wong continues to demonise the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement knowing full well how it will positively benefit her winemaker constituents in South Australia. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
          South Australian
         </a>
         wine industry, like the nation's more broadly, has had some difficult years. In August, the South Australian Wine Industry Association convened a meeting of 40 industry leaders to discuss how the industry can return to profitability, one of the key issues being demand for their product.
        </p>
        <p>
         Before turning to South Australia, I note that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Australian" rel="nofollow">
          West Australian
         </a>
         wine industry has also been experiencing difficult times. A report in
         <i>
          The Australian
         </i>
         on Saturday featured a small winemaker in the electorate of Canning, Mr Bernie Worthington, who says:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         As far as I'm concerned, any-thing that's going to help exports into China should be welcomed. We are trying to build re-lationships with the Chinese, the market up there is just massive.
        </p>
        <p>
         Indeed, China is now our third largest wine export market. ChAFTA's elimination of the 14 to 20 per cent China tariff will be a major stimulus to wine exports. The China-Australia Free Trade Agreement should be expedited.
        </p>
        <p>
         Roger Sharp from Treasury Wine Estates, whose famous brand Penfold's originated in South Australia, says: 'The ChAFTA provides immense opportunities for Australian winemakers regardless of their size. It is imperative that it is ratified and ratified quickly.'
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Evans" rel="nofollow">
          Paul Evans
         </a>
         of the Winemakers Federation said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         We estimate delays in implementation could cost the Australian wine industry over $50 million.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is a good deal for the Australian wine industry.

            Mitchell Taylor
           </a>

            Clare Valley
           </a>
           . He says: 'The opportunities to the wine industry that ChAFTA brings are vital to compete with
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
            New Zealand
           </a>
           and Chile, who both have existing agreements. Taylors Wines seeks the urgent ratification and implementation of ChAFTA to capitalise on this growing market. China represents the No. 1 destination for quality premium Australian wine and represents huge potential to grow in the future if we can take advantage of the good work of the government in signing up a free-trade agreement with China in this important market.' Warren Randall of Seppeltsfield wines in the Barossa says: 'The ratification of the China free trade agreement is vital to the growth of the Australian wine industry. We need to jump on this opportunity.' It is a regret Labor cannot see that opportunity.
