        My question is to the Minister for Trade and Tourism, Senator Farrell. Recently, we have taken some significant and important steps in stabilising our relationship with China and removing some of the trade impediments that were hurting Australian businesses across a range of industries, including coal, timber and barley. In regions like tropical
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         North Queensland
        </a>
        , the slow return of visitors from China has held back the full recovery of the region's tourism industry. Can the minister please update the Senate on any progress towards the recovery of Chinese tourism to Australia, particularly the regions?

         and right across the sunshine state. It's been an eventful week on the trade front. As a result of the hard work by the government and industry, Australian barley growers can now re-enter the Chinese market. It's good news for, obviously, our agricultural sector, but it's equally good news for Chinese beer drinkers. But that is not all. About five minutes ago, the Chinese government announced Australia's re-inclusion on the Approved Destination Status outbound group travel scheme, known as

           This is very welcome news for our tourism industry, because it means group tours from China will soon be returning to Australia in great numbers. Based on the pre-pandemic trends, this means hundreds of thousands of additional visitors each year, who will collectively spend more than half a billion dollars each year in Australia.

           I know you don't like this good news for Queensland, Senator Canavan, but I'm going to tell you anyway. Until now, Australia had not been re-included in China's approved list of destinations for a pilot resumption of the ADS. We welcome our inclusion, and we welcome Chinese group tour visitors back to Australia, including in Queensland, where you come from, Senator Canavan.

             That is fantastic news for tourism, particularly in regional Queensland. Can the minister outline for the Senate the value of the Chinese market to Australia's visitor economy and what further recovery of visitation from China will mean for Australian tourism businesses?

              I thank Senator Green for her first supplementary question. Yes, I can give you an answer to that question. Pre-pandemic, China was Australia's largest and most valuable inbound tourism market. In 2019, Australia received nearly 1.5 million short-term visitors from China. More than a quarter of a million of them were holiday-makers who travelled to Australia on the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADS" rel="nofollow">
               ADS
              </a>
              scheme. Those ADS travellers spent more than half a billion dollars across Australia in 2019. The return of Chinese group tour travellers is particularly important in certain regions. This includes tropical

               North Queensland
              </a>
              —did you hear that, Senator Canavan?—and some of our most iconic tourism drawcards. For example, the
