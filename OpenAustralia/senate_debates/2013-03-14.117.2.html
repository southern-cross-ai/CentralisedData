        The committee recommends that the government, in consultation with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Joint Committee
        </a>

       <p class="italic">
        Not agreed. While agencies should endeavour to meet all requirements of Senate Orders, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government" rel="nofollow">
         Government
        </a>
        considers that the question whether or not an agency has complied with a Senate Order is primarily a matter for the Senate and that monitoring compliance would best be undertaken by the Department of the Senate. In addition, the need for agencies to establish systems to monitor compliance with Senate Orders throughout the year would impose an additional and unnecessary burden on agencies.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 2
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee notes that while the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARC" rel="nofollow">
         ARC
        </a>
        mentioned the strongest performing fields (under the

         Physical Sciences
        </a>
        ), it did not mention the weaker areas of research or the broad field that did not meet international benchmarks. In the future, the inclusion of the weaker performing areas would be useful as it would provide guidance for future improvements and the possible allocation of funding and/or resources.

       <p class="italic">
        Response
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The ARC accepts this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It should be noted that the recommendation refers to the results of a bibliometric study that is not conducted annually and that, therefore, this data will not be reported in every ARC annual report. The ARC will ensure that reporting on the results of any future bibliometric studies is balanced.

        The recommendation refers specifically to information published in the Australian Research Council

        2009–10 about the relative citation impact of journal articles that resulted from ARC-funded research and were published between 2001 and 2005. The broad field in which the relative citation impact was below the world benchmark was Information, Computing and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_Science" rel="nofollow">
         Communication Science
        </a>
        . It should be noted that in this field, refereed conference proceedings rather than journal articles are the predominant research outputs; therefore the data in this study does not provide a complete view of the impact of the outputs of ARC-funded research.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Among the more specific subfields of research, the relative citation impact of journal publications arising from ARC-funded research (across all schemes) was relatively the weakest in Statistics, Nanoscience and Technology, and

       <p class="italic">
        This committee recommends that Innovation table their grants as an appendix and take care to comply with the
