        It's been an honour to be part of the 45th and 46th parliaments, and I very much look forward to being a part of the 47th. I've worked with many in this and the other place who genuinely want to make a positive difference to people's lives. In fact, some are in this chamber right now. You know who you are, and I thank you for the good work that you do. This place should be all about doing good, and you all meet this in spades. Of course, there are also a good number who excel in the art of frustration and will do anything to stop the government of the day from achieving success, and there are those on both sides who particularly like to eat their own. This is such a pointless exercise that damages their reputation and their party's reputation and, of course, damages the way in which the public views us.

        To me, public hearings are the best part of this job as they often bring about change even before government formally responds to them. Unfortunately, government has many hundreds that they have not responded to during this parliament. Sitting weeks are mostly an exercise in frustrating the passage of bills at all costs. Being on the crossbench has enabled me to push for specific inquiries and projects. Some highlights are the digital platforms inquiry,

         IVF
        </a>
        clinics data disclosure,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASD" rel="nofollow">
         FASD
        </a>
        campaigns and numerous projects that will make a difference to those with cancer. I've also worked with the government on palliative care initiatives, and I'm very pleased that one key project in particular was announced in last night's budget.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are also many people I want to thank for their support and friendship over the 45th and 46th parliaments. To the good humans in this place, it's been a pleasure working with you. From my office, I sincerely thank Rachel Pace, Renee Browne, Jonathon Deans, Maria Moscaritolo, Patrizia Casbarra and Rebecca Hamon. Thank you all for being at all times loyal and professional.
