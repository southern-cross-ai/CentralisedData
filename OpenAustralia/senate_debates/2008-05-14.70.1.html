        <b>
         Purpose of the Bill
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill addresses certain urgent Budget measures.  It provides for 2008 one-off payments for older Australians and carers.  It also introduces a portability period for holders of concession cards, allowing cards to remain valid during short-term absences of the cardholders from Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Reasons for Urgency
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The one-off payments for older Australians and carers are to be made by the end of June 2008.  Because of the large customer group, payments will be staggered over the last weeks of the financial year.  In keeping with arrangements for one-off payments in previous years, customers need to be advised in late May 2008 about the 2008 one-off payments.  Passage in the week commencing 13 May 2008 would enable this established timetable to be met again this year.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The beneficial concession card measure requires a substantial system build by Centrelink.  While this will proceed in anticipation of passage, Centrelink will need to know by early to mid-May 2008 if the legislation is not likely to pass by the anticipated commencement date of 1 July 2008, or it may be too late to cancel the system changes.
