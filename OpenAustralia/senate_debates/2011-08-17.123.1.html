          </p>
          <p>
           Air Navigation and Civil Aviation Amendment (Aircraft Crew) Bill 2011
          </p>
          <p>
           The fundamental aim of this bill is to require Australian airlines and their subsidiaries to provide the same pay and conditions to overseas-based flight and cabin crew operating on their flights.
          </p>
          <p>
           Currently, Australian airlines are able to use crew who are employed either through the airline's own overseas-based subsidiary, or through third parties in a foreign country.
          </p>
          <p>
           These crew members can fly domestic legs of international tagged flights, or on international flights on Australian registered aircraft.
          </p>
          <p>
           In July this year, ABCs
           <i>
            Lateline program exposed the conditions these crew members can work under, including low pay and long hours, with little or no opportunity to bargain for better conditions.
           </i>
          </p>
          <p>
           Employed on foreign contracts, these crew members usually invariably earn much less than their Australian colleagues do, even though they are performing the same duties and are often working on the same flights.
          </p>
          <p>
           On the
           <i>
            Lateline program, Bangkok-based cabin crew who are working for Jetstar revealed that their base salary can be as little as $300 a month plus allowances.
           </i>
          </p>
          <p>
           Crew on overseas-based contracts are also not subject to the same duty limits as those on Australian contracts, which can result in their shifts being extended past what would otherwise be considered safe.
          </p>
          <p>
           The issue of crew fatigue was one that was covered extensively in the recent Senate Rural Affairs and Transport References Committee inquiry into aviation safety, which resulted in the committee handing down two recommendations on this issue.
          </p>
          <p>
           This bill consists of two parts, one to address international flights and the other to address domestic flights.
          </p>
          <p>
           In the first instance, the bill amends the Air Navigation Act 1920 to impose a new condition on international aviation licences.
          </p>
          <p>
           This condition applies to Australian airlines, and to overseas subsidiaries or associated entities of Australian airlines, as defined in the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporations_Act" rel="nofollow">
            Corporations Act
           </a>
           2001.
          </p>
          <p>
           Under this condition, Australian airlines that employ overseas-based cabin or flight crew through a third party for overseas flights must ensure that these crew receive the same wages and employment conditions that they would if they were directly employed by the company.
          </p>
          <p>
           For subsidiaries or associated entities of Australian airlines, the condition is that overseas-based flight or cabin crew who are directly employed by the subsidiary or associated entity for international flights must receive the same wages and employment conditions that they would if they were directly employed by the airline controlling the subsidiary or associated entity.
          </p>
          <p>
           These conditions apply to both new and existing licences.
          </p>
          <p>
           An international licence will not be granted if these conditions are not met.
          </p>
          <p>
           The second part of the bill amends the Civil Aviation Act 1988 to place a condition on the issuing of Air Operator's Certificates.
          </p>
          <p>
           Australian airlines will be required to ensure that crew who are not directly employed by the airline but who are involved in its everyday functioning receive the same pay and working conditions as if they were directly employed by the airline.
          </p>
          <p>
           New Zealand subsidiaries and associated entities of Australian airlines, as defined by the Corporations Act 2001, will also be required to ensure that employees are offered the same wages and conditions as if they were employed by the controlling entity. Under the bill, this will become a condition of granting a New Zealand

           as a result of the Closer Economic Agreement.
          </p>
          <p>
           This will also apply to all new and existing AOCs.
          </p>
          <p>
           This bill aims to stop Australian airlines and their subsidiaries from cutting corners and abusing the lax workplace standards in some foreign countries.
          </p>
          <p>
           I would like to acknowledge the assistance and support offered by both the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Council" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Council
           </a>

           </a>
           and the Australian and International Pilots Association.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is not acceptable that a crew member can be employed by an Australian airline, flying on an Australian plane, and be employed under workplace conditions and receive pay that we would consider unacceptable in Australia.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is time for airlines to be fair with their all employees, and to be open and transparent about their employment practices with the Australian travelling public.
          </p>
          <p>
           I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
          </p>

              President, and I thank the chamber. I just make the point that I note that there is a very short time frame on this motion for the production of documents and I recognise and appreciate that in the past the chamber has expressed a view about giving the govern­ment a reasonable time frame to deal with these matters, but in this circumstance decisions around this information will be made this weekend. I know that industry has sought this data from government. It is not something that has to be sourced broadly. It should be readily available. It is in that circumstance that I have put the time frame that I have around the motion relating to the order to produce documents. I thank the chamber for allowing me to speak.

                 We will be supporting the motion for the production of this information, but I should forewarn the Senate that we are considering a motion to also require the databank of
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forestry_Tasmania" rel="nofollow">
                  Forestry Tasmania

                 —which is protected and has been for years by the Liberals and now by the Labor Party in Tasmania not taking action—to be made available for the public determin­ation of the important matters that are inherent in Senator Colbeck's motion.
                </p>
                <p>
                 He wants information from Professor West, who has obviously and publicly been appointed to do a job, which should be based on data available from the public repository of data owned by Forestry Tasmania, but the gates on that databank are slammed shut and there is a manipulated effort by Forestry Tasmania and its leader
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Gordon" rel="nofollow">

                 to prevent the public debate from being based on information which is within those lockers. It is not good enough for him to say that the modelling coming out of that data is available in the public arena. We are astute enough to know that the modelling is only as good as the selection of data and it is the databank itself which has to be opened here.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The effort by Forestry Tasmania to manipulate the whole of the public debate through secrecy in the direction of keeping this unsustainable industry going against the public interest needs to be brought to a close, and I expect Senator Colbeck to support that opening of information to the public when the time comes as well.

                           This report outlines one of the great debacles in our Commonwealth health system for many years. This report outlines a govern­ment that has exhibited a profound mis­understanding or a profound lack of under­standing of the role and importance of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. For years the Labor Party has attempted to hold itself up as the great saviour of Australia's public health system but in February this year what the Australian people discovered was that was nothing but a sham. Just like everything else that comes out of this government when it claims to have credibility on the economy, on education or on health policy, it was nothing more than empty rhetoric. I say that because in February this year this govern­ment made a major U-turn on how medicines are subsidised for Australians. It made that major U-turn when it decided to defer, rather than consider, the listing of new medicines that had been approved by the Pharma­ceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. No obfuscation, no excuse, no amount of spin or rhetoric can actually excuse this, because it did represent a profound change. That is outlined in great detail by the overwhelming response that this committee inquiry received from patient groups, from the pharmaceutical industry and from a rare agreement between the generic pharmaceutical industry and the originator companies of the pharmaceutical industry. But, most importantly, I refer to the overwhelming response of the patient groups who outlined exactly where this government had got it wrong.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           This government came out with a number of excuses that explained why it was going to defer consideration of medicines. It did not want to say no. It thought, in typical Labor government style, that might get it into a bit of trouble but it did not want to say yes either. One of the reasons it gave, and this is outlined in the committee report, was 'there are existing or alternative treatments that are already available or there is no additional clinical benefit'. They were the words of the minister when she put out her statement in February this year stating that these medicines would not be listed, despite the fact that one of the medicines, Botox, for hyperhidrosis, had no alternative treatment available on the PBS that achieved the same outcomes. But if we put that to one side for a second, and I would like to return to that, the patients of Australia and the patient groups that represent them were outraged because this profound misunderstanding can be expressed very simply: there might be eight or 10 different
                           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACE" rel="nofollow">
                            ACE
                           </a>
                           inhibitors on the market and there might be four or five statins on the market and, on a population level when we are looking at samples of 10,000 people, the health outcomes of those may actually be the same but that does not mean they are going to work in 10,000 individuals in the same way. That does not mean that each individual patient is going to have the same response or deliver the same health outcome.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           This is at the core of the government's misunder­standing: the idea that population health assessments mean it is the same for an individual patient. What doctors do, Madam Acting
                           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy" rel="nofollow">
                            Deputy
                           </a>
                           President, is actually treat you with a different ACE inhibitor or a different statin because different people actually react in very different ways. Yet the government said, for some reason, 'Oh, there's another treatment there. It doesn't matter if we don't list this other medicine.' They were not caring at all about the fact that for individual patients this actually meant some of them were not going to get the medicine they needed. This goes to the core of one of the two principles that we have when we are listing new medicines. There is the cost-effectiveness test, as outlined by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Com­mittee and used in Australia for nearly 20 years. Quite frankly, it is a world-leading example of how to list new medicines. But we also have a cost-minimisation model that allows a company to say, 'If this medicine B is as good as medicine A for treating blood pressure'—or for treating high cholesterol—'then we can actually list that new medicine as well.' There is no cost if patients are actually substituting one medicine for another that works better. There may be an additional cost because of the point that I raised earlier, that some patients now have access to a medicine that works. These might all be in the same class of medicines and they might all be very similar but they are very different if they work for you but they do not work for someone else, particularly if you are that person for whom they do not work and now you have the chance of a better health outcome. Ithink I can speak on behalf of the entire committee about what we heard from a particularly brave young woman, Chey-Anne Ellsum from Gippsland in Victoria. I said that I wanted to return to those who suffer from hyperhidrosis. We can disagree on some of the politics of this in the sense of whether it is fair that this medicine was not listed, but I think we will all agree that it was particularly brave of this young woman to put on the record her experience. It impressed the committee and the majority of the committee found her evidence to be particularly persuasive.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           The recommendations of the majority of this committee are quite simple. It is that the government retract its statement of February this year when it implied that there had to be cost savings to list new medicines and that it recommit to the memorandum of under­standing and really consider the listing of medicines. Only in the world of the modern Labor Party is the deferral of a decision a decision. Only this Labor Party would say that a deferral of a decision constituted a decision. But we will let them live with that, because this is something that needs to be addressed.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           Finally, we have also asked that what is known as the $10 million rule be reinstated. The $10 million rule has been very unpopular with the pharmaceutical industry and many industry players. The minister for health had the capacity to list new medicines, without reference to cabinet, as long as the medicines did not cost more than $10 million in any given year. What we have in Australia increasingly now is a lot of smaller population medicines that treat very small numbers of people and that do not actually provide a huge commercial return. This rule provided those industry participants with certainty. It meant that patients with very small numbers of fellow patients suffering the same condition could get access to medicines because, once the P
                           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BA" rel="nofollow">
                            BA
                           </a>
                           C approved it, the minister had the capacity to list it. We are not saying that cabinet should not be able to consider the more expensive medications but that when the cost of a medicine is less than $10 million and the government—a government for which we can simply add up the tens of billions of dollars that have been wasted in a budget that has gone from $260 million to $350 billion in only four years and billions were wasted on pink batts and school halls—tries to tie the denial of access to new medicines to the idea of fiscal rectitude, this not only shows its profound inability to handle Commonwealth finances but also its lack of prioritisation of what really matters to the Australian people.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           I will comment briefly on a couple of comments made in the dissenting report of the
                           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
                            ALP
                           </a>
                           members of the committee. In paragraph 1.14 they claim that this has been done before when the previous government refused to list Viagra. To all those people who are suffering hyperhidrosis and to all those people who have conditions for which there is no available treatment, I urge them to hold Labor to that statement that somehow this is actually comparable to not listing Viagra. I am not trying to dismiss any particular medical condition but a decision was made at that point that we had to priori­tise the treatment of conditions. What Labor has done with this decision is prioritise the treatment of individual patients. What really matters now is whether or not you are lucky enough to have one of the medicines that is currently listed and that works.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           The government members are disingenuous in paragraph 1.15 where they say that previous
                           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBAC" rel="nofollow">

                           recommendations had not been followed. Those recommend­ations did not deny access to medicines; they were pricing decisions. Those recommend­ations did not actually mean that a patient could not get access to a medical treatment. They were simply about the administration of the PBS. It is misleading to try and compare that decision to this one. This represents, in the words of a number of the stakeholders that came before the committee, a profound change in the administration of pharmaceutical benefits in Australia.

                           I urge people who are interested in this area of policy to read the report. It is quite extensive. I would like to conclude by thanking, as always, the exceptional work of the committee secretariat. We would not be as effective in our jobs without their ongoing and tireless support.

                            Government senators have considered the majority report of the Finance and Public Administration References Committee on the administration of the Pharmaceutical Bene­fits Scheme and disagree with its findings. The evidence taken during the inquiry does not support the position that the govern­ment's decision to defer the listing of certain medicines under the

                            is a major change in government policy or will have a serious detrimental effect on the PBS, as noted by Professor Lloyd Sansom AO, Chair of the Pharmaceut­ical Benefits Advisory Committee. Before I go on to quote him, I would like to formally thank him here, in the chamber, for his services, as I understand he will be retiring from that position. Professor Sansom said:

                            The government of the day sometimes accepts recom­mendations of the Pharmaceut­ical Benefits Advisory Committee and sometimes it does not. The contention that somehow this 'constitutes a major, unnecess­ary and unwelcome change in Government policy' is not borne out. Professor Sansom said that advisory committees 'advise gov­ernments, and we have a democracy where governments make decisions'. But coalition senators continue to put the following view:
                           </p>
                           <p class="italic">
                            This profound and ill-considered change in policy puts at risk affordable access to medicines for Australians, and will have significant consequences for the pharmaceutical sector, including research and development.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            What did the industry say? Mr John Latham of Pfizer echoed these sentiments:
                           </p>
                           <p class="italic">
                            When you look at the role of the pharmaceutical industry and what we do, our role is really to innovate and work in a system that discovers and brings new medicines to market. Those medicines are there to treat diseases. For critics to say that the industry are threatening to not bring new products to Australia because we do not like the system is rubbish. We are here and our job is to discover medicines and bring them to citizens around the world.

                            Yet the coalition senators continue in their view:

                           <p class="italic">
                            Further, the committee is concerned that the independence and reputation of the PBAC will be irreversibly damaged by the referral of all listings for Cabinet consideration.

                            Companies are still actively seeking listing on the PBS, as evidenced by the fact that there has been no change in the total number of submissions received for consideration by the PBAC over the last three months. On the contrary, the July meeting of the PBAC received a record number of submissions.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            Besides, the coalition senators have ignored that the number of deferrals is very small and will not impact upon the overall operations the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The deputy secretary went on to say:

                           <p class="italic">
                            Finally, whilst eight deferrals were announced in February this year, two of these have subsequently been listed. No medicines recommended by the PBAC, at its March 2011 meeting, were deferred by the government and, by September this year, 152 new drugs or amendments to listings of existing drugs will have been listed on the PBS, reflecting the government's continued commitment to list medicines.

                            In a perfect world there would be no need for a cabinet review of the PBAC decisions, but we acknowledge that affordability of medications in the short term is definitely an issue that the government may need to consider, particularly in circumstances where the drug has an effect over a very long time horizon.

                            In 2010, 63 per cent of all first-time, cost-effective submissions were rejected by the PBAC. This is not a one-off statistic but a consistent marker of the rigour of the assessment process undertaken. It is this assessment process which I would suggest is the main decision point for companies in determining whether to bring a drug to the subsidised market in Australia.

                            This inquiry did not conclude that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme was seriously harmed. It did not conclude that industry would withdraw from the Australian market. The inquiry did not conclude that the government should not be fiscally responsible, nor should it and nor has it ever rubber stamped the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee's recommendations and it did not conclude that the memorandum of understanding with Medicines Australia had been undermined.

                             </a>
                             . This was my first engagement with the committee system. It is an invaluable way for the government, the parliament and the community to engage with issues that affect their lives. I thank the committee members for helping me through my first days and, in particular, Senator Ryan, who was very helpful with some of my questions.

                             The PBS is well regarded internationally. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is loved by Aust­ralians. It is a scheme which provides secure access to lifesaving medication for Australians and they quite rightly are very protective of it. It is a sound invest­ment in the health of Australians and it is one of the few areas of public policy that has been based on demonstrated cost effectiveness. So we need to be very protective of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             We understand the dilemma that the government is in. It is expensive and the cost of medication is increasing all the time. We know that there are competing priorities for our healthcare spending and it is prudent for the government to review the expen­diture of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. But the decision by this government to defer the listing of a number of important medications was a serious mistake and we urge the government to reconsider that decision.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             It is one of the few areas of public policy that has managed to unite the coalition, the Greens, the pharmaceutical companies, the health professionals, industry groups and consumer health groups against a decision made by a government. It was a bad decision and it has in fact undermined the integrity of what is a very rigorous process. It has shaken the faith of people in the industry, consumers and the industry itself because it relies on the fact that the industry is able to invest in medication, achieve certain benchmarks and know that when the time comes, if those benchmarks are achieved, that medication will be listed.

                             have tried to be very constructive through this process, and we think that there are other areas of action that may warrant some attention. In particular, we think that the issue of the generic industry has the potential to save the government billions of dollars. One of the critical things that needs to happen is that generic medication needs to be made available without delay when patents expire on originator medications.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             We need to make sure that there are incentives within the system to ensure that manufacturers have proper incentives to discount their drugs. We need to make sure that mandatory price reporting is not weakened and applies across all major therapeutic classes. We also need to ensure that the medical profession is prescribing medication according to guidelines that are efficient and that we are prescribing medications for the prescribed indications. We do believe it is a mistake. We know that there have been precedents for this. We know that there have been several occasions where the government has made a decision to defer the listing of a medication that has been approved by the P

                             C. However, on this occasion the circumstances are very different. We think that it is critical that the government review this decision in light of the number of submissions that were presented to this committee and we think we need to be focusing on the long-term sustainability of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme through the measures that we have described in that report. We urge the government to reconsider.

                              I rise to speak on the report of the Finance and Public Administration References Committee on the administration of the PBS which Senator Ryan justly referred to as another government debacle. The treatment of life-threatening illnesses has been compromised by the decision of the Gillard Labor government to defer listing new drugs on the PBS. A Senate inquiry heard in Canberra that there was no formal criteria for the deferral of drugs and that the government's own advisory body had no inkling of this turnaround in policy prior to the announcement by the Minister for Health and Ageing on 25 February. Patients have every right to feel cheated by this decision and the

                              had every right to feel ignored.

                              It was obvious from the evidence that there was no consultation before the Gillard cabinet made this arbitrary decision to defer the listing of eight new medicines and vaccines. The

                              even admitted that the initial decision to defer drugs was made in February 'in the context of the overall fiscal environment'. The penny-pinching Gillard government have been caught out trying to cut life-saving treatment to make its own bottom line appear healthier than it is. This is after they have squandered billions of dollars on fluffy stuff in people's ceilings and on the Building the Education Revolu­tion—you name it, they have wasted money it. Now here they are playing with people's lives—penny-pinching when it comes to life-saving drugs so they can make their own bottom line appear healthier than it is.

                              Minister Roxon thought she could win brownie points, but the inquiry rightly exposed the hot anger in the medical and pharmaceutical communities over the meddling by a group of people unqualified to make life-and-death decisions on people's treatment. How must the independent members of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee feel knowing that their expertise was ignored by Minister Roxon? Wouldn't you like to have been a fly on the wall when they had their closed-door meeting shortly thereafter when all their officials were sent out of the room? Surely this must compromise the professional integrity of the members of the committee.

                              We learnt from the inquiry that patients with conditions needing treatment with the deferred drugs had to take their chances. If they could afford to pay, they won the treatment lottery. If they could not, they missed out. The

                                     I was referring to the comments by Mr David Learmonth. In answering my question, he told the hearing that the decision to knock back the listing of Botox as a treatment for excessive sweating, as explained by a young witness, Ms Cheye-Ann Ellsum, at the Melbourne hearing:
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="italic">
                                     ... was the decision of government in the case of that particular medicine.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                     He dismissed it offhand just like that—just like Minister Roxon dismissed it offhand. This young lady needed Botox injections to treat severe sweating. Her grandparents had to pay after the treatment was refused subsidy. As she gave evidence, we thought thank goodness for her grandparents. This young woman was prepared to appear before the committee so that we could hear how these decisions taken around the cabinet table in Canberra have drastic and debilitat­ing effects on people's lives. This young witness is the face of that bad decision.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                     And there was another witness who appeared before the committee: Renee Hindson, a single mother who had a brain tumour and needed certain drugs. I wish to put on the record my admiration of both these witnesses for their courage in coming to give evidence. Frequently at these inquir­ies we have officials and companies, but we do not often see these sorts of witnesses. It was difficult but very good that these people gave evidence.
                                    </p>

                                     C's recommend­ations have been ignored by Minister Roxon and her cabinet colleagues. This is not an ideal way to formulate health policy. What is the point of having an expert advisory body if its advice is ignored? These decisions have a real impact on the quality of people's lives. The committee heard that the pharmaceutical companies felt frustrated. The deferrals go against the spirit of the memorandum of understanding between the industry and the government. The inquiry exposed the anger in the medical and pharmaceutical commun­ities over the meddling by a group of people unqualified to make life-and-death decisions on people's treatment. This is the same government responsible for billions of dollars of waste, as I said, in pink batts,

                                       All that waste, and yes, people will pay for this as a consequence of your mismanagement. Witnesses from the pharmaceutical companies said tens of thousands of patients had been affected and potentially many more would be if new drugs were not made available. Of course, federal cabinet will be making life-and-death decisions, a point succinctly and repeatedly made by so many witnesses. Companies were being discour­aged from investing in research and develop­ment because there was no certainty in the process anymore. Senator Ryan referred to the five recommendations that the committee is making. These go to overturning the decision that the Gillard cabinet made to get involved in the process. It should not have been involved.

Of course, Senator Polley, there were record numbers, because the process started—as if you were not listen­ing—years ago, and the July meeting was the end result of a process. Even you, Senator Polley, should be able to understand what was said in simple English, and that was that this was the end of a process.

                                         I have still got a minute and 51 seconds, Senator Conroy. The government should withdraw the statement it made on 25 February 2011 regarding the deferral of the listings of new medicines and the new rules applying to listing from that point forward. The government should retract the statement that the P

                                         C listing recommendations will not be proceeded with until savings are found to offset the costs of listing those medicines under the PBS. The government should explicitly state that it rejects any implications that the listing of new medi­cines requires savings to be made elsewhere in the health portfolio. The government should restate its commitment to making an explicit decision regarding the listing of new medicines on the PBS within the terms and intent of the memorandum of understanding signed with Medicines Australia on 6 May 2010 and re-signed on 28 September 2010, and it should reinstate the $10 million rule so that medicines that have a financial impact of less than $10 million in each year over the forward estimates can be listed on the PBS schedule by the minister without waiting for cabinet approval.

                                           . I take this opportunity to congratulate you on your re-election as President. I trust I will benefit from your wisdom and guidance as I learn the ropes in this place. To all new senators I extend my congratulations on your election. To the very capable parliamentary staff: I thank you for your welcome and guidance to date.

                                           I fill a vacancy created by Annette Hurley's decision not to seek another term. Annette has set a high benchmark through her dedication and work ethic. Her contribu­tion to the Labor Party has been of the highest order, and the fact that I have inherited a fully functioning office with well-trained and capable staff is testament to Annette's demonstrated capacity for always doing the right thing, ensuring a smooth transition. As a new senator I greatly appreciate the fact that Nimfa Farrell, Peter Gonis, Matthew Marozzi and Dianna Zollo have chosen to continue their service. I look forward to continuing and upholding the high standard set by Annette and wish her all the best in her future endeavours.

However, I am certain they would be very proud. However, my Aunty Doris and Aunty Mattie put a little Scottish perspective on hearing the news with stern advice along the lines of, 'Don't get a big head,' and, 'Don't get too big for your boots'—advice I intend to heed.

Our children, Caroline, Ian, Terry and Frank, are a source of immense pride and, along with Dave, Seonaid, Tammy and Sharon, hopefully the source of many more grandchildren to add to the ranks of Connor, Lachlan and Mia.

The debate ended when it was realised that the govern­ment had the executive power to commit the troops and it was then the job of the TWU, in the words of WA secretary Jim McGiveron, to make sure the troops had everything necessary to ensure their comfort and success. We must never let our democratic right to argue for or against military involve­ment obscure the fact that an elected govern­ment has the authority to commit our armed forces to places of conflict. It is my belief that we must always resource and afford our complete respect to our people who bravely take up that challenge.

                                           It is the function of first speeches to outline key interests and policy drivers. There are no surprises here. I have three priority interests—the transport industry, road safety and superannuation. I have been involved in the transport industry all my life. In my humble opinion, there is no better place to work. There is no smoke and mirrors, just plain-talking, hardworking employees and employers alike in a tough, competitive industry which works harder than most people imagine and continues to work while most people are asleep. Along the way, I have been privileged to meet some icons of the transport industry—some well known and others not so well known. They all share common attributes—that is, a capacity for hard work and a selfless dedication to the task at hand. Employers and employee representatives in the transport industry share these attributes and have generally made the industry a very efficient machine, putting the goods in the right spot, on time and in full, ensuring the society we live in functions effectively.

                                           Clearly the transport and distribution sector is a vital part of our economy, and it is facing massive growth and massive challenges. A recent study by the Victorian Transport Association indicated profitability and driver availability were the two most significant issues facing this sector of our economy. This is the age-old transport issue: how can an industry attract new skilled entrants when constrained by profitability? Combine this fact with regulatory authorities diligently working in states and territories across an industry which effectively has no boundaries and real challenges emerge.

                                          <p>
                                           The fact that only a third of the transport task is long distance does not diminish the importance of that component. Just-in-time or, more accurately, exactly-on-time delivery schedules increase the challenge. Local distribution tasks integrate with intercity and interstate operations, ensuring the necessities of life are in the nation's supermarkets and retail outlets.

                                           Concentration of power in the freight owners creates an imbalance in negotiations which often impacts on profitability, cascading down into increased pressure on operators, with negative outcomes for the industry and the broader community.

                                           Regulatory authorities are an important part of protecting our community. They need to be given the resources and the direction to actively pursue those disreputable operators not complying with the regulations and ensure a level playing field which will allow the reputable operators to gain a fair return on their investment.

                                           The industry's contribution to carbon emissions is a significant challenge. The industry is responsible for about six per cent of our carbon emissions, and this is predicted to double over the next 20 years. Major industry groups believe they can reduce 20 per cent of these emissions through reduced fuel consumption initiatives which I believe government should support. Technology in engine design may also reduce carbon emissions. However, doing nothing is not an option, as passing on the increased costs imposed will have a significant impact on inflation, affecting every household and business in the community.

                                           Professional drivers should be able to complete work without excessive fatigue, injury and death as a daily challenge. Clearly, safe systems of work are the responsibility of all participants in the transport chain. The impacts in human terms and economically of getting it wrong are enormous.

                                           Clearly the transport industry faces many challenges; however, it always has. Its entrepreneurial spirit is undiminished. Challenges will be met; transport workers and their employers will soldier on. It is unlikely that Australia will wake up one morning and find the necessities of life not in the nation's stores. However, a prudent approach would be to not take this for granted and to work towards increased stability in the sector by careful evaluation and action on the demonstrated needs of this sector. A lifetime on the road in my working life and capacity as a TWU official has made me aware of the ever-present dangers that each Australian faces every day when they drive their vehicle. I have a real passion for road safety. Our country's prosperity is reflected in our love affair with the motor vehicle. The freedom and mobility achieved by owning a car are tempered with the sickening human and economic cost of vehicle accidents. The various authorities charged with third-party insurance provision understand that death is relatively cheap when compared with the costs associated with serious and catastrophic injuries. The attendant economic costs are enormous, estimated to be $27 billion to the Australian economy. I have always believed that we should adopt the Swedish model of

                                           We are human and we make mistakes. Our bodies are subject to biomechanical tolerance limits and simply not designed to travel at high speed. Yet we do so anyway. An effective road safety system must always take human fallibility into account.

                                           I am glad this Labor government is doing exactly that in the recently announced National Road Safety Strategy 2011-2020. There is no city or town across our nation that will not benefit from this fundamental shift in our approach to road safety.

                                           Enormous effort is currently dedicated by all stakeholders in the provision of road safety. Many outcomes are heading in the right direction: improved roads, improved vehicle design, smart systems for avoiding crashes, rigorous enforcement and tremend­ous improvements in recovery and treatment at intensive care facilities of crash victims all play their part. However, I am certain that those dedicated people responsible for road trauma would prefer not to await with dread the next accident victims on any long weekend in Australia. Is it acceptable that our police, paramedics and firefighters are simply putting a body into a bag or cleaning up the blood left on our streets? Surely it would benefit all if they did not have to do such tasks. Sweden does it better with 4.3 deaths per 100,000. Australia, despite our geographical differences, can improve its 5.78 annual deaths per 100,000. Saving 1,291 lives and reducing 32,000 injuries across Australia is a challenge we should accept.

                                           Finally, the toll amongst our youngest drivers is most severe. When our least experienced drivers make up far too signifi­cant a percentage of deaths and injuries then we are duty bound to advocate for change and integrate the failing human in design. It must be accepted that a great proportion of young drivers do not offend. It is the risk takers, the bulletproof few, that make up this disproportionate and dreadful statistic. The importation of vehicles into Australia with much lower safety features than Australian made cars, or the great majority of imported models, is a serious concern. These vehicles marketed on price alone will have a negative effect on any improvements in deaths and serious injury if they become popular amongst our most vulnerable road users.

                                           As a TWU official with a long involve­ment in the improvements of workers' rights, I believe government must act in the interest of workers in retirement. Superannuation has been one of the great learning curves of my career. Along the way I have been privileged to work with many fine people. The TWU super fund and its board of industry representatives is a great organi­sation ably led by chairman David Galbally

                                           Bill McMillin. I am honoured by the presence of Bill McMillin and director Peter Garske here tonight. The challenges facing industry funds are numerous. I am grateful that the Labor government is introducing significant reforms such as MySuper and is moving to increase the superannuation guarantee contribution to 12 per cent. Low fees and no commissions are critical drivers of increasing member accounts. Members' interest in super accounts generally equates with increased balances, and often education is least evident at the most important times. Lack of education or even interest at the most important time—that is, when you are young—is commonplace. In order to take advantage of what Einstein referred to as the eighth wonder of the world, compound interest, young people need to be educated, preferably at school.
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                           Our national superannuation savings pool of $1.36 trillion is the envy of the developed world. The fact that the Howard government dropped the ball and failed to deliver on improved legislated contributions was an important opportunity lost. The changing demographics of our nation and the fact that we are living longer and therefore need to fund a longer period of retirement present some real challenges. Increased migration boosting the workforce is one solution. Our children accepting a greater tax burden for the costs of providing for longer retirement is another. However, I believe we should educate and ensure people have the skills and the contributions necessary to fund a good retirement outcome, whilst ensuring the age pension remains as a vital safety net.
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                           Members will always demand value for money, and it is my belief that this is best achieved by the industry fund not-for-profit model, with all profits back to member accounts. Trustee directors representing employer and employees and only acting in the best interest of members are a world-class model. The Australian superannuation industry has a remarkable record in achieving rationalisation of funds. Clearly the appropriate and prudent regulation of long-term investments on behalf of members needs to be stringent and the cost of complying has driven rationalisation. Various studies have shown that many funds have achieved brand status, with loyalty driven by industry participation and trust in the board representatives. The optimum number of funds and the optimum size should be left to the members, who will vote with their account should a fund lapse in standards. Enforcement of employer obligations is an industry concern. Whether it is an employer simply not honouring its obligations or going broke is an increasing concern. Little seems to be done to pursue those not meeting a legal obligation, and in my view this inequity needs to be addressed. For the nation to continue to build long-term national savings in a world awash with debt is too great an opportunity to be missed. All efforts should be made to increase our long-term savings, as clearly the power in the world rests with the lender not the borrower.

                                          <p>
                                           The main threat to super is the increasing level of uncertainty in members' minds in respect of share markets. Their interest increases with account balances and mem­bers make decisions, usually conservative decisions, which comfort them in uncertain times. However, this may not be in the best interests of their future retirement outcomes. After owning their home, superannuation is possibly the next biggest investment of workers. An increasing aversion to volatility could open up opportunity to invest in simple and clear products, providing capital for infrastructure. The things you drive on, work in or fly out of—you can see them and they cannot disappear in a global financial meltdown. They generally behave in a predictable way and should deliver a higher return than cash. An education campaign to increase members' awareness and under­standing may see growth in allocation to infrastructure as an investment for the long term. Simply switching between a balanced option, a growth option or a cash option as a result of the daily news is unlikely to secure the long-term result required for enough retirement income.

                                             I am conscious that I owe my presence here today to many people and I offer them my thanks for their generosity and commitment. They were Greens party members and supporters, and friends from my community. They volunteered thousands of hours to elect a second Greens senator for South Australia in the faith and hope that the greening of the Australian parliament will be a good thing for Australia and for the future. As well, over 100,000

                                             There are a growing number of Australians who believe that we need to do things differently if we are to meet the challenges that this century brings us. They see the Greens as offering a courageous and creative vision for achieving this. I wish to thank my Greens colleagues in this parlia­ment and throughout Australia for their support and welcome. There are now many of us working to bring our values to the parliaments of Australia. I would particularly like to thank my colleague Senator Sarah Hanson-Young for her help and encourage­ment throughout the election campaign and since.

                                             I made my home in South Australia 20 years ago with my husband, Mark. We came for his work and the family-friendly scale of Adelaide. It has turned out to be a wonderful place to raise our three children, Felix, Eleanor and Mungo, in the foothills of Adelaide, amidst a strong, caring community where people look out for each other. I thank my kids and Mark for their unwavering support and love for me. The feeling is absolutely mutual. They are my rocks.

                                             I was lucky to be born into a big, rambunctious family, No. 6 of seven children—and anyone who comes from a large family knows how important your number is! So I was introduced to politics at an early age. There was a span of 19 years between my eldest brother, Neil, and my youngest sister, Felicity—and Pam, Prue, Gavin and Ian were in between. Being one of the youngest, I grew up hearing passionate discussions around the dinner table, and my older siblings brought the world of ideas and current affairs into our home. In the 1970s, that included the

I am curious and passionately interested in the rich variety of cultures and viewpoints in Australia, and yet I also believe that the things we have in common are vastly greater than our differences. Being part of a big family means that I feel connected to many parts of Australia. I was an auntie at six and a great-aunt at 30, and I have many beloved nieces and nephews across the nation. Some of them are here to help me celebrate today.

I attended government schools, and I am grateful to many dedicated teachers who challenged me and encouraged me to learn and excel. There was one in particular who introduced her year 9 English class to debating and public speaking and probably had little idea what a monster she was creating!

                                             Universal quality public education is crucial for a fair and thriving society, and I have witnessed the increasing sectarianism of schooling and the exodus of parents from the public system with regret. To change this trend, government schools must be properly funded and valued. In an increasingly divided community, where people's destinies are often determined by their postcodes, quality public education can be a unifying force. It fosters connection and under­standing by bringing together children who would otherwise always move in different orbits. For many children, it is the lifeline that will help them achieve their potential. I believe we are all impoverished when our public schools are starved of adequate funds. A fragmented society of have-lots and have-littles is not healthy for any of us, however privileged we are. In this parliament, I will work to promote and strengthen public education.

                                             At Melbourne university I studied law and arts, and my course was set when I met Mark in a crowded lecture after I had been to an early but well-lubricated breakfast of calamari and claret. Since then, we have spent our life together, much of it on bikes, sharing many joint projects to make the world a better place. It has been a great journey. As a lawyer, I have mainly worked in the 'little' end of town, with people who find life challenging, including tenants, people on low incomes and people who live with mental illness. I have also taught public health and environmental law.

It was not just the beauty of the site or the spurious case for the proposed dam that drove me to take this step; it was also the cynical decision by the Tasmanian Premier to stop a peaceful protest by making it a crime to trespass on what had been public land. Down at the Franklin, I saw the strength that comes from people standing together for a shared belief in what is right. Each time I return to Strahan and see the beauty of the Gordon and Franklin rivers, which now draws people from all over the world, I am reminded of how right that action was and that we can all make a difference.

                                             This century brings some huge challenges. At one time, the earth seemed so vast it was inconceivable that we could ever reach its limits. But it is now clear that our planet is finite and that we are living beyond our means. Population growth from one billion to seven billion over 200 years, coupled with massive industrialisation, has led to overuse of the earth's resources and pollution. Those of us who read the science and will not turn away from the evidence, however tempting it is to do that at times, have been aware of the signs for years. We face increasing water scarcity, more extinctions happening now than in the last 65 million years, collapsing fish stocks and peak oil. These are all symptoms of a crisis that will not go away just because we ignore it.

                                            <p>
                                             Too often, governments do not respond to these signs and proceed as if the environment were some kind of optional extra which we can choose to factor in or negotiate away. Conventional economic theory reinforces this view. It was developed at a time when the environment was thought to be limitless, so it does not properly account for the real environmental costs of any particular activity. Because of this, we often have no indication of the threats to the very things that we rely on for life—clean air, clean water and the means of growing food—until they become so scarce that it is almost too late. The current fierce controversy over coal seam gas mining is a case in point. It threatens long-term food production and aquifers on some of the most productive farmland in Australia. We must not proceed full steam ahead without fully understanding what is at stake. In the 21st century there is a risk that we will see the

                                             We cannot negotiate with the environment when it comes to the Murray-Darling Basin either. It is agreed that the problems in the basin stem from decades of poor short-term decision making. Scientists predict that there will be 90 per cent less rainfall by the end of the century due to climate change. The science from the Wentworth group has been carefully developed and peer reviewed, and it tells us that 4,000 gigalitres is the minimum amount of water to be returned to the river for a healthy river system. If we do not heed the science, the Murray will die from the mouth up— first in South Australia but ultimately affecting every community along its length. Of course, we must help the communities in the basin to adapt to changed conditions—we must share that responsibility—but this is not a contest between the environment and people. The environmental constraints are not negotiable. If we end up with another politically driven short-term decision, the Murray's fate will be sealed. Here, as elsewhere, the science must prevail over the politics.

                                             It takes courage to face up to these environmental challenges squarely without flinching, and it takes integrity to communicate them to an electorate that is not always willing to hear about them. Many people are understandably confused or fearful, especially at a time when simplistic slogans and frightening hyperbole are often substitutes for reasoned debate. But members of this parliament have no excuse for ignorance; we have access to the best information and advice available. We have been entrusted to be here. We have a duty to inform ourselves properly and then to make the best decisions in the long-term national interest on behalf of the people who voted us in. To me, that is the definition of leadership.

                                             When it comes to climate change, we Australians are the highest carbon polluters per head on the planet. We often hear calls for responsibility over rights, so it is shameful that some political and business leaders are urging that we should shirk our fair share and dig our heels in until we are forced to act. This is especially so when our Pacific neighbours like Kiribati and Tuvalu face inundation. If we are unable to treat asylum seekers humanely, even at this point, how will we cope with the many climate refugees who will inevitably be forced to flee their homeland in the future? We have a moral duty to take responsibility for our role in their predicament.

                                             Morality aside, it is only a matter of time before industries and nations must become low carbon. Australia can choose to meet this challenge by steadily moving away from fossil fuels and our traditional 'dig it up and sell it' culture to a cleaner economy based on renewable energy, energy efficiency, smart technology and innovation or we can refuse to change as urged by some and end up like

But General Motors functioned in a fool's paradise protected by low oil prices in the US. They kept making cars the same old way until the height of the global financial crisis, and it was only then that they were saved from bankruptcy by a bailout of taxpayers' money reportedly to the tune of $49 billion.

                                             We now have a clean energy strategy for Australia, including a price on carbon. This will be a vital sign to the market that the cost of carbon pollution can no longer be ignored. I am immensely proud of the role the Greens have played in ensuring that climate change has been squarely on the agenda in this term of parliament. This is a commitment we made before the election and it is one we have honoured.

                                             I want to see an inclusive Australia, where all people can participate fully and achieve their best. Most Australians like to think that we are an egalitarian nation, and I think it says something good about the national psyche that this is important to us. Sadly, though, on any clear-eyed view there is a growing gulf between those who are doing well and those who are not. In Australia today, an unemployed person with rent assistance gets $295 a week. At the same time, the average

In Australia today, we lock up people, including children, who come here fleeing war and torture. The asylum they seek was a responsibility we took on in 1951 when we signed the

The legal term for this is excision. It sounds innocuous enough but it actually means notionally cutting away swathes of our territory. As a lawyer, I have been ashamed to see the legal contortions we have engaged in to avoid our international obligations. How have these things come to pass in the land of the 'fair go'? And why is it 'extreme' to name them and seek to change them? One way of promoting fairness is to keep our most important institutions in public hands so that they are available to everyone, irrespective of their income or status. Services such as good quality public transport, housing, health and education allow everyone to share the benefits of living in a community and having their basic needs met. In this parliament I will fight for those services.

                                             At this point I should also mention public broadcasting. I fought passionately to save the ABC from funding cuts and attacks during the Howard years. While it is not necessarily essential for physical survival, I believe that an independent, quality public broadcaster—free from commercial influ­ence—is essential for the survival of our own quintessentially Australian culture and to provide the information which is the currency of democracy. I watch with concern as many of the qualities of the ABC we fought for in the 1990s are now under threat by decisions that are being made in 2011.

                                             When I stand here to make my last speech I would like to think that I have contributed to making Australia a kinder, fairer place. If we practise kindness and fairness I believe that we can meet the challenges this century brings. If we act fairly we will balance Australia's interests with those of other nations, we will balance the interests of our species with the needs of other species—and by doing that we will actually enhance our own chance of survival—and we will balance the needs of today with the needs of tomorrow. That is what the Greens stand for. In all my decisions I am guided by the idea that we do not just inherit the earth from our ancestors; we borrow it from our children. I hope they will look kindly on the decisions we make in this parliament.

                                                   Needless to say, there is significant concern in agricultural sectors, particularly the apple and pear growing sectors, about the import of apples—especially given that, even though this process included the opportunity for industry to comment on the revised draft import risk assessment released by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry some time ago, the sum effect of that was that nothing the industry said had any impact on the decision. While there is a perception that industry has had the opportunity to have some input into and a say in this process, the net impact is that the government has effectively gone with the draft import risk assessment that was released by the government two or three months ago. Effectively the government has gone with the decision of the Prime Minister when she made a statement to the New Zealand parliament while she was there, I think in April, that we would of course accept the

                                                   There is sincere and significant concern here in Australia that we will end up with fire blight. The

                                                   say they do not worry about fire blight anymore; they have learned to live with it. Of course they have—they have had it since the 1920s or so, so of course they have learned to manage it. We are one of the few places that does not have fire blight, and we do not have the expense of dealing with it. Industry is understandably more than concerned about this decision, and particularly the pear growing sector. One of the reasons New Zealand does not have a pear industry is that they have fire blight, and fire blight is completely and utterly devastating for the pear industry. If anyone has seen a photograph of the impact of fire blight on a pear tree, they will know that growers effectively forget about growing pears. That is what has happened in New Zealand. I have had correspondence from someone in New Zealand saying: 'Why worry about our apples? I am enjoying one of your pears.' Of course he was enjoying one of Australia's pears—because of fire blight you cannot get a pear commercially in New Zealand.

                                                   All through this process there has been a withholding of information. Industry tried and tried to get access to

They were told that it was commercial-in-confidence and it was not until the opposition demanded in this chamber that those documents be released that they were finally released. When they were released, we discovered that they were largely as prepared in the import risk assessment. All the government had to do was tell the industry that this was a reproduction of what was in the integrated fruit management plan and the industry would have understood that. But, no, the government would not put that on the table. They said sorry, you cannot have it, it is commercial-in-confidence. So of course this huge level of distrust has developed between industry and the government over this process. How could the industry not be furious about this decision and be complaining bitterly about the result it has had?

                                                   The industry through the consultation process actually put some very sensible propositions to the government. They asked that no apples be imported into Australia from orchards affected by fire blight. The New Zealand integrated fruit management system identifies those orchards, because the orchards are treated; they are sprayed. It is very easy to identify orchards with fire blight. My understanding is that only about 10 per cent of New Zealand orchards have an incidence of fire blight on an annual basis, so let us just rule them out. That lowers the risk and mitigates some of the issues. We are going to have just a simple quality assurance program. What we are being asked to accept here in Australia for the defence of our disease-free status is a quality assurance system.

                                                   One of the other questions the industry has is where is the verification system? Where is there a strong process of verification? My understanding is that the shadow minister put to the minister last week a request that we have a completed

                                                   process, a full verification process, before the fruit is shipped. I would have thought that was a simple process that did not step outside the bounds of what is reasonable. Let us have verification that all the things that are supposed to be done are done before the fruit is shipped. Then we can have a level of confidence that there is proper verification down the supply chain, and particularly through the packing process and the inspection process. Even that has been ignored.

                                                   Given the science we have had put in front of us that fire blight loses its viability over time, it would have been quite reasonable to impose a short withholding period. My understanding is that fire blight does not seem to be an issue anymore for New Zealand apples going to Japan because there is a two-month withholding period for other pests and diseases and over that time the fire blight bacterium decays and becomes no longer viable. Why not put something simple like that in place to mitigate the issues that might impact on the industry here? But, no, the government has not accepted anything the industry has said and the industry is justifiably concerned. Apple and Pear Australia Ltd said today:
                                                  </p>

                                                   The measures adopted in the final policy and determination for the importation of New Zealand apples are horrendously weak and we are extremely concerned that the three pests recognised as major risks to our biosecurity won't be controlled to the degree the industry requires.

There was an outbreak of one of the diseases in Taiwan that the biosecurity system was supposed to cover. This goes back to the issue of the withholding period. There was a breakdown in the New Zealand system which allowed a disease to get into Taiwan. The response from the

I believe we are therefore in a situation where our industry has been exposed to the potential for fire blight. We know what it will do to the pear industry and we know that it will have an impact on our apple industry. It is extremely disappointing that we have gone down that track today where the minister has effectively refused to listen to anything industry has said.

                                                    I rise to take note of the ministerial statement tabled in relation to the import of New Zealand apples, in particular the risk of fire blight. This parliament has considered this issue for many years. It has been before rural and regional committees many times and we have spoken to people in the department very often on this subject. The fact of the matter is that several years ago officials before our committee accepted that fire blight would come to Australia. That was accepted—it will come here. Let us not pretend that we are having any discussion other than an acceptance of the fact that, whatever quality assurance processes are put in place, the reality is that one way or another fire blight will come to Australia.

                                                    The question then becomes: will it spread? That is the point over which there was considerable contention and discussion. My view is, if you import a disease of this kind, it is inevitable that it will spread. The officials, however, have argued that that will not be the case. Frankly, I cannot and do not accept that. We know this is a devastating disease to the apple and pear industry and we know that when you have it, it fundamentally changes things. It is not just the occasional tree that you might be able to excise; it means wipe out, gone, finish. You can lose virtually the entire orchard or the entire district that might have been dedicated to apple and pear growing. So we know what the consequences will be.

                                                    Australians must be asking themselves today: how is it that a nation with disease-free status, with an industry which trades on its disease-free status, would allow these products into Australia and risk that disease-free status? Why would Australia do it? Why would we go down this track? The answer is because of the

The result has been that several countries have abandoned the world trade system. They have recognised that it does not matter how much money you have; if you have money but countries decide to withhold food, not to sell it, then you cannot buy it on the global market. That is why countries like China,

We will trade when it suits us but more particularly we are going to outsource our food production so that when there is a global food crisis we can just grow for ourselves at our outsourced land and water and bring that food back to the domestic market and completely ignore the trade rules.' That is why China has gone out, why the Saudis have gone out and why Qatar has gone out. They are buying up hundreds of thousands of hectares across the planet and the water rights to go with them. In the case of the Pakistanis, not only have they sold the land and water but they have sold a security force which goes with it because they recognise that at the time these food shortages really start to bite there will be hungry people outside the fences who want that food. So those countries will want to make sure that they can get that food out and back to their own countries, where they need it to be.

How do you main­tain secure supplies of food in a global market and in an age of climate change in which outsourcing of food production is now becoming a fairly common thing for some of those countries?

                                                    People who are trying to protect Australia's disease-free status are auto­matically accused of trying to bring in protectionism. Minister Emerson is out there arguing, in every second speech he gives, that anyone who stands up and says that we need to protect our disease-free status and go strictly with science to get that disease-free status right is a protectionist and is using quarantine for protection—trying to protect Australian growers against competition. The reality here is that we have disease-free status and that is incredibly valuable. As a Tasmanian, I am more than aware of the significance of our environment in ensuring there is a significant premium, because we are disease free, for Tasmanian product going into all sorts of markets.

                                                    Australia is disease free. There are many countries who would, quite frankly, be very pleased if Australia got fire blight, because that would level up the playing field. Everyone would be very happy with that outcome, except the growers in Australia. You would say, 'This makes no sense; we do not want these apples from New Zealand.' The point is that Australia did say that we did not want the apples, but New Zealand took us to the WTO. We lost in the WTO. The appeal has been through, but we lost that as well. The situation is that, because of our commitment to WTO rules, Australia would, if it persisted in keeping the New Zealand apples out, run the risk of New Zealand taking retaliatory action against us big time. They could take retaliatory action against any other products—and Australia trades massively with New Zealand.

That is a very interesting turn of events. It would make global news because it would mean that the coalition had abandoned the notion of the free trade system and was giving the parliament the ability to dismantle free trade agreements and any parts thereof. That is an interesting thing that shadow minister Cobb is talking about doing. It would certainly shake up the whole WTO process and where Australia sits in it.

                                                    From the Greens' point of view, it is essential that we not only maintain our disease-free status and use the best science we have to defend our disease-free status but also recognise that, as long as we have a slavish adherence to the WTO rules, we are always going to be in this situation and we are always going to be fighting. The reason is that the basis on which we export is 'negligible risk'. It is not 'no risk'; it is 'negligible risk'. We say we send our product overseas on the basis it is negligible risk and, as a result, the

                                                    The discussion we should be having in this parliament is about how we are going to respond to the changed global trade environment in an age of food security and insecurity. How are we going to produce enough food for our own people and meet our moral obligation to supply as much food as we possibly can into a global scenario where people are going to be desperate for food? That is the reality of where we are going on this planet and that is the conver­sation we need to be having. It needs to be a much bigger conversation than just this.

I ask the government: what are you going to do when, inevitably, fire blight gets to Australia? And who is going to be liable? Who is going to pay and compensate the farmers concerned when fire blight devastat­es orchards? I cannot believe we will be in a scenario where that is not going to happen.

What this is really all about is the government saying, 'Let's find a political way to get these apples in,' instead of, as we used to say, a scientific way to keep them out. This is a complete forfeiture of the rights of Australian apple growers. As everyone has pointed out, the import risk analysis, or

It is a lowering-of-the-bar exercise which is going across all trade around the world to make it simpler to bring back to the pack people who, like us, have a trading advantage through being clean, green and free. It is exactly the same as the BSE argument and we had to do a lot of work to stop that. This is the same principle. With the BSE and the beef, the Canadian government eventually came back and we said, 'What about an IRA?' and they said, 'We do not have the resources to comply with that.'

                                                     Fire blight in New Zealand is not a reportable disease because it is endemic. What they do is go around saying, 'Oh, God, blimey, it is too high; I won't prune that one.' The evidence is that we are going to have apples coming into Australia from trees which have fire blight. They have accepted that because, they say, it is not going to get out into our orchards. The original IRA said we would have to have buffer zones and so on. Under the science, there is an acceptance that we are going to bring fire blight in but that it is not going to do us any harm—it is going to be under a code of farm manage­ment practices. I note that there is no-one here from the Labor Party to respond, probably because they are all ashamed that a political imperative has taken over the right to keep our industry clean, green and free. They are saying, 'Oh, well, our farm manage­ment practices will sort this out.' They would not show us their farm management pract­ices. They would not let us go to an apple orchard. I know as a farmer that every farmer has a different farm management practice, so that is just jiggery-pokery political garbage.

Who is going to get the sack or a smack in the ear if we do what the import risk analysis says and import fire blight? How can it be and what game is being played that an official can fly into Australia one night and fly out the next night after having had a walk through the Botanic Gardens in Melbourne—which I walked through the other day just to get the feel of the place—found an obscure plant in a whole heap of other plants and said that it had fire blight? What sort of game are we being played here? They are trying to play us on a break. It is a disgrace.

The government must understand that the one trade advantage we have in Australia is our clean, green and free status. As for the free trade agreements, which we enacted with the United States when the dollar was 67c, we now have a 40 per cent tariff against us through the currency, having got rid of the tariffs. Thank you very much.

This is without doubt one of the worst decisions that this government has made, and that is a big call. I say it with despair because the implication of this decision is to put the entire apple and pear industry in this nation at risk. It is a case where the decision has been made on very poor premises, where the goalposts have been shifted, and where

What next for our potato industry? What next for our horticulture industry? We know what happened with myrtle rust, which has devastated and damaged the nursery industry across the country. Once fire blight is in this country, that is it; you cannot eradicate it. We have a situation in the

                                                      , the whole issue of how to contain fire blight was raised. It seems that the only way you can contain fire blight is to use streptomycin, an antibiotic, the use of which is banned in this country. It is an antibiotic that Professor Peter Collignon, Professor of Medicine at the

There are huge public health implications in relation to that. My understanding is that the government's response is that there will be, as a result of this decision, contingency plans to allow the use of streptomycin here in Australia. If that is the case, that is very disturbing.

                                                      Basically the government is saying that this will happen. It is conceding defeat. We will put up the white flag of surrender. We are abandoning our farmers. I would urge the government that it is not too late to reconsider this. The so-called safeguards in place will not provide the bulwark that we need to prevent the introduction of fire blight. It is not a case of if; it is a case of when we get fire blight in this country. When we do, the only way to contain it is through the use of streptomycin, an antibiotic, a chemical that is banned for use in this country today. But that will have to change as a result of this decision.

If it has done so it has huge public health implications. I would urge the government to reconsider its position. This is a disaster that is just waiting to happen.

                                                        Labor government was carried, obviously with the full support of our Labor colleagues here in the Senate as well as the crossbenchers and all of my then South Australian Senate colleagues who co-sponsored this motion on my behalf.

                                                        This resolution highlighted the more than $1 million being stripped out of country hospital services in South Australia, particularly the Keith, Moonta and Ardrossan country hospitals. The federal minister wants to highlight a few things in his response, which has just been tabled in the Senate. I find the things he has chosen to highlight remarkable. Firstly, he highlights the fact that the federal government provides support for these hospitals through a range of existing things, such as 'through its funding contribution to private health insurance'. Guess what? Not only is the state Labor government stripping money out of these hospitals, but the federal Labor government and this minister want to strip funding through private health insurance out of these country hospitals. So we have strike one there.
                                                       </p>
                                                       <p>
                                                        Then the federal minister highlights the fact that the federal government has provided funding in the past to these hospitals through various infrastructure programs. Infrastruct­ure is wonderful. It is lovely to build a new ward for a hospital or provide some new facilities for the hospital. It is just not of much use if there is not the recurrent funding to keep operating the hospital—if they do not have the beds, the doctors and the nurses with which to actually service the patients. It is wonderful to have the bricks and mortar and the facilities, but the funding is being taken away.

I hope they succeed in managing to keep their doors open but, if they do, it will not be through the help of this federal Labor government and certainly not through the help of the hapless South Australian Labor government, which is stripping $1 million plus out of these country hospitals. Indeed, it is a hapless South Australian state Labor government at present. It is a government embarking on the long, long goodbye—

What do we have: one premier, two premiers, three premiers, no premiers? It is so hard to tell. Senator Farrell sent his deputy executioners there, and the deputy executioners pulled the lever and the trapdoors opened but the rope was not long enough. They pulled the levers and the trapdoor opened but Mike Rann is still dangling there. It did not snap the neck. He is still alive, he is still kicking, he is still screaming. He is determined to go out causing as much pain as is feelingly possible.

Political parties do get themselves in a tangle from time to time over leadership transitions and it is not pretty. However, when you are the government of the day and you leave your party leadership hanging in the balance, not just for days or weeks but for months, it has an impact on the state as well. I care about this because the people of the state of

Senator Gallacher praised one of those deputy execu­tioners, Peter Malinauskas, Senator Farrell's replacement as head of the great and power­ful shop assistants union. Senator Gallacher described Mr Malinauskas as a wise head on young shoulders. You have to wonder why this wise head on young shoulders thought it was a good idea for a 30-year-old union official, head of the shop assistants union, to be the one to boldly walk into the Premier's office and say, 'Your time is up.' Do not have the parliamentary colleagues do it but leave it to the trade union leader to be the one to hand out the execution warrant—and of course mess up the execution as they have.

We have Mike Rann claiming he is going to stay on a little longer to see some key projects through. At the top of that list he highlights the contract­ual negotiations with

We are sending in a lame duck leader who knows he is on the way out and who every­body else knows is on the way out. Senator Feeney is smirking. You are a student of American politics.

Nobody wants to deal with them. Everybody knows they can manage to screw them over if they want to and, in the end, that is what is going to happen. That is the risk to South Australia with Mike Rann charging on on these negotiations. Mike Rann has said he wants to 'mentor'

Of course, he put this statement out from India, and Jay Weatherill kept ringing Mike Rann when he was in India to talk about it. And guess what? The phone was never answered. You can picture it now. Mike Rann picks his phone up to get his voicemail messages, and when he gets message one—'Mike, it's Jay; we need to talk about these issues; could you give me a buzz back'—there is a beep and the message is deleted. Next message: 'Mike, it's Jay. It's really, really important. Please give me a call back.' Beep. Delete that message. Next message: 'Mike, it's Jay. I'm really sorry about the way things are between us, but if you could give me a call I'm sure we can work them out.'

Then, when he does come back and attends the briefings with BHP Billiton, guess what? He forgets to invite Jay Weatherill. So much for the mentoring. The mentoring is all about being left in the dark. The mentoring is all about being left behind. Mike Rann forgot to invite him to the briefings on BHP Billiton. Even today, we have the right-wing factions—one of their two alternative leaders—out there announcing new policy. Jay Weatherill has not come up with a new policy since he was anointed as Premier, but one of the right's two alternative leaders comes out and starts to announce new policy on urban develop­ment—getting ahead, of course. Why? Because he is not happy with the deal that is done.

                                                           by leave—I wish to speak briefly to correct a statement I made in relation to my contribution on the decision of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry in relation to the apple and pear industry. In my contribution in relation to the decision made by the minister with respect to the import­ation of New Zealand apples, I asserted that streptomycin is banned for use in Australia. I have been advised by the minister—and I accept his advice—that that is not the case. I understand that in relation to the use of streptomycin on crops in Australia, approval can be sought from the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority. How­ever, it is currently not being used on apples in Australia, because there is no need to use it on apples in Australia. So I wish to correct that, but I maintain my comments about the use of streptomycin in our food chain and the comments and concerns of Professor Peter Collignon in relation to the use of streptomycin.

                                                            The government has a longstanding practice of  not dealing with complex foreign policy matters through Senate resolutions and therefore did not support the motion as it was moved by Senator Abetz. The government proposed simpler lang­uage and was disappointed that Senator Abetz chose political point scoring rather than making a strong bipartisan statement in support of Israel.

The evening before, Mr Rudd's office implored the coalition to take the references to Labor's support for BDS out of the motion. The next morning, Mr Rudd's office said Labor would support the full motion. However, just prior to the debate, Mr Rudd's office said they would not support it and would say that it was a complex foreign policy matter. In the House of Representatives Labor also voted to move sections of a similar motion condemning Greens and Labor Marrickville councillors who supported the BDS campaign. The truth is that Mr Rudd wilts when it comes to opposing those in his own party and in the union movement who support this vile BDS campaign. We see a similar double standard from the

                                                            We now see Mr Rudd recommending to the Prime Minister that Australia abstain from the UN vote to recognise a Palestinian state. It is time Mr Rudd put principle ahead of politics. In his, if I might say, quite disrespectful letter to the Senate in response to the motion, he fails to refer to the detail of the Senate's resolution and to the fact that all Labor senators shamefully voted against the motion. Labor and the minister stand con­demned for their vote in this place and for the minister's response, which does not take the strong principled stance that I think the Australian people would want—that is, a strong stance against the boycott, divestment and sanctions campaign against Israel, which has now shown itself with a demonstration outside a coffee shop because it is owned by Jewish interests. That this has come to pass in this country is unfortunately a result of the failure to strongly oppose the BDS camp­aign. People now think that they can demon­strate outside Jewish businesses in Australia to try to stop customers from going into the shop and doing business. I must say that it has hallmarks of events in the last century that I thought had been well and truly left behind.

                                                             In November 2010 the Senate agreed to an order that there be laid on the table no later than 31 May 2011 a report by the Product­ivity Commission on the design of a process for the selection and ongoing review of the superannuation funds that were to be included in modern awards or enterprise agreements as default funds, with the requirement that—and I am just summarising here—the process be based on objective criteria and evidence, subject to systematic review and, essentially, that the process be transparent and competitive. And of course the current process is not objective, it is not transparent and it is not competitive. Don't take my word for it. That was the conclusion of the Labor government just over a year ago.

However, after the election Prime Minister Julia Gillard appointed

                                                             as the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and he is very unenthusiastic about doing anything that would remove the current closed shop, anti-competitive arrangements that are in place when it comes to the selection of default superannuation funds under modern awards. This process is quite disgraceful both in substance and process. We passed an order here in November asking for this report to be provided by the end of May 2011. Initially we got some sort of informal advice that 'we don't really think that we can do this; we don't really think that we can comply with this order unless we have got a direction from the minister to do so.' Of course, the minister wants to be able to hold on to this anticompetitive advantage for union dominated industry super funds for as long as possible, and so the minister was not going to say to the Productivity Commission, 'We want you to do this.' But the Senate said to the Productivity Commiss­ion, 'We want you to do this,' and there is a long history of orders of this nature being complied with in the past by agencies like the Productivity Commission.

                                                             So the Senate passed earlier this year, in February, another order and we asserted that the Senate has the authority, consistent with past practice and under the Constitution, to require that this information be provided and we confirmed the requirement for this information to be provided by 31 May. What did we hear after that? Nothing. This letter is the first formal advice that we are getting from the government about their response to this order of the Senate, and it is a response saying, 'We're not going to do it and we don't care about what you, the Senate, have ordered us to do. We don't care about the motion that was passed by the Senate ordering us to provide this information. Don't worry about a deadline of 31 May as 10 August is early enough to get back and say that, by the way, we're not going to do this sort of thing.' This is a constant pattern. We had a conversation earlier today and yesterday and Senator Ludlam raised the fact that questions on notice had not been answered for 250 days. I had some questions that had not been answered for more than 150 days. And here we have this refusal to comply with the deadline that is set by the Senate. It was a deadline set in November for the end of May. You would think that was a pretty reasonable deadline, yet this govern­ment cannot comply with a deadline set in November for the end of May. This is the pattern of a government that refuses to be accountable to the Senate. They completely do not take us seriously.

                                                             This is a pretty serious issue and related to this is this impasse now in relation to a whole series of orders. There is a whole series of orders, for example, whereby we sought information about the commodity price and production volume assumptions that were at the basis of the mining tax revenue estimates and the government refused outright to provide that information. Supposedly, as part of the agreement between the government and the Greens and as part of the agreement between the govern­ment and some of the key Independents in the other place, there was going to be this process where, whenever there was a dispute between the Senate and the government about matters of public interest disclosure and a Senate order had votes on the floor against the decision of a minister, the

The government entered into this agreement and we have now got a whole plethora of orders on the books whereby the Senate has sought to refer matters to the Information Commissioner for him to arbitrate as to whether it is going to be in the public interest or not for certain information to be released. 'No,' the Information Commissioner says, 'I can't do it. I can't do the job'—refuses to do the job. Clearly, this agreement between the government and the Greens is not worth the paper it is written on.

The best way to maximise value for consumers across Australia is by having a proper competitive framework in place. Look at the recent example of the MT

                                                             was identified as a default fund on a particular award and where some union trustees on the MTAA fund went to Fair Work Australia and asked for the MTAA to be selected as a default fund without declaring the fact that they were actually trustees on that fund. They were going to Fair Work Australia in their capacity as union delegates to ask for a particular fund to be included as a default fund without declaring the fact that they were also trustees of the fund. This is completely inappropriate. The thing is that I have spoken to some very good people, senior leading people across industry super funds, in relation to these issues and some of them have said 'the reason we are selected as default funds is because we perform better'. That is great. And do you know what: if they were to perform better no doubt they would be selected as default superannuation funds in an open, competitive and transparent arrangement. I think that the minister's refusal to act on this clear pre-election commitment by the Labor Party before the last election is actually not doing industry super funds any favours because those that are good are being seen to be favoured and advantaged by a closed shop anticompetitive arrangement when, quite frankly, they would probably thrive in a proper open, competitive and transparent arrangement. If the government still agrees that the current arrangement is anticompetitive and a closed shop arrangement, why would you wait any longer now before you took any action? The reason the minister is not taking any action is that, quite frankly, he is conflicted when it comes to this. He supposedly wants to remove conflicts from financial service advice provision more generally but he does not seem to realise that he himself is conflicted when it comes to policy matters in this area.

Of course, there was only one Evatt. He was certainly not as skilled in the art of caucus or party management as Curtin or Chifley, but few leaders, before or since, have been. And it was Evatt's misfor­tune to be leader at a time when the internal pressures and conflicts of the party would have tested the diplomatic skills of the most conciliatory negotiator. However, Doc Evatt has been acknowledged around the world as a most significant international figure.

The first steps—the 1933 League of Nations Convention Relating to the International Status of Refugees and the 1938 Convention Concern­ing the Status of Refugees—were significant milestones, but they provided only limited protections for displaced persons. The 1933 convention, for example, had just eight member state signatories, as well as substantial self-imposed limitations on the obligations of those signatories.

In 1950 the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was formed. The following year, on 28 July 1951, after tough negotiations and legal wrangling by signatories over the sovereignty of states and their responsibilities and obligations in the international system, the convention that underpins the work of the

According to the most recent Global Trends figures published by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, as at January 2010, there were 2,121,630 refugees in Africa, and 4,524,200 refugees in Asia and the Middle East. That is 6,645,830 men, women and children in only two of the six UNHCR designated world regions. We must remember that no-one becomes a refugee by choice. It is a step demanded by circumstances, so often life threatening for individuals and families. It is a step borne out of the sheer determination of the human spirit to survive and protect those close to them.

Mr Cheeseman, in a desperate attempt to sell a price on carbon, turned to a religious metaphor and has warned of the great flood to come. In Noah's time, humanity's sin was that it had become corrupted, but in Mr Cheeseman's mind the Geelong region's sin is that it has become industrious. Cars have been manufactured, cement has been made, meat has been processed, milk has been produced and the manufacturing industry is creating jobs—all sinful activity in the eyes of the member for Corangamite that needs to be stopped by a new tax.
                                                                 </p>

He drafted a speech that he had planned to give in parliament about the subject which warned of the disaster to come. This speech, however, was never delivered. I assume that someone in the Labor Party—someone in the Rudd government spin machine—knew that the words I am about to quote to the chamber are too crazy to be said in public.

He must have run them by someone in the Labor Party who told him, 'You can't say that, people will think you're a fool, or the words will simply confirm it.'

Here is what the false prophet, Mr Cheeseman, the Noah of Geelong, had to say on his website—the speech he wanted to give but even his party would not let him give.

Mr Cheeseman's great flood will never happen. But Mr Cheeseman and Labor persist with this carbon tax. Noah's solution was to build an ark and put each of the two animals on it. As Mr Cheeseman has been one of the government's harshest critics of the live animal export trade, this option of course is not available to him.
                                                                 </p>

It will punish those sinners who will be responsible for the upcoming great flood—the car manufacturers, the meat producers, the dairy farmers, the coalminers and the cement makers. A bit of common sense in this debate would not go astray. Queenscliffe will not be an island, nor will Barwon Heads or Breamlea; the Great Ocean Road will not be destroyed. The people of Corangamite deserve serious representation. They can do a lot better than this doomsday prophet who does not understand the science and never will. They deserve someone who will not make idiotic statements and they deserve someone who actually understands the needs and wants of their local community.

Interestingly enough, not long after that, my uncle was just off the coast of Ceduna in a ship as he was preparing to enter the Navy. Today it is one of about 50 locations in Australia that are part of a massive global network of surface and upper air monitoring stations. These stations feed data into sophisticated compu­ter models. They are critical to forecasting weather in advance and act as early warning stations, alerting us to severe or hazardous weather conditions.

It is located on beautiful Murat Bay, about 800 kilometres west of Adelaide and 1,900 kilometres east of Senator Back's home town of Perth. As you would know,

Ceduna is also the location of wheat, barley and oat farming. I was particularly impressed to see just how lush the crops were compared with three years ago when I was there. Ceduna also has wool and sheep enterprises, and the mining of salt, gypsum and mineral sands. Of course, the fishing is great all year round.

                                                                  </p>

Ceduna is actually the first of nine offices nationally to receive one of the new wind profilers I referred to earlier. The model used at Ceduna is a boundary layer profiler, designed to monitor wind speeds in the atmospheric boundary layer near the earth's surface, enabling continuous reporting of winds from about 300 metres to at least five kilometres above the station.
                                                                  </p>
                                                                  <p>
                                                                   Traditionally, upper atmospheric wind data are collected using weather balloons, released up to four times per day—and quite an expensive operation. This new wind profiler can produce vertical wind profiles every 30 minutes, greatly improving the ability to monitor storms and weather systems, and support accurate and timely forecasts and warnings. It allows the weather radar to provide a 24-hour continuous weather watch for the region, without having to switch to weather balloon tracking mode for several hours each day. The wind profiler is essentially a vertical-pointing radar and works by transmitting and receiving radio frequency energy. It sends up a pulse of energy, which is then scattered back to the profiler.
                                                                  </p>
                                                                  <p>
                                                                   Turbulent air motion in the atmosphere creates variations in temperature, pressure and humidity relative to the surrounding atmosphere. These variations affect the refractive index of the atmosphere and the scattering of the radio frequency energy. These scatters move with the background wind and as a result the profiler is able to infer the wind speed and direction. Mr President, I see you are nodding and under­standing all of this very comprehensively, as is Senator Colbeck, whom I know has an interest in these sorts of things.
                                                                  </p>

ATRAD produces state-of-the-art, cost-effective radar systems for measuring and interpreting the state of the atmosphere, and provides excellent scientific and technical advice about remote sensing of atmospheric phenomena. ATRAD is an excellent South Australian success story and produces a range of weather radars, antennas and analysers for China and India as well as for the Australian market.

The new wind profiler and radar provide enhanced weather information, which is of vital importance for South Australia, and also enhance the bureau's national network of observations across land, sea and air. The new facilities help fore­casters understand the weather in an area of Australia where data has been relatively sparse in the past. The facilities will provide valuable information through the bureau's website for the benefit of industry, the aviation and rural sectors, local emergency services and the general public.

The Ceduna office is part of a world­wide network of surface and upper air observing stations, of which there are, as I mentioned earlier, more than 50 in Australia. The data from the station are vital in determining the present state of the weather, as the starting point for providing weather forecasts and are also critical for climate, providing valuable information on long-term trends and variations in local weather. A remote balloon launching facility has been installed, providing staff with a safer way to release hydrogen-filled weather balloons, which will continue to be used now and then to supplement the wind profiler as necessary.

The ADF Maritime Activities EMP dictates strict procedures recognised as leading the world in terms of the level of protection afforded to marine mammals. Procedures in place require activities to cease if marine mammals are detected prior or during the exercise, reducing the risk of physical harm to marine mammals to very low.

Some fires did result but these were all contained within Defence training range boundaries. Whale sightings were recorded and vessels implemented the appropriate procedures whenever whales were in the immediate vicinity – no incidents were recorded. Mine countermeasures training is undertaken using simulated underwater mines made of concrete – these are retrieved at the end of the training – there were no identified impacts. Anti submarine warfare training using military sonar was undertaken in areas away from features likely to attract whales, and well out to sea away from the main humpback whale migratory route. Standard operating procedures for both Australian and US ships required that sonar operations cease if whales were sighted too close to warships operating sonar equipment. These procedures are well rehearsed and effective. There were no known impacts on marine mammals.

It has never indicated that military activities pose any significant threat to the water quality of Shoalwater Bay or the Great Barrier Reef. Strict protocols that generally exceed the obligations that apply to commercial, tourist or recreational shipping and boating apply to all warships participating in the exercise, particularly in relation to discharges of sewage and other shipborne waste, management of fuels and other chemicals.

Technical success in any R&amp;D project is not always guaranteed because of the risk inherent in undertaking R&amp;D. However, the merit criteria used for determining the awarding of assistance in competitive granting R&amp;D programs includes an assessment of the applicant's ability to successfully undertake the project and assessment of the commercial prospects for the project outcome. Assistance for R&amp;D provided by way of a legislated entitlement program (principally the R&amp;D Tax Concession) is determined by whether the proposed activity is R&amp;D and whether the claimed expenditure is R&amp;D in nature. A successful commercial outcome is not a mandated requirement of this assistance recognising, again, the inherent risk in undertaking R&amp;D and recognising the value and role that R&amp;D activity plays in economic growth.

A matrix of reporting complements this activity. From time to time, external or internal audits are undertaken to confirm delivery processes and in particular the consistency of delivery arrangements across states.
