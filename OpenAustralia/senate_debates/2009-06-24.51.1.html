         Australian Medical Association
        </a>
        is warning that there could be many deaths in remote Aboriginal communities if governments do not take a more proactive approach to dealing with swine flu. Given that we know that Aboriginal people, particularly in remote communities, are among the highest health risk group in the world and that Aboriginal people have a much higher rate of hospitalisation and death caused by seasonal flu, does the government agree that there is a much higher risk of a disproportionate impact of a swine flu pandemic on Aboriginal communities?

         I thank Senator Siewert for her question. I do understand that the swine flu is an important issue for all of the community. The government does have a robust plan in place to deal with influenza outbreaks for all Australians. The government introduced and announced a new Australian phase of response known as ‘protect’ on 17 June 2009. The government’s response to swine flu is now to target and treat those most vulnerable to severe complications from swine flu, and those can include groups of Indigenous people, who can often have high levels of chronic disease and therefore are more vulnerable to the severe effects of the disease.
        </p>
        <p>
         It has been advised that a 26-year-old Indigenous man who had a number of serious medical conditions and had tested positive to the

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         last week. The man was a resident of a remote community in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         of about 3,000 people, close to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         border. On behalf of the Australian government, I want to take the opportunity to offer sincere condolences to the man’s family.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am advised that WA Health is sending a public health team to these remote communities to support local health staff to assess the situation, undertake surveillance and testing for H1N1 influenza 09 and of course promote infection control and social distancing while minimising unnecessary community anxiety. Antivirals and personal protective equipment have also been deployed in those regions. Australian government staff in the Northern Territory have also undergone hygiene training and all precautions are being taken to limit the spread of the virus in those remote communities.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Perhaps the minister was coming to the point, but my specific question is: is the government prepared to acknowledge that those in remote communities, particularly remote Aboriginal communities, are in fact more vulnerable? Instead of waiting for the symptoms of swine flu to turn up, are they prepared to treat people in Aboriginal communities as a separate group that are highly vulnerable and alter the current plan?

           Thank you, Senator Siewert. I do understand that the question relates to vulnerability. The government is focused on identifying, targeting and treating those most vulnerable to severe complications from swine flu. Swine flu remains mild in the vast majority of cases, but those with existing conditions—and those are people who have respiratory conditions or morbid obesity and pregnant women—are more vulnerable to the severe effects of the disease. Specifically in relation to Indigenous communities, governments—that is, both state and territory governments and the Commonwealth—are working to ensure that people vulnerable to severe complications are protected. Of course, as I indicated, antivirals and personal protective equipment have been deployed in these regions to address those concerns. The Indigenous health sector has been included in all aspects of national and jurisdictional planning—

            , I ask a further supplementary question. What I specifically want to know is: given the exceptional living conditions of Aboriginal communities—for example, crowded living conditions and the health burden they already have—is the government prepared to put extra resources into the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
             Northern Territory
            </a>
            to make sure that remote communities have access to the resources and the vaccines to deal with this issue now, before it gets out of hand? On top of that, what resources are going into the

            now, and will you increase them?

             I thank Senator Siewert. What I have been referring to is that the government has accepted there are risks and we are working to minimise those risks and deal with remote communities and those most vulnerable in the community. In addition, as I have indicated, the Indigenous health sector has been included in all aspects of national and jurisdictional planning and response, and that is to ensure timely and appropriate support is provided to Indigenous communities. To give you an example of that, all Aboriginal medical services have been included in the national planning. They will have access to antivirals and personal protective equipment. The Aboriginal medical service health staff will have access to appropriate training in case management and infection control procedures so that we can ensure that they are trained and can work with this virus.
