         <p class="italic">
          The primary concern in this Bill relates to Schedule 3 which amends the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax to allow the present value of expected future expenditures associated with closing down a particular petroleum project, where these future expenditures relate to so much of this project as continues to be used under an infrastructure licence, to be deductible against the PRRT receipts of this project.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          It relates to ‘closing down’ costs when a project is terminated. Costs from this project are allowed to be offset against revenue until the project ends. Under this provision the Parliament has been asked to support a provision that allows proposed future expenditure of an unsuccessful project to be used as a deduction against PRRT as long as an infrastructure licence is held. However, the expenditure has not even been made, and the deduction is claimed now.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          The definition of expected expenditure is loose and needs clarification, while Treasury and industry should also be asked to justify schedule 3 and indicate whether these are sufficient integrity safeguards to protect against tax avoidance.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          This measure has been presented to the parliament before and has been subject to Senate review.
