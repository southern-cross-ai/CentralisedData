        My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Minister Watt. Minister, now that we are in December it's officially the festive season and families around the country are beginning to plan for their Christmas celebrations. We know that Australian families look forward to sitting down with their families to get great Australian produce on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Christmas Day
        </a>
        . With cost-of-living pressures front of mind in all Australian households, what is the Albanese government doing to assist Australian families with the price of groceries in the lead-up to Christmas?

         Senator Sheldon, I'm sure you'd agree that Christmas is the most wonderful time of year. For one thing, the Senate isn't sitting, and that's a good thing for all of us! But, more than that, it's a time to get together with friends and family, spend time relaxing in the sun and to eat, drink and be merry—but not too much of course!
        </p>
        <p>
         It can also be a tough time for Australians struggling with cost-of-living pressures. Presents for the kids, fuel to get to the other side of town to visit your family, fresh seafood as well as drinks—the cost of Christmas can really add up, so anything that can be done to give families a hand during this time is obviously beneficial, and those with the most to give should be the first to help.
        </p>
        <p>
         That's why today I've called on the big supermarket chains to freeze the price of Christmas hams. The traditional ham—

          I'm surprised that the opposition don't think that's a good idea, sneering at the idea of freezing the price of Christmas hams. How concerned about the cost of living you are! The opposition might be surprised to hear this, but the traditional ham is a staple of any Christmas lunch in Australia. I would have thought you would have known that. It's time for supermarkets to do their part and say one thing we won't put up is the price of a Christmas ham. Guaranteeing a price freeze on ham would allow families to manage their budgets in the weeks leading up to the holiday, and I really would have thought that this was something that the opposition could get behind, but apparently not. It's always politics for them, not caring about the average Australian citizen who's trying to save some money.
         </p>
         <p>
          Farmers also need certainty that they'll get a fair price from supermarkets. These supermarkets have been recording increased revenue and profits while households and farmers are feeling the pinch. For the average Aussie, it doesn't make sense that the price on the bottom of their docket at the supermarket is going up while these companies are recording massive profits—

             and that's why for some time now I've been calling on the supermarkets to drop their meat prices and be more competitive for Australians. The government is doing our bit to help with cost-of-living pressures, and now it's time for the business community to do their part. Since coming to office, the Albanese government has increased the maximum competition penalties from $10 million to $50 million, and we'll keep working on this.

                Thank you, Senator Sheldon. I thank you for your efforts, along with all senators in the Labor team, for delivering real cost-of-living relief for Australians, something that the opposition have failed to do.
               </p>
               <p>
                We know that Australians are doing it tough, and that's why helping with cost-of-living pressures is this government's No. 1 priority. And, while the parliament is taking a break for Christmas, I can tell you that people still get sick, kids still need looking after and households still use energy during the festive season, and that's exactly why the Albanese government has delivered $23 billion in targeted relief while not adding to inflation pressure. For instance, we've delivered electricity bill relief—opposed by the opposition. We've made medicines cheaper—opposed by the opposition. We've made it easier and cheaper to see a doctor—opposed by the opposition. We've delivered cheaper child care and expanded parental leave—opposed by the coalition. We've built more social and affordable homes and increased rent assistance—opposed by the coalition.

                    Given that dealing with cost-of-living pressures are the No. 1 priority of the Albanese government, what obstacles does the government face delivering cost-of-living relief to Australians and how does the government intend to deal with these?

                      President, it continues to amaze me that every time we talk about delivering cost-of-living relief we get laughed at from the other side. I mean, it might be a laughing issue on the

                      of Sydney, somewhere that Senator Sharma knew very well until recently, but it's a very real issue that Australians are dealing with, and that's why we're doing everything we can to help. But, unfortunately, the biggest obstacle to all the cost-of-living relief that we're providing to Australians is the Liberal Party and its leader.

                     <p>
                      As I say, over the last few weeks I've called on the supermarket chains to cut their meat prices, and I'm pleased to see that is starting to happen.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      I will give credit where it is due. We have seen the Greens political party, Senator Lambie and even the Nationals joining us in putting pressure on the big supermarkets but we have heard nothing from the Liberal Party—total silence because they are the party of no solutions. In the past four months in question time the Leader of the Opposition has asked just three questions on cost of living. That's how much he cares about it. He has asked no questions on interest rates, energy or Medicare because he doesn't care about cost-of-living relief and opposes everything we try to do.
