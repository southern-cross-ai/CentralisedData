        Last year the Albanese government continued the Morrison government's campaign to sign away Australian sovereignty to the United Nations

        . Despite the attempt failing, WHO's power grab is ongoing.
       </p>
       <p>
        The WHO is not independent. Their owners are corporate donors who contribute most of the WHO budget. WHO's current sugar daddy is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , who has made billions out of his investment in the same vaccines that WHO promotes. Gates bought the WHO and they now recommend his products. It is that simple.
       </p>
       <p>
        The head of the WHO is Tedros Ghebreyesus, who was previously the health minister of a terrorist organisation called the

        and used international aid to buy power and punish his enemies. The regions of Ethiopia that Tedros starved of medical supplies suffered disastrous cholera epidemics in 2006, 2009 and 2011. Independent investigators found Tedros was 'fully complicit in the terrible suffering and dying that continues to spread in

        .' He's a killer.
       </p>
       <p>
        WHO is rotting from the head. Last week,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press" rel="nofollow">
         Associated Press
        </a>
        reported on the WHO sex crimes scandal, where WHO staffers sexually exploited girls and women during the Congo's recent Ebola outbreakâ€”inhuman. At least 83 WHO staff engaged in abuse, including rape and forced abortions, with victims as young as 13. WHO refused to fire the perpetrators, using the absurd argument that their actions didn't violate WHO's sexual exploitation practice policies because the victims were not receiving WHO aid; the raping part is okay with Tedros. This the person who heads an organisation that many in government and academia want to elevate above the Australian parliament.
