        On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights" rel="nofollow">
         Human Rights
        </a>
        , I present the 11th report of the 44th Parliament of the committee on the examination of legislation in accordance with the Human Rights Parliamentary Scrutiny Act 2011.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ordered that the report be printed.
       </p>
       <p>
        By leave—I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the Senate take note of the report.
       </p>
       <p>
        I rise to speak to the tabling of the 11th report of the 44th Parliament of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights. The committee considered four bills. Of these four bills, one does not require further scrutiny as it is compatible with human rights. The committee has decided to further defer its consideration of three bills. The committee has not identified any bills that it considers require further examination and for which it will seek further information. The committee has also examined and made a number of recommendations in relation to one act previously identified as potentially giving rise to human rights concerns.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of the bills considered, those which are scheduled for debate during the sitting week commencing 1 September 2014 include: the Business Services Wage Assessment Tool Payment Scheme Bill 2014, the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Stronger Penalties for Serious Failures) Bill 2014 and the Mining Subsidies Legislation Amendment (Raising Revenue) Bill 2014. The report outlines the committee's assessment of the compatibility of these bills with human rights. With these comments, I commend the committee's 11th report of the 44th Parliament to the Senate.

         I would also like to talk on this report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on

         and specifically mention the bills that Senator Smith raised that do not need any further examination. It is in light of some cheap political points that the opposition are attempting to score on child care. Just in case there is any ambiguity, the committee response to the very detailed evidence provided to the committee on the childcare bills from the assistant minister ends:

         for her response. In light of the information received, the committee considers the measure to be compatible with human rights and has concluded its examination of the measure.

         I commend the minister for her comprehensive response to the committee.
