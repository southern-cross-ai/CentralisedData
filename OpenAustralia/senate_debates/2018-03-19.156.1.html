        This Bill is an important step to ensuring home ownership is more achievable for Australians.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Schedule 1 to this Bill delivers on the Government's commitment to implement stronger rules for foreign residents owning Australian housing to reduce pressure on housing affordability.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Schedule 2 to this Bill contains technical amendments to support changes announced in the 2017-18 Budget to streamline the foreign investment framework.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Schedule 3 to this Bill delivers on the Government's commitment to introduce tax incentives to boost investment in affordable housing, to create the right incentives and improve outcomes for those in need.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I will now discuss each of these schedules in more detail.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Schedule 1 to this Bill implements two of three reforms announced in the 2017-18 Budget, to improve tax integrity and reduce pressure on housing affordability by changing the capital gains tax rules for foreign residents.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Firstly, foreign residents will be denied access to the main residence capital gains tax exemption from 7.30pm
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEST" rel="nofollow">
         AEST
        </a>
        on 9 May 2017.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A grandfathering arrangement will apply for properties already held at that time, with the change taking effect for these properties from 1 July 2019.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The main residence exemption allows individuals to disregard a capital gain they make on the sale of a property established as their main residence.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        No longer allowing foreign residents to claim this exemption will send a clear message that foreign residents will have to comply with our stringent capital gains tax rules.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second" rel="nofollow">
         Second
        </a>
        ly, this schedule addresses an integrity issue with the capital gains tax rules for foreign residents that hold indirect interests in Australian real property, such as land, from 7.30pm AEST on 9 May 2017.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign" rel="nofollow">
         Foreign
        </a>
        residents are required to pay tax on capital gains made in relation to interests in Australian real property, including indirect interests, where certain tests are met.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This reform addresses an integrity issue with one of these tests—the principal asset test—to require a foreign resident to consider any interests held by its associates, if it disposes of an indirect interest in Australian real property for example by selling shares in a land rich company.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This integrity fix will ensure that the principal asset test cannot be circumvented by disaggregating holdings of membership interests.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I would like to thank those that contributed to the public consultation on the draft legislation for these two reforms, held between 21 July and 15 August 2017.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The third reform announced in the 2017-18 Budget, expanding the foreign resident capital gains tax withholding regime, has already been enacted and came into effect on 1 July 2017. The regime was expanded by increasing the withholding rate from 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent, and decreasing the withholding threshold from $2 million to $750,000 to capture more properties.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Combined, these three integrity measures are expected to have a gain to revenue of $570.0 million over the forward estimates period.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Schedule 2 to this Bill contains technical amendments that introduce a reconciliation fee on developers for dwellings sold to foreign persons under a near-new dwelling exemption certificate. The near-new dwelling exemption certificate was introduced through regulatory amendments that took effect from 24 June 2017.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Schedule 3 to this Bill allows resident investors in qualifying affordable rental housing to obtain a capital gains tax discount of up to 60 per cent from 1 January 2018.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Currently, capital gains arising from the sale of capital gains tax assets of individuals that are held for at least 12 months generally receive a 50 per cent capital gains discount. This includes residential investment properties that are supplied for affordable housing.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Under this measure, an additional capital gains tax discount will be available to resident investors who hold affordable housing directly or through certain trusts, such as holding units within a managed investment trust.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Qualifying affordable housing will need to be managed through a registered community housing provider and provided as affordable housing for at least three years.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Community housing providers will be responsible for assessing tenant eligibility.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        does not want to duplicate state and territory housing policies, so community housing providers will need to assess tenant eligibility against relevant state and territory housing policies and registration requirements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This measure encourages increased investment in affordable rental housing and forms part of the Government's broader housing affordability package announced in the 2017-18 Budget.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This measure is estimated to have a cost to revenue of $15.0 million over the forward estimates period.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I would like to thank those that contributed to the public consultation on the draft legislation for these measures.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In conclusion, the Government through this Bill is creating the right incentives as part of our comprehensive and targeted plan to improve outcomes across the housing spectrum.
