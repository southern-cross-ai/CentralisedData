       <p>
        Australia has the highest rate of mammal extinctions, and one of the highest overall extinction rates, in the world, with 448 animals currently threatened with extinction. Think about that: 448 animals—precious and amazing native animals—threatened with extinction. Why do we have such a staggering rate of species loss? It's because of neglect by government after government, Labor and Liberal alike. It's because this government, the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison-whatever-it's-going-to-be-next-week government, is wholeheartedly supporting the logging of our native forests. It's allowing broadscale clearing for agriculture and property developers. It's slashing jobs and funding in the environment department. It's doing sod all about climate change except changing leaders. It's not doing enough to eradicate pest animals like foxes and cats.
       </p>
       <p>
        Yet this government then turns around and has the audacity to host a threatened species event at parliament showcasing rare, endangered and threatened species, like the Tasmanian devil, the olive python and the even rarer and more endangered female Liberal minister. This event in parliament was an opportunity for coalition MPs to get a cute feel-good pic, for social media, with a fluffy koala. Meanwhile, they stand by and allow these koalas' habitat to be destroyed. Did you know that koalas are set to be extinct in

        by 2050 because of logging and land clearing?
       </p>
       <p>
        It's astounding and appalling that a country as rich, as developed and as wealthy as ours is robbing future generations of their chance to know and to love our precious wildlife. That's why the Greens set up the much needed Senate inquiry into the extinction crisis—to shine a light on what is killing our wonderful animals and what needs to happen to protect them. Over 12,000 Australians have already let this inquiry know of their concerns about our threatened wildlife. This is a massive show of public support for urgent, strong action to end the extinction crisis.

       <p>
        There are 448 Australian animals that are either critically endangered, endangered or vulnerable. In the seven minutes that I've got left, I'm going to see if I can name them all to give you a feel for what's at stake—the extent of the extinction crisis that we face. I'm going to start with the mammals that are critically endangered: the

I apologise to those I left out. They are just as significant, just as threatened and just as important as the others. Take them as read, and, please, all Australians, I call on you to take action to end this extinction crisis. A great way to start is to vote Greens and to vote out this mob at the next election, as soon as possible.
