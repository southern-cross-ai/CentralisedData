         I thank Senator Smith for his question and his interest in these key issues, because this government recognises the importance of meeting the challenges and the opportunities of our blue Pacific continent. That's why, in consultation and in partnership with our Pacific neighbours, the Australian government is implementing our Pacific step-up. Security, economic growth and closer people-to-people links so that they can prosper are the fundamental principles that underpin the step-up, and I'm pleased to say that we are delivering on our commitments.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Office of the Pacific has been established in my department to make sure that all arms of government are working toward this goal together. We've signed memoranda of understanding with 10 countries now to join the Pacific Labour Scheme, which will create economic opportunities and build skills for Pacific island workers and support regional and rural economies in Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         And this month the Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific also opened for business. It will work to address the infrastructure needs of the region. They are considerable indeed—estimated by the

        </p>
        <p>
         We're building on our people-to-people links through our shared love of sport—and our shared love of competition in sport, I might add—and our Church Partnership Program, which is a very powerful engagement between Australia and our neighbours. Both the Prime Minister and I have demonstrated our respective commitment to the Pacific with our regional visits since the election, and I look forward to discussing Pacific priorities further this week at foreign ministers meetings in Suva.

            , as a guest of government. This was the first guest-of-government visit since the election, which speaks volumes for the importance of this relationship—a relationship that we've also announced we will elevate to a comprehensive strategic and economic partnership.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm pleased to say that, within that, Australia and Papua New Guinea have agreed to a range of new initiatives that will build both the breadth and the depth of our partnership in health, in defence, with policing and in a number of other areas. We're working in partnership to grow Papua New Guinea's economy, including through the Coral Sea Cable System, as I mentioned in my earlier response; the Papua New Guinea Electrification Partnership; and the Papua New Guinea-Australia Transport Sector Support Program.
           </p>
           <p>
            We're investing in a range of new projects in Papua New Guinea's energy sector to not only reduce costs but also, really importantly, increase access to power. We're supporting plans to refurbish hydroelectricity plants and to build a new solar power plant and a new gas-fired power plant. We're committed to working side by side with Papua New Guinea to advance the common interest of our Pacific family.

               It's fair to say that engaging with our partners in the region is a core part of the Pacific step-up. We're not alone in our commitment to a stable, prosperous and secure region, and our partners, including
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
                New Zealand
               </a>
               , the United States, France, Japan and multilateral agencies, are strongly committed to the development of the region.
              </p>
              <p>
               We're collaborating with the United States and Japan under our trilateral infrastructure partnership. The

                Papua New Guinea
               </a>
               Electrification Partnership that I referred to earlier is a really good example of this effective partnership approach, through which we are working with Papua New Guinea themselves, Japan, New Zealand and the United States to support the Papua New Guinea government to achieve its goal of providing electricity to 70 per cent of its population, from the current level of 13 per cent, by the end of 2030.
              </p>
              <p>
               Projects are underway to achieve that aim, and it is truly transformative for Papua New Guinea. We are also engaging closely with the private sector and with civil society to ensure that we maximise the potential of our Pacific step-up to strengthen the region.
