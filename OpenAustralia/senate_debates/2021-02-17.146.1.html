        I seek leave to move general business notices of motion Nos 988, 996, 1000, 1003 and 1004 together and that they be determined without amendment or debate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        I move general business notices of motion Nos 988, 996, 1000, 1003 and 1004 together:
       </p>
       <p>
        General Business Notice of Motion No. 988
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the Senate—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) in a report commissioned by Housing for the Aged Action Group, it observed that an increasing number of older Tasmanians (people aged 55 or over) are experiencing homelessness or at increasing risk of becoming homeless, and the problem is particularly bad for women, who are more likely to experience housing stress,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) Shelter Tas, Tasmania's peak body for housing and homelessness, deemed that renting was unaffordable for low-income families across Tasmania,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii) prolonged low wage growth and penalty rate cuts prevent people from being able to save up for a mortgage and have resulted in a lack of affordability in the private rental market for older Australians,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iv) compounding this, stagnant growth in the development of social housing, particularly government funded public housing, has meant that need is an ongoing and critical issue,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (v) the number of people on JobSeeker in Tasmania remains at 75% above pre-COVID-19 levels and, post March, they will return to living on $40 a day, perpetuating the housing crisis, and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (vi) access to safe and secure housing is a basic human right; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) urges the Government to fund the construction of social housing in not only Tasmania, but across Australia to curb the trend of rising homelessness.
       </p>
       <p>
        General Business Notice of Motion No. 9 96
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the Senate—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) notes that the Australian steel industry employs over 110,000 hardworking Australians;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) recognises that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) in 2015, Ms Karen Andrews, while Parliamentary Secretary for Industry, weakened anti-dumping regulations against overseas steel,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) following the 2016 failure of major Arrium steel manufacturer, the Economic References Committee released a report into the future of the steel industry in December 2017,
        <i>
         Australia

        </i>
        which noted that foreign dumped steel, from overseas countries, contributed to Arrium's collapse,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii) the report released 28 common sense recommendations, none of which have been taken up by Minister Andrews,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iv) in 2017, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWU" rel="nofollow">
         AWU
        </a>
        reported that cheap dumped foreign steel had cost local manufacturers $200 million in the previous 12-18 months,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (v) since 2015-16, the Government has cut 13% of the Anti-Dumping Commission's budget,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (vi) since Ms Andrews became Industry Minister over 128,400 manufacturing jobs have been lost, and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (vii) Minister Andrews is forcing out the current Anti-Dumping Commissioner, expert Dale Seymour, at the end of his 2021 term; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) calls on the Federal Government to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) ensure an appropriate and domestic industry-focused anti-dumping regime,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) support the sovereign capabilities of Australia by ensuring that our domestic steel industry is future proof, and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii) stand up for the 110,000 jobs of Australian steelworkers.

        General Business Notice of Motion No. 1000
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the Senate—

        </a>
        oil refinery at Altona;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) acknowledges this decision:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) is devastating news for hundreds of local workers and for the future of Australia's fuel security,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) will cost hundreds of direct jobs and impact thousands of workers in downstream industry, and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii) is further proof that the Morrison Government has no plan for workers affected by these decisions;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) recognises the Morrison Government:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) has overseen the closure announcements of half of our domestic refineries in the last six months,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) announced a $211 million so-called fuel security package in September last year to keep refineries on line, yet six months later another refinery has announced it will close its doors, and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii) said its fuel security plan would 'create 1,000 new jobs and protect workers in the fuel sector and in fuel-dependent industries', but instead its 'stewardship' has seen the loss of 600 jobs at Kwinana, and the imminent loss of 350 direct jobs at Altona, and many thousands more if it continues to sit on its hands; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) condemns the Morrison Government's policy vacuum, which has left hundreds of workers without jobs and the nation without a sovereign supply of domestic fuel.

       <p>
        General Business Notice of Motion No. 1003
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the Senate—

        (a) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) hunting injected $356 million into the Victorian economy in 2019, predominantly in regional areas,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) the Victorian Labor Government has:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (A) reduced the state's duck hunting season to only 20 days,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (B) lowered daily bag limits to only two birds, and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (C) delayed start times to 8 am for the first five days,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii) the restrictions are politically motivated and not based on science, and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iv) rural and regional Victoria will suffer significant economic losses with less revenue generated from law-abiding duck hunters visiting these communities;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) calls on the Victorian Labor Government to immediately reverse these changes to the duck hunting season; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) supports sustainable game hunting by law-abiding citizens who benefit from the health, wellbeing, cultural and recreational aspects of the sport.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) the diversity in our regions reflected in these powerful stories, covering issues and themes such as overcoming adversity, aspiration, disability, mental health, drought, identity, community, courage and distance;
