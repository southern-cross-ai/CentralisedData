        I actually have been listening carefully to the two-minute statements being given in this chamber, and I decided to change my contribution during the course of the discussion. What prompted me to change my contribution was the contribution which Senator James
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGrath" rel="nofollow">
         McGrath
        </a>
        made and the reaction it elicited from a number of Greens senators. I should state at the outset that it was not the Greens senators who are currently in the chamber but some of their colleagues who were in the chamber. Senator McGrath spoke about the fact that the MP for Ryan,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Watson" rel="nofollow">
         Elizabeth Watson
        </a>
        -Brown MP, refuses to display the Australian flag in her electorate office. This was met with some mirth from the Greens senators who were sitting in this chamber.
       </p>
       <p>
        I say two things in relation to this point. If that is the view of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Greens
        </a>
        , then you go to the next election and you campaign on the basis of that view. Be honest with the people of Ryan and every other seat where you're seeking election. If that is your view, if that is the view of Elizabeth Watson-Brown MP, then be truthful with the people of Ryan before election day so they can make a decision, make a judgement, on who represents their values the best. Be fair dinkum with the people of Ryan. Be honest with them.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second point I would make is that as I was listening and watching the mirth from the Greens senators, I was reminded of the famous words of one of my heroes, Senator Neville Bonner, the first Indigenous senator to represent Queensland in this place. He said, 'Look to unite us; don't pursue mere symbolism which seeks to divide us.' That represents what the Greens are doing in the seat of Ryan.
