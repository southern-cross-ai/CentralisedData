        In directing my question to the Minister for Defence, Senator Payne, can I congratulate her on this morning's signing of the memorandum of understanding with the Singapore government. Minister, could you indicate to the Senate how the signing of this morning's defence memorandum of understanding in support of the comprehensive strategic partnership further strengthens the wonderful cooperation between Australia and Singapore?

         I particularly thank Senator Macdonald for his interest in this very important issue, not just for our defence relationship with Singapore but also for his area of northern Queensland. I was very pleased just this morning to sign a memorandum of understanding concerning military training and training area development in Australia with my Singaporean counterpart, Dr Ng. It is a major step forward following the Turnbull government's announcement in May that Australia and Singapore would jointly develop military training areas and facilities in Australia, enhancing Singapore's training opportunities. It is in direct alignment with the 2016 white paper to increase Defence's international engagement to further develop our international partnerships with our allies and our partners.
        </p>
        <p>
         The signing of the memorandum of understanding affirms the commitment from the governments of both Australia and Singapore to take the next steps to implement this historic agreement. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOU" rel="nofollow">
          MOU
         </a>
         provides an assurance of enhancing our bilateral defence relationship and committing to these investments in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
          North Queensland
         </a>
         . It represents a 25-year commitment to increasing training area access and investment by the Singaporean government to upgrading military training areas.
        </p>
        <p>
         This MOU will bring us closer as defence partners. It will generate significant local economic activity over the next 25 years. It will, importantly, complement our very close existing defence relationship with Singapore based on a long history of engagement, practical cooperation, education and training. We will, of course, continue to hold our shared interests in regional stability and security—many of the issues to which Prime Minister Lee referred in his remarks to the joint sitting of the houses yesterday. Specifically, the memorandum of understanding cements our agreement to grant Singapore enhanced access for unilateral land training from the current six weeks per year to 18 weeks per year, and from the current 6,600 troops per year to 14,000 troops per year.

            This is an important aspect of the

             MOU
            </a>
            between Australia and Singapore because it is a milestone that will deliver significant economic opportunities for the Townsville and Rockhampton regions. As part of the memorandum of understanding, priority will also be given—and this is a very important part of the announcement—to local businesses around the Townsville Field Training Area and the Shoalwater Bay Training Area in support of both the phases of development and the ongoing training activities, which will, of course, boost regional jobs and growth.
           </p>
           <p>
            Roughly $1 billion will be invested in each of the Townsville and Rockhampton regions between 2016 and 2026. It is a very significant undertaking. As Singapore's training presence begins to increase, the demand for support services and opportunities for local businesses will expand. As the training presence reaches maturity, the government expects there will be an additional $10-16 million annual investment in both Townsville and Rockhampton. This is significant for jobs, significant for business and significant for—

              communities. Could the minister tell the Senate what the next steps are for planning and implementation of the memorandum of understanding? Perhaps, the minister could also let the Senate know if she is intending to more directly advise the people of Townsville about these new initiatives in their region.

               In fact, following the signing of the memorandum of understanding this morning I am looking forward to travelling to Townsville with my counterpart, Dr Ng, this afternoon to meet with community leaders, including business and local government. Defence will commence engagement with community groups and stakeholders. I am also intending to appoint a dedicated community liaison officer in
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
                North Queensland
               </a>
               to ensure that businesses and other stakeholders are able to receive timely updates on implementation and that they have a point of contact for their inquiries.
              </p>
              <p>
               The detailed planning for facilities development will occur in early 2017, concurrent with master-planning activity. Defence will provide an initial business case on upgrades to government in 2017, and we anticipate construction of facilities will commence from late 2018 to 2019. The scale and complexity of these developments is quite significant, and it needs to be done properly. But implementing this initiative also gives Australian servicemen and women access to better training facilities, and it will enhance our capability as well. We are keen to progress—
