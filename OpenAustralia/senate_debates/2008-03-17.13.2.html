          This bill amends the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to provide the

          , the discretion to consider late applications for renewals of community broadcasting licences up to the expiry date of the licence. Currently ACMA has no discretion to consider late applications for the renewal of community broadcasting licences, regardless of the circumstances that have given rise to the late application. This is a measured and valuable amendment. Having personally campaigned for the continued operation of Goldfields 99.1

          community radio station in Maryborough I am fully aware of the importance of the community radio sector. Indeed, the former government greatly valued the community radio sector, overseeing its expansion around Australia. As this bill was originally produced by the previous Howard government, the opposition has no objection to it.
         </p>
         <p>
          I will speak briefly in relation to community radio, which is one of those great successes Australia wide. They are invariably run by people who are doing it without any remuneration—working long hours and providing a fantastic service, particularly in country areas such as Maryborough where there can be a localised radio service that is talking the talk that the locals talk. The opposition does not oppose the bill.

           , a valuable piece of legislation. It may even be referred to as the ‘Ronaldson memorial amendment’. I know that Senator Ronaldson has championed this case over a number of years. Previously, the coalition has been a good advocate of community broadcasting and opposition to this bill would have been a surprise. We welcome your contribution and support. I thank all my colleagues for their contributions.
