        My question is to the Minister representing the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Sherry. In February this year the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
         ACCC
        </a>
        found that airports drive away competition from other parking venues and bus operators by imposing excessive access levies and controls on the available space for those operators. I note that Australia has some of the highest on-airport car park fees in the world. But in August the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Productivity Commission
        </a>
        's draft report on economic regulation for airport services said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Access charges paid by competitors to on-airport car parking are not so high as to impede competition …
       </p>
       <p>
        Does the government side with the ACCC or the Productivity Commission when it comes to competition at airports, and does it believe the ACCC currently has sufficient powers to deal with excessive airport charges?

         Thank you, Senator Xenophon, for the question. The Gillard government has asked the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          Productivity Commission
         </a>
         to investigate airport pricing, investment and services as part of a major public inquiry into the economic regulation of major Australian airports. Having established an inquiry, it is important that I do not pre-empt the outcome of that inquiry by going to a specific response on at least some of the issues that Senator Xenophon has raised.
        </p>
        <p>
         As far as the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
          ACCC
         </a>
         submission goes, there is no doubt it will form a significant part of the Productivity Commission's deliberations. I have no doubt about that—the ACCC is a highly authoritative and knowledgeable organisation in the area of competition. It is important to note that, whatever the outcome of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC" rel="nofollow">
          PC
         </a>
         's reviews, there are already measures in place to deal with market power issues in airports and other sectors of the economy. For example, section 46 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 prohibits the misuse of market power. In 2006 the Productivity Commission conducted a review of the regulatory arrangements for pricing airport services, and that review examined the price monitoring regime that had replaced the price capping—

                  Senator Xenophon, I certainly do understand your concern at the level of the charges—$15 to $20 an hour or more. I appreciate the concern of consumers about this issue. By way of illustration, I fly in and out of
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devonport_Airport" rel="nofollow">

                  , but it does illustrate the point. At Devonport Airport you can park for $1 forever—there is no limit. So I think that illustrates the comparative—

                     reported that Melbourne airport makes almost $104 million a year from parking alone and Sydney airport makes $95 million, is the government conceding that as a result of the privatisation contracts and a weak regulatory environment competitive car park prices at Australian airports will never in fact be achieved?

                      I think I have already conceded. I can understand the concern of consumers at that level of pricing at Melbourne and Sydney. I take your figures as being accurate in terms of the quantum of profitability from car parking at those two airports, particularly when I compare it to what occurs in Devonport—albeit Devonport's is a slightly more modest airport than Melbourne's or Sydney's. However, it is not for me to pre-empt the outcome—

                        Fractionally, yes, but a wonderful airport, a wonderful part of the world that I would encourage people to visit. Come through Burnie, Wynyard or Devonport airports—a wonderful part of the world. But, to come back, as I have said, there is concern. That is why we have established the inquiry.
