           The government agrees with the

            Department of Defence
           </a>
           that the release of the unredacted document is commercially sensitive. The government agrees also that the provision of the requested documents would adversely impact on the ability of Defence to achieve value for money across the shipbuilding program and meet Australia's broader strategic objectives. The draft tendered plan cited in this motion includes commercial-in-confidence information which encompasses proprietary information, arrangements with other parties, sensitive financial data and commercial strategies that could impact the competitiveness of companies. The disclosure of information also impacts the government's ability to effectively negotiate

              calls for documents which are critical to the committee conducting its businessâ€”that is, to examine the naval shipbuilding program from the Australian industry content perspective. We've got to a point in time now where the government is denying the Senate basic information that is to do with commercial arrangements agreed to by companies in order to win a procurement contract. The government is now seeking to expand its confidentiality over just about anything, as long as it might have come from a company. This is really important material, it goes to the Australian industry content that was promised by these companies at contract, and the Senate has a right to look at these documents and make sure that these companies and Defence are holding them to account in relation to their promises.
