        Previously, Defence has reported the annual outcome for the Portfolio Budget Statement programs by cost summary for each program as part of the online version of the Defence Annual Report. Defence will ensure this level of reporting is included in the online version of future publications.

       <p class="italic">
        Together with the Portfolio Budget Statements, the Defence Corporate Plan provides the external strategic narrative about Defence investment in military capability and how it intends to meet and measure performance against government requirements.

        Recommendation 2
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee recommends that future Department of Defence Annual Reports should clearly report performance against the Portfolio Budget Statement outcomes and detail the level of achievement against all program sub elements. If purposes are used for external communication, the linkages between Portfolio Budget Statement outcomes, departmental programs and the purposes should also be made clear.

         2013

        (PGPA Act) introduced a requirement for entities to prepare annual performance statements for publication in the annual report. The annual performance statements report to what extent the entity has fulfilled their purpose(s) as outlined in their Corporate Plan. Section 39 of the PGPA Act superseded the requirement under section 63(2) of the
        <i>
         Public Service Act 1999
        </i>
        to report performance in relation to the deliverables and key performance indicators of the programs in the Portfolio Budget Statements, and the effectiveness in achieving the planned outcomes in the Portfolio Budget Statements.

       <p class="italic">
        The Annual Performance Statements were prepared in accordance with the PGPA Act for the first time in the
        <i>
         Defence Annual Report 2015–16

        . The quality of the annual performance statements is improving as Defence achieves better alignment between the non-financial performance criteria in the Corporate Plan and the Portfolio Budget/Additional Estimates Statements.

        Recommendation 3
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee recommends that the Department of Defence develop a transparent reporting mechanism that demonstrates changes in effectiveness or efficiency resultant from the First Principles Review related change for consideration by the Defence Sub-Committee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade by 31 March 2018.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Government response
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Agree.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Defence agrees in principle with Recommendation 3, but suggests that the timeframe be amended to 31 July 2018.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Defence notes that a number of improvements relating to efficiency and effectiveness have been gained by implementing the First Principles Review.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        has asked Defence to provide an update on First Principles Review implementation, including progress measuring and reporting on improvements in effectiveness and efficiency, in July 2018. Given the timing of work already underway to measure efficiency and effectiveness and the existing requirement to report to Government in July 2018, Defence suggests that it would also be appropriate to provide the Defence Sub-Committee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade with an update on measurement and reporting of effectiveness and efficiency improvements in July 2018.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 4
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee recommends the Department of Defence consider leveraging private sector expertise during Investment Committee Gate Zero deliberations; where the addition of an industry expert may increase public confidence in approach to market decisions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Government response
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Agree.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Defence agrees with the intent of Recommendation 4. Defence will leverage private sector expertise in the development of Gate Zero proposals but does not propose industry representatives be invited into the Investment Committee as a part of the deliberative process. Defence intends to strike the right balance between early industry engagement and leveraging industry experience, whilst maintaining a competitive environment and protecting the Commonwealth's negotiating position.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Industry will be engaged at multiple points up to and including Gate Zero. Defence intends to leverage industry's expertise in a number of ways, including but not limited to:

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee recommends that the Department of Defence work with the Defence Sub-Committee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade to harmonise and streamline reporting matrices to the Parliament to allow for independent Parliamentary oversight.

        (PGPA Act) and the PGPA Rule 2014 to provide a transparent approach to reporting on performance to Parliament.

        In accordance with the Department of Finance's Resource Management Guides, Defence prepares a corporate plan and annual performance statements in the annual report.

        Recommendation 6
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee recommends that the Department of Defence improve:

       <p class="italic">
        the consistency between the Defence Portfolio Budget Statements and the Defence Annual Report;
       </p>

        Recommendation 6.1: Agree. The 2015–16 Annual Performance Statements, published in the
        <i>
         Defence Annual Report 2015 –16
        </i>
        are the first statements produced by Commonwealth entities under the PGPA Act. The 2016–17 Annual Performance Statements in the
        <i>
         Defence Annual Report 2016 –17
        </i>
        demonstrated greater alignment between the outcomes in the Portfolio Budget Statements 2016–17 and the purposes in the 2016–17 Defence Corporate Plan. This enhanced the narrative of Defence's non-financial performance for the reporting period.

        The
        <i>
         Defence Annual Report 2016–17

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 6.2: Disagree. Government approvals are required and obtained on an out-turned basis. To allow effective performance reporting, budget estimates are reported on the current price basis against actual expenditure.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 6.3: Disagree. The Defence Annual Report does disclose results and performance in relation to the Defence Workforce (2015-16 Defence Annual Report Chapter 7). Additionally the online version of the 2015-16 Defence Annual Report includes comparable information published within the Portfolio Budget Statements and the Portfolio Additional Estimates Statements on Acquisition, Sustainment and Facilities and Infrastructure.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Improvement in performance reporting must take into account that the level of aggregation and disambiguation required to make the report suitable for publication at the Unclassified level may compromise the meaning of the information, to the point that it becomes potentially misleading.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Defence Force Headquarters Governance and Coordination will work with line areas conducting performance reporting to improve the quality of performance reporting provided, within the constraints of the Australian Government Protective Security Policy Framework.

        Recommendation 7

        Since the Defence Annual Report 2015–16 was tabled the Services have implemented all but one component of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) Total Workforce Model, designed and developed by Project Suakin.

This enhances Defence's position as an employer of choice and improves its prospects of attracting and retaining key ADF personnel.

        Recommendation 9
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
