        My question is to the Minister for Defence, Senator Faulkner. Can the minister outline to the Senate the government’s commitment to acquire a new defence capability for the Australian armed forces as set out in the defence white paper? In particular, can the minister inform the Senate of the steps that the government has taken to implement the commitment to acquire a fleet of new naval combat helicopters?

         I can confirm that the government has provided first-pass approval for defence capability plan project Air 9000 Phase 8. An advanced naval aviation capability is essential to maintaining the ADF’s capability edge in the complex and demanding marine environment. The new helicopters will possess advanced antisubmarine warfare capabilities. Sufficient helicopters will be acquired to provide at least eight helicopters concurrently embarked on ships at sea, which under the white paper required a fleet of 24 helicopters. The government will examine the options to provide a new combat helicopter through a cost-capped competitive process involving the Sikorsky-Lockheed Martin

        </p>
        <p>
         This is a multibillion dollar project. A competitive process will ensure value for money for the taxpayer and ensure the best possible decision-making to support this vital capability. Any decision government makes will take into account all relevant considerations, including capability, cost, interoperability with other ADF capabilities, risk, value for money and industry aspects. The competitive process will follow a schedule that will allow for initial operating capability in the year 2014. The government anticipates releasing the request for tender in the coming months, with a final decision in 2011.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Can the minister also outline to the Senate the changes to the public defence capability plan announced on Tuesday by the Minister for Defence Personnel, Material and Science? Can the minister inform the Senate of any other recent steps the government has taken to ensure that the ADF has the capabilities it needs?

           I can advise the Senate of two other important steps towards the delivery of Force 2030. The government has given second-pass approval to the acquisition of seven new CH47F Chinook helicopters to replace the current fleet of six CH47D Chinooks. The CH47F is the most modern and capable version of the Chinook, which has been proven to be a major ADF asset in Afghanistan. The government has also approved Australian involvement in the

           . It is routinely used for a range of operations, including those in Afghanistan. The upgrades will address system obsolescence, maintain coalition compatibility and enable these aircraft to comply with global air traffic standards.

            <p>
             Yes. The government puts a very high priority on ensuring that the ADF has the equipment it needs to carry out its mission. There is no more serious issue than this. We must learn from past mistakes that have been made in defence procurement. Major acquisitions, of course, require careful consideration. Examining all relevant capability cost and schedule issues is essential, and I intend to ensure that we do take the appropriate time to consider all relevant issues when it comes to investing billions of taxpayer dollars in defence. Defence is continuing to progress a range of complex capability projects. My focus is on ensuring that we get both the process and the outcomes right.
