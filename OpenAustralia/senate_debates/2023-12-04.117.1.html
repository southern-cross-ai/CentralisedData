        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. Minister, how many detainees, including paedophiles, rapists, murderers and a contract killer, have now been released into the Australian community, and, of those, how many are there whom the government has tried or is trying to resettle in another country?

         In relation to this cohort, as the shadow minister would be aware, the government, in addition to standing up a joint police operation between

           It is a point of order in relation to relevance. The question was in relation to how many have now been released into the community and whether or not you are pursuing resettlement in relation to any of them.

            Thank you, Senator Cash. The minister did refer to a statement, which of course I don't have before me and don't know the contents of. I will remind the minister of the question, but without knowing the full details of the statement I really can't rule.

             In relation to the number so far released, I am advised that as a consequence of the High Court's decision the 148 individuals have now been released from immigration detention. Perhaps I could go back, though, because I would have thought the senator would be interested in how we try to keep Australians safe in circumstances where the High Court has ordered the release, a decision which any government is required to observe. The government has passed the Migration Amendment (Bridging Visa Conditions) Bill. The government also brought in a strengthening of that legislation—the Migration Amendment (Bridging Visa Conditions and Other Measures) Bill 2023—which criminalises further bridging visa conditions. I note that this opposition, for some reason, voted against—

                Well, with respect to Senator Cash, I'm not going to take as read what she is asserting. If she has questions about the exercise of that law by ministers, I'll certainly see whether we can provide any further information in the absence of any further detail now. But I would make the point that if Senator Cash and those opposite are interested in increasing the penalties on persons released then perhaps Senator Cash could explain to the chamber why her party voted with
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Bandt" rel="nofollow">
                 Adam Bandt
                </a>
                and their party against legislation designed to increase the severity of penalties—
               </p>
               <p>
                I'll take the interjection. She says it's because we had to wait for the High Court. Isn't that interesting, because, as I recall, you were in here being very loud about why we didn't have to wait for the High Court. So, which is it, Senator Cash?

                   First, we are providing briefings to the opposition, which Senator Cash is aware of. Secondly, this goes to the fundamental point that these individuals have not been released because the government made a determination that they had to be released; these people are being released as a consequence of the High Court decision, which struck down laws that you had in place—and not the first set of laws of yours that they have struck down.
