        I rise tonight to make a few brief remarks about an entirely different aspect of medical research and the need to support it. Members of this place would be aware that the Senate Community Affairs Committee recently tabled a report on the need to support research and treatment for gynaecological cancers. Along with my good friend Senator Moore, on Saturday night I had the honour of attending a fundraiser called Comedy for Cancer 2—a benefit that was held in support of the work of ANZCOG and to assist with the fight against ovarian cancer. The evening was hosted by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgie_Parker" rel="nofollow">
         Georgie Parker
        </a>
        , well known in the Australian community, and had a number of comic talents donate their services for free to entertain us all. I must say that, having spent last week here in estimates, it was a fairly fitting way to end the week—to end it with a laugh. You do not get too many laughs in this job.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to place on record a tribute to Ms Tanya Smith, who now lives in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        and was one of the witnesses to appear before the Senate inquiry. Tanya is a woman who suffers from the trauma of gynaecological cancer. She went to enormous lengths to place her very personal journey on the public record in the hope that it would assist not only our deliberations but also women in the future. In addition, she uses her numerous skills and efforts to assist in the fund-raising effort. In fact, Professor Michael Friedlander, who also appeared before the committee and was at the benefit, shared with Senator Moore and me that three weeks ago Ms Smith underwent some major surgery yet again and, whilst in her post-operative phase, she was busy putting the finishing touches to Saturday night’s event—such is her commitment to the need for research to help, she hopes, prevent other women suffering from this incredibly debilitating disease.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I say, the comics that appeared donated their time for free. I particularly want to place on record my thanks for and appreciation of Shelly Silberman’s appearance. She announced at the event that it would be her last comic appearance—which I must say is a great pity, because it was one of the more humorous things I have been fortunate enough to experience for some time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ms Smith supports the work of the Senate committee and the findings of our report. As is known by all in this place, that inquiry was initiated by a network of women involved in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAIN" rel="nofollow">
         GAIN
        </a>
        in Western Australia and by Ms Margaret Heffernan in Victoria. I think it is important that it be brought to the attention of members of this chamber that, since we have tabled our report, GAIN and Ms Heffernan have not let a moment go past. They are now busy emailing their numerous networks of supporters and women in our community informing them that they have now seen the report and fully support all its recommendations and it is now time for action. Therefore, not to let a moment go past, last week I received an email with an attachment, which was a letter from GAIN and Ms Heffernan entitled ‘A call for action! A better future: supporting gynaecological cancer survival, research and diagnosis in Australia’. The letter states:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 19 October 2006 a Senate report entitled “Breaking the Silence: a National Voice for Gynaecological Cancer” was released. This report is the outcome of the first national Government inquiry into the needs of the gynaecological cancer sector which has very high mortality rates and is under funded. By 2011—
       </p>
       <p>
        that is, in five years time—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        it is anticipated that there will be a 14% increase in the number of women diagnosed with a gynaecological cancer. Unless funding is given for these recommendations, the impact on the Australian community will also be worsened by 14%.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In order for the recommendations to be translated into reality, we need the Government to support the recommendations and allocate adequate funding as a matter of priority in women’s health.
       </p>
       <p>
        Before outlining specific steps that women can take, she finishes her plea by saying:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For this to happen—we need you to help us take action.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I say, Ms Smith is doing her bit in organising fundraising. Ms Heffernan and the women of GAIN are doing their bit to ensure that the word gets out and that, unlike many other reports tabled in this place, this report is not allowed to just gather dust, and that its recommendations are implemented.
       </p>
       <p>
        Saturday night’s fundraiser was in support of clinical trials. As I say, its main beneficiary was ANZCOG and over $65,000 was raised on the night. As part of its promotion, ANZCOG went on to say:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There are many unanswered research questions on the impact of new prevention, early detection and treatment strategies for gynaecological cancers. Clinical trials are large long-term undertakings. They remain the best way to identify real improvements in treatment. ANZCOG does not have sufficient resources to carry out all clinical trials that are needed to address and answer all of these important questions. Supporting ANZCOG to run clinical trials ensures that women in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_and_New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         Australia and New Zealand
        </a>
        have access to the best treatments available—
       </p>
       <p>
        a view that I am sure is shared by all in this chamber. So, through the hard work of women like Ms Smith and her friends, Professor Friedlander and his colleagues and the women of GAIN and Ms Heffernan, this chamber and the government are well and truly on notice. It is time to take action.
