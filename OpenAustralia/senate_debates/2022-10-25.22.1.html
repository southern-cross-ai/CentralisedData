        A lot of businesses are finding it hard to get workers. It's not a new thing; it's been an issue in rural areas for years. But we're Aussies, so we find crafty ways to get around the lack of boots on the ground. Australians have long been technical innovators because of worker shortages—we invented mechanical sheep shearing, we were the first nation to scale up mechanically milking cows and we led the field in mechanical crop sowing and harvesting—and that continues today.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last month I had the pleasure of visiting Western Tiers Distillery, where they showcased the technical innovation of two Aussie companies,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAGE" rel="nofollow">
         SAGE
        </a>
        Automation and Kolmark. Working together, they have perfected the art of automated distilling. A process that once would take six or more staff now takes one. They can get on with the business of perfecting their product.
       </p>
       <p>
        But we aren't giving away all our jobs to robots. Tassie boilermakers and welders are making the stills by hand. Tassie engineers are putting together the automated switches, cooling systems, heating systems and pumps. Local farmers are finding a new market for their grains. Local tourists have a new venue to visit, with fabulous food and, of course, the main attraction: gin. The same number of staff are still hired, but they are now arranged more productively—more income for the same headcount. The distillery is highly impressive—shiny copper stills linked by steel pipes and vats all controlled from a central cabinet that can tailor this distillery for different drinks and distilling processes. It's world-class technology, linking the old and the new, being sold all over the world, and it's made in little old Westbury.
       </p>
       <p>
        Aussie innovation in rural areas needs to be supported and celebrated. Innovation isn't just happening in the big mainland cities. It starts with small ideas in small towns from big dreamers.
