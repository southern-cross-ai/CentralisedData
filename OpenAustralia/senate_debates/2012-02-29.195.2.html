        I rise this evening on adjournment to speak about some of the fantastic activities happening in the electorate of Denison supported by the Gillard Labor government.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_George_V" rel="nofollow">
         King George V
        </a>
        Oval—or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KGV" rel="nofollow">
         KGV

        as it is fondly known by Tasmanians—is home to local

         AFL
        </a>
        team, the Glenorchy Magpies.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magpies" rel="nofollow">
         The Magpies
        </a>
        receive a huge amount of support from the local community, with thousands of people braving all kinds of weather to support their team. This is a place that is the hub for the sporting community in Glenorchy. Thanks to the Gillard Labor government, change is afoot and a redevelopment of this important community hub will commence later this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are investing $8.7 million in this important redevelopment which will result in a significant rejuvenation in the municipality of Glenorchy. The redevelopment includes health and wellness centres, including a hydrotherapy pool. It also includes a sports house and upgrades to the Glenorchy District Football Club facilities; a theatrette, a meeting room and training room; function rooms, including bar and bistro; cafe and commercial kitchen; changing rooms; kiosk and public amenities; transport museum shed; refurbished cricket training nets; multipurpose synthetic spots pitch; and a new pedestrian entrance and landscaping.
       </p>
       <p>
        The new KGV precinct will also offer a new home to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migrant_Resource_Centre" rel="nofollow">
         Migrant Resource Centre
        </a>
        . The Migrant Resource Centre is such a key service provider for migrants and refugees in Tasmania that it has outgrown its Hobart premises. Under the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        , Cedric Mannen, and staff, the Migrant Resource Centre is a vibrant place and, with a base in the Glenorchy municipality where many migrants settle, I am sure the influence and value of the Migrant Resource Centre will only increase
       </p>
       <p>
        Importantly, the King George V redevelopment complex will be open to all. I know the community will embrace the opportunity to make use of these first-class facilities. This important redevelopment, made possible thanks to the Gillard Labor government, will add another place for the community to gather, to participate in sport and wellbeing—be it playing, supporting, celebrating or even meeting. I look forward to joining the community at the redeveloped KGV precinct, cheering on the Glenorchy Magpies, as well as seeing the great benefits of the other new facilities that will be open to all ages in Glenorchy's broader community. I thank those members of the community who have worked and lobbied to make this become a reality.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another exciting initiative taking place in the municipality is the Glenorchy on the Go project. This program is run by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenorchy_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Glenorchy City Council
        </a>
        , thanks to a $700,000 grant delivered by the Gillard Labor government under the Healthy Communities Initiative. Glenorchy on the Go is about improving the health and wellbeing of the people of Glenorchy. Glenorchy on the Go is a free program which encourages participants to be physically active, teaches them the importance of maintaining a healthy diet, and how best to go about this through cooking classes, walking groups, sports sessions for those with a disability and the development of community gardens.
       </p>
       <p>
        This program is as much about social interaction as it is about promoting healthy lifestyles. Glenorchy on the Go offers people who may otherwise be isolated within their community an opportunity to seek friendship and improve the quality of their health at the same time. To date, more than 575 people have participated in Glenorchy on the Go programs. Seventy-five per cent of these participants are over the age of 55 and one in seven of them have a disability. Currently Glenorchy on the Go offers 15 walking groups, 10 Heartmoves—a gentle exercise group—and four sessions of sport ability for people with disability. There are also come and try activities such as archery, linedancing and bowls, and chronic health education sessions, which I understand will commence in March. I want to make special mention and commend the work of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
         Heart Foundation
        </a>
        for their involvement in this project as they run the walking groups taking place around the Glenorchy municipality.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was fortunate to attend the launch of Glenorchy on the Go. The community turned out in force. Together we spent about 10 minutes being put through our paces with some fun exercises and interactive movements. It was wonderful to hear the stories of those who have been involved with Glenorchy on the Go since its inception and to hear how people's energy levels have increased. I have also met with program coordinator, Elisa Ryan, and project manager, Len Yeats. Their enthusiasm is boundless. I have no doubt that this program will continue to build momentum and change lives, thanks to the passion of all those involved and the funding they received.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to acknowledge the work and dedication of former senator
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Reynolds" rel="nofollow">
         Margaret Reynolds
        </a>
        , especially in her role as state director of National Disability Services, a post that she has recently moved on from. Margaret is well known in this place, having served as a Labor senator for Queensland from 1983 to 1999. Margaret served as the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Local Government
        </a>
        and also as the Minister assisting the Prime Minister for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_of_Women" rel="nofollow">
         Status of Women
        </a>
        . History shows that Margaret made a valuable contribution during her time in this place and the Senate's loss has been Tasmania's gain as Margaret has now returned to her home state.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the 13 years since Margaret left this place, she has worked on many projects. In
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
         East Timor
        </a>
        , Fiji and Africa she worked to give women an understanding of decision-making at local, national and international levels. In Australia, Margaret engaged with young people, encouraging them to engage with our democracy and to be active and involved with the political process, particularly through
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_Parliament" rel="nofollow">
         Youth Parliament
        </a>
        . Margaret was President of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Association" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations Association
        </a>
        of Australia at a time when the international community were struggling to understand why Australia needed to send what was considered a small number of asylum seekers to isolated detention centres.
       </p>
       <p>
        I had the privilege of serving on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Council" rel="nofollow">
         National Council
        </a>
        for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Association_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations Association of Australia
        </a>
        with Margaret and also at a local level in the Tasmanian branch of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNAA" rel="nofollow">
         UNAA
        </a>
        . I also served under Margaret's chairing of the Tasmanian Women's Council to help improve access and equality for women in Tasmania. Margaret has also written two books. Margaret gave me a copy of her book
        <i>
         The last bastion
        </i>
        for my 30th birthday, now some 10 years ago, before I entered state parliament. It was a great read about the challenges facing women in political life and gave me a good understanding of the challenges which lay ahead for me. I have regarded Margaret as a mentor and a friend. She has certainly inspired me to want to be in this place, and if I can make the kind of contribution she made in this place then I would certainly have achieved a great deal.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2004, Margaret accepted a position with National Disability Services, Australia's peak body representing disability service providers, and she retired from this role just last week. Through hard work, Margaret and her colleagues across Tasmania and Australia put disability services firmly on the political agenda. She began this role at a time when mental institutions were closing in a bid to give intellectually disabled people the opportunity to live in their community, yet little money was directed towards supporting this endeavour. Margaret retires at a time when disability reform is firmly on the government's agenda—with the National Disability Insurance Scheme set to become a reality under the Gillard Labor government.
       </p>
       <p>
        Margaret will continue her contribution to the Australian community as chair of the Australian Centre of Excellence in Local Government. She will also build upon her good work in disability reform as a member of the National People with Disability and Carers Council. I wish Margaret well and thank her very much for what I know will be an ongoing contribution to the Australian community.
