         Depending on the timing of elections and returns to parliament and outcomes, that may be the last charming and engrossing question from Senator Cameron we hear in this place. I think it's important to note that for the record, because we've heard lots of charming and engrossing questions from Senator Cameron over time.
        </p>
        <p>
         It's interesting that he goes to the question of wages growth. We on this side know one thing about wages growth. The difference between us and them is that you have to have a stronger economy to ensure wages growth. The difference—

          I raise a point of order on relevance. I simply asked: can the minister confirm that, in addition to overseeing record low wage growth, the government last night cut forecast wage growth? That's the question. The minister should be drawn to the question.

            I think it would be useful to look at actual budget results in the context of Senator Cameron's question. Unlike those opposite, what our budget results have consistently shown is that we have consistently exceeded expectations and that we are delivering a surplus. That would be foreign territory for those opposite, unless they have memories that go back to 1989. Notwithstanding that, we of course operate on the basis of using conservative forecasts—

                Those opposite might not like to hear about it and they might not like to think about it but we have maintained our path back to surplus on the back of those forecasts and our spending discipline. We want Australians to earn more and to keep more of what they earn. That's what we're delivering: a stronger economy—1.2 million more jobs created by Australian businesses as part of our stronger economy, with wages growth picking up.

                       As I was saying, this strong economy is what will deliver higher wages. Without a strong economy, you cannot deliver higher wages. I understand why this is unfamiliar territory for those opposite, because they don't have the experience in their term of office to have delivered that. And we know, even from the policies they have exposed so far, that they are promising $200 billion in higher taxes.

                            Maybe we can do better this time. Last month the Minister for Finance argued that record-low wage growth was a deliberate design feature of the Australian economy. Is the coalition government's decision to cut wages, and continued failure to do anything to address record-low wage growth, a part of its deliberate design to leave Australian workers worse off?

                             Senator Cameron—consistent to the last—misrepresents government ministers in almost everything he says, and he's just done it again. What the finance minister has made very clear is that the only way to lift wages is a stronger economy built on more jobs and lower taxes. What Senator Cameron is refusing to acknowledge is those men and women who run small businesses, all over Australia, who are living in absolute fear of those opposite being elected and destroying their businesses, destroying the economy, and destroying their future and that of their children.
