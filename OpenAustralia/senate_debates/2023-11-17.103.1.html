        I rise today to thank Raise Our Voice Australia for organising the Raise Our Voice in Parliament campaign. Raise Our Voice's mission is to amplify the voices of young women and gender-diverse people to actively lead conversations in politics and domestic and foreign policy. Today I am very excited to share Emma Eldhose's submission to the campaign. Emma is from

        . I'll read out Emma's words:

       <p class="italic">
        Hi, my name is Emma Eldhose, I'm 13 years old and I live in the Boothby electorate.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Undoubtedly, social media and technology have had an impact on today's society. Self-centredness among people has increased noticeably. In the past, people used to make comments on other individuals or their pictures, to show their appreciation of the person. However, there has a rise of the selfie culture. People are more concerned with their own image and how they show themselves online.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It's important to understand how this habit is changing our way of thinking. Many people, especially those in the younger generation, have the opinion that achieving our own desires is the only true source of happiness. This mindset prioritizes individuals and often overlooks the broader social context.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Let's work to balance our ability to express ourselves and our capacity for empathy. Taking care of our own and others needs is the best way to achieve true happiness. We can build a culture where compassion, kindness, and real human connection flourish by embracing the ideals of connection and responsibility. In addition to improving the lives of others, doing this also helps us discover happiness and meaning in our own lives.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Join me in changing the world for the better. We can build a brighter future together.
