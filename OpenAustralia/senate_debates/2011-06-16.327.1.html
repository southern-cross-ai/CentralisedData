        asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 4 April 2011:

       <p class="italic">
        With reference to the statistical summary of the statement of Australia's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Development" rel="nofollow">
         International Development
        </a>
        Assistance Program 2008-09, published by AusAID in December 2010, which stated that Australia gave, in total, $546,000 in assistance to the production sector in Burma, the production sector being described as including agriculture, forestry and fishing; industry, mining and construction; and trade and tourism:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) To whom was this financial assistance provided and for what purpose.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) What outcomes were achieved as a result of this assistance being provided.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) Was similar financial assistance provided to the production sector in Burma during: (a) the 2009-10 financial year; and (b) the 2010-11 financial year.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) Were any discussions held with AusAID or departmental officials, parliamentarians or other governmental agencies about such financial assistance being in violation of Australia's policy regarding trade and investment in Burma.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (5) Given that AusAID is currently in the process of creating a Burma strategy, expected to be completed by the middle of 2011, and that an interim report was released in December 2010, what process is being used in developing the strategy, particularly in relation to how the policy is being shaped and who is involved in doing this.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (6) Will the policy drafting process be made public and will there be a mechanism or an avenue for the public to engage with this process, such as, by making a submission to AusAID.

         (3) Yes.
        </p>

        <p class="italic">
         (6) Australia's strategic approach to aid in Burma: An interim statement was placed on the AusAID website in December 2010. It outlined Australia's proposed strategy for its aid program to Burma and noted that further consultations with key stakeholders would occur as the final strategy was prepared. Parties with an interest in Burma are welcome to send submissions to AusAID at: infoausaid@ausaid.gov.au.
