        's dismissal of the no voters as racist and stupid. It has been further revealed that, at an event in Brisbane in July this year, she accused no voters of spewing racism. So much for the positive and respectful debate we have been promised by the Prime Minister and

        â€”right. A defining feature of the divisive yes campaign has been the hypocrisy, arrogance and overreach of its leaders like Ms Langton. It is no wonder they are leaking votes to the no side every time they open their mouths.
       </p>
       <p>
        Support for the no vote has grown because more Australians realise that a treaty and the enormous amount of money it will cost them are the real end game. This has been confirmed many times by yes campaign leaders themselves, no matter how many times they deny it. It is too late. If anyone is looking stupid today, it is Marcia Langton and the yes campaign for continuing to deny it. She owes the Australian people a public apology. If you won't be honest with the Australian people about the real aims of the Voice, they have no reason to trust you and every reason to vote no.
       </p>
       <p>
        Marcia Langton has proven herself to be a really nasty piece of work. I call on the government to condemn her insulting comments, kick her out of the yes campaign and ensure this horrid, racist individual will never be part of the Voice should the worst happen and the yes campaign is successful. I call on those people out there who are concerned about handing out 'no' pamphlets. I say, 'Do it,' because, at the end of the day, you might get a little bit of abuse from people like Marcia Langton for an hour or so, but then again, if you don't do it, you're going to cop abuse for the rest of your life. That's what will happen. I say, 'Get out there and hand out the pamphlets,' because it's important to your future and for this nation.
