        It is my pleasure tonight to rise in this adjournment debate to honour a great lady, Kath Nelson. Last Friday hundreds packed
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John's_Cathedral" rel="nofollow">
         St John's Cathedral
        </a>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_City" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        to show their respect and celebrate the life of Kathrine Nelson. Kath was a conscientious advocate for working people. She was also passionate and extremely instrumental in making positive change for those who need it the most. She joined the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Services_Union" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Services Union
        </a>
        in 1993 and worked her way up through the organisation to be elected secretary of both the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASU" rel="nofollow">
         ASU
        </a>
        and QSU in April 2011, the first time the positions had been held by a woman. Kath was also elected the vice-president of the national ASU.
       </p>
       <p>
        Kath was an accomplished industrial relations professional who was widely respected in the union movement, by representatives of employers and by the government. Kath was a pivotal player in many major wins for Queensland workers, including the development of the Queensland Local Government Workforce Transition Code of Practice in 2007 and the South East Queensland Distribution and Retail Water Reform-Workforce Framework in 2009. However, Kath's most notable contribution was her role in the historic social and community services pay equity case in Queensland in 2008. This case delivered a finding which confirmed that Queensland social and community workers performed work which was undervalued because of gender and laid the essential groundwork for the federal pay equity case which was completed in 2012. This outcome was delivered by a Labor government to the credit of many, but Kath in my opinion was at the very lead in ensuring these workers received their just conditions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Kath would settle for nothing less than what those workers deserved. Her tenacity was rewarded, and community sector workers across Australia received higher rates of pay because of her action. Through her leadership, lobbying and negotiation skills, Kath was instrumental in obtaining guarantees from the Gillard government to fund the pay equity increases. As a member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Labor Party
        </a>
        , Kath was compassionate and believed in a fair go for all. She incorporated these values into everything she did.
       </p>
       <p>
        Kath was a member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
         ALP
        </a>
        national executive and the ALP Queensland administrative committee. She was also a member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Council_of_Unions" rel="nofollow">
         Queensland Council of Unions
        </a>
        executive and the QCU management committee. Kath was much loved by those who worked with her and was an inspiring mentor and a treasured friend. At her service last Friday I think the one of the prayers which summed up Kath to a tee was:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There is nothing in the world more irresistibly contagious than Kath's laughter and good humour. We give thanks for her endless laughs we all shared with Kath and never forget the joy these moments brought to our lives.
       </p>
       <p>
        I could not agree more. She would light up a room with her beautiful smile and have you laughing along with her over a joke or comment to lighten the moment.
       </p>
       <p>
        At her funeral, hard men and women shed a tear. People who are known as some of the toughest people in the union movement and the broader industrial relations landscape were moved when they contemplated the commitment, contribution and compassion that Kath brought to industrial relations in Queensland. She will be missed by all in the labour movement.
       </p>
       <p>
        Kath was 43 years old, and for the last 10 months she battled leukaemia. She was far too young to leave this world. Amazingly, Kath remained committed to organising, even when receiving treatment. She spoke to the doctors and nurses who cared for her about their need to be in the union and the importance of electing a state government that would support public services such as the public health system. She was organising, recruiting and advocating right to the end. Our love and condolences are with her entire family, especially her partner, Brett, and son, Spencer.
