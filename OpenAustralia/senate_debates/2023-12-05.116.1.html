Can the minister please explain the government's position on providing this military equipment to Israel?

         Thank you to Senator Shoebridge for the question. The advice I have is what the government has already made clear—that Australia has not supplied weapons to Israel since the conflict began and for at least the past five years. Australia has a stringent export control framework which ensures military and dual-use items are used responsibly outside of Australia in ways which do not violate human rights. I'm advised that Defence undertakes a rigorous assessment of each export application.
        </p>
        <p>
         I know, in relation to these issues, the senator has asked a number of questions. I'm advised that some of the reports deal with data that is collected by the Australian Border Force and compiled by the ABS. This data is based on information provided by companies about the type and estimated value of goods.

                 Well, if I can add something else, I will. I would make the point that I am seeking to answer the question by looking to the legal framework which applies to the relevant export. I would have thought that's entirely relevant, Senator Shoebridge. I know you may not like it, but it is relevant. And, with respect, as to 'a putative future bill': this is a bill that has been introduced. It reflects the government's desire or intention to strengthen our export controls framework and ensure that the Defence Trade Controls Act 2012 remains effective, efficient and fit for purpose. I again reiterate the indication I have made earlier, as has the Deputy Prime Minister, in relation to the supply of these weapons.

                   <p>
                    Senator—through you, President—I have answered the question and I've said:
                   </p>
                   <p class="italic">
                    Australia has not supplied weapons to Israel since the conflict began and for at least the past five years.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Then I have gone to the export control framework which is in existence and government plans to strengthen that framework. That is entirely relevant to the question the senator is asking. I know there's a lot of disinformation and misinformation circulating on social media and elsewhere about this issue, and I would encourage the senator to make sure that he does not contribute to that.

Can you please explain how the government can export millions of dollars worth of arms and ammunition to Israel while you also claim to be sending no weapons to Israel?

                       It is really very irresponsible of a senator to suggest that a government department is engaging in misinformation and disinformation at this time. It really is irresponsible of you in this place to do that.

                      <p>
                       You can disagree, but you know the way in which misinformation and disinformation is used in our society, particularly at this time, and you have a responsibility to use your platform in a more responsible way than you do, Senator Shoebridge. I know that politics is a hard game, but, really, you should use your platform a little more responsibly. I responded on that issue in my primary answer, where I explained—
