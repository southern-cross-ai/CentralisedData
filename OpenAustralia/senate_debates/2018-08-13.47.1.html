         I thank Senator Brockman for the question. Yes, I can. The economy created 50,900 jobs in June this year. The good news for the Australian people is that 40,000 of these jobs were actually full-time jobs. The figures show that the coalition's plan for a stronger economy is working. Thanks to the policies of the Turnbull government, we are seeing more Australians in jobs than ever before. In fact, since we were elected in 2013 we have seen the economy create in excess now of one million jobs. Total employment in Australia is at a record high of more than 12½ million. This includes a record number of 8½ million full-time jobs. Why is this occurring? It's occurring because those of us on this side of the chamber understand that you need to put in place the right set of policies that are going to enable businesses in Australia, in particular small and medium businesses, to prosper and grow. That's why we've delivered tax cuts to individuals. That's why we'll deliver tax cuts to businesses. That's why we're making record investment in infrastructure. That's why we're signing free trade agreements. That's why we're supporting innovation and science. In the last 12 months alone 339,000 jobs have been created and 95,200 of these jobs went to young Australians. This is actually the strongest jobs growth for young Australians in around 30 years. You put in place the right economic policies to stimulate business, and it will prosper and grow and create jobs.

            . We visited a great local business, Thermo King West. Thermo King West currently employs 23 employees. They're also looking to grow their workforce. They're also very proud to tell us that they've taken on two apprentices. The owner, Mr Steve Da Rui, told us that his business had benefitted from the Turnbull government's tax cuts for small and medium businesses. Colleagues, what did this business owner do with this tax relief? He reinvested it straight back into his business, and it helped contribute towards the fantastic new premises that we were standing in. He's also received a $20,000 grant from the government's
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurs'_Program" rel="nofollow">

            . As a result of this grant, he managed to increase his number of employees by 10 per cent and grow his revenue base by 10 per cent. If you support businesses, they will prosper and grow.

               The evidence is there and the commitments have been made. The biggest risk to Australian jobs is Mr Bill Shorten and the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
                Australian Labor Party
               </a>
               . It is a fact that Labor and Mr Shorten have openly declared war on business and, in declaring war on business, on job creation in Australia. Why do we know this? Because, as an election commitment they have promised to increase taxes on small and medium businesses, if they are elected to office. Colleagues, that's 940,000 businesses with a turnover of under $50 million that will actually have their tax rate increased under a Shorten Labor government. Those businesses, like Thermo King West that I visited last week, employ 4.8 million people in Australia. We want to see those businesses incentivised to prosper and grow. Those on the other side are a risk to those businesses.
