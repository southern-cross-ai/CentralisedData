        My question is to Senator McKenzie, representing the Minister for Health. When does the government intend to respond to important Senate health inquiries? One example is the report of the inquiry into the value and affordability of private health insurance and out-of-pocket medical costs, an inquiry initiated by Centre Alliance. The report was tabled back in last December.

         I thank Senator Griff for his question. The government will be responding in due course to the Senate reports as they were tabled. But, in terms of the value and affordability of private health insurance and out-of-pocket medical costs, I'd like to assure Senator Griff that, when it comes to one of the terms of reference—i. the current government incentives for private health—I'm really happy, in the time that I have available, to run the senator through the significant reforms we as a government have already undertaken in this regard.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have been committed to making private health insurance more affordable for the more than 13 million Australian families, younger people and older Australians who need it. The change in premium that has been announced in recent times is the lowest in 17 years. We know that every dollar matters. We discounted hospital premiums by up to 10 per cent, which younger Australians will benefit from. They'll be able to keep those discounts until they turn 40, and that could mean savings of $200 a year on a $2,000 policy. We're providing greater access to mental health services by allowing people to upgrade their cover and ensuring they no longer have to wait for up to months to access mental health services.
        </p>
        <p>
         People in rural and regional Australia will now be able to access travel and accommodation benefits if they're forced to travel for treatment under their private health insurance, and we're making private health insurance simpler by requiring insurers to categorise products as gold, silver, bronze or basic. In the package, we've also announced flexibility for people to increase their maximum excess to assist in the reduction of their overall insurance premium. We're going to continue to support affordable health insurance via a private health insurance rebate, which is currently worth $6 billion a year.

           Minister, 'in due course' is not in accordance with the agreement to respond within three months. I'd like to ask that question for another inquiry, the inquiry into the funding for research into cancers with low survival rates. This inquiry took place even earlier and its report was tabled in November last year. When do you anticipate that you'll be providing a response to that inquiry?

            I'm advised by Minister Hunt, the responsible minister, that that government response will be handed down in due course. But I'm very happy to speak on the medical research investment that our government is making. On 24 June we will invest $23 million in our world-class researchers to continue the fight against rare cancers and rare diseases.

            I know you're laughing, Senator Griff, but that's actually what your Senate inquiry was about. Although we've seen increased survival rates for some cancers, such as breast cancer and bowel cancer, survival rates for rare cancers, such as brain cancer and ovarian cancer, have remained relatively unchanged for some time, as you know. It's a tragedy that rare cancers were estimated to have caused nearly 40 per cent of total cancer deaths in 2017. This funding will create opportunities to address the devastating survival rates associated with some of our cruellest cancers and diseases.

              Minister, I certainly was not laughing at the topic; I was very much laughing at the response of 'due course'. Will the government commit to tabling its responses to both of those reports before sitting resumes in August or, at the very least, within the first sitting week in August?
