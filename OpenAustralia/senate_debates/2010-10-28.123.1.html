Is the government aware of the research published by Newcastle university’s school of medicine that found that the incidents of assaults in Newcastle plummeted by 37 per cent over an 18-month period from the restrictions of the sale of alcohol in the early hours of the morning? Has the issue of time restrictions on the sale of alcohol been discussed at

          Senator Fielding
         </a>
         for his question. I understand it is in two parts. The first part relates to the troubling issue of what states and territories have to deal with in terms of excessive consumption of alcohol and the resultant problems that creates, both for the policing and the hospital admissions that occur as a result of that, particularly in the Newcastle area. The second part relates to closing hours, which, as I understand it, is a matter that the states and territories deal with. Senator Fielding seems to be inter-relating those two questions to be able to provide a base for a position that is being put about the health effects of excessive consumption of alcohol.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Gillard Labor government has been addressing the substantive issues around the primary matter dealing specifically with health in relation to the effects of alcoholism, including the work that we have done around health and hospital funds and being able to provide additional work for the hospital system. But in terms of the specifics of the question, I will take it on notice. I will see if Minister Roxon can add to the answer and whether or not we can provide any additional information to Senator Fielding. I would add, though, that I think it relates more to the trading hours of particular establishments. It is a matter that I may not be able to ask the minister to provide additional information on. Nonetheless, I will see what the minister can respond to from the question asked by Senator Fielding.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Given that restricting the sale of alcohol in the early hours of the morning is a strategy that has proven to be successful, will the government commit to using the federal corporations powers to restrict the sale of takeaway alcohol in the early hours of the morning, similar to what is being proposed in the

           for his question. I did understand correctly that the primary question did go substantively to the issue of closing and opening hours for hotels and other establishments which retail or sell liquor. One of the difficulties with that—though it does appear now that it has been clarified by Senator Fielding in the supplementary question—is it goes far more to state and territory laws and it seems to go within the broad area that they have responsibility for.

            , I rise on a point of order. The question was focused on federal corporations powers, which is quite clearly a federal issue, not a state issue. The minister would be aware that the government can use federal corporations powers to restrict the sale of alcohol.

              Senator Fielding
             </a>
             . He is trying to be helpful. He is trying to address the issues, and was directly relevant to the question asked. Mr President, we have had a succession of points of orders today. People are misusing that mechanism of the Senate by taking frivolous points of order and effectively wanting to argue the case. Mr President, as you know, the time for that is during taking note of answers. I ask you to rule that there is no point of order. But I do draw your attention to the fact that this has become habitual behaviour that totally disrupts question time.
