        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Farrell. Your government has today admitted that over 140 detainees, including paedophiles, rapists, murderers and a contract killer, have been released into the Australian community following the recent High Court decision. How many more detainees does the government expect to release before Christmas?

           I'll give credit where credit's due. It's so infrequent, Senator Cash, that it's worth observing. But the government has responded very quickly to the issues that have arisen as a result of the decision of the High Court last week. We have done this in a very quick and prompt fashion. I have to—

            It's a point of order in relation to relevance. The question was in relation to how many you intend in releasing in the lead-up to Christmas.

             And there were a few sentences before then that went to how many had been released, and that's the part the minister's responding to, but I'll continue to listen carefully. If the whole question isn't addressed, I'll draw that to the minister's attention.

              As I said, I did acknowledge that 141 people have been released. Of course, the actions of the government in seeking to address the failures of the legislative program under the former government will hopefully lead to a situation where we can properly address this situation. We've introduced strong laws designed to protect the Australian community, and of course, as we've heard today, the minister has boosted funding for the
