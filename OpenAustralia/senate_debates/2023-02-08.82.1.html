        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Wong. The situation in Turkiye and also in Syria continues to deteriorate. What else will the government do to assist those in affected areas?

         Thank you, Senator Sheldon, for the question. I know I speak for all in this chamber when I say that we have been watching the heartbreaking scenes from Turkiye and Syria with horror.
        </p>
        <p>
         Yesterday, as I indicated to the chamber, the Prime Minister announced an initial commitment of $10 million in humanitarian aid to support the people affected. I'm also pleased to announce that earlier today, following advice from my department, I agreed to activate an AUSASSISTPLAN to deploy an urban search-and-rescue team of up to 72 personnel to Turkiye to assist local authorities. Our National Emergency Management Agency,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEMA" rel="nofollow">
          NEMA
         </a>
         , is now conducting an urgent assessment to ensure the safety of Australian personnel. NEMA is working closely with Fire and Rescue
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
          NSW
         </a>
         , the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
         </a>
         , and the ADF to coordinate the deployment as soon as possible. These are urban search-and-rescue specialists, highly trained to locate, deliver medical assistance to, and remove victims who've been trapped or impacted by a structural collapse.
        </p>
        <p>
         These are extremely difficult times. I think all of us have been horrified by the scenes of devastation and the stories of human tragedy that we're witnessing. There is also so much heroism and compassion for one's fellow man, woman and child that is on display in these areas, which have already been so devastated in many cases. If we are able to assist, notwithstanding that we are a long way away, I'm sure all of us would want the government to support our personnel to engage in such assistance.

            I know that this is distressing, not only to all Australians but particularly to members of the Turkish-Australian and Syrian communities, particularly to those with loved ones in the areas. I thought Senator Birmingham's contribution yesterday, where he spoke about their experience, was very moving.

            Australian diplomatic missions in Ankara, Beirut and Istanbul are working closely with local authorities to ascertain the welfare of our citizens. The

            is providing consular assistance, including to the families of four Australians who were in the region at the time of the earthquake and, I regret to say, at this stage remain unaccounted for. Obviously, their safety is our immediate priority, and consular officials in Ankara are working with local authorities and others on the ground to assist them. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is working to provide consular assistance to around 40 other Australians and their families who were in the earthquake area.
