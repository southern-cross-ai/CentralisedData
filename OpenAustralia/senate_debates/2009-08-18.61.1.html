        My question is to the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator Carr. Can the minister please inform the Senate of the progress of

         National Science Week

        and its contribution to science communication in Australia? What is the scale of the festival and what level of Commonwealth support does it enjoy? How is the Commonwealth funding used and why is the Australian government making science awareness a priority? How does the government’s support for National Science Week relate to its science initiatives and its broader strategy to modernise the Australian economy and achieve better social and environmental outcomes by investing in science?

         I thank the senator for her question.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Science_Week" rel="nofollow">
          National Science Week
         </a>
         is a celebration of the contribution that science makes to the community and the contribution the community makes to science. This year’s festival boasts some 800 events and is expected to attract over one million participants right across the country. The Australian government is proud to be investing $1.2 million in National Science Week this year. That money is being used to support strategic events around the country, the work of state and territory coordinating committees in developing programs and school based activities through the Australian Science Teachers Association. It is essential that we build an awareness and acceptance of science if we want to make Australia more productive and more prosperous. However, I would have thought that in recent days, given the debate I have heard in this chamber, there was a complete antipathy to the principles of scientific inquiry on the other side. We will need a scientifically literate citizenry who can make informed decisions about scientific questions and make effective use of technologies and scientific outputs, a citizenry who are ready to support scientific endeavour. It is a pity we could not get the Liberal Party to be more engaged on these questions.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Australian government demonstrated its support for science in the May budget, which included $1.1 billion for a new Super Science initiative and an extra $703 million for university research, much of which will support work in scientific disciplines. The Super Science initiative will concentrate on Australia’s strength in space science and astronomy and in marine and climate science.

           , I ask a supplementary question. Can the minister inform the Senate what other measures the government is taking to increase community awareness of science, including through the Super Science initiative? How does Questacon, Australia’s National Science and Technology Centre, fit into the government’s science communication strategy? What initiatives has the government taken to raise awareness of specific branches of science including space science and astronomy and marine and climate science? What further action is the government taking in the field of science education?

              It is an unfortunate fact that we have heard in recent days a denial of scientific principles in the allegations made by those opposite about the issues of climate change. There is a fundamentalist objection to the principles of science. This government has sought an inquiry based approach to the teaching of science and renewable energy in years 9 and 10 in schools. We have heard nothing in terms of support from the other side. The Super Science initiatives that we have proposed include an extra $11.3 million for Questacon, new support for space education and marine and climate science components.
