       <p>
        This evening I want to pay tribute to the late Italo Mazzola. On 6 November the Italian-Australian community in Wollongong gathered to say goodbye to our friend Italo Mazzola. After some very moving words by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luca_Ferrari" rel="nofollow">
         Luca Ferrari
        </a>
        , the Italian vice-consul, who paid tribute to Italo and his involvement in the community, I was able to say some words about Italo and his great contribution to Australia multicultural life in Wollongong and generally.
       </p>
       <p>
        Italo was born on 9 September 1930 in Castelfidardo, in the province of Ancona, in Italy. He migrated to Australia in 1949 at the young age of 19 years, leaving Italy as soon as he finished his liceo classico. As soon as Italo arrived in Australia, like most immigrants he began working in the steelworks at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Kembla" rel="nofollow">
         Port Kembla
        </a>
        . Italo continued his studies here in Australia and completed a bachelor's degree in literature. Italo had ambitions from a young age to open his own business and was granted a loan from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Bank" rel="nofollow">
         Commonwealth Bank
        </a>
        to purchase his first mixed business in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addison_Avenue" rel="nofollow">
         Addison Avenue
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Illawarra" rel="nofollow">
         Lake Illawarra
        </a>
        . Italo repaid his debt to the bank in just one year, and this was the beginning of an entrepreneurial career. It was the first of his many business ventures.
       </p>
       <p>
        I first met Italo in the early 1980s when I became assistant secretary for the fledgling
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Polo" rel="nofollow">
         Marco Polo
        </a>
        Association. Our dream was to build a nursing home in the Illawarra for our elderly Italians. I joined the committee and went on to be one of the founding board members of the joint venture between the Italian community and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniting_Church" rel="nofollow">
         Uniting Church
        </a>
        . There were eight founding board directors—four from Marco Polo, including Italo and myself, Turo Chiodo and Wally Boscoscuro, and four from the Uniting Church. It was indeed fitting that Italo passed away at the nursing home that he worked so hard to establish.
       </p>
       <p>
        Italo committed his life to community service across many different activities. In June 2012 he was made a Member in the General Division of the Order of Australia in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Birthday_Honours" rel="nofollow">
         Queen's Birthday Honours

        list. I would like to share the citation with you.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

        through direct donations and the Catholic Diocese of Wollongong through contributions to various parishes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Indeed, the citation only really reflected a small part of what Italo had achieved over his many years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Italo's heart was always with the Federation of the Marchigianni of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        , which he founded. This group enabled the Italian community from the Marche region of Italy to connect with their region and, at times, permitted them to return to Italy to promote their region here in Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Italo and the association sponsored many activities, including a performance at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Spirit_College" rel="nofollow">
         Holy Spirit College
        </a>
        , where Year 10 students were treated to classical music produced by a leading Italian classical guitarist, who himself had been a graduate of the Conservatorium of Music of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Cecilia" rel="nofollow">
         Santa Cecilia
        </a>
        in Rome. Italo, through sponsorships, assisted in so many different ways. He was also involved with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Wollongong" rel="nofollow">
         University of Wollongong
        </a>
        Alumni Campus Chapter. The hardworking volunteers operate the Alumni Bookshop to raise money for scholarships and prizes for University of Wollongong students. Italo was also involved with Multicultural Aged Care Illawarra, St Vincent de Paul and, of course, the Marco Polo retirement village.
       </p>
       <p>
        He was a very generous man who used his wealth to assist many different causes, often seeking little or no recognition. On 19 April 2008 the statue of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_John_Paul" rel="nofollow">
         Pope John Paul
        </a>
        , which was donated to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mary's_Cathedral" rel="nofollow">
         St Mary's Cathedral
        </a>
        by the Italian-Australian community and donors in 2006, the year of the 23rd
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Youth_Day" rel="nofollow">
         World Youth Day
        </a>
        , was dedicated. The inscription on the plaque acknowledges the generous donors, led by Italo Mazzola. Italo donated regularly to help with its maintenance. It was a testament to his strong faith and Christian beliefs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Italo supported the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamma_Lena" rel="nofollow">
         Mamma Lena
        </a>
        &amp; Dino Gustin Foundation, for which he was awarded a Heart of Mamma Lena medal for his tireless work in assisting the Italian community in Wollongong. He was involved with Dame Missionarie della Consolata. Thanks to Italo, they were able to build a school for 300 children and build an aqueduct to supply fresh water, in Mokululu, in Kenya. In addition to sponsoring many Italian not-for-profit organisations in Sydney and the Illawarra, Italo sponsored three children from Africa in the hope of giving them a better life.
       </p>
       <p>
        Italo was also a longstanding member of the Liberal Party. He had been a member of the New South Wales Italian Special Branch for 33 years. The branch is one of the oldest in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales_Division_of_the_Liberal_Party" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales Division of the Liberal Party
        </a>
        . During this time, he held various positions over many years, including as its president, treasurer and secretary. He was also a delegate to our state council for many years, travelling to Sydney and other parts of New South Wales for meetings. In short, he was the mainstay of the branch for many years.
       </p>
       <p>
        I joined the Liberal Party in the early 1990s and have been a member of the Italian Special Branch since that time. Italo was always ready and willing to undertake whatever tasks were required. He could always be relied upon to do what was asked of him. Italo was not just one of my strongest supporters, he was a friend to me and my family.
       </p>
       <p>
        Italo will be remembered by many for his generosity and willingness to always lend a supporting hand. He was a man whose legacy will be remembered for many years. The death of his sister
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Pia" rel="nofollow">
         Maria Pia
        </a>
        , only weeks ago, was a bitter blow and one from which he did not recover. I visited him on the afternoon he passed away. Indeed, I was one of the last people to see him alive. I spoke to him. He opened his eyes and I do hope that he recognised me. I was so glad I was able to say goodbye to him and to thank him for all his support of me over so many years. I am sure that God will reward him in heaven for his generosity and good deeds on earth.
       </p>
       <p>
        He had his close friends and carers, Stella, Mario and Sofia. Italo was like family to them and he will be very much missed by them. The Mazzola family was represented by his nephew, Nino Mazzola, who had travelled from Italy and who, unfortunately, had to face two very sad trips in a few weeks as a consequence of the loss of both his aunt and his uncle. Italo travelled to Italy frequently, and he will now travel to Italy for his last journey. I am sure that God will accompany him.
       </p>
       <p>
        Italo will be remembered by many people, both here and in Italy, who I am sure thank God very much for his friendship and having known Italo. Vale, Italo Mazzola AM.
