        We know that there are people doing it tough now with the cost-of-living pressures, and those challenges have been with us for way too long over many years. Contrary to the Liberals and Nationals, who have voted against cost-of-living relief at every opportunity, on 1 July more of Labor's cost-of-living plans will come into effect. Firstly, every single Australian will benefit from Labor's tax cuts. The Deputy Leader of the Liberals,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sussan_Ley" rel="nofollow">
         Sussan Ley
        </a>
        , said she wants to scrap them. Secondly, 2.6 million low-paid workers will get their third consecutive pay increase under this government: $110 extra per week in total. Of course, those increases have been supported by Labor and opposed by the Liberals and Nationals at every single turn. Thirdly, 10 million households will receive $300 off their energy bills. While we're providing $300 in direct energy bill relief, the Leader of the Opposition,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Dutton" rel="nofollow">
         Peter Dutton
        </a>
        , wants to impose a $600 billion nuclear tax on every Australian. Fourthly, we're continuing to freeze the cost of critical medicines for every Australian, because we're committed to strengthening Medicare and dealing with cost-of-living medicine costs, unlike Mr Dutton, who as health minister tried to kill bulk-billing and introduce a

        </a>
        tax.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is much more we're doing on 1 July. Your superannuation guarantee is increasing, after years of freezes by the Liberals and Nationals. There are two more weeks of paid parental leave, and more funding for housing, health care and fee-free

        . Labor's plan is providing cost-of-living support while putting downward pressure on inflation.
