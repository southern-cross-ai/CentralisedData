         subprime loans crisis continues, unfortunately, and it continues to impact on the global financial system and exposed US financial institutions. Some have come under a significant stress and a number have collapsed, with significant consequences. The events illustrate what can happen when there is poor regulation and supervision of financial institutions and their lending practices. The base cause of the crisis in the United States was the massive distribution and effectively mis-selling of mortgage products to millions of Americans. In turn these mortgage products were packaged into various securities and passed on through the financial systems of primarily the United States and Europe and, unfortunately, they were given

But, of course, the Australian economy and the financial markets have not been immune—

           I am going to get to super funds in a moment, Senator Coonan. However, the Australian economy is not immune from these impacts. It is fair to say, however, that we are in a stronger position than most other countries to weather the storm. The share markets have fallen significantly in almost every advanced economy around the world as a consequence, and consumer confidence in advanced economies has fallen. But I will emphasise that we have a well-regulated financial sector, with the prices of commodity exports remaining high and businesses investing in the future with confidence.
          </p>
          <p>
           There is one major area, however, where we can have control of our own destiny, and that is the budget surplus. It was very disappointing to see yesterday that the new leader, Mr Turnbull, is determined to carry on the budget-wrecking approach of the former leader by reducing the budget surplus by some $20 billion. We need a strong buffer in these uncertain turbulent times. A significant budget surplus is required and all the Liberal Party opposite can do in the face of these financial disasters in the United States is to tinker with, reduce and wreck the budget surplus by $20 billion.

               I might say that this is not the first time this has happened. Apparently Senator Coonan via her interjection believes it is the first time this has happened. It actually happened in 2001, Senator Coonan, when you were Assistant Treasurer, but we did not hear very much from you about it then. So superannuation funds have been affected adversely by these impacts. The average negative rate of return was 6.4 per cent for the last financial year. What is important, of course, is that Australians overwhelmingly do not access their superannuation at a single point in time; it is a long-term saving. The most important rate of return to focus on is the five- to seven-year rate at least, if not longer. What we do know about the Australian superannuation system is that it is robust, it is strong, and it is well diversified and well regulated.
