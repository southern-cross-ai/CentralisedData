        My question is to the Minister for Defence, Senator Faulkner. Given the minister’s obsession with transparency and public accountability and given that it is now five months since the explosion on

         I thank Senator Ferguson for his question and I certainly note that there has been some press comment about this issue in the last few days drawing comparisons between my position on

           I have not, and I can assure the Senate that I will not, put a short-term political fix or my own personal interests above the critical importance of ensuring proper legal processes. That approach, I can say, is in fact the lesson of ‘children overboard’.
          </p>
          <p>
           The facts of this matter are these. I have made clear that at the earliest possible opportunity I will direct the release of the Defence report and the complete photographic and video record of this incident, and I reiterate that commitment in the Senate chamber today. It has not been appropriate for this material to be released before now. In April Defence explicitly agreed with the

               Yes, I am in the process of doing so. What I will do, because of the constraints placed by you, Senator Ferguson, on answers by ministers to important questions like the one that you have just asked, is ensure that, after question time, I take the opportunity to fully report to the Senate on this matter. I want to inform the Senate that, in response to

                CDF
               </a>
               ’s contact, the coroner advised that, although a decision on the release of the material was a matter for defence, his preference was that the material not be released before the start of the inquest. I then sought legal advice on this issue. I will, after question time, report to the Senate on the advice I have received today.
