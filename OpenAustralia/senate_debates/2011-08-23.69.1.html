        I also have a question for the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator Carr. Given the magnitude of the structural shifts in Australia's economy, can the minister inform the Senate of what action the government is taking to help manu­facturers manage this change?

         I thank Senator Marshall for providing me with the opportunity to cast some light on some very dark corners over there. We have some real knuckle-draggers out here today; we have some people who refuse to face up to the challenges of the 21st century. They believe that a 45 per cent increase in the price of the dollar has no impact on business operations and exports. This government is providing assistance to industry so it is able to be more competitive, so it is able to be more productive, so it is able to be more sustainable.
        </p>
        <p>
         Whether it be through our industry programs such as the $800 million Clean Technology Investment Program, a program those opposite oppose, or whether it be through Enterprise Connect, a program those opposite want to cut, or whether it be through Commercialisation Australia, another program the coalition want to cut, or whether it be through the Buy Australia campaign, a program those opposite refuse to support, or whether it be through the training packages or the modernisation of our telec­ommunications system, a modernisation the coalition also opposes, or whether it be through the long list of measures including the investment support that we are providing for business, which those opposite also oppose, we are in the business of working with manufacturers and all the exporters across this country to ensure that we are able to meet the challenges of the 21st century.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our financial commitments are demonstrated by the 43 per cent increase in support for science, research and innovation that has occurred under this government. This is part of an international consensus that is developing where we know the importance of putting our universities and our science agencies at the front line of the transformation of our major businesses. Take, for instance, our industrial PhD programs, our Researchers in Business program and the major reform of the R&amp;D incentives system which has been passed by the Senate today—

             (Victoria—) (): Manufacturing jobs actually matter to this government, just as they matter to the families of a better part of a million Australians. This is not the time to be playing political stunts at the expense of workers or to be seeking to take advantage of workers who are facing job losses. It is a time to provide confidence and support and to assure workers that we are able to manage this period of adjustment. That is how we were able to weather the global economic crisis and why we find that this economy is in much better shape than just about anywhere else in the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
              OECD
             </a>
             . If we had listened to the coalition, if we had listened to Senator Abetz, there would be 200,000 fewer workers because not only did the coalition oppose our spending measures but even today, on the third reading of the R&amp;D tax bill, they sought a division to demonstrate their opposition, to demonstrate their hostility, to modernisation.

               I can. My department has recently released the 2011
               <i>
                Australian innovation systems report
               </i>
               . I urge the opposition to read this report—those who can read—because it will provide clear evidence of why spending cuts which the opposition has been proposing would not work and would seriously undermine confidence in the major new investments that we need. There are some 200 examples in the compendium to that report of Australians working together to capitalise on new technologies, new processes and new markets. It is a dark corner over there—apart from Senator Mason, who I do know can read and write—
