        My question is again to the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis. I again refer to the email from Mr Greg Burton to Mr Dyson Heydon dated 12 June 2015, which includes the subject matter '
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">

It would be entirely inappropriate for me to comment on the fate of a foreshadowed application, and I would counsel Senator Wong that it would be inappropriate for her to do so as well.

             I will let Mr Heydon's words stand for themselves. But I can tell you, Senator Wong, that Mr Heydon is a person of utterly unimpeachable personal integrity. He is one of Australia's most eminent jurists, he is an honourable man, a punctiliously honest man, and the slurs that have been cast upon his reputation by you and by others of your frontbench—including, shamefully, the shadow Attorney-General—are disgraceful.

               I thought you were a lawyer, Senator Wong. You should know better than that. A government does not demand the resignation of a person appointed under letters patent by the Governor-General. Were the government to do that, that would be a crime under the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">

               —not, by the way, presently a party before the proceedings—to ask the royal commissioner to stand aside on the ground of apprehended bias. Were it to be brought, and I might say that Mr Newlinds indicated before lunch that he does not yet have instructions to bring such an application, it would be dealt with by the royal commissioner in the appropriate way.
