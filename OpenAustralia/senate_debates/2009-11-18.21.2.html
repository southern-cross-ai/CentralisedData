        My question is—surprise!—to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Evans. I refer to the special deal offered by the Rudd Labor government to bribe asylum seekers off the

           and therefore I will give her the same answer. The answer is that there is no special deal. What there is is an arrangement between us and the Indonesian government, which was codified and presented to those on board, as to what would happen to those on board under those arrangements between the two governments for their processing. We rejected the demand of those on board the
           <i>

           </i>
           that they be taken to Australia. We rejected that. They sought to have themselves taken to
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island" rel="nofollow">
            Christmas Island
           </a>
           . We rejected that.
          </p>
          <p>
           There are only two special deals that I have heard of. One was proposed by the opposition spokesperson,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharman_Stone" rel="nofollow">
            Sharman Stone
           </a>
           , who suggested that they ought to get special treatment and they ought to be processed on the boat. She was quoted as saying that there comes a point in time when you can very humanely bring the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
            UN
           </a>
           ’s refugee agency, the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNHCR" rel="nofollow">
            UNHCR
           </a>
           , on board. For heaven’s sake—let them assess on board whether the people are legitimate or not! So the only special deal proposed is that proposed by the opposition. We insisted that they come ashore before they were processed. The other special deal was that offered by the Liberal Premier of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            Western Australia
           </a>
           , who suggested that they be brought straight to Australia. So the only ones calling for a special deal are in fact the opposition. We negotiated with the Indonesian government the arrangements that would apply when those on board disembarked in Indonesia. We insisted on them disembarking there. We are hopeful that they all will. Once they disembark there they will have the normal UNHCR assessment processes apply to them in the timeframes agreed between us and the Indonesian government.

            of 17 November 2009, which stated:

            Sri Lankans are being quarantined from other detainees in the Australian-funded detention centre in

           <p>
            amongst other asylum seekers. Is the government aware that there has been so much concern about the special deal given to those on the

            </i>

              have been housed in a separate section of the detention centre to the other detainees. That is a decision of the Indonesian government. These people have been detained by them in an Indonesian facility under Indonesian law. I make the point in passing that we do the same thing when we disembark a group at

                , although their spokesperson has suggested special treatment. The alternatives were to bring them to Australia or take them to Indonesia. If your criticism is that we should have brought them to Australia, say so. But I suspect you would support the decision that we took to take them to Indonesia.
