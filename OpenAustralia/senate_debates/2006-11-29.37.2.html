        My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Attorney-General. Is the minister aware of reports that Mr Ruhel Ahmed, a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Muslim" rel="nofollow">
         British Muslim
        </a>
        whose story has been told in the movie
        <i>
         Road to Guantanamo
        </i>
        , has been banned from entering Australia due to an adverse security ruling by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">

        ? Is the minister aware that Mr Ahmed has apparently been given visas to Denmark, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Kosovo, Turkey, Spain and

         South Africa

        ? Can the minister explain to the Senate now exactly why Mr Ruhel Ahmed has been refused entry into Australia?

         I am aware that the

          UK

         national intending to travel to Australia following a prejudicial security assessment by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
          ASIO
         </a>
         . ASIO makes security assessments independently on the basis of all information available at the time and in accordance with the provisions and requirements of part 4 of the ASIO Act. Publicly available and classified information about the nature and type of an applicant’s activities may be used to make assessments. Owing to the confidential nature of these security assessments, it would be inappropriate for me to comment on individual cases or specific information that underpins assessments. Any person who believes ASIO has acted inappropriately may make a complaint to the Office of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. Other than that, I can make no further comment.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for his answer. I ask the minister to ensure that the government will provide to Mr Ahmed the reasons for the rejection of his visa application. I understand that he has been deemed a risk, indirectly or directly, to the security of this nation as per section 4 of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
           ASIO
          </a>
          Act, which defines security as: protecting people from espionage, sabotage, politically motivated violence, attacks on Australia’s defence system, the promotion of communal violence and acts of foreign interference. I think Australians and people around the world want to know exactly which of these criteria Mr Ahmed meets in terms of ASIO’s assessment of him. Given other countries have allowed this man to go to their countries to promote a movie, why is Australia standing in his way?

           Assessment by other countries in relation to their own domestic matters is a matter for those countries. As I have said previously, I cannot comment on aspects of a specific case, especially in relation to information that underpins the assessments that are made.
