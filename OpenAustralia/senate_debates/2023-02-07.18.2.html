        Over the break I had the pleasure of meeting with Aisha and Steven from the Western Australia Justice Association. WAJA are university students studying across a range of academic fields with a shared passion for social justice. They're currently focusing on exploring ways to prevent young people coming into contact with the criminal justice system through early intervention and community based support programs. To see West Aussies taking the initiative to meaningfully collaborate with community groups, not-for-profit organisations and the legal sector in such a professional way, all whilst balancing their studies and work, gives me so much hope for the future of leadership in this country. The reports their work generate can make a significant contribution to shaping a system where promoting rehabilitation is a priority and imprisonment is a last resort. Groups like WAJA deserve a seat at the table when these issues are being discussed, and under this government they will get one.

        As someone who has decided to get involved in politics at a young age, I know the struggle of questioning if your opinion matters when talking about such important issues, especially with people who may seem more experienced or knowledgeable. But once I started working on local campaigns and meeting Labor MPs, I quickly realised that they wanted to hear what I had to say. By campaigning with young people, I found a way to raise my voice and make a difference. It gave me the confidence to keep talking and to keep being heard, and now, as senator for WA, I have the privilege of being able to highlight the incredible work being done by other young Australians. Young people's voices are important, so I encourage any young person out there with passion to follow the lead of WAJA students, get involved and create a better Australia for all.
