        , Senator Watt. With Labor embarking on the largest immigration program in Australian history, bringing in more than 500,000 people this year alone, more and more economists are warning these numbers are driving inflation and hurting everyday Australian families. Following yesterday's 12th interest rate rise since Labor was elected, when will the government acknowledge they are completely wrong about high immigration and cut the numbers to sustainable levels?

          Senator Smith, that's most unlike you! I'm very disappointed in you! I'm very disappointed. Thank you for the question, Senator Roberts. I hear, again, in response to your question, Senator McKenzie demanding more spending for infrastructure. So I guess we're back to, 'Spend more in the economy, and drive up inflation!' That's where the opposition was at today—

           Senator Watt, please resume your seat. Senator Roberts, I am going to direct the minister to your question, and I will remind those in here that the crossbenchers are entitled to be heard in silence and are entitled to have their questions answered. They get less time than others in this place. I would expect everyone to be sitting in respectful silence. Minister Watt, I refer you to Senator Roberts' question.

            Thank you. Senator Roberts, I think I answered a very similar question from you the other day. I did acknowledge that Australia's migration system, after 10 years of Liberal and National government, mainly overseen by the now opposition leader, Mr Dutton, is in utter    disarray. We have acknowledged that. I know that the minister—

                    We have taken a number of measures already since being elected to fix the mess of the broken migration system we inherited. For example, this government has ended the Pandemic Event visa, which was being abused in some cases—in many cases. We have changed the previously unlimited working hours that were available for international students, a system that was engineered by the former government, and we've also made changes to work exemptions for working holiday visa holders. We've also increase the temporary skilled migration income threshold from $53,900 to $70,000, and that is the first increase in a decade.

                        Senator Roberts, it's up to you to choose whether you want to listen to my answer or not. But I've already outlined a number of measures that we have taken to fix the migration system, thoroughly broken, overseen by Mr Dutton, and to try to put in place a more manageable migration system and more manageable immigration numbers. We are conscious that this is an issue that needs to be addressed, and we'll keep working on it.

                          Economic experts have, for many months, been calling for lower immigration levels to reduce the high demand causing the housing and rental crisis forcing Australian families into homelessness and poverty. Given that Labor's housing policy won't have any impact for five years, when will Labor admit its record immigration is the primary cause of the housing and rental crisis and act to lower immigration and allow Australians to put a roof over their heads, reduce rental costs and possibly own their own home?

                           (—) (): Thank you, Senator Roberts. As I say, I've already indicated a number of steps that the government has taken to make our migration system more manageable and to fix the mess that we inherited from the former government. I know that you're trying to draw a link between migration numbers and housing pressures. It would have been nice if, just once, we could have had
                           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Nation" rel="nofollow">
                            One Nation

                           's support for any of the housing measures that this government has put in place. We know, of course, that you voted with the coalition to oppose our $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund, which won't take five years to start building houses. Senator Farrell has already talked today, in answering a question, about the money that is already starting to flow to build homes under that program, which One Nation voted against, along with the coalition. So, if you're serious about wanting to have more housing in place for Australians, maybe, the next time we put up something about building more homes for Australians, then you might care to actually back it. We've also forwarded significant funds, billions of dollars, to the states and territories to get to building homes right now. That's the source. That's the way we fix the housing crisis.

                                  I will let anyone go back and have a look at your question, Senator Roberts, and I think the implication is very clear about what you're trying to say and what you're trying to do. But this government, as well as fixing the migration system—that was utterly broken under Mr Dutton and the opposition—have also made very clear that we're committed to keeping the community safe from all forms of terrorism and violent extremism.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  The government's focus is on addressing significant and emerging threats, such as the rise of nationalist and racist violent extremism, and the increase in radicalisation of young people. The government keeps security laws under review in light of evolving threats, including those posed by right-wing extremists, and is committed to ensuring our laws remain appropriate and effective. We've introduced a comprehensive package of reforms to protect the community from those who seek to spread hate, whoever they may be.
