        My question without notice is to the Minister for Jobs and Innovation, Senator Cash. Today, Telstra workers and their families have been devastated by the announcement that Telstra will shed 8,000 jobs over the next three years. When did the government first become aware of Telstra's plan to cut 8,000 jobs, and what measures is the government putting in place to assist the 8,000 workers and their families?

         Senator Carr, it is an absolute delight to hear from you! I can only speak as to when I was informed, and it was late last night. The decision by Telstra to restructure its workforce over the next three years is a disappointing one for those affected by it, but ultimately it is a commercial decision for Telstra. The government recognises the imperative of helping individuals and communities adapt to change. When job losses occur, our first concern is for the workers and their families who are affected by the job losses. I have spoken to Telstra, as I understand has the Prime Minister and the Minister for Communications, and I understand that a number of the job losses will be through voluntary redundancies. The government is pleased to see that Telstra will establish a $50 million transition program to assist its workers who will lose their jobs, or need to reskill, over the next three years as part of Telstra's restructure. Telstra recognises the importance of supporting its skilled and knowledgeable workforce as they transition to new jobs.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government has a number of measures to assist displaced workers to transition and return to the workplace. These include employment assistance through jobactive for eligible displaced workers, including funds to assist with retraining, wage subsidies and, if needed, relocation assistance. We also have support through our vocational education and training system. We also have income support and financial counselling services provided by the

            Senator Carr, we're not. What this side of the chamber is focused on is building a stronger economy. This side of the chamber is focused on building a stronger economy. We are focused on ensuring that our businesses have the best possible policy environment in which to prosper and grow. Those of us on this side of the chamber know that, when a business is able to prosper and grow, that business will create jobs for Australians.
           </p>
           <p>
            But I will also put on the record the words of the Prime Minister. He has stated: 'While this news is disappointing, it once again highlights that Australian businesses are facing intense competition. That's why it is absolutely critical that the government continues to back business to invest and create jobs. It's why lower business taxes are vital to ensuring Australian businesses remain competitive on the global stage.' We will back business to grow and create more jobs.

              Minister, you speak of the uncertainty of the future facing workers. I'd ask you this: why is the coalition government making it harder for Australians to look to education and train themselves for the jobs of the future by cutting $2.2 billion from Australian universities and around $3 billion from vocational education? Doesn't this just show how arrogant and out of touch this Prime Minister is when the best he can doâ€”

                Thank you, Senator Carr. To quote a phrase, 'Yet another lot of Labor lies.' Senator Carr, you are completely wrong in what you have stated. This government is focused on backing our businesses, because, as we know, when we back our businessesâ€”and we can do that through tax cutsâ€”our businesses will reinvest that money back into themselves, and they will prosper and they will grow. This government has a good record of job creation. If we look at just over the last 12 months, in excess of 178,000 full-time jobs were created because of the policy settings of the Turnbull government. Compare that to the final 12 months of the former Labor government. You'd never know, would you, colleagues, that the economy shed almost 17,000 full-time jobs under the policies that those on the other side put in place.
