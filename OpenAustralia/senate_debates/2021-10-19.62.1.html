        . The

        requires members of cabinet to observe cabinet solidarity. Does cabinet solidarity extend to this minister and Nationals members of cabinet publicly campaigning against Mr Morrison's stated intention to adopt net zero by 2050?

          Keneally
         </a>
         for the question. As the Prime Minister has made clear, this is a decision for cabinet and no decision has been made. That is as it stands. Every cabinet minister in the Senate is aware of the processes of cabinet, and of the
         <i>
          Cabinet Handbook
         </i>
         and of our responsibilities as cabinet ministers in this government. It has been an incredibly collegiate cabinet that has been able to deliver for rural and regional Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         My question though is, I guess—having dealt with that question, I am very, very happy to go to the fact that the Labor Party's question belies your strategy—that you're all politics and no—

            has directly addressed the substance of the question in relation to knowledge of the cabinet rules and processes. Senator McKenzie, having directly addressed the question, is fully entitled to add context to the answer she has given.

             , I believe you were being directly relevant to the question; however, your choice of phrase in broadening your answer was probably not indicating that you were staying directly relevant to the question. So I will bring your attention back to the question. You have the call.

                KENEALLY (—) (): The Prime Minister has made clear that net zero emissions by 2050 will be a decision of cabinet. Given the cabinet handbook requires that, 'Members of cabinet must publicly support all government decisions made in cabinet, even if they do not agree with them,' does this minister commit to supporting the Liberal plan for net zero emissions by 2050 once it is adopted by cabinet?

                 's question. As I've just said, the cabinet has not made a decision. The Prime Minister has been clear about that, as has the Deputy Prime Minister. They are making sure that the National Party have the chance, as an independent sovereign party, to make their own decision. We will go through the process that we have outlined.

                   The cabinet handbook also states that, 'Cabinet ministers cannot disassociate themselves from or repudiate the decisions of their cabinet colleagues unless they resign from cabinet.' Given this minister's stated opposition to the Liberals' plan for net zero emissions by 2050, will this minister resign from cabinet once it is adopted by cabinet?

                      It's on relevance. How is quoting from a book about the Rudd government possibly relevant to a question about the cabinet handbook? I would submit that ministers are flagrantly abusing the privileges of senators in here and are testing your limits, as the new President. I would ask you to make sure that their answers are relevant.

                        On the point of order, the question went to matters of cabinet convention and processes, which are, of course, very longstanding customs and practices. I am not aware of the contents of the quote that Senator
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKenzie" rel="nofollow">

                        is going to use and, unless Senator Watt has powers that I've not yet seen, nor is he. So it's entirely possible that the quote is indeed relevant to matters of cabinet process and cabinet consideration, which would make it directly relevant to the question that was asked.
