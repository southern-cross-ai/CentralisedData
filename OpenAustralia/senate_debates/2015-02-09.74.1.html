         The trade union royal commission interim report raises serious concerns about the activities of certain trade union officials. The report recommends that authorities consider laying criminal charges against officials or former officials of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
          CFMEU
         </a>
         ,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWU" rel="nofollow">
          AWU

         and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSU" rel="nofollow">
          HSU
         </a>
         . These potential charges relate to acts of intimidation and coercion, breaches of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporations_Act" rel="nofollow">
          Corporations Act
         </a>
         , blackmail and fraud and to making false statements. Significantly, the report, like others before it, found a 'culture of wilful defiance of the law which appears to lie at the core of the CFMEU,' the union that the Leader of the Opposition so faithfully served.
        </p>
        <p>
         The concerns raised by the report do not stop there. The report also refers to a confidential third volume, a volume that has not been made available to the public because of concerns of the royal commission for the safety and security of potential witnesses. The royal commissioners stated that the contents of this volume 'reveal grave threats to the power and authority of the Australian state.' The report also makes adverse comments and criticisms about the internal operations and financial dealings of officials of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TWU" rel="nofollow">
          TWU
         </a>
         , AWU, HSU, CFMEU and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETU" rel="nofollow">
          ETU
         </a>
         . These findings are very serious. In the government's view, the report's findings confirm the urgent need for legislation to eliminate union corruption and contempt for the rule of law and to ensure that there is a tough cop on the beat in the construction sector.
        </p>
        <p>
         The vast bulk of union officials faithfully represent their membership. That is why I am delighted that many in the trade union movement support the government's legislation.

           The coalition has reforms that are designed to stamp out the kinds of trade union corruption identified in the royal commission interim report. The coalition's Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill establishes a registered organisations commission to ensure that unions are held to the same standards of behaviour as companies and their directors, with the same penalties. It also raises the standards of financial disclosure for unions. The Building and Construction (Improving Productivity) Bill re-establishes the Australian Building and Construction Commission, which was ravaged whilst Mr Shorten was minister, and provides for the creation of a new building code to ensure that construction projects that use taxpayer funding are completed on time, on budget and in accordance with modern industrial law. Now more than ever, Australians deserve these assurances, and that is what we as a government seek to provide.

             Regrettably, there is currently only one major party that supports a clean and honest union movement, and that is not the party of the unions. The handful of people who do not understand the need to clean up the trade union movement are Mr Shorten, the Labor Party and the Greens, who continue to oppose coalition reforms that would ensure that renegade union officials are held to account for their actions. Labor cannot be allowed to hold honest working Australians' interest to ransom for the protection of their union mates. If Mr Shorten and Labor continue to oppose the re-establishment of the Australian Building and Construction Commission and the Registered Organisations Commission, it will be clear that they care more about their dodgy union mates than the needs of hard-working Australians. Those who are serious about ending the culture of union intimidation, blackmail and coercion identified by the royal commission need to act—
