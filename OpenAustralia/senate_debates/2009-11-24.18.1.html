          My question is to the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Government Service Delivery, Senator Arbib. Can the minister inform the Senate of the latest details regarding the rollout of the education infrastructure stimulus? Is the minister aware of recent positive survey results of school principals which show overwhelming support for

           I thank Senator Hutchins for the question and for the outstanding work he has done in the past and continues to do. I think it has now been a number of weeks since we have received a question from Senator Mason or the Liberal Party about the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_the_Education_Revolution" rel="nofollow">
            Building the Education Revolution
           </a>
           . They seem to have forgotten about the Building the Education Revolution, but the Rudd government has not.
          </p>
          <p>
           I can report to the Senate that there are now 11,000 projects approved, with 8,000 school projects underway. There are 2½ thousand projects with on site work, with activity taking place right now on school campuses, supporting schools for the future. Twenty-nine projects have already been completed. In terms of science and language centres, there are over 500 projects already approved, almost 400 underway and 30 with construction having started.

            The coalition can interject, they can criticise, they can laugh, but this is supporting Australian jobs. This is supporting tradespeople throughout the countryside—plumbers, electricians, carpenters and bricklayers. It is supporting their businesses and supporting small business. The coalition may have forgotten about small business but the Rudd government has not. We will not forget about the small businesses who need support during the global recession, and this is how the Rudd government is responding to the global recession. We are doing it through infrastructure—infrastructure in schools—something you forgot about.

            I can also do some research through the newspapers. Queensland’s

            program, which is projected to be complete first quarter of 2011 there is no doubt there would be wholesale job losses in the construction industry.
           </p>
           <p>
            That is what business is saying. They need this stimulus. They need these projects. Australian schools need the projects.

             , this is my first supplementary question. Can the minister provide examples of how the education infrastructure stimulus is supporting jobs as well as delivering vital school infrastructure? Is it true that there is only one complaint unresolved regarding the education infrastructure stimulus? Is it also true that there have been only 60 complaints regarding the education stimulus out of a total of 24,000 projects?

              Thank you, Senator Hutchins. Yes, I can confirm those figures are true. There have only been 60 complaints, with one unresolved complaint out of 24,000 schools. I think that is a pretty good strike rate—there is only one unresolved school matter. A recent survey of 300 principals at the Australian Primary Principals Association conference found that 85 per cent of principals highly approved of the

                 for the 21st Century? How many schools have taken up the generous offer of Senator Fifield to write in and complain about the school infrastructure that the opposition voted against? How many submissions has Senator Fifield personally made to the committee to pass on the concerns of schools, which he also offered to do in his letter-writing campaign?
