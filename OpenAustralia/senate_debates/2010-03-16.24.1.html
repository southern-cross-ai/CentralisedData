        My question is to the Minister for Defence, Senator Faulkner. In respect of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIEV" rel="nofollow">
         SIEV
        </a>
        36 incident, it has been contended by the government:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … the fire was deliberately lit by one or more persons who had travelled to Australia on SIEV36 and that the fire took hold and led to an almost immediate explosion because petrol had been deliberately poured into the bilge by one or more of the persons who had travelled to Australia on SIEV36.
       </p>
       <p>
        Further evidence presented to the coronial inquiry by the government clearly shows the ADF personnel treated the SIEV36 passengers with respect, courtesy and dignity. In light of these contentions by the government, why has the minister not defended the integrity and honour of the ADF personnel who had to contend with a series of horrific events aboard the SIEV36?

           Senator, I do not think that is right, and I think any fair-minded person would acknowledge that the ADF knows that, as do ADF personnel. But there is an issue here that I think senators should take account of. That is of course that on 25 January this year the coroner for the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
            Northern Territory
           </a>
           , Mr Cavanagh, commenced a coronial inquest into the deaths of the five people that occurred near
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashmore_Reef" rel="nofollow">
            Ashmore Reef
           </a>
           . That inquest was adjourned on 18 February this year. The facts of the matter are that the coroner is expected to bring down his findings tomorrow. I have been constrained in what I can say. I did not follow the advice of the opposition earlier, suggesting I should table a range of material, and if I had I would have been roundly criticised because not a matter of days later the coroner came out and requested that that not take place. I suggest to Senator Johnston in these circumstances that we all ought to contain ourselves. We all ought to do what is right in these circumstances, understanding that the coroner is expected to bring down his findings on this very serious incident and then there will be a capacity without those constraints that apply to all members of parliament, whether in government or in opposition—

             36. There were injuries sustained, as you know. Five ADF personnel received first aid for injuries sustained in the explosion. All personnel on board the vessel participated in critical mental health screening following their involvement in the incident. A total of 54 personnel were involved in some capacity in the

               I cannot say and I certainly do not intend to speculate on such matters before the coroner brings down his findings tomorrow. I would be surprised if any senator would expect me to speculate on such matters. I am happy, however, to provide more information to Senator Johnston in relation to the health of those ADF personnel who were injured as a result of the explosion aboard

              <p>
               At the time of the follow-up critical incident mental health screenings, 11 members required referral for ongoing psychological treatment. Of those who required ongoing psychological treatment, four have been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and two have been diagnosed with a stress reaction. I can assure you the normal support mechanisms are in place for those ADF personnel.
