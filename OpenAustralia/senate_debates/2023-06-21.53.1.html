        In my first speech in this place, I said:

       <p class="italic">
        I do not know what it will take to end homelessness, but I want it gone.
       </p>
       <p>
        I knew I was elected to be part of a Labor team that took this issue seriously and would do whatever was possible to get roofs over vulnerable people's heads. Twelve months into the job, I'm still learning every day, and on Monday I learnt a very important lesson: that the Greens political party don't understand what progress looks like. To defer legislation that will create 30,000 additional social housing units, including for women and children escaping domestic violence, because they don't think it's enough? Come on. It's time you walk the talk.

        Despite the barriers the Greens have put in our way with the help of their new mates the coalition, the Albanese government has once again found a way to help: $2 billion for public housing across the country. This is only because the state and territory leaders know—

          they finally have a government and a Prime Minister in Canberra who want to work together to deliver for those doing it tough.

          are claiming that this occurred due to their pressure. Give me a break. This announcement is consistent with the government's agenda and part of a broader plan for housing which we took to the election. The Greens like to claim they are the party of young people and students. Well, this has shown us that they are the type of students who do nothing on group assignments but still take all the credit. The Albanese government delivered our promises for action on environment, for aged-care workers and for wages, and we're delivering on housing, whether the Greens come to their senses or not. We care about social housing, while the Greens appear to care about social media.

           Senator Faruqi, just before you start your contribution, I just remind all senators of standing order 197, which says that interjections are disorderly. People have the right to be heard in silence in the chamber.
