        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for

         Climate Change
        </a>
        and

         Energy Efficiency

        , Senator Wong. I refer the minister to reports that Standard &amp; Poor's has lowered the credit rating for the largest electricity generator in my home state of Victoria,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loy_Yang_Power" rel="nofollow">
         Loy Yang Power
        </a>
        , due to concerns about the government's proposed carbon tax. Given that a government commissioned report by Deloittes warned earlier this year that some power stations would be 'at the mercy of the banks' when it came to refinancing and uncertainty over the carbon tax, what assurances will the government provide to the four major Victorian brown-coal power generators and Queensland's Millmerran power station, which will be affected by the carbon tax?

         The government is extremely conscious of the importance of managing the transition in the energy sector. That is why, as part of the Clean Energy package the Prime Minister has announced, there is a very significant amount of money focused on ensuring that transformation in the energy sector.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would make the point that the policy of those on the other side also involves a range of funding for the electricity generation sector. The difference, of course, is that that is not transparent and they have not been very clear at all with the industry what that would involve. The government announced assistance under the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Security" rel="nofollow">
          Energy Security
         </a>
         package being provided to generators on the basis of emissions intensity. We believe that the package will ensure the sort of energy security that is expected, and we will continue to work with the regulators to ensure that that occurs.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am asked to comment specifically in relation to particular energy assets. I want to make it very clear to the senator that I do not think it is appropriate for us to pick and choose in the context of Senate question time. What will occur? A fund has been funded and the principles around which assistance will be allocated have been outlined, but I do not think it is economically sensible to come into this chamber and make specific comments about specific assets, as the senator has invited me to do.

            Be quiet, 'Senator Doormat'. Given that there is expected to be a 30 per cent increase in these wholesale prices under the carbon tax, does the government expect these costs to be passed on as increased power prices?

Given that the government has admitted that its carbon tax will drive up electricity prices by 10 per cent in the first year alone, what impact will forcing generators, who have already been heavily impacted by the carbon price to pay for future permits, have on energy affordability?

                  First, in relation to the electricity priceâ€”and I acknowledge that that was one of the questions in the first supplementaryâ€”I make the point that, again, unlike the coalition, the government is in fact increasing assistance to Australians in its household compensation package, which does not exist under the coalition's policy. We will provide more money to Australian pensioners; you will take that back. We will provide more money to Australian families receiving Family Tax Benefit; you will take that back. We will cut taxes for Australians earning up to $80,000 a year; you will increase taxes. So it is very clear who has the policies to deal with increases in electricity prices, which would also occur under your policy given that you wish to switch to gas. You just will not have any assistance package. That is the primary difference between your policy and ours.
