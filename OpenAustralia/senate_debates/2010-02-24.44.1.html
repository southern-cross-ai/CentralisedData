         Thank you for this sharp and fast question. I think Mr Fassina’s appointment was made when Senator Minchin was the shadow communications spokesperson. I think he even noticed it at the time. In fact, I think he even raised it. There have been some attempts recently to add to the colour and movement in my portfolio area by regurgitating and dragging up Mr Fassina’s appointment. I simply go back to the comments made at the time of his appointment by those from across all parts of the political divide, including Mr
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warwick_Smith" rel="nofollow">
          Warwick Smith
         </a>
         , a former predecessor of mine, who said that he was an excellent appointment, he had worked with him and he was well worthy to be appointed to that position.
        </p>
        <p>
         So let me be very clear: this was an appointment that was welcomed by those from your side of politics. What we are seeing now is simply an attempt to muddy up a whole range of people who, in Mr Fassina’s case, have not worked for the Labor Party for over 10 years. Equally, we have seen attempts to muddy up quite disgracefully a former staffer of mine.

          , I rise on a point of order, on relevance. The minister has just 35 seconds left and the minister has not addressed either part of the two-part question in terms of what is involved in the selection process and whether the minister was directly responsible for his appointment.

            , if they are going to raise spurious points of order then I will respond. The minister was responding to the question that was asked. The minister has 33 seconds to continue his answer in the relevant manner that the minister was answering in respect of the question asked. What we now have is those opposite rising to make political points or to add to their original question. I ask that you rule it out of order.

I have a lot of respect and time for Stephen and I am honoured to have been selected by the Rudd government to serve on the board.’ Is it true that when the opportunity arises the minister has no qualms in using the

                     You did not hear because you were shouting. I was calling you to order so that there can be order in this place, which is proper. You should not be addressing your comments across the chamber and there should not be interjections across the chamber during question time. The time to debate these issues, as I keep pointing out, is at the end of question time. If you disagree with a minister’s answer, you are quite entitled to do that and, if you want to take that disagreement up, debate it at the end of question time. Senator Conroy, you have two seconds.

                       , I ask a further supplementary question. I note in the minister’s response that every organisation referred to by the minister was a private organisation—none were funded by the taxpayer; none were government organisations or agencies.
