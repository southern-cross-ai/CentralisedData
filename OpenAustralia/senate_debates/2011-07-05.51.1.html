        My question is to Senator Conroy representing the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities. It is in regard to a decision by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australian
        </a>
        Premier Colin Barnett to forcibly remove locals from a road blockade at James Price Point in the Kimberley, which has led to the arrest of at least a dozen people, including elderly women, local small business people, traditional owners, custodians and their supporters. Why is the minister allowing 20 hectares of land to be cleared and for drilling to commence at James Price Point prior to the completion of the heritage assessment and prior to the granting of Commonwealth and state environmental approvals?

           The proposal will only proceed if approved by both the

           government and Minister Burke. Minister Burke visited the Kimberley in November last year to meet with local groups with different views on the James Price Point proposal, and public comment on the strategic assessment closed on 28 March this year. Recent reports have noted that a majority of traditional owners agreed to support a liquefied natural gas precinct at James Price Point. The proposal is subject to an assessment under national environmental law. Minister Burke will be in a position to make a decision on the plan to develop the precinct once all matters required by the terms of the strategic assessment have been appropriately investigated, which I understand will be in the not too distant future.

            , I ask a supplementary question. The minister is obviously well aware that the strategic impact assessment is underway. Will he reconsider his decision not to assess the land-clearing that is underway at the moment—or that Woodside would like to undertake—and immediately declare it a controlled action so that these activities cease until such time as the strategic assessment has been conducted?

             Minister Burke is advised that there have been two referrals in relation to a road to James Price Point. The first was for a four-metre wide access track. Minister Burke is advised that a departmental delegate in November last year determined that the proposal was not a controlled action. This decision was made as the department determined that the access track was unlikely to have a significant impact on matters of national environmental significance. The second was a proposal from the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
              Western Australian
             </a>
             government for a 45-kilometre sealed road from the Broome-
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Leveque_Road" rel="nofollow">
              Cape Leveque Road
             </a>
             to James Price Point. On 26 May 2011 a departmental delegate determined that this proposal was not a controlled action if carried out in a particular manner. No further federal environmental assessment will be required as long as measures are in place to minimise impacts on the greater bilby, which is listed as vulnerable.
