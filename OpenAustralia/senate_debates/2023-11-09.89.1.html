          Good to see you're back, Minister. I note that you returned after visiting China with the Prime Minister and visiting Japan, one of our closest partners in the region. This week I couldn't help but turn on the radio and read many newspapers and see praise of the Albanese government's exceptional effort to stabilise our relationship with China. Can the minister please inform the Senate about the government's approach to Australia's relationship with our largest trading partner?

           I thank Senator Ciccone for the question. I would go back to what we said we would do before the election. Before the election we said to the Australian people that a Labor government would stabilise the relationship with China without compromising Australia's sovereign interests. That's what we said we would do and that is what we have done. Prime Minister Albanese's visit to China was the first visit by an
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Prime_Minister" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Prime Minister
           </a>
           since 2016 and my second visit as foreign minister. I indicate that we appreciated the courtesy extended to the Prime Minister and to the Australian delegation.
          </p>
          <p>
           The visit was an opportunity to continue our calm and consistent approach with China, the same approach that is delivering progress for the Australian people, progress in the resumption of trade. I acknowledge the work that Senator Farrell, as Minister for Trade and Tourism, has done on these matters when it comes to trade between our two countries in barley, coal, timber logs, cotton, hay, copper ores and concentrates. Australia continues to press for the resumption of trade in wine, red meat and lobster. We know that the period of trade impediments was really challenging for so many Australians, because trade matters to Australian jobs and China is our most important trading partner, representing more than 25 per cent of our exports, and one in four of our jobs relies on trade.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Australian people know that we—this government—will continue to speak out on the matters that are important to Australians, which include not only trade impediments but Australians detained in China and human rights. I was very privileged to have the opportunity with Prime Minister Albanese to mark the 50th anniversary of the first visit to China by an Australian prime minister,

           , in 1973. His historic visit is a powerful reminder that whoever has the privilege of serving in these roles also has the responsibility to navigate this relationship wisely.

              I have often said that our world is being reshaped and the focus of that reshaping is in our region. What does that mean for Australia? It means we know we cannot achieve the region we want alone. We have to work with allies, we have to work with partners and we have to work with other nations to enhance our collective security and our prosperity. I was privilege to visit Japan and meet with the Japanese Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister Kamikawa, and the Japanese National Security Advisor, Akiba Takeo. Australia and Japan have never been closer. We share an ambition for an Indo-Pacific which is peaceful, stable and prosperous in which sovereignty is respected. Just as we do with other like-minded nations, I was also able to catch up with other leaders in Tokyo, including my good friend the

                 Regardless of people's political views, I think I speak for all of us when I say it is impossible to absorb the harrowing images in Israel and Gaza with anything less than distress and horror. Australia welcomes the G7 foreign ministers' statement supporting humanitarian pauses and corridors in Gaza to facilitate urgently needed assistance and civilian movement. We join with the G7 in its condemnation of Hamas's terror attacks and call for the immediate release of all hostages without preconditions. Australia also reiterates our call on Israel to observe international law and the rules of war and protect civilian life. We also join with the G7 in indicating that the extremist settler violence committed against Palestinians is unacceptable. It undermines security in the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank" rel="nofollow">
                  West Bank
                 </a>
                 and threatens prospects for a lasting peace. What is particularly notable about the G7 statement is the aspiration that Australia shares, which is that the imperative of an enduring peace and a two-state solution.
