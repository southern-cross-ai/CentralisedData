        My question is to the Minister for Finance, Senator Birmingham. I refer to the minister's comments during his appearance on Sky News on 8 October when he said:

         I thank Senator Gallagher for her question and the question as Minister for Finance. Indeed, those remarks are remarks that I stand by in terms of the importance of the quality of spending. It is crucial across government that we work always to ensure that government spending is targeted where it's necessary to what is necessary. That's been the approach of our side of politics all along. It was that type of approach in terms of making sensible decisions around budget management that enabled us to create an environment coming into this economic crisis that we face right now that had our budget come back to a point of balance. It was through that careful budget management and that economic management that we ensured that—

           is a crucial part of our ecology, of our environment and of our tourism industry and, indeed, has been central to commitments that we have made to the world about the management that we apply to the Great Barrier Reef. The support for the Great Barrier Reef Foundation is absolutely about making sure that we get investments ongoing over a period of time across the reef, supporting a range of different measures that will support the health, wellbeing and resilience of the reef through that time. We are already seeing now that funding is being applied in practical ways to support the reef, one of our great and appropriate assets.

             Eighty-three per cent of the $3 billion allocated from the Urban Congestion Fund administered by Minister Tudge has gone into Liberal seats or seats targeted by the Liberal Party. More than one-third went to Liberal seats in Melbourne. Does this $2.49 billion worth of public money meet the minister's standards of quality spending?

              I am left wondering which projects the Labor Party are against? Which projects, in terms of urban infrastructure or congestion, do they think are unnecessary? Those opposite will criticise endlessly the things that they think aren't being done, yet when indeed the government does decide to invest in the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef" rel="nofollow">
               Great Barrier Reef
              </a>
              , or does invest in relation to urban infrastructure to address congestion—helping to ensure that families can get home more safely, on time, and to increase productivity across our economy by dealing with congestion and those issues—then they come in and they criticise those types of investments. What we see from the Labor Party all the time is a complete lack of consistency in that regard. We have invested in this to support Australians to be able to get the best possible outcomes in their lives.

                  I'll take the interjection from Senator Wong, because it is absolutely taxpayers' money. We, on this side, have always recognised that it is taxpayer's money and that it needs to be handled carefully. It is why we made sure that we made steps through our early years in government to reduce the rate of growth in government spending and to tackle the structural deficits that had been left by the Labor Party, and by being careful with taxpayers' money, we created the circumstances where the economy absolutely had the resilience to respond to the COVID-19 crisis. We created the set of circumstances where we could invest record sums in supporting Australians through these unprecedented times and, in doing so, still maintain Australia's

                  credit rating, maintain an economic response that, along with the health response, is very much the envy of the world. That is because of careful, consistent economic management over a long period of time that invests in priorities for Australia.
