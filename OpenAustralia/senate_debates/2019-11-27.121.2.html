           The government will not be supporting this motion. The committee report recommended the government respond to the ACNC review and work with state and territory governments alongside the charity sector to harmonise fundraising laws. The government is finalising its response to the ACNC review and is currently consulting with the states and territories on fundraising law. The government has consulted widely with the sector throughout the process and is committed to delivering a response in the first half of next year.
