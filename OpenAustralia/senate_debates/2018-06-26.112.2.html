           Ensuring affordable broadband is available to all Australian homes and businesses, including those in regional areas, is a priority for the coalition government. That's why the Australian government is committing close to $5 billion to regional and rural broadband in the form of fixed wireless and satellite technologies. This is arguably the biggest investment in rural and regional broadband anywhere in the world, and includes cross-subsidies from

           users in our cities. As with any satellite and fixed wireless broadband technology, capacity is finite and needs to be carefully monitored and managed in order to deliver a network that can provide the best customer experience. Neither the government nor NBN determine or develop policy by way of a Senate motion.

               rollout will be completed in 2020, by which time more than 11 million homes and businesses will be able to participate fully in the digital economy. To connect to residential service, NBN requires a unique address or location identifier for each premises. Where pre-NBN services are already connected, they can be typically switched to the NBN. Residents have the option to connect their secondary properties and outbuildings to the NBN with extended cabling, wirelessly or under new NBN's new-developments arrangements.
