         I thank Senator Williams for the question and for his strong advocacy to improve mental health services, especially for those from rural and regional Australia. I think mental illness and ensuring that all Australians have the services and support they need is something that binds every person in this chamber. Our commitment as senators and as a parliament to ensure that Australians have access to appropriate mental health services is crucial, and it binds us together. I feel very, very strongly about this issue as rural health minister and I'm committed to doing everything I can to support and improve the lives of Australians who suffer from mental illness.

         There are over four million Australians who experience mental health issues. It's something that's present in every family and every community right across the country. Tragically, too many Australians choose the ultimate expression of their mental illness in attempting to take their lives. Nearly 3,000 Australians go down that path every year, and it's too many. The coalition government is committed to supporting those with mental illnesses. There are challenges right across the community. We invested over $4.3 billion at the last budget. This includes an additional $9 million for the extension and expansion of telehealth into rural and regional Australia, $11 million for the prevention of suicide at hotspot locations and $58 million to support current and former

            Young people, when confronted with mental illness, often struggle to access the information and the support that they need in a timely fashion. We all know the tragedy of young Amy Everett, the 14-year-old who took her life over summer as a result of cyberbullying. It is something that has impacted all families and communities, as parents and as young people themselves struggle with the impact of cyberbullying. I had the privilege of announcing over the summer break an additional $110 million to expand and extend specific mental health programs to our young peopleâ€”supporting headspace and supporting beyondblue with their crack team, which goes particularly into secondary schools that have experienced a suicide episode, to support teachers, students and families at a time in crisis, and providing additional money for Orygen, leading world-class research and policy advice in the provision of youth mental health services. I could go on.

               It is an important topic because it touches the lives of every family and every Australian, particularly in regional Australia, where our suicide rates are 1.5 times higher than those in capital cities. A fortnight ago, I was privileged to visit the 100th headspace, opening in

               , with the member for Parkes,

                Mark Coulton
               </a>
               . I got to meet the energetic and passionate staff, the headspace providers. They are very keen to engage with young people and the community of Broken Hill by going to the schools to ensure that the young people in Broken Hill, who sometimes experience a waiting list to access the support services they need, can walk through the headspace door and get access to the services they need in a timely manner. This government is committed to ensuring that all young people, no matter where they live, will get the support they need. That's why telehelp is so important at 3 am and headspace is so important to our communities.
