        My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Senator Wong. I refer the minister to concerns reported today that the budget's assumptions about the value of the dollar and commodity prices might be overly optimistic and, if so, could lead to reduced revenue collections to the tune of $90 billion. Given the heroic assumptions in the budget about the terms of trade and the highly optimistic estimates about the revenue to be collected via the carbon price and the mining tax, will the minister, as one of the people most responsible for preparing the budget, accept a personal responsibility for any deterioration in revenue collections and any consequent impact on the deficit?

         I would make a few points in response to Senator Joyce on this. The first is: notwithstanding the attempt by the coalition to distract attention by attacking the Treasury or attacking forecasts, I would remind the coalition that the very professional officers of the Treasury and the very professional officers of Finance are the same institutions—and, often, in many locations, the same individuals—who served Mr Costello and produced the forecasts for Mr Costello. But what the coalition would have you believe is that, magically, suddenly, the Treasury has become some hotbed of a Labor Party faction. Well, we on this side actually have some regard for the professionalism of the institution and think it is very unfair and inappropriate for the coalition to continue to attack the Treasury in the way that it is.
        </p>
        <p>
         I think there were two questions. The first might have been in relation to nominal
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
          GDP
         </a>
         , and I would make the point that the forecasts for nominal GDP are in fact: nominal GDP growth below trend and well below the 20-year average, and in fact the nominal GDP forecast has been reduced since the midyear review. In terms of the terms of trade, the forecasts in the budget are broadly in line with those of many major forecasters and show a decline over the forecast period, and of course there is an assumption about decline over the projection period.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would refer the senator—or perhaps I can, in the supplementary—to a number of comments by market economists about the government forecasts.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Why should the Australian people have any faith in the forecasts and assumptions that the minister and the Treasurer have adopted in this election year budget when so many of the estimates, forecasts and assumptions in last year's budget were wrong, including the assumption that only 450 asylum seekers would arrive per month when, in fact, the actual number was around 2,000 people per month?

           We have a reprise from Senator Joyce of Senator Abetz's attempt yesterday to make sure that they do not actually talk about the economy, they do not actually talk about disability care, they do not actually talk about jobs, and they do not actually talk about how they grow the economy or employment, or what their plans for Australian schools are; all they want to do is talk about boats. But we know that that is the approach that the coalition take. I again remind the Senator that, in terms of the forecasters, the Treasury also forecast for Mr Costello and he is now attacking the same institution that served very well under both governments. I would remind him also of some comments by market economists: according to Citi, the economic forecasts look achievable and are similar to the

            , I ask a further supplementary question. Given that, in the minister's time as finance minister, we have seen the cumulative total of deficits run up to over $40 billion—more than you and the Treasurer estimated at budget time; $40 billion over what they told us it was going to be—why should Australians have any confidence in your estimates? Why should we have any confidence in the next budget nightmare, the

             NBN

            ? Is it the fact that Mr Swan just cannot help himself, grossly overestimating your ability to keep the nation's finances under proper control?

              UBS
             </a>

            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             … conservative and credible revenue forecasts—without unduly leaning on the economy’s near-term vulnerable economic recovery.

                              , for that protection. I would like to thank Senator Brown for her question and note the senator's ongoing interest in the science and research sector. The Gillard government remains committed to supporting a stronger, smarter and fairer nation. Building this sector is at the heart of our commitment. Supporting science and research fuels jobs and growth, increases productivity and supports Australian businesses to compete in the global economy.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              For example, we have invested $185 million over two years in the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy. This will support Australian researchers and research facilities to drive innovation and support high-quality jobs growth. NCRIS, as it is known, funds projects that support important research work that will benefit future generations. These projects include work on fabrication infrastructure to support advances in materials design, and earth imaging and geospatial systems of direct benefit to the mining industry.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              This government knows our future prosperity relies on Australians having the skills and innovation needed to compete against the world's brightest. That is why the Gillard government has also announced $135 million over five years to extend the Future Fellowships scheme. This new funding will provide 150 more fellowships and builds on the government's original $844 million investment.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              Importantly, the Gillard government has also committed $25 million over five years for Hobart's Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre. Our commitment to both research and an ongoing presence in the Antarctic means jobs for Tasmanians and investments in the Australian and Tasmanian economies.

                                I once again thank the senator for her question. The National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy supports major research infrastructure to encourage collaboration between the research sector, industry and the Australian government to conduct world-class research. The Gillard government's investment of $185 million in this budget will ensure that Australian research continues to be competitive and ranked highly on the international scale.

                                           Thank you for that question. The fact of the matter is that real funding per student has increased under the Labor government and will continue to increase after the efficiency dividend has been taken into account. In 2007, real funding per student was $16,147. In 2012, it was $17,659. With the efficiency dividend taken into account, real funding—this is after you have taken out inflation—per student is projected to exceed $18,000 in 2017. This will be a real funding increase in excess of 10 per cent. The suggestion that you should only look at one funding source is fanciful and is out of touch with reality.
