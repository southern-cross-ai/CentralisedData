        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Cormann. This morning, the finance minister twice refused to endorse the Prime Minister's claim that a $65 million big business tax cut will increase wages. So I would ask: how is it fair that the Prime Minister is giving a $65 billion handout to big business just so they can keep it for themselves?

         The Labor Party get their numbers all muddled up. First it's a $65 million giveaway to big business; then it's a $65 billion giveaway to big business; and, in the Labor Party talking points, it is a $65 giveaway to big business. The first point I would make is that, clearly for the Labor Party, every business is a big business. If you have got one employee, you're big business. If you've got two employees, you're big business. If you have $2 million in turnover, you're big business under the Labor Party. When they talk about the $65 billion cost to the budget bottom line of business tax cuts, the Labor Party know that $30 billion of that represents tax cuts for businesses with a turnover of up to $50 million. You know what: you could have knocked me over with a feather. Having fought it in the trenches, having fought it on the beaches, having fought it in the air—

             Here's my prediction: the Labor Party will end up backing in our business tax cuts in full. You know why I know that? Because last year they were fighting them on the beaches, in the air, by the sea—the $30 billion worth of tax cuts for businesses with a turnover of up to $50 million. Do you know what their position is today? It's their policy. They're backing it in. Last year they were arguing in this chamber that it was the worst thing ever. And what is your policy now? You're backing it in.

             Clearly, people across Australia understand that, if we want Australians to have the best possible opportunity to get ahead, we need the businesses that employ them to have the best possible opportunity to be successful and profitable into the future. We want Australians today and our children and grandchildren to have the best possible opportunity to have a job and a career here in Australia. We need to ensure that our businesses are not disadvantaged compared to businesses in other parts of the world. We'll continue to fight for what is right and we continue to fight for the working families of Australia. You have sold them out.

                Firstly, it is not a $65 billion handout to big business. It is leaving more of the businesses' money with them so they can reinvest it in their future growth and expansion so they can hire more Australians. I don't expect Senator Carr to understand basic economics, but if you go and look at what the shadow Treasurer used to say you'll see the shadow Treasurer knows that the burden of a higher company tax rate falls most heavily on workers. Why does a company tax cut lead to stronger wages growth? As there is more investment, stronger growth and more competition for workers in the marketplace, wages will go up. The key ingredient for stronger wages growth—and this is economic orthodoxy 101—is always more competition for workers and a depleting excess supply of labour.

                   We will continue to fight for the working families of Australia and to ensure that families of Australia have the best possible opportunity to get ahead. On our economic agenda, including our plan to ensure Australian businesses are not disadvantaged compared to businesses in other parts of the world, we'll help ensure that there is more investment, that there are more jobs and, as we have more jobs and there's more competition for workers, that there'll be higher wages. I can assure the Senate that this government will continue to fight for the working families of Australia. Nine out of 10 working Australians work in a private sector business.

                   The Labor Party wants to keep disadvantaging Australian businesses. The Labor Party wants to keep Australian businesses at a disadvantage when it comes to competition with businesses in other parts of the world. The Labor Party is quite happy to put investment and jobs at risk and it will stand condemned for it.

                    My question is also to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Cormann. In seeking to justify the proposed cuts to the company tax rate and in trying to support the crossbench, the government has been saying that the benefits of a tax cut will trickle down and that workers will see their wages rise. Senator Cormann, you're aware that

                    companies that have recently had a tax cut, and 44 per cent of them said they will use that money to buy back shares or they will return it to shareholders. This is no surprise. Did your department, the Treasury, conduct its own assessment, surveys or consultations with the 130

                     On our side of politics, we understand that policies that support the free market help deliver the best outcomes for individuals, their families and the communities they live in. On this side of parliament, we understand the historical failure of socialism. We understand that socialism makes everybody poorer. And you know who it makes poorer first? Low-income earners have the most to lose from a socialist agenda. We understand that the modern Labor Party and the Greens are all in favour of going back to the old class-warfare, socialist agenda of the past, but, let me tell you, history around the world has proven—

                        On this side of politics, we don't believe it's the job of the government to run private-sector businesses. It's not up to us to tell private-sector businesses what to do. Senator Carr thinks it's the job of government to run private-sector businesses and sort of nationalise them. We know that that leads to inferior outcomes for people around Australia. We happen to believe that encouraging individuals to work hard, stretch themselves and be the best they can be, and that supporting the free market, free enterprise, reward for effort and risk taking are actually the key to making sure that we can maximise our living standards in a sustainable fashion. And don't take my word for it. There is evidence around the world that that is, in fact, the truth.

                             Sadly, you don't understand basic economics. The truth is that every individual business will make a decision on how they can best position themselves for a successful future. The implication of your question is: if we make it harder for businesses to be successful and to compete, do you think they'll employ more people? Do you think that a less profitable business will employ more people? Let me tell you: less successful, less profitable businesses, businesses with their arms tied behind their backs because they've got to compete with businesses that have the benefit of lower taxes, will hire fewer people. And that means higher unemployment. Higher unemployment means that there is less competition for workers, which means that there will actually be lower wages than otherwise would be the case. Your recipe of opposing business tax cuts is a recipe for less investment, fewer jobs and lower wages. Our agenda is about more investment, more jobs and higher wages.

                                Here is where the bipartisanship between the Greens and the coalition comes back together. The Labor Party has lost all credibility. In government, there was no-one more eloquent in making the case for business tax cuts than
                                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Shorten" rel="nofollow">
                                 Bill Shorten

                                . When they were in government there was nobody more eloquent in criticising the Greens' position to limit business tax cuts to small business. But of course then they opposed it because—you know what?—it became our policy in the 2016-17 budget. They actually know, in their heart of hearts, that making sure that Australia can be globally competitive and our businesses can be competitive is the right thing to do by Australia. But Bill Shorten isn't interested in what is in the public interest. Bill Shorten is only interested in the politics of the situation. But of course he has backed in our business tax cuts for businesses to $50 million in turnover, which he fought tooth and nail last year. Nobody can take Bill Shorten seriously.
