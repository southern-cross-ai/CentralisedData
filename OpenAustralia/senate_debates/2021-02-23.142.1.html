        Introduction
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government welcomes the Joint Standing Committee on the National Disability Insurance Scheme 's (the Committee's) final report on the Inquiry into National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) Planning (the Report).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Report" rel="nofollow">
         The Report
        </a>
        contains 42 recommendations to improve the participant experience with the NDIS and support the National Disability Insurance Agency (NOIA) to deliver a transparent, consistent and equitable approach to planning.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The recommendations cover a number of areas including:
       </p>
       <ul>

         The Government
        </a>
        is committed to improving participant experiences with the NDIS and is on track to deliver improvements to the NDIS that make it fairer, simpler and work better for participants, their families and carers. These reforms will help deliver on the promise of the NDIS - to provide people with permanent and significant disability true choice and control over a flexible support package to pursue their goals. They also deliver on the final elements of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Productivity Commission
        </a>
        's original design for the NDIS, as well as recommendations of other reviews and inquiries, particularly the 2019 independent review of the
        <i>
         National Disability

        Insurance Scheme Act 2013 by David Tune AO
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSM" rel="nofollow">
         PSM
        </a>
        (Tune Review).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The NOIA has recently concluded a national public consultation process on the design of these reforms and will continue to engage with the disability sector, the broader community, and key organisations to ensure people are informed and can provide ongoing input into the design of these reforms, which will begin to roll out from mid-2021.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government supports, or supports-in-principle, 26 of the recommendations made in the Committee's report. Given the ongoing reforms to the planning process being progressed by the NOIA, the Government notes the Committee's remaining 16 recommendations and provides information on the key initiatives underway and planned to address them.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Inquiry into NDIS Planning
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendations made by the Committee
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        1. The committee recommends that the National Disability Insurance Agency provide fully costed, detailed draft plans to participants and their nominees at least one week prior to their meeting with an official with the authority to approve the plan.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Supported in principle
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government recognises the importance of providing participants with access to information about their plans prior to their planning meeting. Having a draft plan in advance is an important mechanism to ensure decision-making processes are transparent and for keeping the participant at the centre of the planning process, enabling the participant to consider how they might best use their plan funding to meet their goals and aspirations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIA" rel="nofollow">
         NDIA
        </a>
        is reviewing feedback from the national consultation on a new approach to planning, which will be underpinned by the introduction of independent assessments later in 2021. Under the proposed new approach to planning, all participants will receive a costed, draft plan prior to their planning meeting with an NDIA delegate. The NDIA delegate will have authority to approve the overall plan budget, enabling the plan budget to be quickly considered and approved - removing an administrative step in the process that might otherwise delay the funding of appropriate supports. The draft plan will be provided to participants with sufficient time for them to consider how they could use their plan prior to a planning meeting.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The feedback received during the consultation process will help inform the development of the new approach to planning and the policy, legislative and operational design for the use of independent assessments. Timeframes for certain NDIA administrative processes, such as approving a plan, will be legislated in the Participant Service Guarantee later in 2021.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        2. The committee recommends that the Australian Government implement Recommendation 3 of the Review of the National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013 (the Tune Review).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Supported in principle
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government agrees with the intent of Mr Tune's recommendations in relation to ensuring participants are supported to navigate the NDIS. The Government and NDIA have committed resources to improve the participant pathway.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For example, from mid-2021, free independent assessments will be a key input used for NDIS access decisions for disability support or early intervention. From late 2021, independent assessments will also be a key input informing the value of a participant's plan budget, allowing planning conversations to focus on supporting participants to make the best use of their funding to meet their needs and pursue their goals and aspirations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        By making independent assessments free, the Government is removing the financial burden of gathering evidence of functional capacity needed to access the NDIS, and ensuring participants have the right assessments to inform access, planning and review decisions. This will ensure all participants, or potential participants, are provided equal opportunity in the NDIS.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition:

       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government will monitor the effectiveness of these reforms before considering whether further investment is needed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        3. The committee recommends that the National Disability Insurance Agency provide caregivers, where they are involved in the planning process, with written information about the types of supports that the National Disability Insurance Scheme can fund to sustain caring arrangements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Supported
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The NDIA has an important role to assist families and carers of people with disability to identify, and in tum engage with or strengthen supports that assist them to maintain their caring roles. The supports they provide their loved one with disability is critical for the facilitation of outcomes of economic and social independence and the pursuit of goals and aspirations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government recognises carers of persons with disabilities should be given access to information about the types of supports available to sustain caring arrangements. The NDIS website already provides written information for carers about the types of NDIS supports available to sustain informal supports, as well as links to external websites such as Carers Australia and the Carer Gateway, where carers can access detailed information about the NDIS planning process. In addition, Partners in the Community can provide information about respite and other supports to sustain informal supports to participants, their representatives and carers throughout the planning process. Partners in the Community can also support participants and caregivers to link with mainstream services, such as the Carer Gateway.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The NDIA will consider the effectiveness of these products in promoting information on supports available to carers, and take into account the implementation of the new planning approach, before considering whether further administrative processes are necessary.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        4. The committee recommends that the National Disability Insurance Agency develop, publish and implement a strategy to better support people providing informal supports to participants, particularly caregivers and immediate family members.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Noted
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government recognises the importance of supporting families and carers, and aims to ensure that carers of all Australians, irrespective of whether they care for people who are NDIS participants, are supported to access the assistance they require to fulfil this important caring role.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The NDIA has worked with Carers Australia to develop internal guidance for NDIA planners and Partners in the Community to support improved outcomes for participants, families and carers by ensuring all planning staff understand the valuable role played by caregivers and families. This detailed guidance to NDIA planners, Partners in the Community and Early Childhood Partners (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EC" rel="nofollow">
         EC
        </a>
        Partners) highlights the importance of sustaining informal supports, the types of NDIS supports available and tips on how to interact with and support carers in planning meetings.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government has also recently invested more than $700 million over five years for carer support services through the introduction of Carer Gateway. The new network of Carer Gateway service providers commenced on 6 April 2020, and places greater emphasis on early intervention and prevention, helping carers access supports and navigate relevant and local services through federal, state and local government and non-government providers, such as My Aged Care and the NDIS.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        5. The committee recommends that the National Disability Insurance Agency assign specialised planners to participants who are hospitalised to assist with a smooth transition from hospital to home that enables the participant to access the supports that they need.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Supported
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government is committed to supporting NDIS participants to transition from hospital as soon as practicable with the necessary supports in place. By the end of December 2020 the NOIA had deployed 24 Health Liaison Officers (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HLO" rel="nofollow">
         HLO
        </a>
        s) nationally to improve outcomes for participants and potential participants in health settings, including hospitals. HLOs share their understanding of the NDIS with targeted health services to ensure prospective and existing NDIS participants are supported in their interactions with NOIA and maximise their NDIS outcomes. HLOs also work closely with existing health services to ensure the NDIS access process is clear and understood, in order to support timely hospital discharge. In addition, the NOIA provides dedicated planners for those participants whose support needs are complex and require specialist planning expertise.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        During the COVID-19 pandemic the NOIA implemented a streamlined approach to hospital discharges where a participant required access to Specialist Disability Accommodation (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SDA" rel="nofollow">
         SDA
        </a>
        ) if they were eligible. The NOIA has retained this streamlined approach. Under the new approach, HLOs work closely with participants and the SDA sector to match participants with appropriate accommodation vacancies, if eligible, and expedite the planning process, including by identifying opportunities to rent or hire assistive technology from state and territory equipment schemes to reduce wait times.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        6. The committee recommends that the Commonwealth, states and territories, through the appropriate inter-governmental forum, consider the appropriate division of responsibility for the funding of supports for participants in the criminal justice system.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Noted
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government is committed to ensuring the Applied Principles and Tables of Support (the Applied Principles, or APTOS) are applied consistently across the NDIS service system. As agreed by all governments, the APTOS set out the agreed division of service roles and responsibilities between the NDIS and other service systems, including criminal justice systems.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Building on the APTOS, the Commonwealth, in agreement with states and territories, has implemented the following improvements to clarify the justice/NDIS interface:

        </a>
        , states, and territories continue to work together on the remaining actions in progress.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For the avoidance of doubt, all governments have agreed that states and territory criminal justice systems continue to be responsible for meeting the needs of people with disability while they are in detention and for reasonable adjustment in such settings. Supports, above reasonable adjustments made by the criminal justice systems, may be funded by the NDIS and accessed by the participant during their incarceration.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        7. The committee recommends that the National Disability Insurance Agency develop, publish and implement a strategy for engaging with participants in custody to ensure that these participants:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        a. Â Â Â are not unfairly disadvantaged in planning, and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        b. Â Â Â are assigned to planners who have the expertise to work with them.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Noted
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The NDIA has committed resources to overcome the challenges custodial settings present for supporting people with disability to navigate the NDIS, while appreciating the clear state and territory responsibility for criminal justice settings as set out in the APTOS. This includes the introduction of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JLO" rel="nofollow">
         JLO
        </a>
        s in all jurisdictions, undertaking awareness raising activities, and better promotion of standard practices and information sharing in the criminal justice space.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition, the NDIA is developing an external resource, Our Guideline - Justice System. This guideline will explain how the NDIA supports participants in the justice system, and include guidance on both applying to become an NDIS participant or remaining as an NDIS participant. It will have information about the typical supports participants can expect from the NDIS while in the justice system and how planning will occur if they are leaving a custodial setting. This guideline is due for publishing before 30 June 2021.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government has also commissioned independent research to examine the most effective methods and processes for identifying and assessing disability among Aboriginal and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
         Torres Strait Islander
        </a>
        prisoners in all jurisdictions. The final report is expected to be provided to Government in mid-2021, and will provide valuable understanding of this cohort and how to effectively support them in the custodial setting and reintegrate into the community.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        8. The committee recommends that the National Disability Insurance Agency publicly report on its progress in implementing the strategy outlined in Recommendation 7.

       <p class="italic">
        Noted
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government recognises the importance of timely and accurate data collection on participants in the justice system. Improved interface and data sharing between NDIS and state and territory justice systems are being negotiated and defined, in line with Commonwealth, state and territory disability ministers' agreed timeframes. Once improved data collection is available, the NDIA will determine what data (quantitative and qualitative) to include in its comprehensive Quarterly Reports to disability ministers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        9. The committee recommends that the National Disability Insurance Agency provide further training for planners about how participants can access services outside the National Disability Insurance Scheme.

       <p class="italic">
        Supported
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government recognises the importance of ensuring NDIS participants can access mainstream and community supports. The introduction of independent assessments from 2021 will enable Partners in the Community to shift from being involved in planning discussions to focus on advising people with disability and their families and carers on available mainstream and community supports and assisting them to connect with these services. This coordination and facilitation role was originally proposed by the Productivity Commission in its 2011 Disability Care and Support Inquiry Report.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In anticipation of this shift in approach, the NDIA is delivering a new starter capability and development program to the Partners in the Community, which includes a topic on innovative integration of informal, community &amp; mainstream supports to support participants to realise their goals. The NDIA will work closely with its Partners in the Community throughout the rollout of the new approach to planning to ensure they have the required skills and capabilities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        10. The committee recommends that the Australian Government ensure that the resourcing for the National Disability Insurance Agency and its Partners in the Community is sufficient to enable planners to collaborate effectively with different service systems throughout the planning process.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Supported
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In the 2020-21 Budget, the Government announced it will support expenditure of an additional
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        $709.5 million over three years to the NDIA for work to improve flexibility, consistency and certainty for NDIS participants in response to the Tune Review and to support continued efforts to improve the participant experience.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This funding will also ensure recent improvements to reduce NDIS wait times are maintained and the NDIA and the Partners in the Community are appropriately staffed to ensure positive experiences for every person with disability.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government has and will continue to monitor and adjust resources to meet the needs of the NDIS and the people it supports.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        11. The committee recommends that the National Disability Insurance Agency require planners to provide, in planning meetings, personalised material that outlines how the participant could access supports that the National Disability Insurance Scheme will not fund on the basis that the support is available in another service system.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Supported
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government supports participants being provided with personalised information about how they can most effectively use their plan funding to meet their needs and help pursue their goals and aspirations. This includes identifying how to access mainstream and community supports provided outside the NDIS.
       </p>

        Coordination of NDIS supports with mainstream services is currently undertaken by NDIA staff, Partners in the Community, Early Childhood Partners or NDIS-funded support coordinators, who work with participants to ensure the supports in their plans, including mainstream supports, are meeting their needs. The introduction of independent assessments and plan flexibility from 2021 will refocus the Partner in the Community role towards plan implementation, including connection and coordination with mainstream services. To support plan implementation in the future, the NDIA will improve its materials to help participants know how to best use NDIS funds, and to access mainstream services and supports not covered by the NDIS.

        The Government acknowledges that current funding mechanisms, and resulting pricing regulations, differ across programs such as aged care, disability, veterans care and other supports. This variation is expected as there are important differences in the policy objectives and settings of these programs. Participants and client cohorts that have different needs, different regulatory arrangements and service models are in place and there are different market systems and settings. Any comparison of prices between Commonwealth-funded schemes needs to take into account this broader range of factors and settings.

        Price setting in the NDIS is based on a detailed analysis of market conditions and the costs of delivering supports.

        From late-2021, the outcomes of independent assessments will be a key input into deciding the value of a plan budget. This will mean that the current approach to creating a participant's plan budget will change, with the amount of funding in a participants plan informed by their functional capacity as determined through an independent assessment, not a listing of individual reasonable and necessary supports. The participant's plan budget will also reflect any relevant environmental factors, including informal supports available to the participant and other contextual factors such as locality and circumstance . This will ensure a consistent approach to providing funding for people with similar levels of functional capacity and in similar circumstances, with the participant supported to then use that funding flexibly to meet their needs.

         That the Senate take note of the document.
        </p>
        <p>
         I rise to take note of the government's response to the final report of the Joint Standing Committee on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
          NDIS
         </a>
         on its inquiry into NDIS planning. When our committee released its our final report we made 42 recommendations, all of which were aimed at improving the planning process from the participants' perspective. The committee conducted this inquiry in response to years of advocacy from participants, carers, supporters, advocates and groups in the sector who were calling for reform. Of those recommendations, the government has chosen to support, or support in principle, 26 recommendations and to note the remaining 16 recommendations. During this inquiry the committee received 157 submissions and conducted 14 public hearings.
        </p>
        <p>
         As every NDIS participant knows, NDIS planning, along with access, is the primary point at which participants interact with the scheme, so it goes without saying that a good planning process can change life for the better. It's pleasing to note the government's recognition of the importance of providing participants with information about their plans prior to their planning meeting. During the inquiry, the committee received extensive evidence about the many inconsistencies in the planning process and plan funding. Some plans did not include funded supports because in the view of the planner or agency the participants had access to informal support. 'Informal support' essentially means carers supporting the participant. That was essentially what the NDIS were falling back on, that a participant was going to be assisted by members of their family. The committee also heard of discrepancies in funding and support between siblings with the same disability type.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is heartening that the government acknowledges the important role the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIA" rel="nofollow">
          NDIA
         </a>
         has in assisting families and carers of people with disability in the planning process. This is an issue that has been ongoing for a very, very long time. However, the committee's recommendation that caregivers be provided with written information about the types of support that the NDIS can fund remains very, very important. Participants and their advocates have long advocated for specialist planners for participants who are hospitalised to assist with a smooth transition. The government supported this recommendation, and that is welcome. These transitions and other similar experiences can create uncertainty and gaps in support for people with disability. It is essential that various levels of governments and their agencies work together to support some of our most vulnerable citizens. The appointment of 24 health liaison officers nationally is a good first step towards achieving this.
        </p>
        <p>
         Many participants in the NDIS have complex needs and need to access the complex supports needs pathway. The committee recommended that the NDIA publish more information about this pathway, including information on who is eligible and how the NDIA defines the term 'complex support needs'.
        </p>
        <p>
         I note that the NDIA is currently undertaking a review of the pathway but would remind government and the agency that the more information provided to participants, supporters and advocates, the better. Clear advice and information are essential to the planning process succeeding. Throughout the inquiry this was one of the central messages that we received around information and clear advice. It's very clear that that advice that participants and their families are receiving is not clear and not consistent, so work towards ensuring that it is clear and consistent is welcomed.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another key element is ensuring that there is trust in decision-making of the agency in the resourcing and transparency of the appeals process. The need for many of these appeals arises because participants never meet with the NDIA delegate who makes the decision on their plan. For too long the NDIA was slow to respond to appeals lodged with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_Appeals_Tribunal" rel="nofollow">
          Administrative Appeals Tribunal
         </a>
         . Recent improvements are welcome, but the priority of resourcing this task must be maintained. Leaving NDIS participants living with the uncertainty is not good enough and must be addressed by the agency.
        </p>
        <p>
         During our inquiry we also heard about the impact that planning errors had on participants. Initial plans and reviews have often been undertaken by a planner without any knowledge of the participant's disability, and this is an ongoing issue. The stories of planners relying on search engines while conducting meetings with participants are legend. In responding to many of the recommendations in this review the government notes recent announcements or reviews. But as we all know an announcement does not mean that the issue has been resolved. Announcements do not provide us with hope and provide us with an acknowledgement that the government has recognised the need to address the issue.
        </p>
        <p>
         One of the announcements that the government is relying on in its response to this report is their recent commitment to the introduction of independent assessments. The government's determination to now rely on these assessments has already caused a great deal of alarm and concern in the disability community. This supposed reform was announced without adequate consultation and consideration of the needs of NDIS participants. That is why the Joint Standing Committee on the National Disability Insurance Scheme is already conducting a separate inquiry into independent assessments.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are roughly 440,000 people with disability on the NDIS. The rollout of independent assessments is a radical plan. You can't help but wonder if the soul aim of this radical plan is cost cutting. They all have to prove that they have a disability and they've been assessed as being eligible to participate in the scheme. What the government is now proposing is that these 440,000 participants effectively have to requalify for the scheme. The shadow minister for the NDIS has said that people with disability are effectively being asked to reaudition with a complete stranger for the same money they're already gettingâ€”not with the medical specialists that they've been used to over the years or have already received medical reports from, but with a panel of medical people they need to select from. We know that they've already had to convince a range of medical and allied health professionals, and NDIS officials, that they're eligible for the NDIS.
        </p>
        <p>
         The rollout of independent assessments is a radical plan. I can tell you right now that advocates and participants are wondering whether this is not just a way of cost cutting, cutting people's plans. The reality is that this reform is based on shaky evidence and doesn't necessarily promise a fix for the problems with consistency and fairness in planning as outlined in this report. The government says that there's a new approach for planning which will be underpinned by the introduction of independent assessments later in 2021. Advocates and participants are, at best, very unsure about how this process is going to work. At worst, they believe that this is a way to cut their support. But it also adds stress to the planning process. It is stressful. You can imagine, if you had to go through it, how stressful it would be to talk to somebody and, at the moment, perhaps talk to somebody that doesn't even understand anything about your disability or the supports that you need. Here we have the government introducing independent assessments and lauding that as some sort of reform that's going to fix the issue around having fully costed, detailed draft plans. That's not going to happen, because they don't talk to participants or advocates or family members.
