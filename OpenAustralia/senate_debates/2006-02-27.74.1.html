         Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade

        regarding the construction of a new chancery building for the Australian Embassy in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. The proposed chancery will accommodate Australia’s permanent mission to Cambodia, and provide a modern, efficient, pleasant and safe working environment for embassy staff.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

         Canadian Embassy
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The existing chancery is located in a three storey villa built in 1972 and purchased by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Government
        </a>
        in 1992. The current chancery does not meet current security, access, services and space requirements. The proposed chancery will be designed to meet the specific space needs and functions of the tenants whilst providing for some future expansion within the prescribed building setbacks.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The proposal of works includes:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         facilities for official functions, exhibitions and meetings;
        </li>
        <li>
         guardhouses, security support facilities and a perimeter fence;
        </li>
        <li>
         engineering services infrastructure;
        </li>
        <li>
         a water treatment system;
        </li>
        <li>
         on-site water storage tanks with fire fighting capability;
        </li>
        <li>
         official fleet and A-based staff parking; and
        </li>
        <li>
         landscaped surrounds within a secure compound.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Having investigated the proposal, the Committee asked the Department to provide it with further detail on the various parties involved in the project delivery to be provided subsequent to the hearing. However, the Committee was satisfied with its findings and recommends that the works proceed at the estimated cost of $19.93 million.

         Construction of Chancery, Rangoon, Burma

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee’s second report of 2006 deals with a proposal, also by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, to construct a new chancery building in Rangoon, Burma.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Department reported that Australia’s existing chancery is in a building constructed in 1901 and no longer meets functional or security requirements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        After examination of different options, the Department proposed to provide a new purpose-built building to serve as Australia’s permanent mission to Burma. The building will house the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, AusAID and the Australian Federal Police.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        One of the Committee’s concerns was a report that indicated that Burmese bureaucrats had been ordered to leave Rangoon for a new capital which would be located 320 kilometres to the north at Pyinmana near Mandalay. At the public hearing the Department responded, on the best advice it had received to date, that it did not expect the move to have any significant implications for the Chancery.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee has given detailed consideration to the proposal and recommends that the works proceed at the estimated cost of $12.87 million.

         171st Aviation Squadron relocation, Holsworthy Barracks, NSW
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The third report of 2006 presents the Committee’s findings in relation to the proposed relocation of 171
        <sup>
         st
        </sup>
        Aviation Squadron to Holsworthy Barracks, NSW.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Department of Defence’s primary aim in relocating the 171
        <sup>
         st
        </sup>
        Aviation Squadron to Holsworthy is to improve the ability of Army aviation to provide troop lift support to the newly established

         Special Operations
        </a>
        command and counter-terrorist capability also located at the Barracks. The collocation of dedicated army aviation support with counter terrorist and special operation forces is expected to enhance capability and improve safety, thus satisfying one recommendation of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_Inquiry" rel="nofollow">
         Board of Inquiry
        </a>
        into the

         Black Hawk
        </a>
        accident that occurred in Townsville in 1996.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The proposed relocation will include the following elements:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         refurbishment of facilities accommodating command operations and logistic elements; and
        </li>
        <li>
         works to

         to enure satisfactory accommodation for aircraft related facilities.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        The Tharawal Local Aboriginal Land Council and the Cubbitch Barta Native Title Claimants Aboriginal Corporation provided evidence for the Committee at the public hearing. Both groups voiced concerns over heritage concerns on the Holsworthy site and the impact of Defence’s proposal on aboriginal sites. Defence assured the Committee that an environmental consultant had been employed to provide “…an open, transparent and comprehensive public environmental report…” part of which will include Aboriginal cultural heritage issues. After significant discussions with both aboriginal groups and Defence, the Committee recommends in this report that after the consultation process on environmental and cultural heritage matters has been completed, the Department of Defence report its findings to the Committee.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Whilst the Committee wants to ensure that comprehensive environment and heritage examinations are carried out on the Holsworthy site, it does not intend unnecessarily to obstruct the project delivery of the proposal. In this regard, the Committee recommends that the works proceed at the estimated amount of $92 million.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I would like to take the opportunity to thank my Committee colleagues and all those involved in the three inquiries. I commend the reports to the Senate.
