        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Industry and Science, Senator Ronaldson. I refer to the Prime Minister's announcement last week that South Australia will build Australia's future frigates. Given this government has sent the Navy's new supply ships offshore and walked away from a promise to build future submarines in South Australia, isn't it clear that this announcement was designed to save the jobs of the Prime Minister and Mr Pyne, even if that meant sacrificing shipbuilding jobs around Australia?

         I thank Senator Carr for his question. It is always nice to get an industry question from Senator Carr, because they are very few and far between, which I am sure Australian workers will have noted if they have been listening to question time. In fact, there are some in the gallery.

         There were very significant announcements made last week in relation to the naval shipbuilding plan.

           Either you are interested in hearing the answer or you are going to make stupid interjections like that. If you are interested in shipbuilding in this country, if you are actually interested in shipbuilding jobs, then rather than make very silly, stupid little interjections, why don't you listen to what we have planned for the naval shipbuilding industry? I will also be reminding you of what you did not do for six years in relation to the naval shipbuilding industry.

           Over the next two decades Australia will invest over $89 billion to acquire and sustain new submarines, frigates, offshore patrol vessels and other specialist naval vessels. A significant amount of the work to build these new ships will be undertaken in Australia. The Australian naval ship—

             Again, someone else who does not give a damn about Australian jobs, with childish interjections. The naval shipbuilding plan will start the implementation of an historic continuous build of service warships in Australia. It will begin with the future frigates, which have been brought forward by two years to commence construction in 2020.

                   My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, Senator Brandis, and on the same topic of naval shipbuilding. Can the Attorney-General inform the Senate about the government's plans for a strong and sustainable naval shipbuilding industry?

                    Yes, Senator Ruston, I can and, in doing so, I want to acknowledge the advocacy of yourself, Senator Sean Edwards, Senator David Fawcett, Senator Simon Birmingham over there and Senator Cory Bernardi. Their advocacy on behalf of their state, South Australia, contributed to the government's decision announced by the Prime Minister last Tuesday—the most important announcement of Australian shipbuilding in Australian history.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The biggest difference, Senator Ruston—you should know—is that we now have a government in Australia that does have a shipbuilding plan. As Senator Michael Ronaldson pointed out—and it cannot be repeated often enough—for six years the Labor government let Australian naval shipbuilding die on the vine. For six years not one warship was commenced in Australia—delay, indecision and procrastination creating a valley of death which it falls to the Abbott government to repair.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    What we announced last week was that, over the next two decades, Australia will invest over $89 billion to acquire and sustain new submarines, frigates and offshore patrol vessels and other specialised naval vessels. The centrepiece of the government's naval shipbuilding plan will be the implementation of a historic continuous build of service warships in Australia. That has never happened before, but, as a result of the historic decision announced by the Prime Minister last Tuesday, that will be the future of Australian shipbuilding and that will protect jobs for all time.

Both the Secretary of the Department of Defence, Mr Richardson, and the Chief of Defence Force,

                         , have said that it was necessary, if we were going to avoid the 'valley of death', for these projects to be brought forward. That is not what occurred. For six years nothing was done. So we have brought forward the commencement of the offshore patrol vessels to 2018. We have brought forward the construction of the future frigates to 2020. The future frigates will be built in Adelaide. The government will make decisions in the near future as to the location of the construction of the offshore patrol vessels.
