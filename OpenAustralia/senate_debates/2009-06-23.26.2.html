        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Environment, Heritage and the Arts, Senator Wong. Minister, why is it that, after years of the Commonwealth government funding the Indigenous dance festival at Laura in

            , I ask a supplementary question. Could I suggest to the minister that she might ask Senator McLucas, who was there. At that festival Mr Jim Turnour, the member for Leichhardt, said he and Senator McLucas were representing the federal government, and he said that the federal government wanted to ensure the continuing success of the festival so that the Commonwealth could help nurture and protect the culture of Indigenous people. I ask the minister, now that she has had a note from Senator McLucas: was Mr Turnour speaking the truth in that he was saying the federal government wanted to nurture the culture through this festival? If he was speaking the truth, why is it that the government did not provide the normal funding for the festival?

             This is an interesting day for an opposition senator to be talking to the government about speaking the truth. Here is an opposition whose leader called for the Prime Minister of the country to resign on the basis of an email that was found to be false and a forgery—

               and you want to come in here and continue to throw smears at hardworking members of the government. I have no doubt that the member for Leichhardt as well as Senator McLucas will be putting the case for that community as strongly as they put other cases for the communities they represent. They are outstanding representatives of

               in this parliament, and I am sure they will be putting their views very clearly to Minister Garrett and the government on this issue. But for you to come in here and yet again suggest that somebody is not telling the truth really demonstrates that those on the other side have no strategy other than a low-rent strategy.

                       I have to say that, although there is stiff competition, I think Senator Macdonald wins the prize for the most relevance deprivation in this place. It is all about him, isn’t it? ‘I wrote a letter. I did this. It’s all about me.’ Senator, I am not sure this is the place for you to deal with those personal issues and your difficulty around the fact that you are not in government. I have said on this issue I am not aware of the detail of what funding has or has not been made available, and I will seek advice from Minister Garrett and provide an answer to the Senate. It is unfortunate that Senator Macdonald chooses to use question time to smear members of the government who cannot stand up in response to his question, but he is in fine company, because that is the way Mr Turnbull approaches these matters.
