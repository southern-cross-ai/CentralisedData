        My question is to the Minister representing the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Regional Development, Senator McKenzie. The Auditor-General's scathing report into the regional jobs and investment packages revealed ministers gave four project exemptions from the 50 per cent co-funding requirements worth over $1.74 million, including $365,000 for a food van on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flinders_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Flinders Island
        </a>
        in Tasmania without a cent from the proponent. What evidence did ministers rely upon in awarding this grant and co-funding exemption?

         Thank you very much, Senator Urquhart, for your question. I'll have to take the details of that on notice and check with ministers concerned. But I've already stated in answer to previous questions that the Australian government notes the findings of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANAO" rel="nofollow">
          ANAO
         </a>
         performance audit on the awarding of funding under this particular program. The department's working proactively to address issues. Despite the assertions being made and the cherry-picking of certain sections of the ANAO report, it's worth noting that apparently the ANAO report concluded that there was no bias 'evident in the assessment and decision-making' process concerning funding of projects in RJIP regions over others. The Regional Jobs Investment Package delivers much-needed funds to regional communities to stimulate employment not just into the future but in the here and now. In respect of requests for specific project details, it's all publicly available on the website.

          The food van's proponent told the Launceston

          the approved project was originally a physical cafe and community centre, and the viability of the enterprise is questionable. What steps has the government taken to ensure these $365,000 grant for a food van represents value for money?

              report in its entirety actually makes some helpful suggestions, which the department has taken on board. Rather than cherry-picking certain sections, the conclusion of the report was there was no bias 'evident in the assessment and decision-making process' concerning funding of projects in RJIP regions over others. That is what the report found. Now, could processes improve? The department's looking at that, and I'm getting more information handed to me. In selecting each of the 10 regions, the government considered a range of factors, including recent structural changes in the local economy, and whether or not the regions were under pressure from falling commodity prices and the downturn in the mining and manufacturing sectors. In each region we had local planning committees develop local investment plans that provided economic—
