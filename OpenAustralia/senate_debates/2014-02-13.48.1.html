         The Australian government considers that engaging Sri Lanka, not isolating it, is the most effective way to encourage and advance progress on human rights and accountability, the rule of law and democratic governance, and to promote reconciliation. The government continues to urge the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan" rel="nofollow">
          Sri Lankan
         </a>
         government to give the highest priority to implementing the recommendations of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lessons_Learnt_and_Reconciliation_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission
         </a>
         and regularly raises human rights issues with it. The government also consistently urges Sri Lanka to ensure all allegations of serious international crimes committed by both sides to the civil conflict are investigated and prosecuted in a transparent and independent manner. A decision on whether Australia will co-sponsor a

          UN
         </a>
         Human Rights Council in March will be made after due consideration of the final text and the balance of issues it raises. The motion as it stands would pre-empt this and, for that reason, we cannot support it. We encourage all parties to take a constructive approach towards the proposed resolution. Any resolution must go to assist the process of reconciliation.
