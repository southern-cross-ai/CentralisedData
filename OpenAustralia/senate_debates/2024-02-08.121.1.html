        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Senator Wong. Last month, in one of the most scathing Federal Court judgements in memory, Justice Natalie Charlesworth found: that the actions of the Environmental Defenders Office and its team were severely lacking in integrity; that they distorted, misrepresented and confected evidence; and that they manipulated and coached a number of traditional owners in the Munkara and Santos case. Especially after all of the warnings that the government was given about the problems, including green lawfare and the social and economic devastation that it would trigger, does the Albanese Labor government finally now concede that its October 2022 budget decision to supply $8.3 million to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDO" rel="nofollow">

         Thank you to Senator Duniam for the question. Justice Charlesworth's comments speak for themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
         Well, Senator Whish-Wilson, I don't think anybody, regardless of their political persuasion, can suggest that some of the actions which were commented on by the judge are appropriate. So I do take that view. I understand that the minister has written to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
          CEO
         </a>
         of the

          EDO

         , making clear that the expectation is that the office act ethically and professionally, and that the minister has asked her department to ensure that the EDO's conduct is in accordance with their grant agreement.

          <p>
           A slap on the wrists! During question time on 28 November last year, Minister, you responded to my question on the fact that the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDO" rel="nofollow">
            EDO
           </a>
           was engaging in claim farming and was exploiting consultation processes by saying that, if it was the case:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           â€¦ they should be brought to the attention of the legislature and the executive.
          </p>
          <p>
           Minister, the legislature was bypassed in the approval of funding for this organisation and the judiciary has slammed, as you've just mentioned, the EDO's dreadfully unethical practices. So I ask the executive, through you: will the government now cease funding this terrible organisation?

            Again, I simply refer back to my earlier answer, which is that I am advised that the minister has asked the secretary of her department to ensure that the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDO" rel="nofollow">
             EDO
            </a>
            's conduct is in accordance with their grant agreement. Obviously the government will receive that advice and the government will consider that and the matters to which you referred.

                 Thank you, yes. I have responded previously, Senator Duniam, to your earlier questions prior to this case about the principles which underlie the government funding an organisation, whether or not we agree with the organisation, in a system where there is the rule of law that enables appropriate actions to be considered. Obviously, what we have now is a judgement with some substantial criticism of the

                  EDO
                 </a>
                 by Justice Charlesworth, and, as I've informed the Senate, the minister has asked her department to provide advice about whether or not the EDO's conduct is in accordance with the grant agreement.
