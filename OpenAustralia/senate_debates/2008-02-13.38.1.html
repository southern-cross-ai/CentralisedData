         Ensuring the Australian population has access to fast and affordable broadband is a key priority for the Rudd Labor government. We are keen to work with the telecommunications industry to ensure Australians have access to the best available broadband. When Telstra approached my office last year after the election seeking regulatory certainty in regard to fixed line broadband services, I was quick to act and overcome the stalemate that had arisen between the former government and Telstra. As regulatory certainty is rightly a matter for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
          ACCC
         </a>
         , I sought their advice. The chairman of the ACCC, Mr Samuel, brought to my attention a number of very consistent public statements relating to the regulation of wholesale access to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADSL" rel="nofollow">
          ADSL
         </a>
         services. I then wrote to Telstra and informed them of my position. In particular, I noted that, in agreement with the ACCC, I believe there is a high degree of regulatory certainty in relation to the ACCC’s approach to wholesale
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADSL2" rel="nofollow">
          ADSL2
         </a>
         + services—a high degree of certainty. The letter that I wrote to Telstra is publicly available. It is there for all to see on my department’s website.
        </p>
        <p>
         I was pleased that the government was able to provide assurance to Telstra in regard to regulation. As a result, Telstra announced on 6 February that they would switch on high-speed ADSL2+ broadband in 900—that is right: 900—telephone exchanges servicing almost 2½ million homes. Telstra have already made ADSL2+ available from 370 telephone exchanges in the past week, serving approximately 1.8 million households—that is right: 1.8 million households. Within the next two weeks, 132 exchanges, serving over 230,000 households, will start providing ADSL2+—that is right. Over the next 200 days Telstra will install ADSL2+ in a further 405 exchanges across Australia, covering another 330,000 households. As a result of the decision, download speeds of up to 20 megabits per second will now be available in more cities and towns across the country.
        </p>
        <p>
         I noted with great interest that the former minister for communications, Senator Coonan, has claimed that she offered Telstra a letter of comfort. This is despite the fact that Telstra’s general counsel, Will Irving, has denied this was the case, stating:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         She never signed any letter, she never sent any letter ...
        </p>
        <p>
         and:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         She’s again just living in a bit of a world of her own, to be honest.
        </p>
        <p>
         As I said earlier, the Rudd Labor government will drag Australia out of the digital dark ages, reforming the telecommunications sector for the benefit of all Australians.
