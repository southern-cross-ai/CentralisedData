        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Evans. I refer to the leaking to the media of details of the Prime Minister’s private and confidential conversation with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_President" rel="nofollow">
         United States President
        </a>
        on 10 October. What explanation did Australia’s ambassador in the United States provide to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Department" rel="nofollow">
         State Department
        </a>
        for this false, misleading and damaging leak?

         I thank Senator Coonan for her question, which is very similar to the question she asked me yesterday. I think I told her all that I know about the subject yesterday, and I am not going to be able to add much to my remarks. I do not quite understand the intense interest in this issue. I have been moving through the community in the last few weeks—ethnic communities, cricket matches et cetera—and no-one has actually raised this as a matter of national concern with me. Maybe I am not moving in the right circles. As I indicated yesterday, the President of the United States has consistently emphasised the importance of the G20 in its response to the global financial crisis. The Prime Minister did speak with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Bush" rel="nofollow">
          President Bush
         </a>
         to discuss the role of the G20 in responding to the global financial crisis. I do not think there is any accuracy in the suggestion that the President was not fully aware of the role of the G20. As I understand it, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House" rel="nofollow">
          White House
         </a>
         , the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Ambassador" rel="nofollow">
          United States Ambassador
         </a>
         and the Prime Minister have confirmed that the President did not make the marks that have been attributed to him in the article in question. Therefore, it seems to me that all the relevant parties have made it clear that the alleged commentary was never made and was inaccurate. The United States Ambassador has said publicly that, as far as he and the American government are concerned, the matter is closed. I have no further information in relation to the role of the Australian Ambassador in Washington. I can take that part of the question on notice and see if I can be more helpful to the senator, but I am not able to help her with that specific part of the question.

          I note that Senator Evans will take on notice that part of the question that he was not able to address. Perhaps he can also take this on notice: when will the Prime Minister apologise to the United States administration for this unprofessional and undiplomatic breach of confidentiality?

           As I have said, all parties have confirmed that the remarks were not made and that the matter is closed. I think there is nothing further to be said on the subject.
