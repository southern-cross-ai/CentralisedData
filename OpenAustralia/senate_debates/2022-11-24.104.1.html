        I've just come from a presentation by Dr Jordan Peterson. He's done a lot of work exposing the Left's infestation of the West's education systems, as well as defending free speech and championing open and honest dialogue about difficult subjects. It was wonderful to hear someone other than myself—I feel like I just talk to blank walls all the time in this place—trying to get the message across about ordinary people out there. He's right in what he's saying because he travels the world.

       <p>
        Here we are trying to deal with climate change, yet we're allowing people in this country and across the world to live in absolute poverty. They are hanging on by their fingernails and dropping off the edge because the main thing is that they cannot afford cheap energy. Cheap energy drives everything. Yet we have governments that have constantly put in place systems that are driving up the cost of power and causing the loss of jobs. That's the main factor. You're worrying about saving the planet at the expense of people living in poverty and not being able to have a decent life. The whole fact is that you have 20 million people a year who die due to the air that they breathe in. These people living in poverty without electricity are actually dying because of the dung they burn in their fires. You're not dealing with that, because you couldn't care less about it. You're all worried about saving the planet.
       </p>
       <p>
        Here we have the Labor Party, which is all about the working class people, but they prefer to see them in poverty and heading down this path. Do you know what it's all about? People need to start growing up. They need to start taking responsibility for their own actions, make decisions and not be led by those who will fill their heads with garbage and rubbish. That is happening in our education system with the indoctrination of children, which I spoke about and covered in my bill. Get out of telling people how to live their lives. People need to grow up, get a backbone and stand up for themselves.
