        Introduction
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        One of Australia's first coal fired power stations started in Yallourn in Victoria in the 1920s.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It was powered by the vast brown coal deposits of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latrobe_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Latrobe Valley
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Over the coming decade, Australia's first offshore wind turbines will also start to run in the waters off the Latrobe Valley.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Harnessing the power of the Bass Strait Winds.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Generations of Australians have powered this nation safely, reliably and with dignity.

       <p class="italic">
        This

        Australian industry.

       <p class="italic">
        Australian communities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Working together to power every part of our nation and every one of us.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The way we power Australia will change.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But those who do it will not.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The target is clear—achieve net zero emissions by 2050 to avoid the most dangerous impacts of climate change.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The pathway is clear—power our industries, light our homes, our businesses and fuel our transport with clean energy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        is determined that Australian workers and Australian ingenuity will get us there.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As the Prime Minister has said, we can be a renewable energy superpower.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We can not only power our transformation but that of the rest of the world as well.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But it may not happen automatically.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The opportunities will not seize themselves.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As the race to net zero accelerates—and it is a race—we must ensure Australian workers and communities are supported to play their part.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We know there are communities in which the experience of the transition will be most concentrated.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Government knows that we must support these communities and those that live in them.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Government also knows the critical role it can play.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To better coordinate programs and policies, to attract investors and help communities make the most of the transformation opportunities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We will engage major stakeholders in the decision making and support structures.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We will help deliver Australia's future as a renewable energy superpower.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We will leave no one behind.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In the net zero global economy of the future, it is hard to imagine where else you would rather be.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Where else than Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Home to abundant renewable energy sources.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To every metal and critical mineral essential to net zero technologies.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Our geography has gifted us much.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But only by working together will we be able to grab the opportunities of the future.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Previous government
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Less than two years ago, the approach of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Government
        </a>
        was very different.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australia Government had:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Back then, the Australian Government could not even agree to a long term energy policy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        One former Liberal Premier went so far as to describe it as a:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        'slow-moving train wreck.'
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In the time since, Australia has changed significantly.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Albanese government
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Last month the Prime Minister described the history of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liddell_Power_Station" rel="nofollow">
         Liddell Power Station
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        He explained:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        'It's a snapshot of the economic and energy transformation underway in Australia, particularly in regional Australia.'
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        'A journey that every advanced economy has embarked on.'
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        'And a race that Australia can win.'
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Since the 2022 election, the Albanese Government has acted to address climate change.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We have also put Australia on the path to becoming a renewable energy superpower.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        With over $40 billion invested in Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This includes:

       <ul>

       <p class="italic">
        We have also supported Australian industries, workers and communities to participate in the shift to net zero.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Net Zero Economy Authority
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Net Zero Economy Authority will be a new statutory agency.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Its functions will be to:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>

       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        The Net Zero Economy Authority's mission will be to promote orderly and positive economic transformation for Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For regions and workers, as the world decarbonises.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This recognises that the way in which we navigate economic transformation is as important as reaching the destination of a net zero economy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As emissions-intensive industries and technologies decarbonise, the Authority will help ensure Australians can access the opportunities new net zero industries bring.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Communities
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is critical that we support workers and communities throughout the transition.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Authority" rel="nofollow">
         The Authority
        </a>
        will be a partner, on behalf of Government, with industry and investors.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It will help to get the big transformational projects happening.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For example:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        The Authority will work with project proponents, state governments and others to get projects to investment decision.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It will mobilise public and private financing support, address enabling infrastructure needs and navigate regulatory processes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Authority will be the Government shop-front for industry and investors.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Helping as they seize the opportunities of Australia's transformation to a net zero economy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This will assist our regions to become the economic powerhouses of our future net zero economy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Industrial regions like Gladstone, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Hunter Valley
        </a>
        , Latrobe Valley, Upper Spencer Gulf and the Pilbara, have powered Australia's economy for generations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This can and should continue the transition to net zero.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Authority will help place these regions in a position to continue to play the vital role they always have.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Authority will also play an important role in supporting community understanding of the transformation to a net zero emissions economy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Ensuring Australians are engaged in the process and confident in its outcomes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government wants to be a partner with communities in navigating the change.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Especially in regions where the changes will be more significant.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And with First Nations Australians, providing opportunities for economic advancement.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        By partnering with workers and communities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        By building understanding and relationships.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We can ensure that no one is left behind as we build the industries and jobs that underpin our future prosperity.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Workers
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Authority will ensure workers receive the support they need.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Authority will work with employers, unions and others to assist workers to engage in new opportunities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As part of this, the Bill will establish the legislative framework for an Energy Industry Jobs Plan.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Administered by the Authority, the Plan will enable the use of pooled redeployment arrangements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These will support workers in closing coal-fired power stations and closing gas-fired generators, and their dependent suppliers to transition directly to a new job.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Workers in a closing facility will have opportunities to be redeployed into a new job with another employer in the same or a similar industry.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Closing and dependent employers will be encouraged to participate voluntarily.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Our largest coal fired power stations are run by mature corporations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        They often have strong plans in place to support their workforce as they prepare for closures.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We expect many of them will put their hand up to participate in the Energy Industry Jobs Plan.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill provides the Fair Work Commission with powers to require their participation as a failsafe to make sure the transition is orderly.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It enlivens enforceable obligations for those closing employers to provide transitional support to their employees, subject to operational requirements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Authority would encourage receiving employers to participate voluntarily.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill does not include compulsory participation of receiving employers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Those receiving employers that put their hand up will be in pole position to grab highly skilled and experienced workers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This community of interested employers will give workers the greatest opportunity to secure alternative employment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The proposed model for the plan reflects the outcomes of detailed consultations with employee and employer groups.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This is about supporting workers on the frontline of the energy transition.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And supporting businesses to access the skills and experience they value.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Helping workers and their families stay in place helps communities stay whole.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Helping some businesses with challenging closures and others to deliver ambitious growth targets means making regional economies more robust and resilient.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Stakeholder support
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The global economy is experiencing the biggest transformation since the industrial revolution.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The spectrum of stakeholders for the transition to net zero is wide.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This is why it is so pleasing that the Government's approach has such broad support.

       <p class="italic">
        But keep them wide open so all Australians can get through.
