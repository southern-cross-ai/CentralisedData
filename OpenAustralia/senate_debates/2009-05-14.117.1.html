         Order! Senator Fisher, you are entitled to be heard in silence. Some of your colleagues could not hear the question and would like it repeated. This is an important part of question time. People are entitled to hear the question during question time. Extraneous interjections do not help the conduct of question time. I believe—and I have been reasonably fair on this—that people should be heard in silence when the question is being asked. I think that is one of the things which we need to pay closer attention to in this chamber. Senator Fisher, I understand your question has not been fully heard and I ask you to ask it again. Those on my right, refrain from interjections.

           It is disappointing that you clearly have not read the entire speech—I can only encourage you to—because you would have seen that I was actually not referring to the equipment that would be put into individuals’ homes; what I was describing was the boxes on the end of the big, fat pipes. That is technical jargon, for those over there! So I was not actually referring to that equipment, but I am happy to answer questions about the pricing.
          </p>
          <p>
           The government recognises that affordability is an important factor that will drive take-up of services on the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
            NBN
           </a>
           . NBN prices cannot be structured without considering the prices people pay today for comparable services. Pricing levels on the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network" rel="nofollow">
            National Broadband Network
           </a>
           will be a key issue considered in the implementation study, but let me take this opportunity to dispel a few myths. First, the NBN is a historic microeconomic reform. It is Australia’s first national wholesale-only open access network. It is important to remind those opposite of this because they shirked the tough decisions on this for 12 years and privatised Telstra without ever properly resolving it.
          </p>
          <p>
           How does this relate to retail prices for consumers? No retail company will be able to control the network in its own interests. The discipline of genuine competitive pressure will drive lower prices, innovation and greater choice of services at price points. Retail companies—

            , I rise on a point of order going to relevance—and direct relevance, as the standing orders now require. I am sure you will point out to the minister that he has just 12 seconds left to answer. He was asked a very direct question as to whether the $1,000 costs for connection were included. I ask you to get the minister to answer that direct question and be directly relevant in the 12 seconds that remain.

I have been directly relevant in dealing with the pricing that individuals will face. I am addressing that specific issue.

                   Again, the reference that the good senator is drawing from my speech was not actually talking about the equipment that is to be installed in the home. My quote was not actually referring to that. But, to deal with the question I think you are trying to ask, the pricing involved in the

                   includes all of the relevant equipment necessary. Whether or not an individual chooses to install the connection and have it connected will be a function of whether the individual would like to have it. The Labor Party takes the view that this is an essential utility in the same way that the telephone, gas, electricity and water are, so we will provide the connection. It is then entirely in consumers’ hands whether they choose to take the next step.

                    , I ask a further supplementary question. What additional price will consumers have to pay for internal wiring to access fibre to the home? When, Minister, will you be up front with Australian consumers about what they will have to spend to access fibre to the home above and beyond their already massive taxpayer spend?

                     I guess that I will have to explain to those opposite the difference between a wholesale and a retail company. Notwithstanding that those opposite have continued to claim we are going to need five million customers to make it pay, I do not believe this

                     s there are in the country. The marketplace and the ISPs will engage in price competition to attract customers, and therefore that will be part of the package ultimately to be charged, but that will be a matter for the retail providers, not the wholesale company, for which we will be providing the connection. Think of it as if it were a phone. When you have the phone installed, you seek to get it connected; there is a connection fee, and that is charged by—
