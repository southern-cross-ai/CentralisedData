        He was a peace activist and environmentalist, a civil rights campaigner and union man. He collected the songs of America's poor and poorly treated. He made their melodies popular, conserving their truths for posterity. He provided the soundtrack to the civil rights movement and countless other struggles for justice. He was

        Pete Seeger was born on 3 May 1919 in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" rel="nofollow">
         New York
        </a>
        , the youngest of three sons born to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Louis_Seeger" rel="nofollow">
         Charles Louis Seeger
        </a>
        and Constance de Clyver Edson. Music and idealism were in the blood. His father's people were religious dissenters and abolitionists who migrated from Germany to New England during the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution" rel="nofollow">
         American Revolution

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Seeger" rel="nofollow">
         Charles Seeger
        </a>
        was a Harvard educated composer, widely regarded as the father of American musicology. Constance was an accomplished concert violinist and alumna of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Conservatory" rel="nofollow">

        Seeger attended

         Avon Old Farms
        </a>
        , an elite boarding school, where he shined shoes and worked in the kitchen to meet the fees. Like his father he attended Harvard, where he founded a radical paper and joined the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Communist_League" rel="nofollow">
         Young Communist League
        </a>
        . Disillusioned by Harvard's elitist atmosphere and narrow curriculum, he eventually left for the excitement and opportunity of New York City. But New York during the Depression offered little opportunity for Seeger, who wanted to be a journalist or painter. His dishevelled appearance thwarted his attempts at securing a job in journalism; his lack of talent, his artistic ambition. A teacher looking over his portfolio casually asked Seeger what else he did. 'Well, I play the banjo,' Seeger answered. 'I've never heard you play the banjo,' the teacher responded, 'but I'd suggest you stick to that.'
       </p>

        He took a job at the

        at the Library of Congress, where he immersed himself in American folk music. But his first break came as a member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almanac_Singers" rel="nofollow">
         Almanac Singers
        </a>
        , a five-piece group that included
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Guthrie" rel="nofollow">
         Woody Guthrie
        </a>
        . Their album,

        , remained a staple of the labour movement for decades. The group's links to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front" rel="nofollow">

        , entertaining troops in the Pacific. At war's end, he helped establish
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Songs" rel="nofollow">
         People's Songs
        </a>
        , an artistic and political alliance created to 'make a singing labour movement'. But, as

         Roosevelt's New Deal
        </a>
        unravelled and the Taft-Hartley act took effect, the music stopped for People's Songs. In 1948 Seeger joined a new group,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Weavers" rel="nofollow">
         The Weavers
        </a>
        . A series of hit singles followed beginning with

          Goodnight Irene
         </a>
        </i>
        . But popularity brought scrutiny and Cold War questions lingered. The Weavers were blacklisted in 1953 and Seeger was targeted by the House Un-American Activities Committee. In August 1955 he testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee but refused to answer any questions about himself or others. Responding to questions on his political associations, he said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am not going to answer any questions as to my association, my philosophical or religious beliefs or my political beliefs, or how I voted in any election, or any of these private affairs. I think these are very improper questions for any American to be asked …
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1961 Pete Seeger was found guilty of contempt of Congress and sentenced to 10 years jail—a sentence overturned on appeal. Undeterred, Seeger's activism continued. In 1965 he joined the thousands who marched from Selma to Montgomery in support of civil rights. But his lasting contribution to this cause was to popularise an anthem first sung by striking tobacco workers from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina" rel="nofollow">

          We Shall Overcome
         </a>
        </i>
        . It became the soundtrack of that struggle. In 1967 he again courted controversy with
        <i>

        </a>
        . At the time his banjo carried the slogan 'this machine surrounds hate and forces it to surrender'—an ode to, and alteration of, Woody Guthrie's 'this machine kills fascists'. In the same period Seeger helped establish an environmental group focused on cleaning up his native
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_River" rel="nofollow">

        <i>

        to raise environmental awareness. At the time many were baffled by the idea, but to this day the

        Tall, wiry, austere—some would say that he lent radical politics a certain dignity, a certain resolve and a respectability borne of his New England reserve.

        said, 'He had a sense of the musician as a historical entity, of being a link in the thread of people who sing in others' voices.' Seeger was both an artist and an archivist—a producer and preserver of song.
