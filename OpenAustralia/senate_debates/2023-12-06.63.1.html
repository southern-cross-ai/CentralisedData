       <p>
        I rise to speak on the incredible legacy of Peta Murphy, for whom we've heard moving condolences in the other place today. The impact that Peta's passing has had on the parliament, her colleagues, her family and her friends reflects the significant impact that Peta had on the broader Australian community and on the health outcomes of Australian women, particularly those battling metastatic breast cancer.
       </p>
       <p>
        Peta's personal strength and resilience was absolutely undeniable. She faced a difficult battle against the harsh and insidious adversary that is breast cancer, not once but twice. Her second diagnosis was only days before she was due to come into this place as a member of parliament, yet her strong conviction to advocate for the matters that mattered most to her and her unrelenting passionate kept her in this place every day she could be here.
       </p>
       <p>
        Peta was a powerful advocate, particularly for breast cancer awareness, treatments and funding. Her advocacy encouraged more women to book themselves in for a check-up and allowed more women to benefit from early detectionâ€”something that, sadly, Peta didn't have the opportunity to do. We know that that is critical for someone to survive. This is an inspiring legacy that has literally saved the lives of Australian women and will no doubt continue to do so.
       </p>
       <p>
        I had the privilege of engaging in genuine discussions with Peta throughout our shared time in support of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_Cancer_Network_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Breast Cancer Network Australia
        </a>
        , which she was an invaluable contributor to and supporter of. I was also privileged to attend the launch of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCNA" rel="nofollow">
         BCNA
        </a>
        's new report last week on how we can make metastatic breast cancer count through critical data collection, which I know she felt strongly about, even though she wasn't able to attend. This was a poignant opportunity to recognise the incredible advocacy of Peta, whose legacy will live on as we continue her important work to achieve better outcomes for women battling breast cancer and for those who are at risk of diagnosis. Peta, it was a privilege to have known you.
