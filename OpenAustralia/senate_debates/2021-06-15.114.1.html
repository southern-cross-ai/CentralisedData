        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, Senator Payne. At estimates, I asked the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_Army" rel="nofollow">
         Chief of Army
        </a>
        about the issues at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_University_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
         Sydney University Regiment
        </a>
        . Since then I've heard more stories about young cadets and Army reservists training to be officers being pushed around and harassed by older officers who think they own the joint. Is the Minister for Defence confident that the next cohort of 18- and 19-year-old gap-year officer cadets and Army reservists who go through the Sydney University Regiment will be safe from abuse, illegal room searches and other unacceptable behaviour from the hierarchy?

         I thank Senator Lambie for her question. Senator Lambie—through you,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">

         , but I can absolutely reiterate the expectations of the highest standards of behaviour applying right across the system, including to the regiment, its leadership and its administration. I will take the details of Senator Lambie's question on notice and provide further information to the chamber.

           The cadets and Army reservists training to be officers who have blown the whistle and told me and others what's going on here have been incredibly brave. What protections is the minister planning to put in place to make sure there won't be serious consequences for their careers because they have finally found the courage to speak out? We're going to have the same thing going on with the royal commission unless we give full protection to diggers to come forward so we can get to the bottom of why we have suicides. So is there anything put in place?

            Again, I will take the specific details of Senator Lambie's question on notice, but I can say that the bravery, strength and leadership it takes to speak out to call out inappropriate behaviour is most certainly acknowledged, not just in relation to the ADF and not just in relation to cadet and reserve units but much more broadly across our society and our communities. So I do acknowledge that, and I agree with Senator Lambie that appropriate support should be provided to those people who are appropriately calling out bad behaviour where it exists, no matter where that happens.

              As usual, the ADF has called in one of its own, a colonel from the very regiment that is dishing out the abuse. Why haven't the military police or IGADF been asked to investigate serious allegation of illegal room searches instead of the ADF doing a stupid fact find that we know will go nowhere? There is no central database for these fact finds to report to. Once again, you would think that, with a royal commission coming up, they would be trying a little bit harder to make sure the right people are investigating these things that are going on in their regiments. Why not?
