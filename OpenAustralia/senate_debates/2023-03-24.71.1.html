        My question is directed to Senator Farrell in his capacity representing the Minister for Resources. Nuclear submarines mean weapons grade nuclear waste. Five Australian governments over 70 years have tried and failed to find a suitable place for the permanent storage of our existing low- and intermediate-level waste from medical and research activities. Even finding a site for low-level waste in our state of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        has met with very strong opposition from local communities and

        </a>
        deal locks Australia into managing large quantities of weapons-grade waste, requiring military protection for more than 100,000 years. Neither the US nor the UK have moved beyond temporary storage of this material. Given that no-one on the planet has found a permanent solution, isn't it true that your government will also be unable to dispose of this dangerous waste and will simply kick the problem down the road to our kids decades ahead.

         I thank Senator Pocock for her question and for her interest in this particular topic. I guess the short answer to your direct question is that no decision has yet been made on the location for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel.

          I'm trying to answer your question, Senator Pocock, in the most honest way I can. You could at least give me the opportunity to complete the answer. I sat in silence while you asked your question. I would appreciate the same courtesy while I'm giving you the answer. I'm pointing out that there is the issue of low-level nuclear waste. The previous government attempted to resolve that issue in respect of a site in Kimba in South Australia. By the end of this year, Defence, in consultation with the Australian Radioactive Waste Agency, will complete a review to identify sites within the Defence estate that could be technically suitable for the storage and disposal of radioactive waste, including spent nuclear fuel. The process to identify—

                   I thank Senator Pocock for her second supplementary question. I can certainly give you this assurance, Senator Pocock: any spent fuel from the nuclear submarines will not be stored or disposed of at the National Radioactive Waste Management Facility at Kimba. There are legal proceedings underway in respect of a dispute about the site at Kimba. I think that, in the circumstances that there are legal proceedings underway, generally speaking we don't comment on those particular proceedings and we allow those proceedings to take their course and, of course, abide by any decisions that might come out of those proceedings.
