        My question is to my good friend and colleague the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis. Can the Attorney-General update the Senate on recent counter-terrorism activity—this is a serious question—in Sydney?

         It is an important question. Last night, two people were arrested in Sydney and charged for the offence of acts in preparation of a terrorism offence under section 101.6 of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Code" rel="nofollow">
          Criminal Code
         </a>
         . Regrettably, this is another episode and another reminder that the terrorist threat to Australia is real. Tactical operations police arrested both people at their residence in Fairfield in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
          Western Sydney
         </a>
         . This action is likely to have prevented harm to innocent Australians and potentially saved one or more lives. I can confirm that the information received by the Joint Counter Terrorism Team indicated that a terrorist attack in Western Sydney was imminent.

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
          AFP
         </a>
         deputy commissioner, Mick Phelan, made it clear at his press conference today that the comprehensive reform of our national security legislation is already helping our agencies deal with this problem. The foreign fighters act lowered the arrest threshold in relation to terrorism offences from belief on reasonable grounds to suspicion on reasonable grounds. The lower threshold allows police to respond in a more dynamic and flexible manner, and the need for the new legislation was highlighted by yesterday's arrests. An alleged imminent terrorist attack was reported and the two men were arrested by police under the new lower terrorism arrest threshold. I was advised this morning by the AFP commissioner, Andrew Colvin, that it may be the case that the arrests would not have been able to be made under the higher tests under the previous legislation. Both suspects have been refused bail.

           Yes, I can. The investigation of the alleged terrorist activities of these two suspects, known as 'Operation Castrum', is a
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales_Police_Force" rel="nofollow">
            New South Wales Police Force
           </a>
           and Joint Counter Terrorism Team investigation. Police will allege that the two suspects purchased a large knife before returning to their home. Searches were subsequently conducted at the residence, on the motor vehicle and at their places of employment. Located at the residence were an ISIL flag, a machete and the large knife purchased earlier that day. Significantly, police also located a video recording of one suspect kneeling in front of an ISIL flag with the knife and machete, making a politically motivated statement threatening to undertake violent acts with those weapons. Other items have been seized as well, and the investigation is continuing.

             As all honourable senators know, keeping Australians safe is this government's No. 1 priority. Last year, the government committed an additional $630 million to provide our security and law enforcement agencies with the resources they need to effectively counter and deal with terrorism planning. Our agencies will continue to work tirelessly to detect, disrupt and prosecute those who seek to do us harm. The government also provided our agencies with a range of new powers under legislative amendments to help combat the evolving terrorist threat. As I pointed out in my answer to the primary question, the advice of Commissioner Colvin of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
              AFP
             </a>
             is that the arrest that was effected in Sydney late yesterday may not have been possible under the old law, but it was made possible by the reforms which this Senate passed when it passed the foreign fighters act. Might I finally say that yesterday's action again highlights the professionalism and bravery of our law enforcement and security officers.
