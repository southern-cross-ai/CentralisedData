         I thank Senator Paterson for the question. Yes, I am. It was revealed over the weekend that a significant donation was made in 2005 from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Workers'_Union" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Workers' Union
         </a>
         to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GetUp" rel="nofollow">
          GetUp
         </a>
         !. This was when the current Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten, was the national secretary of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWU" rel="nofollow">
          AWU
         </a>
         . Based on the reports, Mr Shorten's union donated the sum of $100,000 to GetUp!. In addition to being the national secretary of the AWU at this time, Mr Shorten was also a board member of GetUp!, a supposedly independent organisation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite being asked questions about these serious matters, and the potential conflict of interest, Mr Shorten has today failed to provide answers and has merely referred the matter to GetUp!. Unsurprisingly, we're still waiting for answers. But there are very serious questions that Mr Shorten has to respond to. He needs to provide evidence that this $100,000 donation was within the AWU's rules. AWU rule number 57 states:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         A loan, grant or donation, must not be made by the Union or any Branch as the case may be, unless the National Executive of the Union has:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (a) Satisfied itself:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (i) that the making of the loan, grant or donation, would be in accordance with the Rules of the Union; and
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         …   …   …
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b)   Approved the making of the loan, grant or donation.
        </p>
        <p>
         So the question for Mr Shorten is a simple one: was this $100,000 donation of AWU members' money validly authorised under the rules?

            , hardworking Australians whose union should act in their best interests, not in its own. It is unconscionable that their membership fees could be spent on boosting Mr Shorten's political profile rather than fighting for their best interests. As senators will recall,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSU" rel="nofollow">

            </a>
            , as national secretary of that union, on his own political campaign, without authorisation of the union's rules. Again, Mr Shorten needs to answer the questions: was the $100,000 donation from the AWU authorised under the union rules, and did Mr Shorten declare a conflict of interest?

               Yes, I am. The donation is not an isolated incident. When Mr Shorten was the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWU" rel="nofollow">
                AWU
               </a>
               national secretary, the AWU made another generous donation, to the Labor campaign for the federal seat of Maribyrnong, where, as it happens, Mr Shorten was the Labor candidate. The donation was made on 14 September 2007.
              </p>
              <p>
               Mr Shorten has again failed to answer similar questions in relation to this donation. A very simple question: was it made in accordance with the AWU's rules? The rules are clear on what constitutes valid authorisation. Again, Mr Shorten needs to come clean and advise the Australian people whether the rules were complied with in both of these instances and whether in both instances he declared his conflicts of interest.
