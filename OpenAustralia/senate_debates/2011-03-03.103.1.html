        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Evans. Is the minister aware of comments by the government’s Disability Ambassador, Ms Catherine Deveny, that people who reside in the outer suburbs are, and I quote, ‘brainless retards’ and who likened a mother losing her temper to, and I quote, ‘chucking her annual Christmas spastic’.

         I am not aware of the remarks that Senator Fifield says have been made. I do not know the individual whom he names, so I am not able to help him in that regard. But clearly if those remarks are accurate then clearly it would not be appropriate for anyone to refer to anyone in that way. If there is some suggestion that people caring for people with disabilities had lost their temper, I think we would all acknowledge that the strain that carers have to carry is enormous. Senator, I am sure that you find in your new portfolio responsibility that people caring for people with disabilities have enormous strains placed upon them—financial, emotional and physical. I think all members of parliament recognise that we need to be better at supporting those people who carry such a terrible load. I do not know about the remarks you referred to. They certainly do not sound appropriate but, without the context, without having heard them and without knowing the individual, I do not want to go further. But I think we would all take the view that some of that language is not appropriate and that the term ‘spastic,’ which you used, has been accepted more broadly as being totally inappropriate terminology of an earlier era and one that is not used anymore. I agree that it is not appropriate. As I say, I cannot respond directly to it. I am happy to refer the matter to the minister. But, clearly, we would all want to make sure that people caring for people with disabilities are supported and understood.

          , I ask a supplementary question. The department of FaHCSIA confirmed at Senate estimates last week that they were aware of Ms Deveny’s comments prior to her appointment by former disabilities minister,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Shorten" rel="nofollow">
           Bill Shorten
          </a>
          . Why, when the government was aware of Ms Deveny’s unfortunate comments, prior to her appointment, would she have been appointed?

           If this is an issue that Senator Fifield explored at Senate estimates then I am a bit surprised as to why he raises it with me now. Clearly, the people at Senate estimates would be in a better position to answer his questions.

            I am the Minister representing the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs in question time today. It is the case I was not present at FaHCSIA estimates, so I have no knowledge of that discussion. But I am happy to take on notice the matters you refer to. As you know, I do not know about the remarks, I do not know the individual, I do not know the context and so I will not comment on any of that other than make the remarks I have made. But I will take the question on notice and will ask the minister to respond to the issues you have raised.

             , I ask a further supplementary question. Does the minister agree with the comments of Senator McLucas at estimates that, as a person with a disability, Ms Deveny has a space that ‘she can say something that you and I can’t’? Will the minister take this opportunity to do what the appointing minister, Mr Shorten, has failed to do, what Minister Macklin has failed to do and what Senator McLucas to do and unequivocally condemn this appointment and apologise to Australians with a disability?

             <p>
              As I said, I have not seen the reports and have no understanding of the context, other than that I know that Senator McLucas is a very strong advocate for people with a disability and their carers and has been for many years. I have complete faith in her. But I will refer the matters you raise to the minister. I do not have knowledge of them personally; I do not have knowledge of the context. I will ask the minister to provide you with a response. It is not appropriate for me to try and answer questions if I am not aware of the context or the whole history of what you refer to. I will take it on notice and get you a response.
