       <p>
        The greyhound export trade ruthlessly sacrifices dogs on the altar of greed and profit. How many more greyhounds must suffer before the government musters the courage to slam the door on this wretched industry? Greyhounds from Australia are routinely ending up overseas, in countries where there isn't a semblance of animal welfare protection for these dogs, and there is absolutely nothing in Australian law to stop this.
       </p>
       <p>
        The greyhound racing and gambling industry doesn't give a crap about dogs, inside or outside Australia. For them, greyhounds are merely collateral damageâ€”out of sight, out of mind. They just hope that no-one discovers their dirty little secret and that they don't get caught. The industry's greyhound passport system is a complete and utter failure. It is useless, essentially unenforceable and has no statutory power. No matter what this vile industry says, neither the welfare of the dogs nor where they end up can be guaranteed once they have been exported.
       </p>
       <p>
        Between 2016 and 2023, nearly 2,000 greyhounds were exported from Australia, according to public records. Between January and July this year, 385 greyhounds were exported. We have no idea where they will finally end up. It's left up to greyhound protection groups to track the fate of these dogs, and that speaks volumes about how little this gambling fuelled racing industry and the government actually care.
       </p>
       <p>
        The only way to protect greyhounds is to shut down this trade. I urge the government to step up and support my bill to ban export of greyhounds for racing, breeding and commercial purposes. The gambling industry may have a hold on the major parties, but the tide of public opinion is turning against racing, and it is only a matter of time before this violent spectacle of a sport is remembered as a shameful chapter in this nation's history.
