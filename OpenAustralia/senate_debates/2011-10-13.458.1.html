           I have many and varied responsibilities, and that includes working with the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Senator Ludwig, in the management of this chamber and the business of the chamber. I congratulate him on the great job he did yesterday in ensuring the proper management of the chamber.
          </p>
          <p>
           One of the things I am grateful for is that I am not responsible for management of the House of Representatives. As to how they have organised their business today, I am afraid I am not in a position to advise you. Unlike many others, I do not tune in to the House of Representatives television coverage all that much. I focus much more intently on the important role that the Senate plays. I find the debate to be more interesting and stimulating and the contributions to be of a much higher order. So I cannot assist the senator with an update on what is occurring with the management of business in the House of Representatives. But, if he is interested, I will see if I can get Minister Albanese to give him a call or to inform the Manager of Opposition Business,

           . If he seriously wants me to find out for him, I am happy to. But, as he would understand, I am not responsible for managing the business in the House of Representatives.

             The government remains committed to a fair and orderly immigration system. That includes the management of unauthorised arrivals. It has been this government's very strong intention to try to get an arrangement in place with Malaysia which allows for the return of unauthorised boat arrivals to Malaysia for processing there. The agreement we struck with the Malaysian government was, we thought, the best way of discouraging people who were seeking asylum in a country of first asylum from seeking to move again. We sought to negotiate that arrangement with Malaysia within the broader framework of the Bali process and the regional responses which we know are essential to finding long-term solutions to movement within the region.

               We as a government have increased the resources available to border protection agencies and take the protection of our borders very seriously. That is why any unauthorised arrivals are intercepted and detained by our border protection services. They have been very successful at providing that service.
              </p>
              <p>
               We also understand that, in terms of unauthorised movement through the region, we need to work with our neighbours. I am pleased to say that the minister informed me yesterday—I had not seen press coverage of it—that the Indonesian government recently successfully prosecuted an Indonesian national for the new offence of people smuggling in that country. That is a really encouraging development. They passed legislation making people smuggling unlawful and they have had a successful prosecution of an Indonesian national. That is a very important development in the ongoing regional response—
