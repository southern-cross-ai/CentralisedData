        [by video link] We have the Premier in Queensland at it again. As of midday today, she's shut down the borders to all of Queensland for anyone who wants to come in from

        , Victoria and also the

        </a>
        . So you have to apply to get here. They see that all of the quarantine hotels are full, so no-one can come back into Queensland. You can apply for an exemption if you are lucky. We've seen the closure of the borders. We've seen people can't get across. Essential workers and teachersâ€”those people could not come across. Then they were forced to have the first shot of vaccination and they must prove they've had that. We've got people that live on the Tweed border who rely on crossing the border for doing shopping, going to facilities and getting medical attention. But, no, that's all stopped now because we're shutting down again because we have this person who wants to control Queenslanders.

        It's about time the Prime Minister stepped up to the mark because this is what people want. You're saying you have an agreement with the states that once we get to 70 per cent vaccination restrictions will be eased and then by 80 per cent there will be no more lockdowns. How can you give us that guarantee when you know that there are premiers of the states which are determined to do their own thing? You're not giving the people the hope that they need that you are in control of this country. I have a suggestion to you now. You should start legal proceedings in the High Court to challenge this state under the Constitution on the right of freedom of movement of people to cross the borders. That's what needs to happen. You know this is going to go on because the final vaccination rate of hopefully 80 per cent, as you are indicating, is going to be at the end of November. People want assurances on what is going to happen at Christmas time so they can see their loved ones and their families. Step up to the mark, Prime Minister. Call the premiers into line. We are one nation and should be united in this.
