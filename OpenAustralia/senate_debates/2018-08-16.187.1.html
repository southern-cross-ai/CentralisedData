                         Just because a minister doesn't know anything about, or says he doesn't know anything about, criminal charges for cartel conduct relating to a friend of the Prime Minister's does not give this minister the licence to talk about criminal action which is entirely unrelated to the grant or to any other activities. It would be a travesty if the ruling is that direct relevance means you can talk about anything if you don't know the answer to the question.

The foundation has raised $58.97 million from corporate and philanthropic contributions, of which $52.87 million is from the corporate sector and $6 million is from private philanthropy. The foundation has received $3.28 million from other sources, such as interest and research partners, including

                           and the University of Queensland. In addition, the GBRF has received pro bono and in-kind services to the value of $4.74 million from the corporate sector. In total, support from non-government sources equates to $66.689 million. The GBRF has been granted $29.71 million from government sources. This includes $22.35 million previously from the Australian government and $7.36 million from the Queensland government.

And here you are trying to besmirch people in the pursuit of your base political interests in relation to a grant that you supported. Senator Keneally came into this chamber and she voted in favour of it.
