        on 2 February 2011 while on combat operations in Afghanistan, places on record its appreciation of his service to our country and tenders its profound sympathy to his family and friends in their bereavement.

        before him, Corporal Richard Atkinson lost his life in service to his nation in Afghanistan. Twenty-two-year-old Corporal Atkinson was from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Army
        </a>
        ’s 1st Combat Engineer Regiment, based in Darwin.
       </p>
       <p>
        Corporal Atkinson was born in Hobart, Tasmania, in 1988. He joined the Army in 2007 and completed recruit and combat-engineering basic training prior to a posting to the 1st Combat Engineer Regiment, based in Darwin. In 2009, he was promoted to lance corporal. His commanding officer noted the leadership he displayed in bringing his section to combat readiness during his preparations for operations in Afghanistan. For his efforts during this important phase, he was promoted to corporal prior to deployment in October 2010. Corporal Atkinson was leading his combat engineer section as a search commander when he was killed in action. He had previously been deployed to Indonesia in October 2009 as part of Operation Padang Assist.
       </p>
       <p>
        Corporal Atkinson leaves behind his fiancee, Dannielle; his mum and dad, Ross and Kate; brother, James; and sister-in-law, Sumah. The government, together with the parliament, the defence community and the Australian people, deeply mourn the loss of Corporal Atkinson, alongside those who have died before him in service to our nation. We acknowledge the profound sense of loss experienced by Corporal Atkinson’s fiancee, Dannielle, and his family and friends, as well as his mates who served with him in the 1st Combat Engineer Regiment in Afghanistan. Corporal Atkinson died before his 23rd birthday, before he could realise his dream of a future family with his fiancee, Dannielle. No words can compensate for his loss, but I hope all who knew and loved Corporal Atkinson can take some comfort in the knowledge that his sacrifice was not in vain. He will not be forgotten by a grateful nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to acknowledge the injuries suffered by a soldier in the same incident in which Corporal Atkinson was killed. I am advised that the soldier is receiving the best possible care and extend to him best wishes for his recovery. More than 160 Australian Defence Force personnel have been injured in Afghanistan. Many of them continue to live with the consequences of their service every day. All of them share the gratitude of a nation that honours their services on our behalf. Our thanks for their efforts are deep and abiding.

         Last Wednesday at about 9.30 am, Australia lost one of its finest in the cause of freedom. Another one of our finest was seriously injured in the incident. Our thoughts and prayers are with him for a full and speedy recovery.

         </a>
         ’s life was cruelly cut short, but his memory will live on not only in the hearts of his family but also in the heart of a thankful nation. Anyone who saw the pictures last week of 22-year-old Tasmanian Corporal Richard Atkinson and his fiancee, Dannielle, could not help but have been affected by the pathos of a young life so abruptly ended, and with it many dreams and aspirations. Corporal Atkinson leaves behind his fiancee, Dannielle, to whom he was engaged only one month before his deployment and with whom he had planned a trip to Italy. He also leaves behind his parents, Ross and Kate; brother, James; and sister-in-law, Sumah, who are all, deservedly, so very proud of him.
        </p>
        <p>
         Corporal Richard Edward Atkinson was born in Hobart in 1988. He attended school in Tasmania both at Trevallyn Primary School and at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launceston_Church_Grammar_School" rel="nofollow">
          Launceston Church Grammar School
         </a>
         . His high-school yearbook from Launceston Church Grammar School records his ambition to be an Army man. In a tribute, Launceston Grammar headmaster
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Norris" rel="nofollow">
          Stephen Norris
         </a>
         said he was highly respected, reliable, kind, considerate and well mannered and showed initiative. In grade 12, Corporal Atkinson was selected as the boys’ captain of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilkinson_House" rel="nofollow">
          Wilkinson House
         </a>
         and captain of the soccer team. He received the school’s top sporting award, the full blue.
        </p>
        <p>
         Just yesterday Corporal Atkinson’s father graciously spoke with me about his and his family’s sense of loss. He told me that, whilst farewelling their son in September last year before his tour of duty, they knew the risk but it was an abstract concept—that it happened but to others. Devastatingly, the abstract has turned into a harsh reality for the Atkinson family. Nevertheless, his father, Ross, told me of his and the family’s pride in Richard. He told me about their last talk, courtesy of Skype, only 14 days before his death, where Corporal Atkinson reinforced how he considered that he and Australia were playing an important role and how pleased he was with what he was doing. In short, he believed in the task in which he was engaged. To borrow some words of our latest
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Cross" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         recipient, Corporal Ben Roberts-Smith: ‘I do what I do because I believe in the country that we live in. I believe that we are making a difference in stemming the flow of terrorism.’ Corporal Atkinson’s father also indicated to me his great appreciation of the wonderful work of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Defence
         </a>
         and the support that he and the family are receiving in their time of loss.
        </p>
        <p>
         Corporal Atkinson joined the Army in 2007. He was promoted to lance corporal in 2009 and his dedication to his section was rewarded with his promotion to corporal in 2010, prior to their redeployment. Corporal Atkinson was in a mixed patrol of Australian and Afghani troops, moving on foot through the Tangi Valley at about 9.30 last Wednesday morning, when a roadside bomb exploded. He was part of an operation trying to drive the Taliban out of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deh_Rahwod" rel="nofollow">
          Deh Rahwod
         </a>
         area, west of the Australian base at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarin_Kowt" rel="nofollow">
          Tarin Kowt
         </a>
         , a vital strategic area in the war against the Taliban insurgency. In the past few weeks Australian and Afghani soldiers had successfully discovered several insurgent caches, including large amounts of explosives. On Saturday, in a memorial service at Tarin Kowt, Major David French spoke of Corporal Atkinson’s ‘cheeky nature and quick wit as well his dedication to his job and his professionalism in always leading from the front’. Major French said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Akka was never happier than when he was on the job and he was bloody good at it.
        </p>
        <p>
         Best mate and fellow engineer, Corporal David Myers, said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Words will never do justice to describe the kind of mate “Akka” was. He would want to be remembered by us with a smile on our faces and laughter in our hearts …
        </p>
        <p>
         Our deepest sympathies go to Corporal Richard Atkinson’s fiancee, Dannielle Kitchen, of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         ; his parents and his extended family. We feel incredible sorrow about a young man, his life full of promise, on the cusp of marriage and starting his own family, being cut down in a foreign land. We will never fully know the sorrow of Richard’s fiancee and family, but we feel intensely for them as they carry their loss, in the hope that it will ease their sense of loss. It is consoling that Richard was convinced that we were and are doing the right thing and that he was doing good in Afghanistan. After receiving the Victoria Cross, Corporal Ben Roberts-Smith, in urging Australians to remember our digger heroes who have died in Afghanistan, said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         These are the guys who put their hands up willingly and they didn’t come back.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         They are our mates and their families live with that every day.
        </p>
        <p>
         I urge the public to remember that they are heroes, that they are the ones who gave the ultimate sacrifice. Corporal Richard Atkinson is a hero, who volunteered and made the ultimate sacrifice. May his service and sacrifice in the cause of freedom be an inspiration to all. A thankful nation salutes his volunteer spirit, his service and his sacrifice.

          In speaking to this condolence motion I rise also to concur with the remarks made with regard to Corporal Richard Edward Atkinson. He was part of a patrol to the west of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarin_Kowt" rel="nofollow">
           Tarin Kowt
          </a>
          . He lost his life. Not only has he left behind a bereaved fiancee, Dannielle, but also he is a loss to his family—to his father, Ross; mother, Kate; and brother, James.
         </p>
         <p>
          With the loss of Corporal Atkinson we also see the loss of a person who was really at the cusp of so much that would have been ahead of him in life—his impending marriage and all those dreams that we take for granted. He lost and sacrificed that because he believed in what our nation had asked him to do in a foreign land. There have been so many tragic deaths—so far, 22 have lost their life—in this endeavour. These people do it so that we do not have to engage with the enemy on our shores. As they always say, ‘You seek out and close with the enemy,’ and that is what Corporal Atkinson was doing. Corporal Atkinson came from Hobart and, as Senator Abetz properly portrayed him, he had so much to offer right from the word go. He was a person who, with his sporting ability, had so much promise. He was a person of good character and he willingly laid that on the line for his nation and he paid the supreme sacrifice.
         </p>
         <p>
          Australia will never forget those who have served our nation, nor are we ever able to repay what they have offered. Of course, we can ensure that we give the best support that we can to those who have been left behind following the tragic death of Corporal Atkinson and let them know that, like those who have also been maimed and who have also paid the supreme sacrifice, this chamber will continue in the remembrance of their service and will continue to lend whatever support, in the many and varied ways that the people in this chamber do.

           On behalf of the Australian Greens I join all other senators today in expressing my admiration for the bravery of Corporal Richard Edward Atkinson, my sadness at his untimely death in Afghanistan and my condolences to his family and fiancee. He was only 22. He was a very young man, but a brave soldier. He was based in Darwin, as part of the 1st Combat Engineer Regiment. He was the 22nd young Australian to be killed in Afghanistan. I would also like to send my best wishes to the 168 people who have been wounded in Afghanistan.
          </p>
          <p>
           Corporal Richard Edward Atkinson was on his first deployment to Afghanistan and he was killed by an improvised explosive device while on a foot patrol in the Tangi Valley, in southern Oruzgan province. Another soldier was badly wounded at the same time. The Australian soldiers had been working with their Afghan partners at a new patrol base in the Tangi Valley and had discovered several insurgent caches, including explosives.
          </p>
          <p>
           I want to think especially today of Corporal Atkinson’s family. As a mother of sons in their twenties myself, I cannot even begin to understand and imagine the profound grief and sense of loss that his mother and father, his brother James and his wife, and his fiancee must be feeling. His parents, Ross and Kate, have spoken of their profound sadness. His father said that his son loved the Army and had a ‘real knack for adventure’. His father also said:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           He enjoyed being deployed. He was just a lovely boy. He was funny. He loved playing sports. He was a loved son and a loved brother to James.
          </p>
          <p>
           To his mother and father, to his brother, and to his fiancee, Danielle, we say: we know that you are suffering and we care. We know that you have suffered a great loss, and every day henceforth you will feel that loss. We acknowledge that. We are a grateful nation.
          </p>
          <p>
           In summing up his life, former principal of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launceston_Church_Grammar_School" rel="nofollow">
            Launceston Church Grammar School
           </a>
           , Mr Norris, said that, as a student there until year 12, Corporal Atkinson was highly respected, reliable, kind, considerate, well-mannered, had showed initiative and was obviously a great sportsman, having been the captain of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilkinson_House" rel="nofollow">
            Wilkinson House
           </a>
           and having won the highest sporting achievement of the school. He particularly loved his soccer. He graduated in 2006—that is very recent, when you think about a year 12 boy leaving school in 2006—saying, ‘I want to be an Army man’. He joined the Army in 2007, and now he has been killed in Afghanistan. As a nation we need to really reflect on that, because there is no greater sense of responsibility than those who make the decision to deploy our troops overseas into a battle zone.
          </p>
          <p>
           His friends in the Army described him as quick-witted, as a dedicated professional, as a great mate and as cheeky and fun-loving. At his funeral service in Afghanistan they said he would want to be remembered by us with a smile on our faces and laughter in our hearts. We also remember him, though, as General Hurley, the Acting Chief of Defence Force, said:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           His bravery should not be forgotten and his sacrifice brings great honour to him, the

There is no greater sacrifice than laying down one’s life for one’s country, and Corporal Atkinson has done this. It is a deep loss.

             I, too, join this condolence motion and endorse all that my colleagues before me have said. This is a great loss. I think Senator Milne, Senator Abetz and others have painted a picture of a lovely young man—energetic, funny, great with his peers and mates, much loved by his family and his fiancee. He died doing what he loved: serving his country. That is something that we can never forget. This is an appropriate tribute to him, and I am sure there will be many other tributes in the weeks and months to come. His contribution will never, ever be forgotten. I extend my condolences to his family, to his loved ones and to his colleagues in the

             . I cannot imagine what his family is going through, but I think they know that they have a grateful nation that supports them and that extends their condolences to them.

             </p>
             <p>
              We have heard that Corporal Atkinson was a dedicated and professional soldier. We have heard how much his mates depended on him and how much they will miss him. This is a time when all of us who serve in this parliament think of those who serve in Australia’s defence forces, of those who spend their lives in the nation’s service, of those who serve in Afghanistan, of those who have been wounded in that service and of those like Corporal Atkinson who have given their lives. I am only too painfully aware that perhaps no words of condolence in the parliament can ease the pain of Corporal Atkinson’s family and friends. I can only say to them all—to Corporal Atkinson’s family, his fiancée, his parents, his brother and other family members, his friends and his mates, particularly those in the 1st Combat Engineer Regiment—that Australia proudly and profoundly honours his service and sacrifice. I join with other senators in offering my deepest sympathy to Corporal Atkinson’s family and friends.

               Corporal Atkinson was 22 years of age and from Darwin, based with the 1st Combat Engineer Regiment. He is survived by his fiancée, Dannielle; his parents, in Tasmania; and his brother, who lives in my home state of

                Western Australia
               </a>
               . As we have heard, this was his first deployment to Afghanistan. He had previously been deployed with combat engineers to Indonesia on a humanitarian assistance mission, Operation Padang Assist. This young man was truly a fine and outstanding professional soldier. Corporal Atkinson is the 12th Australian soldier to have been killed by an improvised explosive device, out of the 22 brave and courageous young Australians who have died so far in this dangerous and difficult Afghanistan environment. There is nothing more dangerous than performing dismounted patrols in Afghanistan. It was whilst performing that task that Corporal Atkinson was killed and Sapper Rose seriously injured.

               Our thoughts and prayers are with Richard Atkinson’s fiancée, his family and his comrades at this very difficult time. We mourn the loss of a very fine young Australian. We also wish Sapper Robert Rose a speedy recovery from his serious wounds resulting from this

               detonation. I pause to acknowledge the ongoing commitment, service, bravery and courage of all Australian soldiers in Afghanistan. They continue to occupy our thoughts and our prayers. Corporal Richard Atkinson is and will continue to be an inspiration and a very fine example to all of us.

                 Richard Atkinson
                </a>

                </a>
                and was known as a Launceston boy. He was 22 years of age when he died—when he was killed. He was leading his combat engineer section as a search commander. I note that he has been awarded the

                and the Army Combat Badge. In paying a tribute to Corporal Richard Atkinson, it is an honour to note his service, his bravery and his courage and to know that a grateful nation is thankful for that service and that sacrifice. My hope and prayer is that that sacrifice is indeed not in vain, lest we forget.

                Words cannot describe the sadness and the grief that is currently being endured by his family and, in particular, his fiance, Dannielle, who he was planning to have a family with; his parents, Ross and Kate, who live in Launceston; and his brother, James, and sister-in-law, Sumah. My heart also goes out to the Grammar community at this time, because only last week they were advised of the death of James Poland, who died in a bushwalking accident in
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
                 New Zealand
                </a>
                . We had a wonderful thanksgiving service for his life last week with the whole school community. The students are now returning to the school at Grammar—this week in fact; grades 11 and 12 yesterday and the rest of the school community tomorrow. It will be a very heavy burden for them to bear. But it will be good for them to know that we stand with them shoulder to shoulder in terms of their condolences and support for Corporal Richard Atkinson’s family and the friends that he knew so well at Grammar during his school days in Launceston. I pay tribute to him and give honour to his courage, bravery and sacrifice. He is the 22nd soldier to have died in Afghanistan.

                 Stephen Norris

                , about him being a leader at Grammar. It has been noted that he was the head of

                 Wilkinson House

                . Mr Norris also noted that he was highly respected, reliable, kind, considerate and well mannered and showed initiative. I know that the school community will be mourning his loss with his family. Together with other senators and the entire Senate, I pay my respects and give him honour.
