         Thank you to Senator Xenophon for this question.

          Lake Eyre

         Basin Intergovernmental Agreement, which, as the senator would be aware, provides for the sustainable management of Lake Eyre. The forum is chaired by the Parliamentary Secretary for Water,

          Dr Kelly

          Lake Eyre Basin
         </a>
         for some nine years. This IGA, which was signed in 2000, is given effect under legislation in each jurisdiction. I can advise the senator that at a recent meeting of the ministerial forum this year the Queensland government advised that the existing
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Creek" rel="nofollow">
          Cooper Creek
         </a>
         water resource plan was scheduled to expire on 1 September 2010. As required under Queensland water law, the Queensland government has previously announced its intention to prepare a new draft water resource plan for Cooper Creek for public consideration later this year. The advice provided to the ministerial forum was that a draft of this resource plan will be released for public comment later this year. I am also advised that socioeconomic, hydrologic and ecological assessments are being used to inform the development of the draft plan.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is the case that there are some sleeper licences, where no extraction has commenced, and what are known as dozer licences, where pumps are in place but are not yet used, which are able to be activated now under the existing resource plan provided strict licence and land-use conditions are met. The senator is correct that it is possible that activation of these licences together with the potential to enable trade and water entitlements in Cooper Creek could have an adverse impact on the river flows and flood plain inundation to the detriment of areas, including the Coongie Lakes Ramsar site. I again say that the Queensland government has informed—

           Queensland has confirmed to the ministerial forum that the new plan will be ‘fully compliant with all state, national and international agreements, including the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Eyre" rel="nofollow">
            Lake Eyre
           </a>
           Basin Intergovernmental Agreement’. That IGA has, as its primary purpose, the development and implementation of policies and strategies that avoid, or eliminate as far as is reasonably practicable, adverse cross-border impacts in the basin. I have asked my parliamentary secretary to ensure that, from the Commonwealth’s perspective, the provisions of the IGA continue to be utilised to protect the ecological characteristics of key assets within the basin, including the internationally significant Coongie Lakes, which as you know is a Ramsar site.

             The announcement to which the senator refers was in relation to the Murray-Darling Basin. This matter concerns the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Eyre" rel="nofollow">

             Basin. There are many who would argue that the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Eyre_Basin" rel="nofollow">
              Lake Eyre Basin
             </a>
             initiative has actually been a very good example of inter-state cooperation on river and natural resource management. I stress again that no decisions have yet been taken. As I mentioned earlier, Queensland has indicated an intention to fulfil its water planning obligations in a way that is consistent with the Lake Eyre Basin Intergovernmental Agreement. I would add that that remains the Commonwealth’s expectation.
