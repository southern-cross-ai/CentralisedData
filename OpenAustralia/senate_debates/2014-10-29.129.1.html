          I thank Senator Smith for his question. I am pleased to inform the Senate that from 1 July the My Aged Care gateway will become the single entry point to Australia's aged-care system, making it easier for older Australians to access aged-care services. In particular, one of the major changes to the My Aged Care service from 1 July is the introduction of the regional assessment service, or the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAS" rel="nofollow">
           RAS
          </a>
          . The RAS will provide assessments of the home support needs of older Australians. It is going to help them to locate and access the services that they need to help them remain living at home. For the very first time older Australians will know that their needs are being independently assessed. It is important that by separating assessment from service provision we are ensuring that older Australians are being assessed for what they need rather than just for the services that a particular provider can give them. This separation is consistent with the best practice for government services outlined in the Harper review.
         </p>
         <p>
          The current process for assessments is a little fragmented, with several hundred organisations providing assessments which are often limited to the services that they themselves deliver. The RAS is going to help ensure that the services received correspond to the needs of an individual and that they are not limited by the scope of that particular service provider. This change will ensure that there is a consistent nationwide approach across the country. These new regional assessment arrangements will make it easier for older Australians to access the services and information that they need to help them remain at home for longer.

            , the government is opening a competitive tender process for organisations to deliver assessments for people seeking aged-care support at home. Organisations who successfully tender will form part of the nationwide network that I mentioned that will be undertaking face-to-face assessments of older people. They will then make a referral to locally available services that best suit the individual's needs. Service providers who currently receive funding to provide assessments are encouraged to consider submitting an application to deliver services under the RAS. Organisations can apply individually or as part of a consortium to deliver services across the region, and local and specialist organisations such as those that support culturally and linguistically diverse and Indigenous communities are encouraged to apply as part of a larger consortium.

              The gateway is becoming the single entry point to Australia's aged-care system. This is going to make it easier to navigate for older people and their families, and crucially it is going to make it easier for older people to access the aged-care services they need. Older Australians considering their options can now visit the My Aged Care website to find out services available in their area and the price of accommodation at their local residential aged-care facilities. Importantly, they can also access a fee estimator in which they can plug in their assets and their income and receive an estimate of what fees they may be asked to pay in residential aged care. This is on top of accessing assessment services from the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAS" rel="nofollow">
               RAS
              </a>
              , and all these services can also be accessed by calling the national call centre. Bringing these services together will make the system much easier to navigate for older Australians, helping them to access the care that they need when they need it. It is important that, at that stage of life, we make things as easy as we possibly can.
