       <p>
        Last Sunday week, 14 February, I was honoured to be asked to represent the government at the opening of the Joan Nicoll Tennis Centre at Terranora, adjacent to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweed_Heads" rel="nofollow">
         Tweed Heads
        </a>
        . Tennis Terranora started as an intraclub of the Terranora Lakes Country Club way back in 1978, growing to over 400 members, five courts, a clubhouse and a coach. With the unfortunate liquidation of Terranora Lakes Country Club in 1996 and the eventual sale of that club's land and buildings, the old tennis club was given notice to vacate. The club was re-established as a separate association with about 100 members and renamed Tennis Terranora Incorporated.
       </p>
       <p>
        From 1996 to 2002, the tennis club continued to function using the same complex as before, which was under private ownership, on a week-to-week rental arrangement. Through media reports during 2002, members heard that the existing tennis complex would be redeveloped for other purposes, giving the club an uncertain future. In November 2002, Tennis Terranora set up a committee of eight members to oversee the relocation of the club to new premises, as it was clear a new home was needed. Funding was sought, and the club itself raised over $50,000. But in May 2005
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweed_Shire_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Tweed Shire Council
        </a>
        , a great supporter, was placed in administration.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the next four years Arkinstall Park at Tweed Heads was recommended as the venue for a regional tennis centre. Initially, Tennis Terranora was keen to relocate to the new centre, but they found the delay would be far too long and they were under pressure to vacate their existing site. Stage 1 of the Arkinstall Park sports complex was opened in May last year.
       </p>
       <p>
        In late 2009, the council made an offer to Tennis Terranora to take up a site at Henry Lawson Drive and, shortly after, the council said it would contribute $145,000 towards the clubhouse amenities. Originally this $145,000 was for a separate amenities block. Thus began a long process of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DA" rel="nofollow">
         DA
        </a>
        s and approvals, with club members rallying to help. The first sod was turned in August 2013. Then began a program of earthworks, laying of asphalt, fencing and painting and construction of the clubhouse.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Provest" rel="nofollow">

        , with us. There was $50,000 from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Tennis Australia
        </a>
        , and Ken Laffey represented Tennis Australia at the opening. As well, there was the $145,000 from Tweed Shire Council, led by Councillor Katie Milne, plus a couple of loans.
       </p>
       <p>
        What struck me at the opening was the in-kind support Tennis Terranora received. It seemed like every husband, wife, brother and sister had rolled their sleeves up to dig a hole, use a paint brush, lay some tiles or plant a shrub. Many had put their hand in their pocket to pay for some of these. A conservative $255,000 worth of in-kind support from individuals and businesses resulted in a magnificent complex of five tennis courts, state-of-the-art clubrooms, an amenities block and lighting fixtures. The longer-term goal is for more courts, so that Tennis Terranora becomes the headquarters of junior tennis in the Tweed.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are many people who can look back with pride on what they have contributed, but I want to mention a few: South East Excavations, run by Brian and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Turner" rel="nofollow">
         Bruce Turner
        </a>
        , who donated $120,000 worth of civil works, fencing materials and soil; the president of the club, Rob Nienhuis, who has been a tenacious leader, organiser and contributor in his own right and who will be knocking on doors again shortly looking for assistance for the next stage; and the lady after whom the Joan Nicoll Tennis Centre is named.
       </p>
       <p>
        Joan Nicoll played in two
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Open
        </a>
        tournaments, as well as at Wimbledon, and has won titles in Denmark, Spain, England and Fiji. Joan recently retired after 30 years of dedicating her time and highly-regarded skills to coaching the junior tennis stars.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you to the members of Tennis Terranora for your warm welcome and hospitality and, more importantly, for rolling your sleeves up and never giving up. Persistence is the key to success. The community has worked hard. They have a wonderful facility. It is a great legacy for Joan Nicoll for her years of contribution, expertise, talent and coaching of the young ones. I wish them all the best for the future.
