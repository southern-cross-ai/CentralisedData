        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Conroy. When does the Prime Minister next intend to visit my home state of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        ? Can the minister confirm that the Prime Minister's office was told by WA state Labor leader

         I will attempt to answer as much of that as is relevant to the portfolio. The Prime Minister travels the length and breadth of this country talking about the achievements of the Gillard government, talking about the strong economy and talking about the unemployment rate, which is the envy of other developed nations—a billion-dollar jobs plan and a
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAA" rel="nofollow">
          AAA
         </a>
         credit rating, but not one question from those opposite. The Prime Minister has travelled the length and breadth of this country talking about the unprecedented support for modern families—the schoolkids bonus, new payments for families, more family tax benefits, record support for child care and help with costs taking kids to the dentist.

          , I rise on a point of order on the question of direct relevance. The minister was asked when the Prime Minister intends to visit
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           Western Australia
          </a>

           It is all well and good for us to listen again as Senator Brandis restates the question. The answer Senator Conroy is providing is that the government visits
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            Western Australia
           </a>
           every single day, every single hour of the day, with the support we provide to

We are going to continue to talk about supporting child care, helping with the costs of taking kids to the dentist. We are going to continue to focus on policies like finalising the health agreement—more doctors, more nurses, more beds, less waiting time, together with more control and accountability.

                 , I ask a further supplementary question. The last time the Prime Minister visited was 13 November 2012. Is the reason the Prime Minister has been asked to stay as far away as possible from

                 has condemned the government's carbon tax and mining tax? If the state Labor Party can recognise that these toxic taxes are bad for Western Australia, when will federal Labor wake up to the fact that they are dangerous to the Australian economy?

                   Again, what we see from those opposite is that Barnett-Liberal Party mining taxes are good because the Liberal Party has introduced them. They are good; they are fine; they are all wonderful things. But if the government introduces a tax that is fair for all Australians, then suddenly it is bad. So we have the Liberal Party taxing mining companies is good and to be supported; Labor Party raising taxes on mining companies to spread across the country is bad. The grovelling attitude by those opposite is just nauseating to witness. Liberal Party mining taxes are good—that is okay, all across the country:
