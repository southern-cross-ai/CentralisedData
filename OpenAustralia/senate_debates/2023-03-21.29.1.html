        Everyone should be able to go to the dentist without worrying about how much it will cost. In today's reality where corporate profits are soaring and so many people are feeling the pinch, more folks than ever are delaying or simply denying themselves a visit to the dentist because they simply cannot afford it. I, along with my Greens colleagues, have heard from people all around the country who have shared stories of relentless tooth pain; experiences of ongoing, chronic headaches as they wait for the removal, or save for the removal, of wisdom teeth; and, indeed, so many older people making do with dentures that are ill-fitting and contributing to gum disease. There are tens of thousands of people in Australia who end up in hospital for treatment of dental conditions that could've been prevented had they been treated earlier.

        We must move to a publicly funded universal dental scheme that tackles dental disease proactively. That's why I am so pleased, in fact that's why I sit here with the biggest smile on my face, to be able to share that the Greens have established a committee of the Senate to review the provision of and access to dental services in Australia. In the coming months this committee will hear from people all across the country about their experiences of oral healthcare. I would encourage everyone to make a submission so that the parliament can hear from you about the challenges that you've experienced and the impacts of not being able to afford or access a dentist; and hear your ideas about how we can end up in a place where when you go to the dentist and open your wallet, instead of needing to reach for your credit card, you can reach for your Medicare card.
