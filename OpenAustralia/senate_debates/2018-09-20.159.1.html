        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Education, Senator Birmingham. The former Minister for Education and Training's own South Australian Liberal colleague the member for Barker, Mr Pasin, labelled Senator Birmingham's relationship with the independent schools sector as toxic and accused him of allowing the 'sore to fester far too long'. Is that why Minister Birmingham was dumped from the education portfolio and replaced with Mr Tehan?

         I'm very sorry that Senator Wong, the shadow foreign minister, doesn't think that Australia's trade relationships with the world are important—that Senator Wong, the shadow foreign minister, who aspires to be the foreign minister of this nation, belittles Australia's trading relationship with the world. I mean, imagine the strife that the Australian economy would be in if that attitude were brought to bear in terms of our trading relationships! One in five Australian jobs depends on exports, on trade, on opportunity. And, of course, at this time of global uncertainty, in terms of the way in which the trading relationship operates, Australians need to know they have a government that values our relationship with the world and puts the ability of Australian farmers and small businesses to sell their products and services to the rest of the world as one of the most important things that the government can do for them. Of course we, on this side, know that Australian farmers and businesses are much better off today as a result of our government's work over the last five years in ensuring their trade and market access is improved as a result of the deals and agreements we've pursued with China, with the Republic of Korea, with Japan, through the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPP" rel="nofollow">
          TPP
         </a>
         , and building, indeed, on the work of the Howard government in terms of the United States.
        </p>
        <p>
         But do you know how much trade market access was improved during the six years of the Labor government, how many deals were struck during those six years and what work occurred? Absolutely none—zero; a big fat zero. Why do you think that might have been the case? It was probably because the then Labor government had the attitude that Senator Wong brought to bear in that question just then. They don't take trade or foreign affairs seriously.

             Leader of the Opposition in the Senate
            </a>
            , the shadow foreign minister, has such contempt for trade and Australia's international relations but you also have the fact that all you get from the Labor Party is petty politics. Indeed, on a day when Prime Minister Morrison and Mr Tehan, the new education minister, have announced a further increase to what is already a record investment in supporting Australian schools, does the Labor Party come in here and ask any questions about policy or investment in schools? No—of course, their questions are about petty personality politics and anonymous quotes from the newspapers. Our government is investing record sums into Australian schools. That record level of investment went up again today, providing more funding, more choice and more opportunity for Australian parents and more support for schools and Australian schoolchildren.

              This former minister managed to unite the public school sector, the Catholic school sector, the independent school sector, principals and teacher groups, his Liberal colleagues, state education ministers, a Liberal education spokesman, former Prime Minister Howard and former Prime Minister Turnbull as a result of this minister's bungled handling of school funding cuts.

               While in this chamber I've thought many things about Senator Wong at different times but I never thought that Senator Wong was a slow learner. But, on this occasion: third question and third same failed approach from Senator Wong—the third same failed approach in terms of just playing petty politics. If the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
                Australian Labor Party

               think that Australian parents, Australian schools and Australian teachers care about these petty political games, they are wrong. If they think that Australian farmers or Australian businesses care about these petty political games, they are terribly wrong.

              <p>
               Our government has ensured that our economy is stronger, thanks to our trading relationships with the world. And, from a strong economy, we are able to invest in the services that Australians care about, such as school education. A strong economy, balancing the budget and record investment in our schools are this Liberal-National government's achievements.
