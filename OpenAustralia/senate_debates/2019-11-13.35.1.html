        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Cormann. On the same day record low growth for Australians under this government is again confirmed, Morrison government MPs, including the member for Goldstein, the member for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKellar" rel="nofollow">
         McKellar
        </a>
        and the member for Hughes—Mr Wilson, Mr Falinski and Mr Kelly—have all lined up to publicly criticise the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">
         Reserve Bank
        </a>
        . Given the Morrison government continues to refuse to heed the advice of the Reserve Bank to stimulate the economy, including by bringing forward vital infrastructure investment, can the minister advise when this government will stop criticising the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RBA" rel="nofollow">

                Reserve Bank
               </a>
               and, of course, we respect the fact that it is their job to determine monetary policy settings based on their assessment of the economic information and data in relevant consideration that they appropriately pursue.
              </p>
              <p>
               I would also make the point that the Australian government is pursuing a pro-growth economic strategy enshrined in our budget. That is in stark contrast with the alternative policies taken to the last election by the alternative government, which was delivering a socialist, antibusiness and high-taxing agenda which would have weakened the economy, which would have created more unemployment and which would have led to lower wages.
              </p>
              <p>
               Since the election, of course, we have legislated another $158 billion worth of income tax relief, which takes the level of income tax relief legislated over the last two years to more than $300 billion. More than $23 billion of that has been returned to the pockets of hardworking Australians since the middle of July. And, indeed, we continue to implement a very ambitious infrastructure investment program, with our $100 billion federal Infrastructure Investment Pipeline.
              </p>
              <p>
               Indeed, let me reassure Senator Wong and all senators that the government's fiscal policy continues absolutely to run in the same direction as monetary policy, and that we are very, very respectful of the Reserve Bank.

                 cuts which the minister's colleagues are lining up to criticise—and I refer him to their public statements—are a direct result of the economy's weakness under this government and the coalition's failure to provide complementary fiscal stimulus, as the RBA has called for on multiple occasions. Can the minister explain why his colleagues are so anxious to criticise the RBA instead of the government doing its job, and that is to take action to turn the economy around?

                  I completely reject the premise of that question. Under our government, the Australian economy continues to grow. The Australian economy continued to grow at a time when other economies around the world—in the June quarter, for example—were shrinking. Our economy in the June quarter was growing at half a per cent, and here is the Labor Party saying that the sky is about to fall in! In the

                            Furthermore, we went to the last election with a plan to grow the economy and to deal with the challenges that we knew were coming our way. We are implementing our pro-growth budget and we'll provide an update on that pro-growth budget in our half-yearly budget update in December. We will continue to make decisions in an orderly fashion. We will not ever pursue the sorts of cash splashes that the Labor Party recklessly and irresponsibly pursued in government. We are not going to force schools to accept school halls they don't need. We are not going to put pink batts into people's houses and set their houses on fire, only then to spend another billion dollars taking those pink batts out again. We will continue to make sensible decisions, implementing our plan to build a stronger economy and a more resilient economy, and to create more jobs.
