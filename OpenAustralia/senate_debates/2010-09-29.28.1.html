        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Evans. Can the minister explain why, when the Prime Minister announced her ministry on 11 September, there was no member of the executive given specific responsibility for disabilities and carers? Why, when the Prime Minister was asked, was she unable to say who had responsibility? Why did it take several days for the Prime Minister to belatedly announce that Senator McLucas would have that responsibility?

               , Senator McLucas would be in the portfolio and Ms Macklin would have Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. As the senator knows, Senator McLucas has had a long interest in these issues and was active in these issues when we were in opposition and in government. She was a particularly good choice for the portfolio. The arrangements that existed under the first—

He has not addressed that question. Nothing he has said bears directly on that issue. Mr President, you have in the previous parliament ruled that ministers have been relevant. If you can rule that, you can rule that they have not been relevant, and you can certainly rule that they have not been directly relevant. If so, to enforce the sessional order, you should either direct the minister to the question or direct him to resume his seat.

Unfortunately, what the opposition want is a directly relevant question that they have in mind which is impermissible. What the minister has been answering is the question that was asked in respect of the

                    As I was making clear, Senator McLucas has a long interest in the area. She was previously the opposition spokesperson. She is well regarded in the sector. She succeeds Mr Shorten, who had an excellent reputation in the area and was responsible for significant improvements in the support for people with disabilities and their carers in the term of the first Labor government. I think it is an excellent appointment. As I say, that has been clear for some weeks now. I look forward to working with Senator McLucas in that role.

                     , I ask a supplementary question. I am pleased that the minister has worked out that disabilities actually is not in the health portfolio. Given the expectation within the sector that there would be a dedicated disabilities minister, deliberately built up by Mr Shorten’s promise to have the portfolio elevated, why did the government not appoint a minister for disabilities?

                      The arrangements in relation to the ministry and the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers are, as I understand it, the same as existed under the last government, the first Labor government. They are the same arrangements, as I understand it, that existed under the previous Howard government. What I can advise you is that that arrangement—that is, having a senior minister for FaHCSIA and a parliamentary secretary under that minister with a direct responsibility for disabilities and carers—continues as it was under the Howard government and under the first Labor government.

                       , I ask a further supplementary question. Given the growing profile and awareness of disability issues, don’t Australians with a disability and their carers deserve a dedicated minister at least as much as the arts or sport does?

                        What people with a disability and their carers need, Senator, is a government committed to reform, a government committed to supporting them and a government that delivers. That is what they got from this government in its first term. That is what they will get from this government in its second term. As I have said in relation to other issues, it is not the title; it is whether you do the work. This is the government that delivered the largest increase ever to pensioners in this country. This is the government that increased the disability support pension and carer payment. This is the government that doubled funding to the states and territories under the National Disability Agreement.

                        We have also been responsible for putting disability back on the national agenda, after 12 years of neglect, with the National Disability Strategy and the

                        inquiry. The opposition may want to focus on arguments about titles, but the reality is that the government will continue to deliver improvements for people with disabilities.
