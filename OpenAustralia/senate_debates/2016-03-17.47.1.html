           The federal government is committed to protecting children from the dangers of sexual and physical exploitation and abuse wherever it may occur. Under Australia's federal system of government, the Commonwealth, states and territory governments have different areas of responsibility and child protection matters fall within the responsibility of states and territories. Discussion on advancement in ways to protect children are ongoing between state and federal authorities, and stakeholder contributions are an important part of those considerations.
          </p>
          <p>
           Within the family law portfolio responsibilities of the Attorney-General, the Attorney-General's Department continues to work with the family law courts in the states and territories to improve the interface between the family law system and state and territory child protection systems. The purpose of this work is to promote the best interests of children and protect them from harm. The government is considering the findings of the interim report from the Family Law Council on the issue of families with complex needs, including violence, that intersect Commonwealth family law and state and territory child protection systems. The establishment of a national child protection database would be a significant undertaking from a policy, legislative and technical perspective, and would require the agreement of all jurisdictions.

              Labor have the greatest respect for the Morcombe family and in particular for the ongoing wonderful work of the Daniel Morcombe Foundation. We support measures which will keep Australian children safe from abuse. However, we are not convinced that a national sex offender registry is an appropriate path forward. This proposal was already put to
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
               COAG
              </a>
              in 2014 and was rejected by the Commonwealth and every state and territory except the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
               Northern Territory
              </a>
              . There are a number of concerns about such a registry, including the fact that there is no clear evidence to indicate it would reduce offending or make children safer; concerns that publication could lead to identification and further trauma of victims; concerns that publication could discourage reporting of abuse; and ongoing concerns about encouragement of vigilante action and the disruption of rehabilitation.
