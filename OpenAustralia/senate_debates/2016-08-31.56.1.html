        My question is for the Minister representing and

         Special Minister of State

        , Minister Cormann. Minister Cormann, today there are some reports that a senator's parliamentary entitlements were subsidised by a Chinese government entity. Australia is one of the only countries in the Asia-Pacific that allow donations from foreign citizens or entities. Former Treasurer Wayne Swan recently said that foreign donations are potentially skewing the decision making in favour of donors, and many Australians would agree with the former Treasurer, Mr Swan. When will the government introduce a ban on foreign donations for political and parliamentary purposes?

               I know I am in a bit of strife when Senator Macdonald is defending me! My question is to the Minister representing the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Minister_of_State" rel="nofollow">
                Special Minister of State
               </a>
               , Minister Cormann. As I said, there are reports today that a senator's parliamentary entitlements were subsidised by a Chinese government entity. We know that Australia is one of only a few countries in the Asia-Pacific that allows donations from foreign citizens or, indeed, foreign entities. We heard from former Treasurer Wayne Swan who said recently that donations from foreign entities are potentially skewing the decision-making in favour of donors. Many Australians right around the country would agree with that proposition. The question is this: when will this government introduce a ban on foreign donations for political and parliamentary purposes?

               <p>
                The first point I would make in response to that question is that the matter addressed by Senator Dastyari this morning did not, by my understanding, relate to campaign donations. That is the first point. The second point is that there is a well-established process whereby, after every election, the cross-party Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters reviews the election that has just taken place. If Senator
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Di_Natale" rel="nofollow">
                 Di Natale
                </a>
                is serious about wanting to pursue these matters, then that would be the appropriate forum to explore these issues.
               </p>
               <p>
                As a general point, what I would say is that the coalition believes that, when it comes to campaign donation disclosure, current arrangements reflect the appropriate balance between transparency and enabling Australians to participate in the political process. Where a donation is over the threshold, it is required to be disclosed to the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Electoral_Commission" rel="nofollow">
                 Australian Electoral Commission
                </a>
                by both the donor and the recipient, and that is a system that everyone is expected to comply with.

                  I take it from the minister's answer that we struck the appropriate balance. Does that relate to the fact that we have seen the foreign minister praise four major Chinese donors who also happened to donate half a million dollars to the

                  n division of the Liberal Party? Is that the appropriate balance you are talking about, Minister?

                   That is obviously a political debating point. The electoral laws, including disclosure laws, are there for all to see. They are, obviously, openly and transparently on the books, so to speak. Everyone in Australia who participates in the democratic process is expected to comply with relevant laws of the land. That is what the Liberal Party does, and I would expect every other party in Australia to do the same.

                     The Prime Minister said during the election that, in an ideal world, donations could only be made by individuals on the Australian electoral roll, and those donations would be capped. This parliament can turn this ideal world into a reality. Will this policy proposition put forward by the Prime Minister himself inform the basis from which the government will proceed?

                      for that final supplementary question. I would refer him to part of my initial answer: there is a routine process through the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, which, I believe, will be chaired by a distinguished senator from the great state of
