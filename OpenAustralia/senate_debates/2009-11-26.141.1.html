        by leave—Today marks the first anniversary of the tragic terrorist attacks in Mumbai last year. The attacks which began on 26 November 2008 and lasted until 29 November 2008 involved more than 10 coordinated shooting and bombing attacks across Mumbai. Terrorists attacked the

        , a cinema and two hospitals. Some 62 hours later, at least 164 innocent people had been killed and hundreds more had been injured. Today the Australian government and people and all senators in this chamber remember the two Australians killed in this attack—Douglas Markell and Brett Taylor.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to pay tribute to all the victims of the

        </a>
        . One year on, the families and friends of those killed and injured are trying to rebuild their lives. I also wish to acknowledge the bravery and the sacrifice of all those who risked their lives to save others. In difficult conditions, Indian security forces battled bravely and successfully to rescue hundreds of innocent people who were caught up in the attacks. From across the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , Australia was deeply shocked and appalled by the deadly and horrific attacks. Today, as we remember the victims, we need to remind ourselves that the threat of international terrorism continues. We must remain vigilant and work together to defeat terrorism in all its forms.

         by leave—On behalf of the opposition I want to associate the coalition with the remarks by Senator Faulkner in his ministerial statement on this first anniversary of the tragedy in Mumbai. It was indeed, as Senator Faulkner properly said, an horrific event and a great tragedy. We join with Senator Faulkner in acknowledging and remembering those killed and wounded in this dreadful event. We acknowledge the bravery and sacrifice of all those involved, those who tried to help, those wounded and those whose memories will be scarred for life by their experience of that dreadful event. All of us who have travelled in India and, like me, have been to Mumbai feel that tragedy particularly because of what a magnificent country India is and what a wonderful people India has. That this tragic event happened upon Indian soil is something that touched the hearts of all Australians and people all over the world. As Senator Faulkner properly says, it is a gruesome reminder of just how determined those who perpetrate terrorism are that they are prepared to take innocent life in pursuit of their horrific objectives. I am pleased that in this country the government and the opposition stand firm together in our joint efforts, whether we are in government or in opposition, to ensure Australia plays its part in combating this sort of evil—terrorism—that so tragically befell Mumbai one year ago today.

          by leave—I concur with Senator Faulkner and Senator Minchin and join with fellow senators in expressing horror at what happened in Mumbai and the greatest empathy and sympathy for those who suffered. I also note that one of the circumstances of that terrible event was the illiterate vulnerability of some of the people who were manipulated into taking part in that act of terrorism. One cannot go through the detail of that event without feeling abhorrence at the bastardry of those who manipulated that act of terrorism from a distance in a cowardly act that kept them safe while they sent in pawns to kill, maim and destroy the lives of the innocent. That is, of course, the hallmark of terrorism and it is totally unforgivable. I simply add to the words of the previous two speakers in wishing the best recovery possible for the people who were so terribly afflicted in Mumbai a year ago today.
