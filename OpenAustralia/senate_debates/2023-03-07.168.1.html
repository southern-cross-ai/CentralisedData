       <p>
        I rise to take note of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters report on the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Amendment Bill, which has already been tabled by the government whip. I wish to make some comments in relation to that report.
       </p>
       <p>
        The coalition strongly believes that any discussion or consideration of constitutional change should be—in itself—considered, measured and balanced. The changes proposed in this bill will set a precedent for future referenda and should not be considered as temporary or be adopted lightly. The government's decision to rush this inquiry over the Christmas and summer holiday period is disappointing because it has limited the ability of JSCEM members to effectively scrutinise witnesses and the proposed legislation.
       </p>
       <p>
        While there are a number of sensible and constructive changes included in the bill, it is clear that the government has put forward other changes that are not in the interest of an informed and robust process for conducting a referendum. We are pleased to note that the government has agreed to our recommendation that there should be the publication and communication of an official pamphlet. However, coalition members are very disappointed that there will not be a designation of official campaign entities in addition to the adequate and equal funding of 'yes' and 'no' campaigns. In particular, we believe that our recommendations negate recommendation 2 of the chair's report, and we are concerned that the government's report puts at risk a successful referendum process with integrity and appropriate protections against misinformation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The coalition, along with numerous stakeholders and submitters, remain greatly dissatisfied at the government's decision not to create and fund official 'yes' and 'no' organisations. We believe, regardless of your view on the Voice, that the cases for and against should be dealt with in an appropriate and adult manner across the community and that the referendum should be managed in a manner that is most similar to how a federal election has been run, considering that a referendum has not been conducted in this country for over 20 years. It is for that reason that the coalition do not support the passing of the bill. Further comments will be made when the bill comes before the Senate chamber later this week.
       </p>
       <p>
        I seek leave to continue my remarks.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted; debate adjourned.
