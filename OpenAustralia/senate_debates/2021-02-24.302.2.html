        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Birmingham. Yesterday the Minister for Defence claimed twice, for complete clarity, that she had met with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Federal Police
        </a>
        on two occasions, with the first meeting being on 1 April 2019 with Ms Higgins and her then chief of staff. The minister was then forced to correct the record. This is the second time this week that the Minister for Defence has been forced to correct her statements during question time. Does the Prime Minister have full confidence in the minister's account to the parliament in relation to these matters?

         Yes, the Prime Minister has full confidence in Senator Reynolds and in her work in her portfolio and in her handling of these very sensitive matters, including her work to ensure the parliament is informed in relation to these matters whilst being cognisant of the responsibilities, as Senator Reynolds has outlined, to treat carefully and with confidence information that was shared with her, to respect Ms Brittany Higgins's right to tell her story and to be mindful of consequences for any potential police investigation.

            As the opposition, the parliament and more broadly know, there are a number of review processes underway. That includes work in relation to ascertaining the handling of events in relation to this matter. However, it is also important that that work is cognisant of any potential implications in relation to police investigations too.

              The Prime Minister has publicly rebuked Minister Reynolds for failing to tell him of allegations of rape in her office two years ago. Minister Reynolds has said it is not her story to tell. Who is correctâ€”Minister Reynolds or the Prime Minister?

               I think Senator Reynolds has been clear in this place that, in relation to the details of what Ms Brittany Higgins shared with Senator Reynolds and her former chief of staff, they should absolutely make sure that Ms Higgins's wishes and privacy are respected during that time, and Senator Reynolds has been careful in relation to the manner in which she has shared that information. And the Prime Minister has indicated that in relation to matters of serious crimes he would expect to be informed, and I think his statements stand in that regard.
