        My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Senator Wong. Can the minister outline to the Senate why this government places a high priority on ensuring all policies are properly costed and that all spending commitments are fully funded? Has the Minister seen any announcements—

            I thank the senator for her question. This government understands that you have to cost policies and you have to fund them. That is what we have certainly done in our budget. That is what we have done in the mid-year review.

               I somehow do not think Senator Sinodinos was laughing then. But, anyway, we will come to that point. We have laid out our plans in our budget. We found $100 billion worth of savings over a number of budgets, and we have laid out our plans, including what we will cut in order to fund things.

               , because it is embarrassing as a member of the economic team on the other side—is to do what the opposition is doing, which is to try and hide your $70 billion black hole, not tell anybody what your budget position is, not tell anybody what you are going to cut, not tell anybody how you are going to fund anything and certainly not do any proper costings. So what we have seen is Mr Robb and

                Mr Hockey

                Tony Abbott
               </a>
               . And, because they are refusing to tell anybody, we thought we would give them a helping hand. So I released yesterday what the 2012-13 budget would look like under Tony Abbott: a $9 billion deficit.

                   I can understand why Senator Cormann has not shut up at one point during this answer. He did not yesterday, on Twitter, either. He is extremely embarrassed as a so-called senior member of the economic team that people are actually starting to ask what the true budget position would be under you.

As Senator Sinodinos reminded us all this morning, there has been some untidiness from the coalition on returning the budget to surplus. He calls it untidy—well, a $9 billion deficit in 2012-13 is pretty untidy.

                         (—) (): As Senator Sinodinos also knows, a clear fiscal strategy is essential for good government. The alternative is a series of unfunded, unaffordable, undeliverable promises. We have seen the opposition conceding that they have to find $70 billion worth of cuts, but they do not want to tell the Australian people what they are. They do not want to do their costings. They give their costings to a catering company. A catering company is going to do their costings, and who can forget the election costings done by an accounting firm that was subsequently found to have breached professional standards. This is the standard of the coalition's budget numbers. What we know is it is more than untidy. It is $70 billion worth of cuts, the equivalent of every Medicare payment for four years. That is what they have to find; that is what they are hiding.
