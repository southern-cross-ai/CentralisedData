           It's a longstanding practice not to disclose information about the operations and business of the cabinet and its committees, including when a matter went to cabinet, who attended and what form of submission was provided, as to do so could potentially reveal the deliberations of the cabinet, which are indeed confidential.

              We support this motion. The people of Queensland and of Australia deserve to be treated with respect and to have confidence that the government's serious and far-reaching decisions taking us through the COVID scare are based on credible and robust data. The government's huge economic response is based on the Doherty institute report. It seems that is in turn based on the flawed assumptions of Professor Ferguson,
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_College" rel="nofollow">
               Imperial College
              </a>
              , London, and I am deeply concerned as to the validity of the data and concerned about decisions made on that basis. Professor Ferguson's modelling predictions are known to be wildly exaggerated and fanciful. His work has had devastating impacts on national economies. Yet his assumptions are cited as the basis for the Doherty report. I refer to the model description where baseline values and more were obtained from Imperial College in London. The government should release Treasury and health department modelling and scenario work as the basis for blowing $320 billion.

                 I'm very concerned that we see things like Treasury modelling, which is used to inform the Treasurer, having a claim of cabinet-in-confidence made over it. It seems the government is spraying cabinet sprinkle dust right across a whole range of decision-making, which, basically, denies the Australian public the ability to scrutinise and to participate in our democracy. It's really important that we have openness and transparency in relation to these matters. I remind the government that the Prime Minister is at liberty to waive any genuine privilege in relation to cabinet documents so that the Australian population can see the basis upon which decisions were made by the government.
