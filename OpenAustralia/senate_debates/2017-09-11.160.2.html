        I seek leave to amend general business notice of motion No. 479 standing in the names of Senators Griff and Xenophon and in my name relating to Aboriginal deaths in custody.

       <p class="italic">

       <p class="italic">
        (i)   on 22 August 2017, Mr Kunmanara Gibson, a 47-year-old Aboriginal man for whom English was a second language, died in custody after being found unconscious in his cell at Adelaide’s city watch house,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii)   an Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement (ALRM) duty officer was advised of Mr Gibson’s arrest, however, the

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iv)   recommendation 224 states: 'in jurisdictions where legislation, standing orders or instructions do not already so provide, appropriate steps be taken to make it mandatory for Aboriginal Legal Services to be notified upon the arrest or detention of any Aboriginal person other than such arrests or detentions for which it is agreed between the Aboriginal Legal Services and the Police Services that notification is not required',

       <p class="italic">
        (vi)   to date, ALRM has been operating a limited Custody Notification Service in South Australia, however, it does not satisfy requirements of a best practice model, as exemplified by the

           The government supports the implementation of custody notification services in each state and territory to ensure an Aboriginal Legal Service is contacted when an Indigenous person is taken into custody. That is why the government offered funding and support to the states and territories to legislate and take up their responsibility for this recommendation of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">
            Royal Commission

            Aboriginal Deaths in Custody

           . This government has put the offer on the table. It is now up to the state and territory governments to do the right thing and introduce this support for
