         I thank Senator Moore for her question. The Labor Party has a very strong record when it comes to dental health. In August 2012 the government announced a $4.1 billion package of dental health reform. There are a number of elements in this package designed to target the dental health of people, particularly those in need. There will be $2.7 billion allocated to fund basic dental treatment for eligible children and teenagers from 1 January 2014. It includes $1.3 billion for states and territories to expand services for adults in the public dental system from 1 July 2014. There will be $225 million allocated for a flexible grants program in 2014 to provide dental infrastructure in outer metropolitan, rural and regional areas, where we know that the dental health of the community is not to the level of the whole population. Around 3.4 million eligible children and teenagers between the ages of two and 17 will receive $1,000 over a two-year period for basic dental services such as check-ups, X-rays, fillings and extractions.
        </p>
        <p>
         Further, the government has entered into a national partnership agreement with all states and territories to provide more public dental services. There has been $345.9 million provided to states and territories over three years to provide dental services to eligible concession card holders. Over $1.3 billion will be provided over four years to states and territories, under the national partnership agreement, to expand services for up to 1.4 million low-income adults in the public dental system. There will also be $450,000 provided over three years to support the provision of pro bono dental services to disadvantaged groups.

           report, delivered to the government in February 2012, said that there were 400,000 people in Australia waiting to access public dental services. These people were not able to get care under the Howard government's flawed Chronic Disease Dental Scheme. That is why the government has invested $344 million in last year's budget for a public dental waiting lists blitz—so that these 400,000 people can get the care they need. This investment is already flowing through and reducing public dental waiting lists. In addition, in the 2012 budget the government committed funding to strengthen Australia's dental workforce. There will be an increase in the number of placements available on the Voluntary Dental Graduate Year Program, and there will also be an increase in the number of placements for oral health therapists in a similar scheme. There will be incentives provided to encourage and support dentists—

             I advise the Senate that the government took the very sensible measure to close the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme because that scheme was not being used appropriately. Frankly, we were finding that people were using that scheme not for check-ups, not for fillings, not for—particularly—paediatric work but for caps, and, in many respects, for cosmetic purposes. That is why our government took the decision to close that scheme and relocate that money to the appropriate area.
