         In respect of this amendment we may need either to decide to call a quorum or, if you could let me know where we are up to, I can argue the case whilst I get an adviser. Perhaps if you wanted to add something to the debate, Senator Nash, I can then take a lead?

           Senator Nash is correct. However, we had just ordered an additional piece of information from the minister on the question of, if I remember correctly, the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
            ACCC
           </a>
           inquiry. I think the minister was just about answering a question that I had asked about whether the inquiry was able to look at the issues around third parties and the extent to which they could look at the restructuring, or potential restructuring, of a particular district. I was interested in what people are now calling a ‘Swiss cheese approach’ of just buying out particular properties and, as a result, additional expense being put on the whole of the district when those properties are bought out. That would have been my subsequent question in response to her answer. We left the debate yesterday with her saying that she thought that the ACCC was looking at some of that information and that their report was being provided to the minister. She said that the minister would then make a decision. So I am, in fact, still interested in getting an answer to that question because it will help us to decide how we should be voting on this inquiry. If the work, as the minister is saying, has already been done then I do not see any need to repeat it. But if that work is not being done, this inquiry would help to gain that information.

            Senator Siewert is indeed right. I think we had reached that point yesterday but, if the amendment had been put at that point, we would not have been able to take into account that information. As I indicated yesterday, I was also very interested in hearing the response from the minister on that particular issue. My understanding, as I said yesterday, is that particularly within the industry there is not a level of comfort—that what Senator Siewert is trying to ascertain is indeed the case. I certainly understand that there has been some interaction between the industry and the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
             ACCC
            </a>
            . That having been the case, and with them still coming to the coalition with concerns about the process, it really leads me to believe that perhaps it is not the case that that third-party effect is going to be undertaken by the ACCC. Hence the need, we thought, for moving our amendment.
           </p>
           <p>
            Again, just to reiterate from yesterday, there is going to be, as Senator Siewert and others have pointed out, a lot of adjustment throughout the communities. We are looking at bulk water holders and the impact on them of changes in arrangements, of potentially taking water out for a public good. We believe that needs to be very closely looked at to ensure there are not consequences flowing on from the act of taking that water out for that public good. So we feel that this amendment is entirely appropriate in making sure at the very least that there is a safeguard for this process. I am sure the minister will very shortly give us some advice on the workings of the ACCC and I am sure she will very definitively point out how it is all in hand and all being undertaken through the ACCC process. But our view is very clearly that this amendment is appropriate. It will work, at the very least, as a safeguard to ensure that the effect on third parties around the bulk water arrangements is taken very much into consideration.

            <p>
             I thank Senator Nash for enabling me to arrive in the chamber. I apologise to the chamber; I was somewhat delayed. I think I went through yesterday the issue of where the government is currently proceeding in relation to the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
              ACCC
             </a>
             and other matters. I think it might be useful if I perhaps go through where those inquiries are at. First, in relation to termination fees, which I think Senator Nash talked about on the last occasion when this amendment was being debated, they are a legitimate mechanism to do with third-party impacts of irrigators terminating access to an operator’s irrigation network. Obviously, one of the discussions that have been raised with me on a number of occasions is the quantum. Unsurprisingly, depending on where people are in that commercial arrangement, they have different views about that. Currently the schedule E protocol to the Murray-Darling Basin agreement on access, exit and termination fees requires that the termination fees only be allowed when an irrigator terminates access to the operation network and that the termination fee be capped at 15 times the annual fixed access or shadow access fee. My advice is that the 15 times limit was a decision of the previous government.
            </p>
            <p>
             I do not know whether I should wait until Senator Siewert is able to listen; I do not know whether she wants me to explain this or not. In terms of the termination fee, which obviously is a legitimate mechanism, as I said, to deal with third-party impacts, the current arrangements are that, under schedule E to the agreement, the termination fee is capped at 15 times the annual fixed access or shadow access fee. As I understand it, that was a decision of the previous government predicated on advice which had been provided, including by the ACCC.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Water Act, which passed through this parliament under the previous government, requires the Commonwealth minister to obtain and have regard to advice from the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Competition_and_Consumer_Commission" rel="nofollow">
              Australian Competition and Consumer Commission
             </a>
             in making the water market and water charge rules to apply in the basin. I am advised the ACCC is undertaking an exhaustive three-stage process of consultation to develop these rules. In July of this year, in response to stakeholder feedback—I emphasise also at the request of the ACCC—I extended the deadline for the ACCC to provide its advice in order to allow more time for stakeholder consultation. Currently the ACCC is due to provide its final advice on rules for termination fees and water market rules to me next month. The draft rules for termination fees provide for operators to levy termination fees but only when they choose to terminate access to the operator’s network and recommend that termination fees be capped at 10 times the annual fixed access fee. I am advised this provides 12 to 15 years of annual access fees. So that is the mechanism by which third-party impact is managed.
            </p>
            <p>
             The draft rules also provide for the ACCC to approve the imposition of higher termination fees where contained in new or existing contracts. For those operators worried about security against irrigators transforming and trading out without paying termination fees or ongoing access fees, the draft water market rules provide for operators to obtain security. There is obviously no clear formula by which we can calculate the correct termination fee multiple. Setting the multiple is not a deterministic process but takes into account a range of competing objectives. In recommending in the draft rules the termination fee level be at 10 times the access fee, the ACCC has attempted to strike the right balance between providing, on the one hand, investment certainty for operators and irrigators and, on the other hand, incentives for rationalisation to promote the efficient delivery of required services and water trade.
            </p>
            <p>
             I pause there to emphasise that point. I think Senator Siewert asked, if not yesterday, perhaps last night, about third-party impacts. As I said, a termination fee is one of the ways in which one manages that. It is important to recognise the countervailing policy considerations, and that is that an excessive termination fee—and I appreciate people may have different views as to what that will mean—clearly operates as a barrier to the sort of rationalisation or adjustment we know will be required in the industry. So there are balancing policy objectives here in terms of ensuring that you have a certain investment environment so as to provide an appropriate and sufficient level of investment certainty without, at the same time, creating barriers to the sort of adjustment that we know will need to occur and which irrigators may want.
            </p>
            <p>
             The government believes it is prudent to monitor any new regulatory arrangements to ensure that they have the desired effect in terms of setting appropriate rules for the market and for market participants and do not have any unintended consequences. To this end, the draft rules recommend a review of the water charge rules, which would include termination fees, to commence by 2012 and conclude by 2013.
            </p>
            <p>
             I trust that that assists the chamber in terms of some of the questions which arose yesterday in relation to this amendment. I suggest that a range of the issues that Senator Nash has raised concerns about are already being considered by government and I am certainly happy, if senators are seeking it, to provide further information after the ACCC has provided to me their final advice on termination fees and water market rules.
            </p>

              (1)    As soon as practicable after the commencement of this section, the Government must determine an assistance package of a minimum $50 million for Lower Lakes and Coorong communities to help farmers, small businesses, tourism and community sectors to respond to the crisis caused by the lack of water.

             <p>
              There has been a lot of discussion, particularly over the last few months, about the Lower Lakes and the Coorong. Indeed, I participated in one of the inquiries that went to the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport looking particularly into the state of the Lower Lakes and the Coorong and into what arrangements might be necessary to assist. It looked at, initially, the state determining whether there was any water able to go south to the Lower Lakes and the Coorong and what steps governments should take to remedy the situation. One of the recommendations that came forward from coalition senators at that time was that there was a very distinct need for assistance for the Coorong and the Lower Lakes given the very dire situation that they were in.
             </p>
             <p>
              With this amendment we are intending to require the government to determine an assistance package of a minimum of $50 million for the Lower Lakes and the Coorong. This is to assist communities, farmers, small businesses and the tourism and community sectors to respond to the crisis which has been caused by this lack of water. We think it is an entirely appropriate amendment. We believe that the financial assistance that would then be put forward from the government would go a significant way to alleviating the hardship being experienced by the people in that region at the moment.

                I assume the senator is aware of what conveyance water is—I was actually asked by a senator in a division the other day what it is. It is additional water to the water that is used required to ensure delivery. So you need to release more water than you actually need at the other end, for obvious reasons, because of the losses on the way. These words were agreed through the IGA process, including with

                ; this is a critical human need of communities around the Lower Lakes below Wellington.

The definition is agreed with South Australia and, in relation to the Lower Lakes and the Coorong, the critical human needs are being secured by the mechanisms, including a very substantial amount of funding, that I described.

                  I am advised that Wellington is the end of the regulated system, and that portion of the river—as the senator would know—includes the off-takes for Adelaide’s water supply. My advice is that it is the end of the easily regulated system. I am not sure if that is, in fact, a term. The point is, the off-takes to Adelaide are upstream of Wellington, as the senator would know.

                   Yes, I do know the off-takes for Adelaide are upstream. My question, in both legal and practical terms, relates to what is not upstream of Wellington, to what is downstream of Wellington.

                    are considering very seriously their position on this bill. There are a range of significant advantages in the bill for South Australia. One of them is, for the first time, the formalisation of arrangements which have worked informally until now through the process that the former Prime Minister and other former ministers established, I think on

                    </a>
                    senators from all sides of the chamber should be aware of this—is to obtain agreement from the states, including the upstream states, to formalise those arrangements, thereby giving a far greater level of water security to South Australians.

                    I know the political point that Senator Fisher is trying to make. We are addressing the issue of the supply of potable water to the Lower Lakes communities, as I have described, through the pipeline mechanism. But this is not a problem where there is a quick and easy fix. It is certainly not a problem that her government was able to find any solution to in 12 years. We are facing an extremely difficult situation, as senators are aware, in the Lower Lakes and Coorong—as we are, frankly, at many wetlands upstream. Senator Fisher can try and make some points about a definition here, but the fact is that this is a more beneficial set of provisions for your state, Senator, than your government ever achieved in the Turnbull bill and, frankly, it should be supported.

I am endeavouring to understand the basis upon which—the reasons why—the definition in the bill does not contemplate conveyance water for critical human water needs going any further than Wellington in South Australia. I am trying to establish the reasons why it is seen fit to have those communities rely on external mechanisms rather than conveyance water and critical human needs water, which the bill sees as appropriate for the rest of the basin. I am trying to ascertain and understand the reasons why it is not seen as appropriate for communities downstream of Wellington in South Australia.

                       I would like to put on record the Greens’ support for the coalition amendment here. I think it is really important that we do something to support the communities who rely on the Lower Lakes and the Coorong. We know that the lack of water has been devastating for people in those communities. We know that, even though we hate to talk about these things, the level of suicide in those communities is increasing. That is how desperate the situation is for people whose businesses are folding, whose schools are closing, whose lifestyles and livelihoods are on the brink of collapse because they just do not know what the future holds for them. We need to be doing whatever we can to support those communities, whether it is transitioning to other types of industries or whether it is giving them a bit of a stopgap measure until we get some increased flows. I am quite concerned—and I spoke about this in my speech in the second reading debate—that this bill as it stands does very little for the Lower Lakes and the Coorong area to respond to the desperate and urgent need for increased flows and support for the community. The opposition should be commended for this amendment.

The opposition has, particularly throughout the course of the second reading and committee stage debates of this legislation, sought to recognise that many communities are stressed throughout the system. We have sought to do this by calling for structural adjustment funding throughout the basin system. We have sought to do this by calling for support for exit grants and packages that are necessary throughout the system. In doing so, we have recognised that, right throughout the Murray-Darling Basin system, many, many communities are under stress, particularly irrigation communities in my home state—and the home state of Senator Hanson-Young, Senator Fisher and the minister—of
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                         South Australia
                        </a>
                        . We recognise that those Riverland irrigation communities are under particular stress and pressure.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        But coming down through the system, with this, one of the last amendments that we propose, we recognise that the Lower Lakes communities are also under pressure. We have recognised, throughout the second reading debate and the committee stage debate, the strains that communities throughout the basin system have been facing. We now recognise that the Lower Lakes communities equally are feeling particular pressure. We have seen thousands upon thousands of
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
                         South Australian
                        </a>
                        s protest in support of those Lower Lakes communities, protest in support of delivering additional water and additional support for the communities there, particularly the people of Goolwa, who are very passionate and are urging the state government and others to consider alternative proposals. This amendment tries to help them through the tough times. Just as we have sought to find ways to help irrigators through the tough times, we see this as a way to try to help those businesses, those tourism operators, those many people suffering throughout the Lower Lakes through the tough times. I commend the amendment to the house.

                         has now been well documented and I think is recognised, as it needs to be. I recognise that there are measures in progress to provide some assistance for the Coorong and the Lower Lakes. The trouble is that it is becoming too little and we fear that it will be too late. These initiatives need to be progressed more quickly and, pending progress of those initiatives, the opposition sees the need for the sorts of measures outlined in this amendment.

It is very good that the state government and the federal government through national initiatives have found a way to find 10 gigalitres of water to pump into Lake Bonney in the Riverland in South Australia in the next two months. However, I do note that through the recent Senate committee process coalition senators and others, including the Greens and Independents, were cognisant of evidence given to that inquiry that 30 to 60 gigalitres would be very prudent at the very least in respect of Coorong and the Lower Lakes. So it is very pleasing that state and federal governments through a national system have found a way to secure 10 gigalitres to be pumped into Lake Bonney in the next two months. It does raise a question as to when the same mechanism will be able to deliver 30 to 50 gigalitres required to help Coorong and the Lower Lakes.

                          I indicate my support for this amendment and I support the sentiments expressed by Senators Fisher, Hanson-Young and Birmingham in relation to this. The people of the Lower Lakes are bearing the brunt of years and years of policy inaction and mismanagement of the river upstream, and I think it is entirely appropriate that there be this additional package. I think it would be churlish not to acknowledge the assistance that the Commonwealth has given in terms of the pipeline project and a number of other measures. That needs to be acknowledged and it is welcome. But I believe this additional assistance is warranted in the context of the additional pressures the people of the Lower Lakes have been facing, through no fault of their own, as a result of not only the double whammy of drought and climate change but also the fundamental issues of overallocation and of mismanagement of the river system upstream.

I do not mind the crossbenchers holding governments accountable; you should do that. But what I do mind—

                              I want to make these points and perhaps remind the chamber, including the crossbenchers, of the Liberal Party’s position and the National Party’s position on water. I hope that the Greens when they hold us to account also hold to account those opposite for failing to do anything for 12 years. I hope when they hold us to account they also hold the opposition to account for their criticism of water purchase, which I understood the Greens to support and which this government has had the courage, in the face of very significant opposition upstream, to continue. I hope that, just as the opposition is commended for moving an amendment, the Greens would also commend the government for, in the face of significant political opposition, continuing water purchases because we believe it is the right thing to do.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              I hope when people criticise the government for its perceived failures that there is also a recognition of statements being made by opposition frontbenchers such as, ‘Minister Wong’s decision to buy $3.1 billion of water entitlements guarantees that communities currently in the worst drought in living memory will go from a natural drought to a Rudd-made drought.’ I hope those sorts of comments are the subject of criticism from the Greens and from Liberal senators like Senator Birmingham who say we should buy more. I hope when we talk about the Lower Lakes that Liberal senators who stood up in here and said that we should save the Lower Lakes will come out and condemn frontbenchers of their own party who say that we should open the barrages to the Lower Lakes. But I have not heard Senators Birmingham and Fisher do that.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              People criticise this government for seeking to move to free up water trading and to negotiate to remove the caps that limit that trading. I hope that those who think we should do that also criticise Liberal frontbenchers who criticise those efforts, such as Dr Stone, and say those caps should not be removed. So let us inject into this debate a little bit of fairness, a little bit of policy rigour, because I for one am tired of this debate not recognising the extraordinary inconsistencies of those opposite. Senators Birmingham and Fisher can come in here and talk about the Lower Lakes but refuse to roll people in their own party who are critical of water purchases.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              We had the extraordinary situation in Senate estimates where we talked about a 1,500-gigalitre target. I think the Greens have been on record wanting double that. My recollection, Senator Brown, is that in one of the elections you indicated 3,000 gigalitres. That is reasonable for an environmental party to push; I accept that. We had Senator Joyce saying, in front of everybody, to Senator Birmingham, ‘We don’t support that.’ This is the alternative government. What is their policy? What is their position? So all I say to those from an environmental perspective who commend the opposition is this: I trust you will be reasonable enough and fair enough and recognise your own constituency enough to also condemn them for the great many things that they either failed to do or still are not supportive of.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              In terms of this Lower Lakes issue, the same sorts of inconsistencies by those opposite that I have already outlined are really most patent. Senators, you cannot come in here professing that you do everything for the people of the Lower Lakes and professing that you want to see water returned to that area unless you are prepared to do the hard yards and roll those in your party who are opposed to water purchases and who have described this purchasing as a ‘Rudd-made drought’. You cannot have it both ways, because ultimately people will judge you by what you do, not by what you say. You speak but you do not act. You do not come out and say, ‘They’re wrong.’ You do not come out and say, ‘This is our position.’ You do not come out and say: ‘Yes, we will do this. We will purchase. We will ensure that those upstream know that the Victorian Liberals and the National Party members who are opposed to purchases, those who are critical of purchases, do not represent the views of Mr Turnbull and the party.’ I actually think Mr Turnbull does think we should do something, but clearly he and those around him are unable to control the members of the National Party who are running this debate in the Senate and the members of their own front bench who are more interested in speaking to their local constituency and not dealing with the big problem.

                               The reality is the honourable thing to do is not to play local politics and build on people’s fears but to be upfront with them about what reality we confront in the basin. This government is actually prepared to do that. We are prepared to say upfront to these communities: ‘Yes, we think you have to adjust. We think all in the Murray-Darling Basin have to adjust. That is why we are doing what we are doing. That is why we are prepared to purchase.’
                              </p>
                              <p>
                               In relation to the assistance that is proposed here, my recollection is that, although those opposite never made a formal funding decision to allocate structural adjustment, they are now requiring that of this government. I assume, given their position, that they would want that taken out of the water purchase entitlement. I do not know, in terms of this agreement or this position between the Greens and the Liberal Party, whether that has been agreed. I want to make the point that this government has done more in one year to assist this community than was ever done by those opposite. I would hope, just as Senator Hanson-Young commends the Liberal Party for an amendment requiring $50 million to be paid—

                                   Through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, I note Senator Hanson-Young is prepared to interject to criticise the government but not when I say that perhaps it is reasonable for the Greens, consistent with their policy position, to commend the government for having the courage to be the first government in the nation’s history to purchase water. I hope also that when people talk about the Lower Lakes they might recognise that, while those opposite can move an amendment, we are actually the ones putting money on the ground. We have committed some $320 million in total to the Lower Lakes and Coorong: $120 million for piping to secure the water needs of the communities which were discussed in the previous amendment, plus $200 million for a lasting solution as to the Lower Lakes for the

                                   We know that much more needs to be done. Yes, I do have a personal understanding of this area, Senator Hanson-Young, but the problems in the Lower Lakes are problems which are endemic to the system as a whole, particularly the southern basin. And, as many environmentalists have said, this is the most obvious example of the legacy that we—all of us—have inherited, particularly this government in having to address it, and is most obvious at the Lower Lakes. There are a great many wetlands, a great many environmental assets upstream which are also under pressure. I have spoken before in this place about a visit which made a great impression on me: I went to Bottle Bend near Mildura and an irrigator talked to me about the fact that the acidity levels in that billabong were equivalent to sulfuric acid.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                   There are environmental pressures throughout this system. That is why we are committed to purchasing: because that is the fastest way to return water to the system. Again, it is opposed by many of those opposite. Senator Nash can get up and say, ‘We support water purchases but in the right environment, in the right circumstances.’ There are many on your frontbench who do not, and they are on the record as saying it. That is why we are investing in infrastructure return efficiencies to the river, and I notice again that the shadow minister and others have been critical of the government for not rolling this out. Firstly, we have rolled out more than was ever the case under the previous government. Secondly, we know that investing in irrigation infrastructure is the right thing to do to ensure that the economic base for those communities continues to be viable and productive. But we also know that savings yielded through that process take far longer to be returned to the river simply by virtue of the nature of getting those projects out.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                   I simply want to place on record here that this is a government that takes this issue seriously and that is undertaking practical measures to address these issues. We are making progress. A solution will not be achieved overnight and I do not think anybody—if they are honest—in this chamber believes that. We do not support this amendment. We point to what we are already doing and that is providing $200 million for a lasting solution to the Lower Lakes, $120 million for pipelines and a continued program of returning water to this system in order to improve its health, because that is what is demanded in the basin.

                                    The minister said that we need to inject a little bit of fairness into the debate. I would also like to inject a little bit of history into the debate.

                                    for years and years have been calling on calling for action for the Murray, for the entire basin. We have continuously criticised whatever side of this chamber was in government and called for better action, for better foresight in seeing what we needed to do to tackle the overallocation issue and its implications for communities further downstream. I would like to remind the minister that when this bill first came into play it was the Greens that were moving amendments to strengthen the arrangements, to strengthen the impact on saving the river Murray, saving the basin and giving communities hope and security. There was very little support from either side—either the then opposition, the Labor Party, or the then government, the coalition. So as well as injecting a little bit of fairness, I think we also need to inject a little bit of history.

                                    Even as recently as yesterday, the Greens stood up and acknowledged the good things the government has done on this issue over the last 12 months. But we are talking here about an amendment to give some immediate relief to those communities in the Lower Lakes and the Coorong. We acknowledge that things are happening slowly and further down the track in terms of trying to offer security to these communities, but this package is about trying to relieve the pressure that the communities feel now—and it is important to do that. It is a shame that the minister cannot see that that is an important thing that these communities need right now. They need this support right now. They need action right now.

                                     We have probably been debating this bill for close to 10 hours, through the second reading stage and the committee stage. Throughout those debates, at numerous intersections, Minister Wong has accused us and others in the chamber—but particularly those of us on this side—of playing politics with the debate. She has accused us of being overtly political throughout the debate. Perhaps the pot should look in the mirror at the kettle, because we just had 15 minutes of overt politics, of totally playing politics. However, it is not for the first time in this debate by any means—for the umpteenth time, the minister has felt the need, particularly during this committee stage, to hector and lecture on political point-scoring matters.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                     I would like to think that we will have robust debates here and yes, Minister, we will actually have robust political debates too—you know that and I know that; we are all grown-ups and we all recognise that politics will be engaged in just as the issues will be engaged in—but do not lecture us on the one hand about playing politics and then give us 15-minute political lectures on the other hand.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                     The minister knows full well that the process of funding buybacks was started by Mr Turnbull. The minister knows equally well that it was also not long before the election that the Water Act was passed; it was passed only a couple months prior to the election. It was one of the last pieces of legislation dealt with in this chamber. Minister, you know that. You know very well that that is the case. If it had not been for the fact that Minister Turnbull had allocated $10 billion of funding in last year’s budget, you would not have managed to get the funding through the razor gang this year. You would not have managed to get the extra funding that was required to have that $10 billion to be able to do these things. So you owe Mr Turnbull a lot for the fact that he put the process in place. He started things going. He started the ball rolling. Indeed, if your Victorian Labor Party counterparts had not been playing politics with this issue throughout the course of last year, throughout the lead-up to the last election, more may well have been able to be done. The minister obviously feels like she needs a little bit more loving today. She wants some commendation. Minister, I am happy to commend you.

                                          I thank the minister for that interlude. I am sure my fiance, who is looking—I hope—to meet me on the aisle in a week or two will not be getting too concerned about any arrangements that we may have. Nonetheless, I will not give the minister the loving but I will give her the commendation. I commend the minister for the fact that building has started on the pipelines to the Lower Lakes and the Narrung Peninsula for the communities there.
                                         </p>
                                         <p>
                                          It is noteworthy that two years ago, when this proposal was first made, the
                                          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">

                                          </a>
                                          n government were not calling for those pipelines to be built. Of course they were not calling for them to be built, because at that stage the water levels in the lakes were higher than they have been this year. At that stage, the process was in crisis but not so much in crisis. At that stage, they did not see piping water to the lakes as the solution; this year they did. And I recognise that the government acted and acted quickly to support them.
                                         </p>
                                         <p>
                                          The question I pose, though, is: if the government can build infrastructure for the Lower Lakes communities so quickly, if it can fund that infrastructure so very quickly and get works happening on the ground so quickly, why can’t it do it elsewhere? That infrastructure is important. It provides water security for the Lower Lakes communities, but it does not actually save any water. It is not the type of infrastructure that is about increasing efficiencies in irrigation elsewhere throughout the system. It is purely infrastructure that provides security to the communities. That is critical, but it is not the water-saving infrastructure that is so desperately needed throughout the rest of the basin. If non-water saving infrastructure can be put on the ground and started within a matter of months then why can’t other projects where hundreds of gigalitres of water could potentially be saved—the Menindee Lakes and elsewhere—be done in months, not years? That is what we should expect from the government when it comes to delivery across the basin, not just in that one community.
                                         </p>
                                         <p>
                                          What was noteworthy throughout the minister’s 15-minute contribution was that she barely mentioned the communities. Senator Hanson-Young was right to draw the debate back to the Lower Lakes communities and to the point of this very amendment, which is to ensure that some tangible support is provided to those communities. The tangible support that we have called for is to assist irrigators and communities throughout the basin to help them survive the tough times they are in. The minister was right when she said that progress would not be achieved overnight. That is why these communities need support. They need support because progress will not be achieved overnight, and they need support to be able to sustain themselves into the future. They need support so that all the businesses do not close their doors, so that all the farmers do not leave their properties, so that the marinas are not put out of business by all the boats having to be taken to other marinas, so that the tourism industry and other industries in the area are not decimated, so that the schools stay open and so that the facilities of those communities are sustained through the difficult times until progress is made. That is why this amendment is critically important. That is why it should be supported by this house. I commend it to the Senate.

                                           Just very briefly, I will not counter all the issues that Senator Birmingham put on the record. Robust political debate—I am up for that. I do not think you would accuse me otherwise, Senator Birmingham. But I think there is a political game playing that people should be called on when what they say and what they do are so different. I note that Senator Birmingham, despite his professed support for purchases et cetera, has always failed to condemn or clarify that his government’s position is not that articulated by Dr Stone—

                                             Sorry, opposition. Thank you, Senator Birmingham—that his party’s position is not that of Dr Stone, Mr Cobb or Senator Joyce. The relevant shadow minister, who clearly does not have the internal party political power to deliver this, has never come out and said that Senator Joyce, Dr Stone and Mr Cobb et al are wrong. So my point about playing politics is that people will judge this government and the opposition, as the alternative government, not simply by what they say but by what they do.

                                             I think a number of times in this debate I have been in the rather odd position of being the defender of the Turnbull act. I do acknowledge that Mr Turnbull commenced this process. He did not achieve very much but he did commence this process, and he did get an act through that Senator Nash, on behalf of your party or your opposition, has moved amendments to. We have defended the Turnbull legislation on certain—

                                               No. I leave that to you, Senator Hanson-Young. It is not a perfect act. That is why we have brought forward a very substantial bill to amend it. But there are a couple of key areas where the opposition has moved amendments to its own act. When this comes back from the lower house it will be a test of Mr Turnbull’s leadership. It will be a test of whether those in the opposition who have professed concern on these issues are actually able to stand up to those also on that side who do not want water purchases and who want to continue to oppose it. It will be a test of Mr Turnbull’s leadership as to whether or not those extreme elements inside the coalition will scuttle a piece of legislation that is so important.

                                               I accept that there are differences of views about whether this bill goes as far as people want. There are differences of views from Senator Xenophon and from the Greens, and a different set of differences of views at times from the Nationals and the Liberal Party. But, ultimately, when this comes back from the lower house the test will be whether you are prepared to back genuine reform or whether you are prepared to scuttle it in the interests of playing politics. I would suggest that that latter path will really demonstrate that what you say and what you do are poles apart.

                                                Senator Hanson-Young has really covered the field, but I just want to comment on the minister’s approach to this. As the minister said, the Greens have been campaigning to get action on the Murray-Darling Basin for many years, and that included a 3,000-gigalitre guaranteed flow. We campaigned for that because the scientific evidence was that one quarter of the flow should be guaranteed for environmental purposes. If only the Howard government had acted on that we would not now be looking at a river system in such a parlous state. Indeed, it may have helped if the Labor opposition at the time had been apologists for the Greens and supported the position that we were putting.
                                               </p>
                                               <p>
                                                We are now debating a very serious piece of legislation; it is a major piece of legislation for the minister. But the whole role of this Senate and its committee system is to, through the community, improve legislation where we can. If the government or the opposition have amendments that the Greens consider meritorious then we will be supporting them. I can make the opposition relaxed by telling them that we are not going to be defrayed from that by Minister Wong’s talk about apologists. The only thing that we do not want to do is have to apologise to the community for denying good amendments on the basis of a political stand. This amendment has merit for the reasons that Senator Hanson-Young and Senator Birmingham have outlined. It is our intention to support it.

                                                  We can open up this debate again. We are opposing this because we are already doing things for this region—very substantially more than is proposed. This was a Mayo by-election Liberal Party policy stunt, and I think that people know that. We are already putting substantial amounts of assistance into that region. We have taken a consistent position that the best way of ensuring viability for communities throughout the basin—because we as a government have to look at the basin as a whole—and the best way governments can use taxpayers’ funds to assist communities in the basin is to investment in irrigation infrastructure so that we can ensure the economic base of the communities that are reliant in part or substantially on irrigation and so we can assist them to adjust to a future where there is less water. I am not sure that I can add anything further. I understand the position that your party is taking and I have outlined the government’s position.

Members of this chamber will be aware that the Greens have been pursuing the issue of cultural water flows for quite some time. I moved some similar amendments previously, when we were debating the Water Act 2007. This very importantly deals with not only Indigenous water rights but also establishing cultural flows in the Murray-Darling Basin.

                                                       Indigenous nations are, and have been since time immemorial, connected to and responsible for their lands and waters. The peoples of every Indigenous nation obtain and maintain their spiritual and cultural identity, life and livelihood from their lands and waters. In addition, Indigenous nations each have responsibilities and obligations under their Indigenous law and custom to protect, conserve and maintain the environment and ecosystems in their natural state to ensure the sustainability of the whole environment.
                                                      </p>

                                                       In November 2007, Indigenous peoples for the nations represented within MLDRIN, which is the Murray Lower Darling Rivers Indigenous Nations, met in Echuca to come to an agreement on the definition of cultural flows and to discuss the impacts and benefits. The Indigenous nations of the Murray-Darling Basin have been working on this for quite some time and are very keen to ensure that their water rights are recognised and that cultural flows are provided for in the Murray-Darling Basin plan.

                                                       I would just like to remind the chamber that it is often cited that within Australia the percentage of land in the Indigenous estate is around 20 per cent. However, in the Murray-Darling Basin, Indigenous peoples currently hold less than 0.2 per cent of the land, despite comprising around four per cent of the basin’s population and despite land reforms such as the

                                                       1993. In other words, Aboriginal people’s connection to and involvement in the management of the Murray-Darling Basin has been extensively broken over a considerable period of time. We believe it is about time that we start recognising this and making provisions for Indigenous water rights and cultural flows.

                                                       The right to access water is supposed to be provided by the National Water Initiative and other Commonwealth and state mechanisms, but many of these are contingent upon positive native title determinations. Given the current disparity of Aboriginal land tenure within the Murray-Darling Basin, we believe access to water for Indigenous peoples has been severely limited and restricted. Unfortunately, until relatively recently, cultural flows have not been on the political agenda in Australia. They have not been part of the discussions on natural resource management. So, while Australia has moved on and is finally starting to recognise environmental water flows and the importance of natural resource management, we still have not adequately incorporated Indigenous knowledge, expertise and experience into natural resource management. As I said, making provision for cultural flows, in particular, still has not been fully and properly incorporated into our decision making.

                                                       MLDRIN defines cultural flows as water entitlements that are legally and beneficially owned by the Indigenous nations and that are of a sufficient and adequate quality and quantity to improve the spiritual, cultural, environmental, social and economic conditions of those Indigenous nations. Cultural water flows have many benefits and impacts. These include empowerment and social justice, where water is delivered to country by the peoples. They further include growing native plants, protecting and hunting animals, song and dance, art and ceremony, spiritual sites and improved cultural, economic and health outcomes through the provision of food, medicines and materials for art.
                                                      </p>
                                                      <p>
                                                       The difference between environmental and cultural water is that cultural water is the Indigenous peoples themselves deciding where and when water should be delivered, based on traditional knowledge and aspirations. This ensures that Indigenous peoples are empowered to fulfil their responsibility to care for country. The question of volumes needed under cultural flows needs to be acknowledged and scoped. More work needs to be done. MLDRIN acknowledges that that work does need to be done. But of course we need to make provision for cultural flows in the first place in order to ensure that there will be water available once the decisions have been made and the calculations have been done on the issue of volumes.

                                                       I would like to point out that there are a number of international conventions and processes through which there has been recognition of Indigenous rights to water. They include the

                                                        International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination
                                                       </a>
                                                       1965. A number of the provisions of this convention relate to the rights of Indigenous peoples to access and use their traditional water resources. For example, paragraph 5 of recommendation 23 of the convention says:

                                                       especially calls upon State parties to recognise and protect the rights of indigenous peoples to own, develop, control and use their common lands, territories and resources and, where they have been derived of their lands and territories traditionally owned or otherwise inhabited or used without their free and informed consent, to take steps to return those lands and territories otherwise inhabited or used without their free and informed consent, to take steps to return these lands and territories.

                                                       The World Heritage Convention also recognises cultural landscapes and their links to conservation and diversity. Included within that is a new category of cultural landscapes. Despite the emphasis on the recognition of Indigenous concepts of culture and appreciation of the sacred nature of these particular sites, a recent analysis of the implementation of the provision for the protection of cultural landscapes revealed that there is a Eurocentric nature to the sites listed and cites the fact that there has been a gap in recognition of the role of Indigenous peoples and Indigenous involvement in those cultural landscapes. The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights also applies here, as does the

                                                       So the issues around cultural flows are recognised internationally. Australia is still to adequately deal with the issues surrounding cultural flows. Cultural flow issues certainly were not given recognition in the Water Act 2007 and are not included in the Water Amendment Bill 2008. We believe it is time that we start recognising these issues and start including a legislative basis for cultural flows. We acknowledge that further work needs to be done on how to implement cultural flows, but we believe we are far past the time when we should have given this issue a legislative base.

                                                       amendments on sheet 5660 relate to a number of issues, including the recognition of Indigenous water rights and the delivery of cultural flows, and we have used the MLDRIN definition of ‘cultural flow’. The amendments provide mechanisms by which we can start to incorporate cultural flows in the act and then start to implement those commitments, if the amendments are accepted, into the legislation—for example, establishing an Indigenous water subcommittee including people with expertise in Indigenous water rights and cultural flows. The amendments include recognition of cultural flows and also how we start to include cultural flows in decision making. I commend the amendments to the chamber.

                                                         I thank Senator Siewert for having a discussion with us about moving clauses 10 and 11 on sheet 5660 separately to enable some discussion to occur. Indigenous water rights are an issue that I am personally aware of and about which I have had some discussions with Indigenous representatives. I understand that the Murray-Darling system has enormous cultural significance for many Indigenous people and communities within the basin. I think this is a timely reminder that the natural wealth of the Murray-Darling system has sustained countless generations of Indigenous people but, by contrast, the people and cultures that have come to Australia in recent times have only taken a century or so to preside over the current crisis we see in the Murray-Darling. What I have suggested to Senator Siewert is the consideration of clauses 10 and 11. The remainder of the amendments, at this stage, probably go a little beyond where I think the current discussion and Basin Plan arrangements are at. I am very conscious of the importance of considering Indigenous issues in relation to basin water resources through the Basin Plan process. In my view, the best approach to take would be to allow that to occur through the development of the Basin Plan and the consultation that is expected and required.

Obviously, we are extremely disappointed that the government does not think it can go as far as accepting the recognition of Indigenous water rights in the Water Act. We think this is a particularly important issue. Aboriginal people have been disconnected from the management of the Murray-Darling Basin over the last 200 years, and these amendments seek to re-establish and give a legislative base to Indigenous water rights. We think this is particularly important, so we are disappointed that the government and the opposition cannot support these amendments.

Clause 10 refers to the Basin Community Committee and the subcommittees that exist under the Basin Community Committee. It seeks to establish an Indigenous water subcommittee. Our amended clause will read: ‘an Indigenous water subcommittee to guide the consideration of matters relevant to the basin’s water resources’.

I thank the Greens for their discussion with us on the wording to enable that to occur. The only caveat I place on it is that, as I indicated to Senator Siewert, given the nature of this bill we obviously will need to have consultation with the states on these issues. With that caveat, the government indicates its support for the amendment.

We believe that the integrity of the catchment should be maintained and that, at this critical time when there is simply not enough water, water should not be taken out of the basin. There are perfectly good, and much wiser, options that the Brumby government has not undertaken—and I do not mean the building of a desalination plant but the use of the water that falls over metropolitan Melbourne much more wisely—that would obviate the need for this diversion of critically needed water out of the

I want to make the point, first, that there is already an audit process covering the Living Murray, known as the Independent Audit Group. On the issue of the protection of water from the Living Murray, there are detailed arrangements in place for this purpose, such as the provisions of the Living Murray Business Plan and the Living Murray Intergovernmental Agreement. Section 28(1) of the Water Act for the Basin Plan, the environmental watering plan, has the purpose of safeguarding existing environmental water. I also make the point that, on completion of the water recovery project, an independent review is undertaken by one or more members of an independent review panel to ensure there is evidence of project implementation and outcomes, and this report comes to the ministerial council, which I chair, before the savings are listed on the formal register. So the agreements associated with the Living Murray already provide that this water is not used for other purposes.
                                                                   </p>
                                                                   <p>
                                                                    In terms of Senator Brown’s apologist comment, I simply would make the point that this was a Howard government initiative—in 2004, from memory—but, obviously, this amendment was not moved by them in the context of their Water Act 2007. But I would make the point that we do not regard this amendment as necessary, given that there are already very clear audit requirements and intergovernmental agreement requirements that those opposite were actually party to as part of the Living Murray arrangements—and which they are seeking to supersede now they are not in government. Regarding Senator Brown’s point about the Sugarloaf, this amendment, as I understand it, is not needed to ensure compliance with the
                                                                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC" rel="nofollow">

                                                                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC_Act" rel="nofollow">

                                                                   </p>

I would make the point that this directly goes to issues that are relevant to the states, so the states would have a direct interest in the amendment that is before the chamber, and it certainly was not something that was discussed or negotiated in the context of the intergovernmental agreement. So I come back, in terms of the opposition, to your consideration of how much risk you are prepared to put this legislation to, and that will be a decision that awaits you when this returns from the lower house.

We believe that none of the amendments moved on the bill would have an impact on the various sources of environmental water for the Snowy River, but we recognise that those concerns have been raised and that it has been requested that some confirmation be provided that the amendments could not be misinterpreted. This amendment simply confirms the pre-eminence of the Snowy flows.

This demonstrates exactly one of the things that we said was a problem with that amendment: that it is all about political gains and trying to make the pipeline the political issue—not the broader and much more significant policy issue of the Murray-Darling. The chamber needs to be aware that this is an amendment which recognises—from the opposition’s own pen—the risk and unintended potential consequences of their amendments in relation to the pipeline, which were clearly politically motivated. I will put that on the record, because I think there is no doubt about that, looking at the history—in particular, looking at the Victorian Liberal Party position and what motivated that. The government does not support this amendment. We did not support the previous amendments that this amendment is trying to fix up.

Yesterday we moved that there be an independent assessment of the impact on the aquifers and the catchment of mining exploration and/or mining before licences be granted. That is a very sensible proposition. I say at the outset: where is the logic in having a mining corporation being allowed to proceed to exploration and then doing a water study, which would show that mining interrupted and degraded the aquifer, and therefore the productivity of the farmlands above, so that the mining is halted? Clearly, the study should be done before any licence for exploration or mining is carried out. That is the clear logic that was accepted by the coalition yesterday. Overnight, the Australian Mining Industry Council and the big miners have moved in, alarmed by this sensible proposition, and have talked the opposition, in particular the National Party, into reneging on the decision to support this amendment.
                                                                              </p>

                                                                               I understand the lobbying power of the mining industry as against the farming industry, but I do not understand the logic of saying that we will require a study of the impact of mining on the catchment but not before exploration takes place. The mining industry itself ought to look at this because it is being invited to expend large amounts of money on exploration at the risk that an independent study will show significant risk and the mining cannot then go ahead.
                                                                              </p>

I want to quote from the debate yesterday. Firstly, Senator Williams said:

Nevertheless, Senator Boswell went on to say:

You do not wait till after the exploration and you certainly do not insert an amendment like her second amendment, which says: ‘If you find that the aquifers are going to be interrupted and significant damage will occur to the potential of the farmlands and their productivity, you don’t have to do anything anyway. Remove that clause.’ Senator Nash went on to say:

Suddenly this amendment is being eviscerated by the National Party because that is what BHP Billiton and the Australian Mining Industry Council want.
                                                                              </p>

That compelling good sense has not changed overnight. I will tell you what has changed, Chair, the Mining Industry Council and BHP Billiton have said: ‘Suddenly this is for real. Suddenly this is important. This amendment may be adopted by the government in the House of Representatives in order to get this important piece of legislation through, because it is an amendment of compelling good sense. We’d better get down to the National Party and the Liberal Party and change it from good sense to bad sense.’ That is what has happened, and I am disgusted by it. I appeal to the National Party to get back to what was described just yesterday by Senator Nash as ‘very sensible, very pragmatic and very good’.
                                                                              </p>

                                                                               We will, of course, oppose this amendment because it means that the impact of mining on the groundwater systems would not have to be studied before exploration proceeded, the implication being that, once exploration had found that the mining should go ahead—and big mining corporations rarely put millions into exploration if they are not intending to mine—you then do a study. The second amendment here says, ‘And when you’ve done the study, if you find a significant impact is going to occur to the water system, you don’t have to take any notice of that. We abolish that clause as well.’ I will be moving for some consistency when we get to the second amendment. I think this is a very sad outcome. The principle has not changed but the people have. The representation in here has changed because the mining lobby got at the National Party overnight. That is not good enough.

There has been no deviation as Senator Brown is indicating, in spite of his rather lengthy dissertation. One of the things that I have always admired about the Senate is its ability to accommodate improvements in legislation where they are identified. This is one of those cases where, again, I am very impressed with the Senate’s ability to do that. The revised amendment very clearly still echoes the intent of the first, requiring the studies to take place before mining commences.

We do not want an echo; we want substance. It is the National Party that is the echo—of yesterday. The substance has gone overnight. All we are left with is an echo. What are the farmers going to think about that? Let me just explain this to the committee. Farmers at Caroona—and these are not deep green activists; these are quality, long-term, committed farmers on the Breeza Plain—have gone out of their normal routine productive lives to blockade

                                                                                </p>

They effectively may end up on the wrong side of the law because the natural law of protecting their farmlands comes first and because they are outmanoeuvred in Sydney when it comes to the legislature, which empowers the mining corporations to cut their fences and move in and do exploration. This process, by the way, is being echoed, to use the senator’s term, up on the plains near Dalby, where there is another mining exploration underway which farmers object to. And we are going to see more of it.
                                                                                </p>

That is what the amendment that I brought forward, through the grace of an earlier amendment of Mr Windsor in the House of Representatives, will do. But it is being emasculated by the National Party and the Liberal Party here today. You have got to feel for those people sitting with their tent and their stalls and their display and what it means to them out in the bush south of Gunnedah today. They were not able to come here overnight and fight what they know is a manifest wrong. They are disempowered by this process. Who is going to argue that these are not quintessential Australians standing up for their patch of land, being overrun by—a minister objected to this term yesterday but I will use it again—the big end of town. It is unfair, and they deserve the numbers of representatives who stand up for the bush to be in here today. A big issue was made of that yesterday, that the coalition was giving them the numbers. I am not shy to say that I will make a big issue of the fact that those numbers evaporated overnight and we are left, in Senator Nash’s terms, with an echo of the defence of those people’s rights which we heard here yesterday.

                                                                                  In terms of some technical issues, we put on the record yesterday our view about the best way to deal with these issues, and I set out the provisions in the act which enable the basin plan to deal with the assessment of interception activities such as mining. I pointed to the sections of the existing act which enabled that to occur. We do think the amendment represents some improvement in terms of one of the technical issues that I raised. We retain concerns particularly in relation to amendment (2), which I understand has not been moved. We do retain concerns generally about the constitutional validity of the second part of the original amendment.
                                                                                 </p>

First, when this amendment was first supported by the National Party—and I notice, Senator Brown, that yesterday you had a lot of friends on your right, on the opposition benches, who are noticeably absent from the chamber now—I wondered whether Senator Nash and others had actually consulted with their Liberal Party colleagues, particularly from mining states, and the shadow resources minister. I wonder whether overnight they have worked out they have got a problem and now they are moving an amendment and clearly reneging on an arrangement they had, from what Senator Brown said, with the Greens.
                                                                                 </p>
                                                                                 <p>
                                                                                  More broadly, what we have seen is that the historic coalition between the Greens and the Liberal and National parties that the shadow minister spoke about yesterday was historic in part for its briefness. Less than 24 hours later, we see that there is already a breach of what was agreed yesterday, certainly a change in position. People can make their own judgement, but I suggest that this brief and historic coalition was good for the Liberal Party to try and get them on television looking a little bit green for a period of time but actually does not deliver very much at all, other than good pictures. It remains our view that those on the other side are not interested, from what they have said in here, in behaving in relation to this bill in a way that recognises their own leader’s position in the past, and I assume now, and the responsibility to act on these future challenges.
                                                                                 </p>
                                                                                 <p>

We have been consistent, and Senator Brown has also been consistent. We think this is an important issue, but we do believe the best way to approach it is the way I outlined yesterday. I will not re-traverse those arguments.

This is a changing landscape. It is a moveable feast, because there is inconsistency on the opposition benches. But there have been a number of proposals for a study of the impact on the integrity of the groundwater in the Gunnedah Basin. I refer to the proposal from the Liverpool plains Land Management Committee which involved three universities and other independent assessors. Part of the proposal states:
                                                                                    </p>

                                                                                    </p>

And if her asseveration that the prospect is there in the legislation for such a study to take place is correct, here is the upfront test case. Ministerial authority, government authority, carries a lot of weight here. This is an utterly disappointing day for the bush and for the people of the Liverpool plains. I ask the minister: will she not have the resources of government brought to bear—she says the way is open for it—and will she not commit the government to ensuring that this study is undertaken?

I think even the opposition would agree that I gave a quite detailed response to those questions on the last occasion. I was pointing out that we do not believe the amendments that were originally moved by you and supported then by the opposition were necessary, because the effect of interception activities could be dealt with through the Basin Plan in the circumstances I outlined, and the basin authority obviously has the independent authority to enable that to occur if it sees fit.
                                                                                     </p>

My recollection is that involves in the order of $2 million. I also recollect that the Liverpool plains is one of the case studies that is being looked at. Senator Brown, I am not going to—and, in terms of appropriate decision making in government, I hope you would not expect me to—make a decision on funding a project on the basis of a senator asking me a question about it across the chamber. What I will say is that these are issues that do require attention. The act enables them to be given attention for the reasons I outlined. We also need to do more work to enable better assessments within states about the impacts on groundwater of mining. So that is the purpose of the project that I funded.
                                                                                     </p>

We have been consistent about the approach we think ought to be taken in relation to this issue. We were consistent when this previously came up. We retain the same position.

When I asked specifically about ensuring that a study be done, the position was the same as the National Party’s and the Liberal Party’s. That is the problem, isn’t it?

Well, if ever in this parliament there was a demonstration of the value of an Independent committed to his electorate, it is the value of Mr Tony Windsor to his electorate of New England. I am a Green. I would describe Mr Windsor as a conservative, and one thing he wants to do here is conserve the farmland. We are perhaps on opposite ends of the spectrum. But he is dinkum in this, and he is standing up for his electorate. It is just a pity that that electorate has been sold out in this way in the last 24 hours.

It has been quite interesting that over the last few days accusations about playing politics have been made from one side of the chamber across to the other. But I do not think I have seen a more extreme example of that than what Senator Bob Brown has done this morning. The issue of water is very serious. There is no doubt about that. In spite of Senator Brown’s new-found professed love for farmers coming to the fore, it is the very fact that he could turn this into such a political statement—indicating that his Independent friend from New England might be able to solve the problems of the world by himself—that makes it quite simply untrue. There were also comments made about the Nationals and some changes of position. This amendment seeks to ensure that the outcome that Senator Brown so clearly referred to before, about farmers being able to have a study undertaken on the effects of mining on groundwater and surface water systems before mining commences, still stands.

It is entirely his prerogative to grandstand on this issue and to play politics, but that does not help the people of Caroona. It does not help the people right around the Murray-Darling Basin who are extremely concerned about water, which, to the end, is what this debate is all about. This is about the

I would suggest to Senator Brown that he might like to stop playing politics with this issue. He knows full well that the substance of the amendment remains. That an independent expert study will take place before any mining commences is what we are putting forward in this amendment today. Senator Brown may well take up a whole lot more time. As the minister and I have been here for some 10 or 11 hours, a bit more time will not make any difference. Take up as much time as you like, Senator Brown. We will stay as long as you want. But it does not matter what you say or what you indicate. The substance of our position remains. Yesterday my Nationals colleagues indicated very clearly that their position to have a study undertaken substantively remains.

                                                                                          </p>

                                                                                          </p>

                                                                                           This amendment is to ensure that we are very clear about this issue. Senator Nash said, ‘There will be a study done before mining is undertaken,’ under the previous cave-in amendment of the coalition. That does not change the fact that there is no longer any need for a study to be sensibly done. The bush common sense that she agreed with yesterday is that the study should be undertaken before exploration takes place. The amendment that we now have from Senator Nash means that yesterday’s position—jointly held by the Greens, the Nationals and the Liberals that, where a substantial risk is identified, exploration licences must not be granted—is abolished. When you look at that, together with the amendment that the Nationals have just moved, you get to the point where the amendment from Senator Nash would mean that, where a substantial risk is identified, licences for mining are not altered. You can identify a substantial risk but the mining can go ahead.
                                                                                          </p>

                                                                                           My amendment is simply to accept, as the numbers beat us, that a study does not have to be undertaken before mineral exploration; it now has to be undertaken before mining. My amendment would mean that, where a substantial risk is identified, the mining licence must not be granted. I ask the coalition to look at that carefully. If what Senator Nash says is true then my amendment should be supported. It is consistent with the last amendment that was made. We have lost the fight to ensure that a study is done before exploration is undertaken. It now has to be undertaken, as Senator Nash says, before mining is carried out. My amendment is to ensure that, where a substantial risk is identified in that study, the licence for mining is not granted.
                                                                                          </p>

                                                                                           I see that there are hurried discussions between Senator Nash and Senator Wong. That is fine. But I think this is very important. What I am doing here is ensuring that, where a substantial risk is identified, the licence to go ahead with the mining is not granted. I beseech the coalition to support this amendment. It is entirely consistent with what Senator Nash has been putting to the committee this morning. It is a very important and logical amendment and I would expect that the government would also support this amendment. What is the point of having a study if a substantial risk is identified and it does not make any difference?

Here we have a situation where yesterday we had the opposition supporting the requirement that there be an investigation—a scientific study—of the impact on water catchment of mining operations before those operations took place, including exploration. Then, where a substantial risk was identified, the mine would not go ahead. Now we have got the government and the opposition turning down this absolutely pivotal requirement. Where damage to the farmlands in the short term or long term can be identified, and there is a substantial risk of that damage, both the big parties say, ‘Well, we will leave that to the lobbying power of the mining organisations.’ This is a dreadful sell-out of common sense, let alone the farming communities that are getting the wrong end of this outcome.
                                                                                                    </p>

I am a politician elected not just to get better outcomes for the people of Australia but to surely levy common sense in situations like this. I ask Senator Nash, or Senator Wong: how can you justify turning down a parliamentary requirement that where substantial risk is identified to farmlands, like those of the Breeza Plain or the Liverpool plains or indeed anywhere in the Murray-Darling Basin, there should not be action following that to protect those farmlands from that identifiable substantial risk? What is the point of doing a study if you then do not act upon it? It is incredible. This is an astonishing turnaround. I understand the excruciating position Senator Nash is in, and I ask her if she would say who it was from the
