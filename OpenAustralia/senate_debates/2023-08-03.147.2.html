        I'm pleased to be speaking to the Senate tonight and in your presence, President, about a very important decision about the

        . Earlier this week

         UN
        </a>
        ESCO, the UN's educational, scientific and cultural organisation, released an important update on the

         UNESCO
        </a>
        has been considering whether to list the Great Barrier Reef as endangered, a move that would place its World Heritage status and its international reputation at grave risk. I'm very pleased to update the chamber that UNESCO has released its draft decision concerning the Great Barrier Reef and it does not recommend the reef be listed as endangered at the next

        meeting. This is recognition that the Albanese Labor government is acting on climate change and protecting the Great Barrier Reef.
       </p>
       <p>
        The decision recognises the clear and distinct difference between the former government and the current government's approach to protecting the reef. The decision notes the significant progress to respond to the threat of climate change and, significantly, the decision welcomes the state parties' significantly increased actions in addressing climate change since the reactive monitoring mission, including through newly adopted legislation introducing progressive reduction targets for carbon emissions. This is the climate legislation that the Albanese Labor government introduced when we were elected. It was opposed by those opposite but it is making a real difference to the reputation of our nation and to the reputation of our management of the Great Barrier Reef. This decision recognises we have acted quickly to protect the reef and that our record investment is making significant progress on climate change, water quality, managing invasive species and preventing unsustainable fishing. Every reef around the world is under threat from climate change, but we are doing everything we can to ensure the Great Barrier Reef is resilient and well-managed. This decision today recognises that the world-class management by our partners, agencies and stakeholders is doing exactly that—managing the reef and doing so in a world-class manner.

        I have had the pleasure of working with them closely over the past 12 months and I'm incredibly proud of the work they do. From scientists to farmers, traditional owners and tourism operators, everybody's doing their part and now they are finally supported by a government that is committed to protecting the Great Barrier Reef. I can say with confidence we are a government that is backing them. We are a government that accepts and listens to the science—what a concept! We are also working to harness 60,000 years of environmental management from First Nations Australians. We are working hard with our partners in the tourism industry and working in collaboration with the Queensland government, not against them. That is the difference with our government and it stands in stark contrast to those opposite.

        -Nationals wasted a precious decade, but the Albanese Labor government is not wasting a single day in office. We know that there is more work to do and we are prepared to do that work. Make no bones about it, the UNESCO draft decision makes clear that the reef possibly is facing more extreme weather events and warmer temperatures, as all reefs are across the world. Our government made sure that we could take action on climate change because it is essential to protecting the reef. Australia has stepped up to play its part, and we are doing everything we can to ensure the reef is resilient and well-managed. We know this is incredibly important to the people of Queensland, particularly those in regional Queensland, because the reef is a global icon that attracts international visitors from around the world to Australia's shores. That is why this decision is welcome news for the thousands of people who rely on the reef for their jobs.

        , a scientist in Gladstone or the Indigenous ranger in Bundaberg, protecting the reef matters because protecting the reef means protecting Queensland jobs. It's a pretty special thing, our Great Barrier Reef, and I'm incredibly proud, as I know all Australians are, that we are the managers and protectors of the reef. I'll be doing everything I can with the opportunity I have as
