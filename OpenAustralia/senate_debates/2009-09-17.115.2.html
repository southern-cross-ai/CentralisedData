        My question is to the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Government Service Delivery, Senator Arbib. I refer the minister to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Technical_College" rel="nofollow">

        program to extend a shed, despite parents and students at the school being told that this Australian technical college will be closed. Will the minister explain how a grant of $75,000 to extend a shed that will soon be demolished is an appropriate use of taxpayers’ hard-earned money?

         I thank the good senator for the opportunity to talk about the

         . As I put on the record yesterday, there are 24,000 projects across the country and 9½ thousand schools will receive major upgrades and new infrastructure, creating jobs for tradespeople and jobs for small business. That is what Building the Education Revolution is about.

         With regard to the Australian Technical College - Spencer Gulf and Outback, I inform the Senate that the college received $75,000 under the

               Always check the facts when Senator Mason is quoting about schools; always check the facts when the Liberal Party is quoting about schools. We know they oppose 9½ thousand schools across the country, including in all their electorates, getting this funding.

                 Senator Mason has worked very hard on this question. He has done a great deal of research. He rolled out of bed this morning and picked up the newspaper and said, ‘Oh my goodness, I think I’ve got a story for question time!’

                 has been allocated $850,000 under the P21 program for a new library. I am also happy to advise the Senate that that was agreed to by the school’s principal. Information was reported in the press this morning that was incorrect. The

                   Again, Senator Mason opened up the newspaper and found a story. A great deal of research went into that one, Senator Mason. Unfortunately for Senator Mason, the information reported is, again, not accurate. What a surprise, Senator Mason! Colbinabbin Primary School received funding of $600,000, which was approved under P21, for the construction of new classrooms—not a multipurpose hall, as reported. That is advice from the Victorian Department of Education and

                     As I said, always check the facts when you are dealing with Senator Mason; always check the facts when you are dealing with the Liberal Party. What is the Liberal Party’s plan for schools? They want to roll back the stimulus package. And what will that mean? Tell us, Senator Mason. Tell us which schools will lose their funding. Tell us which schools in your electorate, in Queensland, you will take funding away from, because that is what you intend.
