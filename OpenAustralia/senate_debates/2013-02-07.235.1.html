        What is the final, total cost of the Fair Work Act Review, and can a full breakdown be provided including all staff, travel and secretariat costs.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The total cost of the Review was just under $900 000, including Panel, secretariat and publication expenses.
       </p>

        </a>
        ) for a maximum of eight hours a day ($4400 per day including GST).
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Panel" rel="nofollow">
         The Panel
        </a>
        members' appointments were part-time and they were remunerated for time worked, not for each day of the review period. These arrangements are consistent with appointments of similar standing and import.

       <p class="italic">
        The remuneration invoiced by the Panel was $382 800. The total cost of additional expenses incurred by the Panel was $13 000. This includes travel to attend meetings of the Panel and meetings with stakeholders as part of the Panel's consultations, accommodation, and Professor McCallum's engagement of a reader to assist him in his work. The total cost of the services provided by the panel was $395 800 (including GST).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The total cost for the Secretariat from 20 December 2011 (when the Minister announced the appointment of the Panel members) until the finalisation of the Review in June 2012 was $447 700, including the cost of an outposted officer from the Office of Best Practice Regulation for approximately eight weeks.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secretariat" rel="nofollow">
         The Secretariat
