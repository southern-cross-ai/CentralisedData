        My question is to the minister representing the Minister for Health. The Prime Minister announced yesterday that he would not pursue Medicare changes without the support of doctors. He said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is important to maintain the support of the medical profession because, letâ€™s face it, they have the best interests of their patients at heart.
       </p>
       <p>
        In response, AMA president Brian Owler said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Prime Minister must ditch the disastrous Medicare co-payment model, the $5 cut to the Medicare patient rebate, and the freeze on Medicare rebate indexation until 2018.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not just the AMA's view. It is the view of every doctor I have spoken with, right across the country. Minister, will the government now explicitly rule out the co-payment and the Medicare freeze or was yesterday's statement just another porky pie from the Prime Minister?

                  say at the outset that perhaps the Greens have not been listening to what the coalition government has been saying. We have stated very, very clearly that we will be consulting with the sector, including the very doctor that the Greens senator has just referred to. I can tell you,
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
                   Mr President
                  </a>
                  , that one thing everybody, across the medical sector, across our communities, including our rural communities, and the coalition government, agree on is that the Medicare system and the health system in this country need to be sustainable. This government have been very clear that, unlike the previous Labor government, we actually have a plan to go forward and make sure that we have health servicesâ€”

                   , I raise a point of order on relevance. I asked a very specific question. Yesterday, the Prime Minister announced that he would not pursue Medicare changes without the support of doctors. I have asked whether the minister will explicitly rule out the co-payment and the Medicare freeze, which are not supported by doctors. It is a very straightforward question.

                     I have a very straightforward answer: the Prime Minister said he would be consulting with doctors, and now he is going through the process with his minister to do exactly that. He has been very consistent in what he has said. The previous Labor government left us with a mess in health care. The previous Labor government left us a trajectory to debt of $667 billion that this coalition government has to fix. Included in that was a trajectory of $34 billionâ€”

In spite of the fact that the Greens might stand here and ask questions today, the Prime Minister has been very clear in making his comments about consulting with doctors, making sure that the broad backing is there for the medicalâ€”

                         himself, that GPs act at their own discretion as to how they make their charging arrangements. In terms of the arrangements that we have put in place, we have indicated that vulnerable people will be protected. We have listened to the concerns out in the community, and those vulnerable peopleâ€”concession card holders and those under 16â€”will be absolutely protected. It is important that we get this right. Unlike the previous Labor governmentâ€”who made a complete mess of the economy and who did not have any kind of plan for making health care sustainable in this nationâ€”this government does and we will proceed to do that.

                           I would say that that is a question that the senator should ask Dr Kamerman about the way he runs his practice. This government is absolutely committed to ensuring that we not only protect people who are vulnerable, including concession card holders and those under 16 but that we also make the system sustainable. Perhaps those on the other side have not been listening but, as we have very clearly indicated, we will be working with doctors, with communities, with people from right across the sectorâ€”as indeed I have been with the Rural Doctors Associationâ€”to make sure we get the right things in place to protect not only those vulnerable people but to ensure that we have a strong and sustainable health care system in this country that the Australian people deserve and that the previous Labor government did not deliver.
