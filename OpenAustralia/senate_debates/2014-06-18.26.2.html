          I refer to comments made by senior Liberal Senator Ian Macdonald yesterday when he described the Prime Minister's Paid Parental Leave scheme as:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          … an age-of-entitlement allowance to certain individual Australians.
         </p>
         <p>
          Does the minister agree with senior Liberal Senator Macdonald?

           I am sure that Senator Moore is referring to Senator Macdonald's seniority in this place rather than the years that he has lived on this planet. But I can indicate that the government's position on the Paid Parental Leave scheme is very clear. As I indicated yesterday, we believe that it is good, sound public policy. I simply remind Senator Moore that these are the sorts of conditions that public servants in Canberra enjoy, and we want to have those conditions enjoyed by other women in the community who do not happen to have the good fortune of being employed in the Public Service.
          </p>
          <p>
           As I indicated to the Senate yesterday, the Liberal Party is a broad church that brings together a diversity of opinions and views on a whole range of issues and therefore it does not surprise that within the broad church of the Liberal Party there are also diverse views in relation to the Paid Parental Leave scheme. Because we are a party of freedom of speech, because we are a party that believes in individuals being able to express themselves, it stands to reason that we will have people within our parliamentary party who do not necessarily fully accept and adopt all policies of the government. Having said that, the government is determined to press ahead with this vitally important social reform which will be good for our country's population, will be good for our country's productivity and will be good for the participation rate within the workforce and the maintenance of skills, especially of the women within our community.

            , I ask a supplementary question. Allowing for the fact of the very broad church of the government, I would like to find out further, Minister, whether you agree with other comments made by Senator Ian Macdonald—who has now joined us—yesterday when he said about the Paid Parental Leave scheme that it is giving businesses a tax cut so that they do not have to use their own funds for a Paid Parental Leave scheme, but that then whacking them with a 1.5 per cent levy to pay for the universal scheme just does not make sense. Does the minister, allowing for the broad church, agree with those comments from Senator Macdonald?

             I agree with Senator Macdonald about the need to abolish the carbon tax. I agree with Senator Macdonald about the need to abolish the mining tax. I agree with Senator Ian Macdonald about the need to ensure that we have a proper framework for the live export trade, and—

                    , reaching across the political divide, I agree with Senator Mark Bishop's observations about how Labor Party policies were destroying his home state of
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                     Western Australia

                    . That does not mean I agree with everything he said, but I do agree with that.

                      , I ask a further supplementary question. I refer to the fact that as late as yesterday afternoon in this chamber the government had not convinced Senator Macdonald of the benefits of the Paid Parental Leave scheme. If the Prime Minister's Paid Parental Leave scheme is not supported by his own parliamentary colleagues, how can the government expect the Australian people to support it at all?
