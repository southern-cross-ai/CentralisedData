        My question is to Senator Abetz, representing the Minister for Agriculture. Australian farmers are the lifeblood of our land. They feed our country, employ many people and contribute to our economy. Despite this, your government is undermining the viability of our farmers.
       </p>
       <p>
        The ginger industry is a thriving sector in Australia, comprising some 50 growers. Ninety-five per cent are based in Queensland and the majority are Australian owned and operated. Ginger growers generate some $32 million per year at the farm gate. In total, the industry generates around $80 million per year through fresh and processed food. The Australian Ginger Growers Association has just confirmed that your government allowed the importation of ginger into Australia from Fiji from August this year. Why has your government allowed the importation of fresh ginger into Australia, which will directly hurt hard-working Australian farmers? Will your government compensate farmers for associated financial loss?

         The Leader of the Palmer United Party in this place is absolutely right when he describes farmers as the lifeblood of Australia and our economy. Without farmers we would not have the foods that we rely on and basically take for granted each and every day. That is why I would call on the Leader of the Opposition to stop demeaning agricultural workers and demeaning people who harvest potatoes, pick apples and pick the fruit that provide the meals that we as Australians rely on each and every day.
        </p>
        <p>
         The assertion has been made by the Leader of the Palmer United Party in this place that we are somehow undermining the agricultural sector.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
          Can I
         </a>
         say we deep respect to him that I reject that assertion? I reject that assertion absolutely. Indeed, the farmers of this country have a great champion in the Minister for Agriculture, Mr Joyce. Can I also indicate to the leader that the free trade agreements, so ably negotiated by Minister Robb with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea" rel="nofollow">
          South Korea
         </a>
         and with Japan, have provided a real boost for the agricultural sector, be it dairy, be it beef, be it sheep or be it horticulture—huge, huge gains. If we are in the marketplace of seeking to get free trade with other countries then we as a nation can build on one of our great strengths, and that of course is the agricultural sector.
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to imports of ginger from Fiji: I was not able to find any parliamentary brief in the folder in relation to that and I will take that part of the question on notice. But can I assure him that we as a government are committed to the agricultural sector.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Not only would the importation of Fijian ginger into Australia hurt farmers, jobs and rural and regional Australia, Fiji is known to have roundworm, which reproduces inside the ginger. This pest is very destructive and could wipe out entire ginger crops, putting our entire ginger industry at risk. It can also affect other types of crops. Why does your government think this is an acceptable risk? Can you give a 100 per cent guarantee that the pest will not destroy our ginger crops or more across the other crops?

           clear up for the Leader of the Palmer United Party that it is not the government per se that determines whether a risk is appropriate or not; an independent risk assessment is made by scientifically qualified officials who make that determination. As I understand it, the final import risk assessment for fresh ginger from Fiji was released in January 2013—in fact, under the previous government—and a work plan was subsequently agreed with Fiji and the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Agriculture" rel="nofollow">
            Department of Agriculture
           </a>
           . I am further informed that the Department of Agriculture will inspect all consignments of ginger, and departmental officers will inspect a 600-unit sample of the ginger on arrival to ensure that no pests, diseases or soil are present. With those sorts of safeguards in place, the scientific advice is that the guarantees are in place.

            , I have a final supplementary question. While the lifeblood of our land, our farmers, are continuing to deal with extraordinary hardships, they are the forgotten Australian battlers left to fend for themselves. It appears the government is more interested in putting the interests of other countries, including Fiji, ahead of the needs of Australia and our own farmers. Senator, will your government put up funds to combat an outbreak should the Fiji roundworm make its way into our crops?

             I have just indicated to the honourable senator that there will be an inspection to ensure that no pests, no diseases and no soil are present. As I understand it, if those protocols are applied—and there is no reason that they would not be or should not be—there should be the guarantee and the protection that those learned in the sciences in these matters advise us.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the event that a breakout were to occur—which of course would be something that we would not want to see—I am sure the Queensland and Commonwealth governments would work together in cooperation to ensure that anything that needed to be done would be done. Having said that, there is no expectation or anticipation that there will be such an outbreak, given the scientific evidence and the protocols that are being put in place based on that scientific evidence.
