         This instrument makes retrospective amendments to the principal Regulations to correct an error which has made certain licencees ineligible for licence tax exemption.

Notwithstanding the insertion of the Note, the Committee has written to the Minister seeking advice as to how those licencees will be made aware of their right to seek a refund of licence tax paid.
