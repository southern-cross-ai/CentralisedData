        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Brandis. I refer to the Indonesian vice-president, who says, in response to allegations that the Abbott government paid people smugglers:

             <p>
              Thank you very much indeed, Senator Wong, for that question. Senator Wong, we do not comment on operational matters, as you know. In fact, Senator Wong, evidently you are not familiar with Mr Shorten's train wreck of a press conference about 45 minutes ago, when he was asked this very question. He was asked this very question whether the Labor Party, when it was in government, paid people smugglers. Do you know what Mr Shorten had to say? Mr Shorten said, 'Well, we don't comment on operational matters.' So, Senator Wong, I suggest that the next time you prepare for question time, you have a glance at what your leader has said in the hour before question time.
             </p>
             <p>
              Of course, we know that the Labor Party paid money to people smugglers. We know $500 million worth of money went into the coffers of people smugglers, who charged a fee of approximately $10,000 per passage to 50,000 illegal entrants into Australia—

                 Senator Moore, in relation to the point of order, Senator Brandis did answer the question first-up, indicating that he would not be commenting on operational matters. And as has been the tradition and convention in this chamber for decades, ministers can always enhance their answers once they have answered the substantive question.

                  So we know that people smugglers in Indonesia were enriched during the period of the Labor government to the tune of tens of millions of dollars, because we know there were approximately 50,000 illegal entrants to Australia, whose average fee, as we also know, was
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">

                  </a>
                  $10,000. That is the extent to which people smugglers were enriched during the period of the Labor government. But because the Abbott government has stopped the boats, stopped the drownings, we have also stopped the people smugglers.

                    As I said, Senator Wong, I am familiar with the remarks attributed to the Indonesian foreign minister. What I can tell you, Senator Wong, is that unlike when you were a member of the cabinet, unlike during the period of the Labor government, the Indonesian people smugglers have gone broke. They have gone broke because they have no business. And the reason they have no business is that they have no customers, because the Abbott government stopped the boats. Senator Wong, I know you are reluctant to acknowledge that fact. I know how reluctant you are to face the shame of having made a decision that resulted directly in the deaths of 1,100 people, most of them innocent women and children. I know how that sits with your humanitarianism, Senator Wong, but you will never escape the shame of that decision. You will never escape your record and you cannot escape the fact that the Abbott government stopped the boats.

                     , I ask a further supplementary question. I refer to a spokesperson for Indonesia's security ministry, who says that the Australian foreign minister's call for Indonesia to enforce sovereignty over their borders was 'not an appropriate statement for her to make and she should withdraw'. How is the Prime Minister's Jakarta, not Geneva, foreign policy going?

                          , if it assists you, I will. As I was saying, the relationship between Indonesia and Australia occasionally faces difficulties. That has been the case on the watch of both sides of politics, but the relationship is in extremely good shape notwithstanding. It is in much better shape, I might say, than it was during the period of the Labor government when, for example, as a result of a decision of Senator Ludwig—who now lingers there on the backbench—when he was minister for agriculture we banned the export of live cattle to Indonesia, interfering with the food chain of that nation.
