        I seek leave to make a short statement relating to Senator Ludlam's request yesterday for a response to questions on notice relating to the Perth Freight Link.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        I now understand that Senator Ludlam has requested information on the Perth Freight Link via several means, and the information provided to the Clerk on 23 November 2015 was in fact a response to an order for the production of documents on the Perth Freight Link and not a response to the questions on notice being referred to by Senator Ludlam. I apologise to Senator Ludlam and the chamber for the error.
       </p>
       <p>
        In relation to questions on notice 2630, 2631 and 2632 from November 2015, I have requested the office of the Deputy Prime Minister action the responses as quickly as possible. Once these are made available to me, I will present them to the chamber.

           Prior to the seeking of leave, it is actually standard practice to give some advice about when these things are going to occur in the chamber. I am just checking. It may well have come to someone else, but it did not come to me. I was unaware that the minister would be making that statement this morning.

              In this case, it was not a regular ministerial statement. It was a clarification of an issue that arose yesterday. I have seen it in a different light. However, if the minister wants to make any remarks in relation to that, he may.

              <p>
               To clarify, no, I did not give advice. It was a clarification of an issue that occurred yesterday. I had discussions with Senator Ludlam yesterday afternoon once I became aware of the circumstances so that he was aware as soon as possible of the situation that existed. I did tell Senator Ludlam at the time that I would be making a statement to clarify the situation from yesterday, but I did not formally advise the opposition. If that was an omission on my part, I apologise.

                I will just make the comment that, in relation to these matters, the minister has no choice. He had to come and correct the record. So, really, whether advice was given or not I consider immaterial. I take your point, Senator Moore, but it was not a regular ministerial statement; it was more a correction of the record. The minister is in order and has corrected the record. But thank you for asking, Senator Moore.
