         I am, I must admit, slightly bemused by the opposition's approach to this. Usually, traditionally, they would have a firm commitment to matters concerning national security, but that is glaringly absent in this case, for what appears to be the sake of puerile local politics, as far as I can tell. There is not a lot more to it than that. In fact, the government has been quite clear in saying that the concerns which were raised by landowners and the process of planning that has been underway by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">

             It is very disappointing that those opposite have not been able to take a strategic view of the comprehensive strategic partnership and military training initiative which sits underneath it. As we know, the Prime Minister announced the comprehensive strategic partnership in May of last year, which includes a strengthening of the defence partnership and the joint development of military training facilities in

                 commenced detailed planning for the joint development of military training facilities. I, as the Minister for Defence, was preliminarily advised about the potential requirements for training area expansion in June. Detailed planning continued, which led to the finalisation of and signature of the memorandum of understanding with Singapore on 13 October 2016, which formally set out the agreed parameters of the increased training access that Australia would offer and represented the formal agreement by both countries to the scale of the increased access Singapore would be offered.

                    As I indicated in my previous answer, I was preliminarily advised about the potential requirements for training area expansion in June 2016. That goes to all aspects of the processes under the Lands Acquisition Act.

                      I thank the minister for finally telling the Senate that she was advised by her department of the possibility of compulsory acquisitions before the July election last year.
