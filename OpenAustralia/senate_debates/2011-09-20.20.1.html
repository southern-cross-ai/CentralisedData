           I think Senator Birmingham is seeking to tell me how to answer the question. There have been various times in my life when people have told me how to answer questions and I have generally found that one should follow one's own instincts on that and answer as one sees fit. I shall do so on this occasion.

             As I said yesterday, the Treasurer did indicate on Sunday that updated modelling would be released this week. As I have said in response to a number of questions yesterday, I think it was, from the senator, I will not be pre-empting the release of that modelling. It is interesting that the other side are so focused on modelling. They were when I was climate change minister and they are now. The interesting thing is that they disregard what the modelling shows, which is that we can continue to grow our economy—

                On the question of direct relevance you have, with respect, correctly, ruled that the question is in order. The question could not have been more narrow. The question asked for one fact: whether the modelling had been completed or not. What we have heard from the minister has been commentary; it has been prologue; and it has been criticism of the opposition. But it has not addressed either directly or indirectly the only fact that you have ruled was the topic of the question. Has the modelling been completed: yes or no? We are entitled to have that question answered.

                 Order! You misinterpreted what I said. I allowed the question to stand, so you should not interpret what I said. I allowed the question to stand so that the minister could hear the question and answer the question. If you are asking me to rule whether the minister is answering the question, I say to you that I cannot direct the minister how to answer the question. This is a longstanding ruling in this parliament: I cannot direct the minister. The minister has one minute remaining to address the question that has been asked. I call the minister to answer the question.

                  Point of order. Very briefly, you have indicated that it is a longstanding ruling in relation to how ministers answer questions. That is correct but for one position—that is, that the sessional orders were in fact changed to require direct relevance. That was not in the standing orders previously and if that change to sessional orders is to mean anything then surely the rulings must change, because if the rulings do not change it is quite clear that that change to sessional orders has meant absolutely nothing in the practical running of the Senate.

                    I again refer to the Treasurer's public indication this week that he would be releasing updated modelling. He indicated that this would show the impact of the carbon price on the entire economy. The initial modelling showed that the economy will continue to grow strongly under a carbon price at the same time as we cut carbon pollution—

                    Yes, I understand the opposition do not want to hear this. This is the interesting thing. They want modelling but they do not accept the findings of the modelling, which is that the economy grows, jobs grow and incomes grow with a carbon price. So, despite the fact the modelling does not back up their shameless scare campaign, they come in here and demand it, only, I am sure, to come in here subsequently to say that the modelling should not be believed. What absolute hypocrites. It is an absolutely shameless scare campaign.

                     , I ask a supplementary question. With just 18 hours left before Treasury officials appear to give evidence to the shotgun inquiry into Labor's carbon tax legislation, will the minister give a commitment that this modelling will be released before that hearing occurs, and if so will it be released today so as to at least provide members with some time to read it before having to ask questions on it?

                           , I ask a further supplementary question. Will the minister explain why it is that she will not and cannot answer these most basic questions about whether the updated Treasury modelling has been completed and, if so, when exactly it will be released? If Labor cannot be trusted to give a straight answer to such basic questions of process will the minister explain how on earth anything they say about the impact of their incredibly complex carbon tax can be believed by the Australian people?

                            In relation to the first part of that question, I have answered that by indicating that it is for the Treasurer to make this announcement. In relation to the second part of the question, those on the other side have engaged in the most shameless scare campaign. They have a leader who rocks up to a coalmine and says, 'This is the end of the coal industry.' Wrong. We have Senator Birmingham now coming in here advocating against a carbon price when he previously advocated for one. We have those on the other side running around telling Australians the sky is going to fall in if we price carbon, just as
