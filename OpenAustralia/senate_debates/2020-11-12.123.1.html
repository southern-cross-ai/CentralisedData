        My question is to the foreign minister, Minister Payne. We know from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_President" rel="nofollow">
         US President
        </a>
        -elect Biden's report of this morning's phone call between the President-elect and the Prime Minister that the discussion included confronting climate change. Interestingly, the report of the equivalent conversation with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Prime_Minister" rel="nofollow">
         Japanese Prime Minister
        </a>
        noted their shared commitment to tackle climate change. We also know that the Prime Minister tried to cut the climate crisis out of reports of his conversation with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        Prime Minister Boris Johnson. So I'd like to get some things on the table now. How did climate feature in the conversation the Prime Minister had with President-elect Biden, and did they discuss how Australia's 2030 targets lagged the rest of the world, contrasting starkly with President-elect Biden's commitment to zero carbon from electricity by 2035?

         I thank Senator Rice for her question. I've seen the read out of the President-elect's call with Prime Minister Morrison. I think it is important to reinforce—and I noticed Senator Rice did not refer to this—both leaders, President-elect Biden and the Prime Minister, made clear our strong commitment to strengthening our alliance even further as we head towards the 70th anniversary of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANZUS" rel="nofollow">
          ANZUS

         next year. We agreed there was no more critical a time for our alliance as we face the global pandemic and we face a much more uncertain strategic environment.

           Yes, a point of order. I ask you to draw the minister's attention to the topic of my question, which was specifically about how climate change was addressed in the conversation with President-elect Biden.

            On the point of order, it referenced the phone call as well. So I think, for part of the answer, the minister is entitled to address the phone call as well. I'm sure the minister is aware of the second part of the question.

             I think I had just said that the leaders discussed their shared values, our many shared interests, particularly in the Indo-Pacific. They also discussed the need for like-minded liberal democracies to do more together, which I'm sure would be endorsed by Senator Rice and those in her party, whether it is in the G7-plus, the Quad or the G20 through the leadership of multilateral institutions. Prime Minister Morrison has also indicated that their discussion included addressing global environmental challenges, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions and plastics pollution in the oceans. The Prime Minister welcomed President-elect Biden's commitment that the United States would rejoin the Paris Agreement, which, as I would note, Australia has been a continuing and committed member of. They also discussed the alignment between the President-elect's climate change platform and Australia's focus on practical measures to reduce emissions through investment in clean technology and on exploring opportunities for partnerships on clean technology, investment and deployment.

                I've indicated what matters were discussed in the phone call. I indicated across five points, I think, what they were. It is a matter for President-elect Biden and the administration, once it is formed, as to how they convene that meeting. There are a number of other meetings President-elect Biden has indicated he wishes to convene, and Australia would welcome an opportunity to participate.
