          I thank Senator Thorp for her question. On this side of the Senate we are doing the right things by the health system and its patients. Since 2007, Labor has strengthened the health care system and our plans for the future are very clear: more doctors, more nurses, the building and rebuilding of our hospitals and

            Our plans are in stark contrast to those opposite. As the Gillard government gets on with the job of governing, almost nothing is coming from the other side about the issue of people's health. Now the member for Dickson has come up with a bright idea. In the other place he has been caught out telling the
            <i>
             Australian
            </i>
            newspaper that he is going to do away with Medicare Locals. Their policy will cut $1.2 billion out of primary health care over three years. What a cruel, heartless excuse for a policy it is. Taking a leaf out of Premier Campbell Newman's playbook, the opposition have admitted that they are going to wield the axe—and we know who they will sack. Not the admin, not the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
             CEO
            </a>
            s; they will take the axe to 3,000 health workers—that is what they will do. This is all we get from the coalition—cuts in health. He will follow his past. Premier Newman in Queensland cut health and education and we will have Mr Abbott cut $1 billion out of the health system like he did last time. What do you think he will do if he is elected? He will wield the axe like Premier Newman. He has done it before and he will do it again. Mr

               these Medicare Locals—a critical part of our primary health system—would be gone. They would disappear. The health minister has said, and I agree, that it is very concerning that Mr Tony Abbott and Mr Peter Dutton have committed to scrapping Medicare Locals if the coalition wins government. It would be a sad day for health services, not only in Queensland but right across the country. At a time when patients require better primary care, the Liberals want to slash 3,000 front-line services from the health department. We need to be very clear—

                  Order! I have said there is no point of order. I am saying it is within the standing orders. I am allowing the question to stand. I am calling the minister to answer the question.
