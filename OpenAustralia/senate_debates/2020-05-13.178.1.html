           The Morrison government is committed to preventing, addressing and ultimately ending family domestic and sexual violence in Australia. This government has made the largest ever Commonwealth investment, of $340 million, to support the fourth action plan of the National Plan to Reduce Violence Against Women and their Children, which is focused on prevention and early intervention. An additional $150 million has been provided to prepare for and respond to any increase in domestic, family and sexual violence as a consequence of COVID-19. Delivery of frontline, domestic and family violence services is a matter for the state and territory governments.
