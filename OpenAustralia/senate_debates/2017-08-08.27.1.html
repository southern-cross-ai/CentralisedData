         I thank Senator Macdonald for his question and his interest in this issue. I want to, first and foremost, express my most sincere sympathies to the families and to the members of the 3rd

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
          Mr President
         </a>
         , I briefed the Prime Minister and spoke directly with my United States counterpart, the defence secretary Jim Mattis, to offer Australia's assistance in any way that we could.

         Australia has been able to assist the United States' 3rd Marine Expeditionary Force in key roles as part of the

         survey vessel based in Cairns, was deployed on Sunday. HMAS
         <i>
          Melville
         </i>
         commenced survey operations in the area on Sunday evening and, shortly thereafter, located the submerged aircraft relatively quickly. The positional information and associated hydrographic information has been passed to the United States to assist with further recovery planning. A navy clearance diver team also departed Richmond via a Royal Australian Air Force C-130J Hercules around midnight on Sunday night as well. The diving team transferred to HMAS
         <i>
          Melville
         </i>
         via a US navy landing craft. I can confirm that that team commenced operations with a remotely operated underwater vehicle late yesterday. The imagery from the underwater recovery vehicle assists with the dive planning for the recovery of the three missing marines.
        </p>
        <p>
         These recovery operations are very complex in nature. They're affected by a range of factors including weather conditions, depth, sea state, debris, water current and a number of others. I particularly want to thank the ADF personnel who are involved in this process for their very swift response and their professionalism.

            military to continue their planning and recovery operations. The focus will be, of course, on finding and recovering the three missing marines and then on retrieving crucial equipment, such as the flight data recorder, which will aid in accident investigation. As I said, these are complex operations affected by a range of factors, including the state of the aircraft wreckage, which is yet to be determined, and what access divers are able to gain to it. It could, in fact, take some time. There is a United States salvage vessel en route to
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoalwater_Bay" rel="nofollow">
             Shoalwater Bay

               I take the point Senator Macdonald made at the conclusion of his question. But, unfortunately, it is often through the most challenging circumstances—and, in this case, indeed, through tragic accident—that the strength of the alliance with the United States and our ability to work collaboratively is reinforced. Australia and the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
                US
               </a>
               are focused on working to ensure that our militaries are interoperable and able to work together seamlessly in circumstances such as these. Indeed, ironically, this was demonstrated most recently through
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercise_Talisman_Sabre" rel="nofollow">
                Exercise Talisman Sabre
               </a>
               , which concluded in late July. More than 33,000 United States and Australian personnel and number of our neighbouring nations took part in the largest joint exercise to test and evaluate our amphibious capabilities. So, whether it is in training or in peacetime operations or in operations in conflicts such as those we see currently in Afghanistan and in the campaign to defeat Daesh, Australia and the United States do have a proud history of confronting adversity together.
