         Thank you very much, Senator Joyce, for the question. I acknowledge that both you and, I think, Senator Boswell on previous occasions have raised the issue of biosecurity and quarantine assessment in respect of bananas. In fact, I can recall this matter going back at least to 1996 when we were in government and the issue was under consideration. Australia’s Director of Animal and Plant Quarantine has made a policy determination—and this is an update with new material since I responded to Senator Boswell, I think, about two months ago—establishing a stringent quarantine policy for the importation of bananas from the Philippines consistent with Australia’s conservative approach to quarantine. In line with the final import risk analysis report issued last November, the Philippines will be required to demonstrate to Australia’s satisfaction that risk management measures can be achieved under commercial conditions on an ongoing basis with the

          Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service
         </a>
         involved in ensuring compliance on the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Philippine government has reacted to Australia’s banana quarantine policy, describing it as ‘very stringent, expensive and trade restrictive’, and claiming it will delay any exports. Philippine quarantine officials said that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosecurity_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Biosecurity Australia
         </a>
         ’s clearance of their bananas was almost useless because of these stringent conditions. The Philippine agricultural undersecretary is also apparently concerned.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I was hoping the minister might go into the effects of the importation of mealie bugs, black sigatoka, moko virus et cetera. Is the minister aware of the statement by Minister Burke on 4BC on 5 March:

          Well the way the law works on this, once the process is started—and it started under

          eight years ago—then it gets handed through a scientific process and the opportunity for the Minister to intervene doesn’t come up until that process has ended.
         </p>
         <p>
          Now the process has ended, is the minister going to intervene to stop the importation of Philippine bananas?

           I thank Senator Joyce for the question. I am glad you raised black sigatoka and moko. I am not sure you mentioned freckle, as we also have to take into account freckle and the insidious threat it could pose to bananas. The
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRA" rel="nofollow">
            IRA
           </a>
           found that the seven groups of pests and diseases of concern required quarantine measures to achieve Australia’s appropriate level of protection. Most notable of those are moko, black sigatoka and freckle, as well as other pests not present. I have every confidence that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Burke, has handled this matter appropriately.

            , I ask a further supplementary question. Does the minister acknowledge that with the importation of Philippine bananas comes the chance and, over time, the likelihood of the importation of these diseases and, in fact, the inevitability of these diseases coming into Australia and decimating the banana industry, which is an employer of up to 5,000 people in
