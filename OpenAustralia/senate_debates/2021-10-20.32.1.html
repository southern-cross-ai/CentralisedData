        It is a privilege, Senator Cox, to follow you in this chamber. It's the second time I've done that this week, in your first week. I think you made some extremely important points there, and one is left to ponder why it is that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia

        has a budget surplus of $5 billion when its social housing provision is in such a terrible state, as you outlined.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was privileged to attend two celebrations over the last few weeks. When I gave my first speech in the Senate, I spoke about my passion for Australia's Pacific step-up program, and, as I've engaged more and more with the Pacific island diasporas in our beautiful country, I'm becoming even more passionate about the Pacific step-up program and its importance. So let me talk to you about the two celebrations I had the honour of attending.
       </p>
       <p>
        The first was the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_Islands" rel="nofollow">
         Cook Islands
        </a>
        celebration of self-government, the Te Maeva Nui 2021 celebration, which was put on by the Cook Islands Council of Queensland Inc.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cook_Islands" rel="nofollow">

        flag, that beautiful flag with the

        in the top left-hand corner and then the 15 stars representing the 15 islands of the Cook Islands, was proudly on display. The Cook Islands diaspora turned out in force. All the food you'd expect was there, and the arts and crafts—I did some early Christmas shopping—and cultural performances. It was all there to behold and it was just an outstanding event. I pay tribute to Mr Archie Atiau, who's president of the Cook Islands Council of Queensland Inc. Archie actually gave a dance, in the lead-up to his welcoming speech, which signified his enthusiasm for the celebration and how great it was for the community to come together. I also congratulate Councillor Mindy Russell from

        </a>
        Council, who was in attendance. She gave a dance as well; she caught the enthusiasm. She is a great worker in the community in Logan City. So I pay tribute to Councillor Russell. I was the next speaker. I didn't dance physically. I was dancing on the inside; I was celebrating on the inside. I managed to restrain myself and didn't give any physical—
       </p>
       <p>
        Senator Walsh, I didn't hear that through your mask, but I'll assume you were complimenting me on my restraint! I did manage to restrain myself. But it was a great celebration. It also reflected, in my view, the great generosity of spirit of the Cook Islands people.
       </p>
       <p>
        I saw that the previous week when I attended

        , which has been set up by the Cook Islands Council of Queensland Inc, under the leadership of Archie Atiau. Every Wednesday they provide emergency food hampers to people in need in the community. It doesn't matter whether or not you're of Cook Islands background. They're there helping people in need, reflecting the generosity of spirit of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_Islanders" rel="nofollow">
         Cook Islanders
        </a>
        everywhere. I congratulate the volunteers who were there that day: Teela Komene, Nooroa and Terii Hagai, Tai Kairua, Justin Tautua, Danteus Roberts-Tugaga, Papa Maata Moeroa and Anita Tugaga. Congratulations, one and all. You're outstanding community members and it was an honour to be in your company.
       </p>

        The week before, I attended another celebration, which was for Fijian Independence Day—again, another great community event, on this occasion celebrating Fiji's independence, which occurred on 10 October 1970. Senators present in the chamber will know that Australia has a very deep bond with Fiji, and this is exemplified by the Fiji-Australia Vuvale Partnership which has been entered into during the term of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Morrison" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        government. There was a wonderful dinner on the Friday night, and I was given the great honour of participating in traditional Fijian welcome ceremonies, including the drinking of kava, which I must say I quite enjoy. I actually quite enjoy a drink of kava, especially when it's in such wonderful company.
       </p>
       <p>
        During the course of that night and the cultural and sports celebrations the next day, a total of $5,000 was raised for a project undertaken by the International Women's Association in Fiji to provide cloth nappies and other essentials to new mothers in Fiji. It was a great example of our Pacific island diasporas working together to raise funds to send back to their island homes. I congratulate everyone involved in that event.
       </p>
       <p>
        There were many elders of the community in attendance. In particular, I'd like to pay tribute to the President of the Fiji Community Association of Queensland Inc., Dr Vilaseri Tuicolo. Dr Tuicolo is an obstetrician. He provides outstanding medical services, especially in regional Queensland, and he's a great leader of the Fijian diaspora. I also pay tribute to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honorary_Consul" rel="nofollow">
         Honorary Consul
        </a>
        of Fiji in Brisbane, Mr Hari Raniga. The Raniga family has made an outstanding contribution, in both Fiji and Australia, through community work and business work. Honorary Consul, you should be congratulated for your efforts and those of your family. It was an honour to hear the story of your family and all that you contribute to the wellbeing of Fiji and Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        My good friend Ratu Alifereti Maseinawa was the sports and cultural convener. Ratu, you did a magnificent job pulling it all together. You're a great Queenslander, and your leadership in helping to pull together the sports and cultural day was just outstanding. It was great to spend time in your company on Saturday. I also want to congratulate
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosese_Rauluni" rel="nofollow">
         Mosese Rauluni
        </a>
        , who was involved in organising the rugby sevens, along with Kelevi Tuicolo and Donna Lobendahn. Thank you to the dinner conveners, Kathy Harry Jaeger, Donnalyn Sing, Susana Bartlett and Donna Lobendahn; the soccer organiser, Raj Rao; the cultural festival organisers, Pate Ganita and Netani Lesi; the organisers of the children's activities, Valami and Sera Roqica; and everyone else involved in putting on a wonderful cultural and sports celebration. It was just outstanding. So, in conclusion, I say to all my Fijian friends, the Fijian diaspora: Ni sa bula vinaka.
