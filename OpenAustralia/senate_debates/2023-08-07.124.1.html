        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. In August 2021, in a joint release with Minister Burney, the Prime Minister said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Labor will deliver on a national process for Treaty-making and Truth-telling …
       </p>
       <p>
        Yesterday, on
        <i>
         Insiders
        </i>
        , the Prime Minister said this:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Well, Treaty is occurring. There's 400 Indigenous nations in this country. So, we're not talking about centralised operations here.
       </p>
       <p>
        Minister, does the Albanese government support the Commonwealth engaging in treaty-making with Indigenous people at a national level?

            Its meaning includes 'coming together after a struggle'. It is about bringing people together, and it is disappointing to see Senator Cash again—notwithstanding her leadership position—leading the charge to divide the country. What I would also say about treaty is to make the point that the Prime Minister made:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Well, Treaty is occurring. There's 400 Indigenous nations in this country. So, we're not talking about centralised operations here.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think that is a response to Senator Cash's point. But I would also make this point, which I made last week, but no doubt Senator Cash didn't want to hear it: treaty is being progressed with bipartisan support in Queensland. Treaty is being progressed in Victoria with bipartisan support. It is being progressed in the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
             Northern Territory
            </a>
            and, in fact, in Tasmania, where a Liberal government has established a pathway to truth-telling and treaty. These are all good things.
           </p>
           <p>
            I think it is disappointing that those on the other side continue, in the face of so much to gain from this process, to seek to ensure that they talk about everything but a voice to the parliament. It is disappointing, and I wish that some more senior people had joined the Prime Minister at Garma and had the opportunity to engage with leaders of

              In his 2019 address to the Garma festival, the Prime Minister called makarrata the 'path to treaty' but in his address to the Garma festival this weekend, the Prime Minister didn't use the words 'treaty' or 'makarrata' at all. Again, does the Albanese government support the Commonwealth engaging in treaty-making with Indigenous people at a national level?

                     In February 2021, the Prime Minister told the parliament:
                    </p>
                    <p class="italic">
                     A makarrata commission as outlined in the Uluru statement would oversee a national process of truth-telling, agreement and treaty.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     But, in answer to a direct question in the parliament last week, the Prime Minister refused to use the word 'treaty' at all. Again, does the Albanese government support the Commonwealth engaging in treaty-making with Indigenous people at a national level?
