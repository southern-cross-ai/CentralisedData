           Recently, we have heard of disturbing cases of violence, abuse and intimidation perpetrated by
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
            CFMEU
           </a>
           officials against female Fair Work building commission inspectors, including spitting, threatening phone calls, verbal abuse and—most disturbingly—a threat of gang rape.
          </p>
          <p>
           Each year on
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Ribbon" rel="nofollow">
            White Ribbon
           </a>
           Day we stand together as representatives of our community and pledge to not remain silent and not excuse violence against women, whether it is by union officials or anyone else. I note that four male members of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Greens
           </a>
           have taken the White Ribbon pledge. Australians must therefore wonder why they refuse to support this motion.
          </p>
          <p>
           Perhaps this explains their reasons: the CFMEU donated $145,000 to the Australian Greens last financial year. More worryingly, the CFMEU contributed $1.33 million to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
            ALP
           </a>
           in 2013-14 and $13.4 million over the last 19 years. Given this evidence, their refusal to support this motion is reprehensible. I table a copy of this photograph of the four Australian Greens male members taking the White Ribbon pledge.

                  Labor is not a defender of criminal or thug-like behaviour, as we have made clear many times in this chamber, and in public notice. We do not tolerate intimidation or bullying. If criminal conduct has taken place, Labor condemns it. However, it is not proper for the Liberal-Nationals government to use allegations of criminal conduct to pursue a political campaign against its opponents. If there is evidence of crime it should be immediately reported to the police for investigation. Labor and the union movement are consistently supporters of

                  , as can be seen. We support lawful process and do not tolerate bullying or intimidation.

                     This motion contains serious allegations. Violence against women is to be condemned, and anyone engaged in it should feel the full force of the law. It is disturbing that neither the employer of these women, Fair Work Building and Construction, nor the government has referred any of these matters to the police.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     We note that the

                     </a>
                     has referred the serious claim of violence and sexual assault to state and federal police but that no CFMEU officials have been contacted by them so far. Some of these claims, such as those about allegedly threatening late-night phone calls, are strongly denied.

                     firmly believe that government officials have a right to work in a safe environment, but if the government were serious about the welfare of FWBC officers it would not bring unproven allegations to the Senate in a motion and ask us to stand in judgement. Take the matter to appropriate authorities
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     That this has not happened raises questions about the motivation for bringing these allegations under parliamentary privilege. It seems it has more to do with the government's legislative agenda than concerns about women's safety or people's rights at work. We will not be supporting this motion.
