       <p>
        A primary role of our parliament is to make, monitor and update laws which have a key focus on the safety of Australians. Our parliament has a strong record of bipartisanship when it comes to dealing with legislation surrounding national security measures and other laws that go to making our communities safer. The opposition extends the same hand of bipartisanship when it comes to legislation relating to road safety and motor vehicle standards. During the calendar year of 2017 there were 1,224 road deaths in Australia and more than 35,000 seriously injured on our roads. In 2018 alone there have been 874 deaths on Australian roads.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sadly, thanks to the actions of this current government, Australia no longer builds cars and must rely on imports. With nearly 1.2 million new cars sold in this country each year, we must ensure that the standards applying to motor vehicle imports are up to date and fit for purpose, especially with the rate of deaths on our roads, which I mentioned earlier. We must not dumb our cars down. With the annual economic cost of road crashes in Australia at approximately $30 billion per year, it is essential that governments do everything they can to ensure that cars being brought into this country are the safest they can be.
       </p>
       <p>
        This legislation is therefore timely. It is 17 years since the Motor Vehicles Standards Act and its regulations were last reviewed. This package seeks to bring the regulatory regime into the 21st century and to make it more streamlined, reducing compliance costs to the industry by approximately $68 million. The legislation will create an online register which will provide consumers an opportunity to check that the vehicles they are interested in purchasing comply with Australian design standards. Despite having some concerns about the finer details of these bills, based on consultation with stakeholders, Labor will support this package. We believe that the stakeholder concerns, which I will address shortly, should be taken into account in the rules and subsequent technical and administrative arrangements provided for by these bills.
       </p>
       <p>
        The road safety package will replace the old Motor Vehicle Standards Act, which regulates imported vehicles, and includes five pieces of legislation: the Road Vehicle Standards Bill 2018, the Road Vehicle Standards (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2018, the Road Vehicle Standards Charges (Imposition—General) Bill 2018, the Road Vehicle Standards Charges (Imposition—Customs) Bill 2018 and the Road Vehicle Standards Charges (Imposition—Excise) Bill 2018. Under existing rules, people demonstrate that a vehicle complies with safety standards using the physical attachment of a compliance plate, but this legislation replaces that system by creating a register of approved vehicles that comply with Australian standards.
       </p>
       <p>
        There will be two ways for a vehicle to make its way onto this register. The first, known as the type approval pathway, is for new vehicles being imported into this nation for sale. The vast majority of vehicles will enter the list via this route. The second, known as the concessional pathway, is aimed at a limited range of new and used vehicles which can be granted concessions on a vehicle-by-vehicle basis. This pathway will apply to specialist and enthusiast vehicles, classic and vintage vehicles, and vehicles that have a special purpose that could not be fulfilled if they had to comply with Australian standards. This latter category might apply to emergency vehicles and cranes. The legislation creates the specialist and enthusiast vehicle register to ensure that motor enthusiasts seeking to import unusual vehicles can do so without breaching Australian vehicle standards.
       </p>
       <p>
        The legislation establishes road vehicle standard rules to define vehicles that are of general, specialist and enthusiast nature through needing to meet one of six criteria: high-performance vehicles, vehicles with environmental standards significantly superior to Australian mainstream vehicles, vehicles manufactured with modifications to assist people with a disability, rare vehicles, left-hand drive vehicles, and campervans and motorhomes not originally manufactured as campervans or motorhomes.
       </p>
       <p>
        The legislation also includes provisions allowing for the importation of vehicles for purposes other than road use, such as for testing or racing. These vehicles will not be listed on the register. Relevant states and territories will decide whether such vehicles may be driven on roads within their borders.
       </p>
       <p>
        The proposed changes will serve the interests of consumers. Consumers will be able to search the online register of approved vehicles using their vehicle identification number,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VIN" rel="nofollow">
         VIN
        </a>
        , to confirm that vehicles they want to buy comply with the rules. The new legislation will also require manufacturers to introduce a secure identification-marking requirement for all new vehicles. This provision is designed to provide a deterrent to vehicle theft and rebirthing. This is a sensible move.
       </p>
       <p>
        The package also gives the minister for transport the ability to issue a recall notice on any road vehicle or road vehicle component and lays out the framework for voluntary recalls. This too is important. When manufacturers discover faults in motor vehicles, it's critical that there is a process by which they can be recalled quickly if they represent a risk to public safety. There have been some major safety recalls in recent years involving major manufacturers. We need a simple system that allows for efficient handling of such issues.
       </p>
       <p>
        Administration of these new standards will be funded by industry participants on a cost-recovery basis. However, these bills do not outline the amounts to be charged. These will be prescribed in accompanying rules and regulations that will be subject to disallowance by this parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        Various industry groups have expressed concern over elements of the package. For example, the legislation allows some vehicles to be imported through a revised Registered Automotive Workshop Scheme which allows for the import of used specialist and enthusiast vehicles. It also creates a New Low Volume Scheme which applies to new vehicles where fewer than 100 vehicles are to be imported.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian Automotive Aftermarket Association raised concern about the inclusion of the New Low Volume Scheme under
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAWS" rel="nofollow">
         RAWS
        </a>
        . The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAAA" rel="nofollow">
         AAAA
        </a>
        argued that, under the existing system, vehicles imported under the New Low Volume Scheme do not need to be individually inspected. Its concern is that, under the new system, low-volume imports will have to be individually inspected and that this will add costs to the industry. The AAAA suggested that the new arrangements would therefore disadvantage small workshops and benefit big manufacturers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Concerns were also expressed regarding the effect of this legislation on companies that import vehicles from overseas and then convert them into campervans or motorhomes. Specifically, this legislation closes a loophole in the existing system that allowed some registered automotive workshops to import thousands of cars which they did not convert but simply on-sold at profit. This legislation's closure of that loophole has created concerns about the prospects of companies that do legitimately convert vehicles into campervans and motorhomes. Having considered these concerns, Labor has formed the view that the legislation as it stands serves the public interest. However, we take these industry concerns seriously. The opposition will monitor the operation of the legislation and the operations of its accompanying rules and subsequent technical and administrative arrangements.
       </p>
       <p>
        Administration of vehicle standards is never easy. When we are importing 1.2 million cars into our country per year, we need to make sure that we get it right. We need a system that is simple but one that also allows people who want to import unusual and specialist vehicles an opportunity to do so. While I think there is still more we can be doing to mandate sufficient safety ratings on cars we import into our nation, this legislation includes some important improvements in the cause of public safety and security. I commend the package to the Senate.

        <p>
         I'm rising today to speak to the Road Vehicle Standards Bill 2018 and associated bills. These bills replace the Motor Vehicle Standards Act—legislation that's provided the basis for the safety, environmental quality and anti-theft performance of all vehicles on Australian roads. The Motor Vehicle Standards Act dates to 1989, although it has been amended along the way. However, the last major review was undertaken over 17 years ago. It's easy to understand why the Motor Vehicle Standards Act needs replacing when you think about how far vehicle technology has come in the last three decades, particularly when it comes to safety and reducing pollution. It's only since 2013 that Euro 5 standards have applied in Australia, and that was the first set of standards that put a restriction on the amount of particulate matter that came out of petrol engines, and it's only since 2011 that electronic stability control has been mandatory on all new cars, reducing the danger of skidding. Technology moves on and legislation has to keep pace. However, we know that Australia is way behind when it comes to next-generation technology, including our dire position on electric vehicles compared to the rest of the world, but I'll come to that in a bit.
        </p>
        <p>
         The bills will establish a new legislative framework for the regulation of the importation and supply of road vehicles and the provision of some road-vehicle components. We think the changes to the import pathways are sensible with the streamlining into two distinct groups—registered approved vehicles and registered specialist and enthusiast vehicles—which will make the system easier to navigate for both new vehicle retailers and the broader automotive community.
        </p>
        <p>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greens" rel="nofollow">
          The Greens

         certainly welcome the new recall powers, streamlining the process through which the government can act on and enforce recall events if they're required for safety reasons or if specific models do not comply with the national road vehicle standards. This is an important addition to the powers of the minister, as the Takata airbag event can give testament to. However, I would note that there are concerns that the Greens have with this legislation. As noted in both the
         <i>
          Bills Digest
         </i>
         and the Scrutiny of Bills Committee report, the powers delegated to the minister are extremely broad. This is a trend which is concerningly becoming the norm for this place. As parliament is squeezed out, decisions are being made by the executive and less and less space is being left for parliamentary oversight.
        </p>
        <p>
         I also want to put on the record that the bills that we are finally debating today are the outcome of nearly five years of process within the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development. There was consultation in 2013, a second consultation process began in 2014 and, finally, a bill made it to the parliament in 2016, but here we are, and it's 2018, so it's been two years since the bill first made it to the parliament. The original version of the bill had a more permissive pathway for the import of right-hand-drive vehicles from overseas, but the minister at the time folded after a deluge of industry pushback, and now we see in the bill before us today that those provisions have been substantially tightened. It's very interesting to think about the five-year process and the pressures that are applied during such a process, because right now we are looking at a very similar process and similar outcomes with the Ministerial Forum on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_Emissions" rel="nofollow">
          Vehicle Emissions
         </a>
         . Since that body was set up in October 2015—that is, three years ago—we have had nothing but delay after delay after delay. We've had multiple changes of responsible minister, multiple rounds of discussion papers and draft regulatory impact statements and a continuous pushback in the time lines.
        </p>
        <p>
         The proposals that the Ministerial Forum on Vehicle Emissions have actually developed are quite good, even if they're not always as ambitious as us Greens would like. The proposed light-vehicle efficiency standard would finally implement something that 80 per cent of cars around the world already have to comply with, and that means more efficient vehicles and more efficient use of fuel. It would save up to $1,000 for the average driver at today's fuel prices. And it would reduce greenhouse gas pollution by over 65 million tonnes between now and 2030, which would be a big—although still insufficient—dent in our growing transport sector emissions, and those transport sector emissions are significant. Our transport pollution is now 18 per cent of our total emissions, and it's growing—it's the fastest-growing sector in the country.
        </p>
        <p>
         The ministerial forum also recommended that we immediately begin the introduction of Euro 6 standards for light vehicles and trucks, putting tighter caps on particulate matter and nitrous oxide pollution, which kills literally hundreds of Australians per year. These standards have been in place in many other countries since 2014. Pollution from those heavy vehicles is incredibly significant, and it really needs to be tackled. I say this as someone who lives in Footscray, in the inner western suburbs of Melbourne, just across from the port, where massive semitrailers and B-doubles are plying our streets every day, belching out their diesel pollution—past schools, past kindergartens, past hospitals.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Euro" rel="nofollow">
          The Euro
         </a>
         6 standards would put a reduction on this diesel pollution and, in doing so, would reduce rates of cancer, because diesel is a known carcinogen. Every time you've got a vehicle that is belching out those diesel particulates, you are doing damage to people's health.
        </p>
        <p>
         The sorts of reforms that have been recommended in the Ministerial Forum on Vehicle Emissions are very similar to the road vehicle standards being considered in this bill. They are simple, sensible, bare-minimum standards. But, again, we've finally got to this stage with the Road Vehicle Standards Bill and the implementation of the recommendations of the Ministerial Forum on Vehicle Emissions—these critical updates to our motor vehicle regulation—and industry is calling the shots. In July last year, after beginning consultation on an actual implementation model for the changes that the forum is recommending, we saw a front-page article in
         <i>
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph" rel="nofollow">
           The Daily Telegraph
          </a>
         </i>
         about a carbon tax on cars. Ministers Frydenberg and Fletcher immediately went into damage control. Their plans were immediately shelved, and the whole thing went away for another year. Could anybody be surprised that the story in
         <i>
          The Daily Telegraph
         </i>
         appeared literally the day after consultation on the implementation model began? No: it's what we would expect.
        </p>
        <p>
         We now know from documents acquired by Senator Patrick through freedom of information that, in February of this year, Ministers Frydenberg and Fletcher had further discussions from which there were consequential actions for officials from the Department of the Environment and Energy to carry out. We were even told, when we asked questions about it in estimates in May this year, to expect something on vehicle emissions later this year. Well, there's not much of this year to go, is there? But of course after that we heard negative stories all over Sky TV, 2GB and the Murdoch press. If hope was held out that Ministers Frydenberg and Fletcher would be able to get it together on a third try, it's been pretty clear since the events of August—and the complete abandonment by this government of anything that even looks like doing anything meaningful about climate change—that those reforms are dead and buried. It's taken five years for us to get the Road Vehicle Standards Bill to this stage today, it's taken us three years so far in the ministerial forum, and I don't think they are going to be achieved within this term of government.
        </p>
        <p>
         So, here we are. We welcome this bill, and we welcome the amendments that are going to be moved by Senator Storer, which will ease the pathway to the import of electric vehicles. If we don't have the efficiency standards recommended by the Ministerial Forum on Vehicle Emissions, then at least being allowed to have imports of second-hand electric vehicles would provide another pathway to help build the base of vehicles on Australian roads so that we could begin the journey towards electric vehicles being the majority of the vehicles on our roads. So many other countries around the world are so far ahead of us in doing that. So many countries around the world now have regulations in place so that all new vehicles being sold will be electric vehicles by 2030, by 2040, by 2050, yet here in Australia we are lagging behind. So at least, as a stopgap measure to get more electric vehicles on the roads, allowing the importation of second-hand electric vehicles, with appropriate consumer protections in place, is a very sensible way forward.
        </p>
        <p>
         In terms of our thoughts about this legislation, I have also got a second reading amendment to move, which I understand has been circulated. I think it's worth concluding my speech today by actually reading you out the text of that second reading amendment in full, because it summarises our concerns with the current situation regarding pollution from vehicles and the sorts of legislation that we would like to see—legislation about safety and the sustainability of vehicles on our roads; legislation that should be being introduced, in addition to the measures being introduced in this bill. So I move my second reading amendment:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         At the end of the motion, add:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         ", but the Senate notes that:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (a) the Ministerial Forum on Vehicle Emissions was established in October 2015 to address emissions from motor vehicles;
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) the Draft Regulation Impact Statement on Vehicle emissions standards for cleaner air released by the Ministerial Forum notes that:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (i) Australia is estimated to have experienced a 68 per cent increase in deaths attributable to air pollution during the period 2005 to 2010, with total of 1,483 deaths in 2010; and
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (ii) it is suggested that, in

          OECD

         countries, road transport accounts for approximately half of the cost of the health impact of air pollution (including these preventable deaths);
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (c) while the Prime Minister insists that we will meet our Paris targets 'in a canter', the transport sector is now responsible for 19 per cent of Australian greenhouse gas emissions and has continued to grow in emissions year on year since 2001;
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (d) despite two discussion papers, three draft regulation impact statements, two additional reports and over three years of work, there has been no substantive government action to reduce emissions from motor vehicles; and
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (e) the Government has proven itself completely unable to deliver meaningful reductions in vehicle emissions and therefore cannot be trusted to reduce deaths from vehicle pollution or meet our international climate change obligations."
        </p>
        <p>
         In conclusion, the Greens are supporting this legislation, but there is so much work that still needs to be done to ensure that all vehicles in Australia are safe and clean, and the Greens implore this government to get on with the job of doing that.

          The Road Vehicle Standards Bill 2018 and four other related bills replace the Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989 to implement the federal government's updated framework to regulate how motor vehicles are made available to the Australian market for the first time. The government is seeking to ensure that Australians enjoy a car fleet that is safe and displays suitable environmental performance, with adequate consumer safeguards and choice. This concludes the consultation process with the automotive sector, which has taken four years. It cements the government's approach to managing vehicle entrants to Australia's fleet.
         </p>
         <p>
          Put simply, this bill and its accompanying regulatory framework define how motor vehicles are imported into Australia and given permission to enter the register of approved vehicles. The first and main way that this may occur is via the type approval pathway; the second is the concessional entry pathway. A type approval is the permission given by the government to car manufacturers to bring a compliant vehicle to market. This is the primary path. In 2018, 98 per cent of the 1.2 million vehicles that entered Australia came to market this way. The second means of vehicle entry to the Australian market is the concessional path. This allows the importation of new and used vehicles that were not made available via the type approval pathway, under highly restricted circumstances. These vehicles comprise less than two per cent of vehicles entering Australia for the first time. This legislation provides for the regulatory oversight of these two pathways.
         </p>
         <p>
          In terms of the second concessional pathway, these vehicles that have not been made available to the market must comply with the criteria set out in the Register of Specialist and Enthusiast Vehicles, the S

          register. The draft rules explain the range of vehicles that may be released to market under this scheme, to include mobility and environmental vehicles. This is a positive since it will have the effect of expanding consumer choice and forcing car manufacturers to release a wide range of models to what they consider to be a small and distant market. However, we now have an opportunity to do more when it comes to electric vehicles, an issue I've advocated on since joining the Senate.
         </p>
         <p>
          Australia's uptake of electric vehicles, EVs, has been slow compared to the rest of the developed world. Of the approximately 17 million light passenger vehicles in Australia, only around 7,300 are EVs. In 2017, around 2,300 electric vehicles were sold in Australia, representing just 0.2 per cent of the market. As the Chair of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committee" rel="nofollow">
           Select Committee
          </a>
          on Electric Vehicles, I've heard a wealth of evidence on why it is in our interests to increase the uptake of EVs here in Australia. They stand to improve our health, our environment, our economy and even our national security. The slow uptake of EVs in Australia can be partly explained by a lack of model availability, higher up-front purchase prices and poor consumer familiarity with new technology. These are all factors that would be assisted through a deeper and more diverse second-hand electric vehicle market.

          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
           New Zealand
          </a>
          provides a useful comparative case study. Our neighbour has around 2,000 more EVs on the road than we do, despite having a population smaller than Sydney. This is largely thanks to policy decisions it has made around the importation of second-hand EVs from larger markets, which have resulted in greater range and affordability. To take a real-world example, there are currently 250 Nissan
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEAF" rel="nofollow">
           LEAF
          </a>
          s for sale online in New Zealand. It's possible to buy a 2012 model for around $12,185. In Australia, by comparison, a search shows that just 14 Nissan LEAFs are available, with all but two priced over $20,000. The
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW" rel="nofollow">
           BMW
          </a>
          i3 is another example. Twenty-eight are available online in New Zealand, and just five are available here in Australia. A 2015 BMW i3 may be purchased in Australia for $41,000 with 48,800 kilometres on the clock. The same model is available in New Zealand for the lesser amount of $37,000 with just 2,500 kilometres on the clock. These are examples of the significant premium the Australian motoring public pays compared to New Zealand and are a consequence of the supply constraints that limit Australia's market. This is why it is a shame that the government missed this opportunity to increase the liquidity and competitiveness of Australia's second-hand EV market.
         </p>
         <p>
          My proposed amendment rectifies that. It inserts an additional clause that requires the accompanying rules in this legislation to provide for the inclusion onto the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEV" rel="nofollow">
           SEV
          </a>
          register of previously approved electric vehicles—that is, electric vehicles or plug-in hybrids that have entered Australia via the main type approval pathway but have had their type approval expire, which generally happens five years after the approval comes into force. This will allow independent importers to bring in second-hand EVs from comparable markets, increasing the depth of Australia's EV market. For clarity, this reform would mean that, from next year, second-hand EVs built in 2014 and earlier could start being imported into Australia.
         </p>
         <p>
          It is a modest but highly significant amendment that would benefit Australian consumers and assist us in meeting our Paris agreement commitments. I'm advised that it could initially lead to an additional sale of around 3,000 electric vehicles per annum. These vehicles would be a way for the Australian market to test its appetite for EVs and could lead to stronger sales of new vehicles of this class. It would also encourage car manufacturers to offer more competitive pricing and a wider range of stock for new EVs here in Australia. If car manufacturers choose not to do so, independent importers could fill the market gap quite quickly. This suggestion would result in an increased supply of electric vehicles in Australia at a far more affordable price, without requiring subsidies from the taxpayer. Some may claim that such independent imports will place consumers at risk. While I understand these concerns, I believe they could easily be addressed with the right regulations. For example, importers should be required to meet all Australian consumer obligations around warranties, recalls and insurance, and arrange for the vehicles to be inspected by a registered authority, approved to inspect imported vehicles.
         </p>
         <p>
          In summary, I call upon the government and the opposition to accept this modest but significant amendment. It will result in more electric vehicles coming to market, providing more choice and lower prices for Australian consumers and improving our health, environment and national security.

           In rising to speak to the Road Vehicle Standards Bill 2018 and related bills, I foreshadow that I will be moving a second reading amendment, which reads:

          <p class="italic">
           (b) calls on the Government to relax import restrictions on second-hand cars to allow widespread wholesale importation of late model second-hand vehicles from countries such as Japan."
          </p>
          <p>
           This second reading amendment that I will be moving to the Road Vehicle Standards Bill 2018 seeks to highlight the need to relax current restrictions on the importation of second-hand vehicles. Current import restrictions were originally put in place to help protect our domestic vehicle manufacturing industry but, since both the government and the opposition have decided that we don't need one, these restrictions are now redundant. All that these restrictions now serve to do is to push up the cost of private transport to Aussie battlers.
          </p>
          <p>
           As part of the 2014 review of the Motor Vehicle Standards Act 1989, the Australian government engaged Castalia Strategic Advisors to evaluate the costs and benefits relating to the potential relaxation of the current vehicle import policy settings. The report identifies significant economic opportunities for reducing the current restrictions on the importation of used vehicles. In its conclusion, the Castalia review stated:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Deregulating the used import trade has the potential to unlock considerable economic net benefits. The economic analysis shows that the benefits outweigh the costs of deregulating the used import trade by … (up to) $1,943 million in

           terms.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Whether the biggest impact is to increase the fleet size, to substitute for new car sales or increase the scrappage rate of old cars, the benefits outweigh the costs.
          </p>
          <p>
           The review stated:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           This result holds under all scenarios that we have modelled.
          </p>
          <p>
           The simple fact is that relaxing import restrictions on late model second-hand cars and commercials would increase the supply in Australia, increasing competition amongst sellers and driving down prices. That means that people who struggle to buy and maintain a car today could then afford one. This is a direct and immediate improvement to the living standards of many hundreds of thousands of Australian working families who currently struggle to afford a reliable car. The only opponents of this measure are the new vehicle dealers, who see an increase in their supply of good, reliable second-hand cars as a threat to their own profits. Well, I say that the government isn't here to protect the profits of a minority at the expense of everyone else.
          </p>
          <p>
           Currently in Japan, strict emission controls mean that car engines struggle to remain compliant after 30,000 or so kilometres. This means that there are ample late model cars which could be exported to countries such as Australia, facilitated by the fact that the Japanese drive on the same side of the road as us and so no vehicle steering conversions are required. Widespread importation of second-hand cars from the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
            UK
           </a>
           is also available.
          </p>
          <p>
           As part of its inquiry into Australia's late automotive manufacturing industry, the Productivity Commission recommended that the government should relax the restrictions on importation of second-hand passenger and light commercial vehicles. So, if the government refuses to support the amendment I will be moving, it not only will be ignoring the economic benefits identified by its own independent inquiry but also will be rejecting the recommendations of the Productivity Commission. It is also rejecting the best interests of ordinary working families. So I call on the government and the Senate to adopt the recommendations of the Productivity Commission and the Castalia review and make reliable car ownership affordable for Australian working families.

           <p>
            I'd like to firstly thank all senators for their contribution to this debate on the Road Vehicle Standards Bill 2018 and related bills. This legislation delivers on five key principles that improve the regulation of road vehicle standards for the benefit of the Australian community: flexibility and responsiveness, given how fast the motor vehicle is already changing and how fast it's expected to continue to change; clarity, so that we reflect modern legal drafting standards to strengthen the existing regulatory framework, whilst improving transparency and decision-making; a greater choice of road vehicles for Australians; ensuring modern compliance and enforcement powers, improving safety and emission outcomes; and the continued harmonisation of Australian standards with international standards—a longstanding policy of Australian governments to reduce the regulatory impost on Australian industry and consumers.
           </p>
           <p>
            For Australian manufacturers and importers of full-volume vehicles, these bills mean reduced red tape and streamlined certification processes. I recently met with the Caravan Industry Association of Australia, who are amongst the strongest advocates for this legislation, which will level the playing field for our Australian manufacturers. A strong Australian caravan industry means safer caravans, safer roads, improved consumer confidence and more jobs in manufacturing and tourism, particularly out in the regions, as more and more Australians with their caravans head outside capital cities to experience our fabulous beaches, mountains and country towns.
           </p>
           <p>
            For Australian motoring enthusiasts, these bills mean that an increased range of specialist and enthusiast vehicles will become available and there will be reduced costs of regulatory compliance. This legislation will see, for example, people able to import and supply new and used electric vehicles that manufacturers have, for whatever reason, chosen not to provide to Australian consumers. This results in greater choice for Australian consumers but will not result in parallel imports of electric vehicles, ensuring protections for consumers wishing to use this pathway.
           </p>
           <p>
            For the Australian community at large, these bills mean a better regulatory system capable of responding to the challenges of the future. They mean improved compliance with safety and environmental standards. Ultimately, these bills mean safer, cleaner and more secure vehicles for Australia. I commend the bills to the Senate.
