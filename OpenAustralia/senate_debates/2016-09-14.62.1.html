           I thank Senator O'Sullivan for his question. I am incredibly proud to be part of the Joyce-Turnbull government that is delivering in spades for regional people right across this nation, compared to the previous Labor government that never ever once had regional Australia as a priority. We have seen $5 billion for the Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund Facility. And this is from the coalition government, from the Turnbull-Joyce government that is investing in the north, again, unlike those opposite.
          </p>
          <p>
           I particularly want to acknowledge the work that Senator Ian Macdonald has done on this over a long period of time. This is going to be funding for dams, funding for pipelines and funding for irrigation schemes—in direct contrast to Labor's previous approach to water which saw the previous minister, Senator Wong, spend $300 million buying back water, a part of which did not even exist.
          </p>
          <p>
           Under this government, we are seeing $571 million for the dairy industry support package and the $4 billion agricultural white paper. Under Minister Barnaby Joyce, we have seen real investment going out to the regions where it is needed, such as the $313.8 million on the Farm Co-operatives and Collaboration program and the $100 million on research and development—something that would never, ever have occurred to the Labor Party opposite. And we have seen the appointment of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
            ACCC
           </a>
           Agriculture Commissioner, putting a real focus right where it is needed—on agriculture.

              Again, unlike those opposite, and the comparison is stark, we have under the coalition government $50 billion being spent on infrastructure right across the country, specifically targeting regional Australia. We have seen $594 million under the Turnbull-Joyce government going to make sure we start the inland rail—something those opposite in the Labor Party were incapable of doing.

               They probably would not even know where it is! We have seen $560 million per year from 1920 for the Roads to Recovery program, for the Bridges Renewal program, for the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity program and for the road

                  The dollars we are investing in regional Australia are not just about dollars. This is about investing in regional Australia on an economic case because of what regional Australia contributes to the national economy. The economic benefits are significant. We are going to see improved productivity and efficiency. This coalition government is investing so significantly in the regions because the economic case is there to do so.

                  The Turnbull-Joyce government is also ensuring that it is looking after our communities by spending $300 million to address the issue of drugs, particularly ice, in our regional communities. That did not happen under the Labor government; that happened under this coalition government. Everybody around this country knows how our regional communities are being devastated. It took the coalition government to act and it took the coalition government to deliver.
