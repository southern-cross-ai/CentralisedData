        My question is to the minister representing the Minister for Health, Senator Gallagher. Why is the government creating uncertainty for people with serious medical conditions by refusing to confirm funding commitments? On 1 March 2022, now Minister Butler announced funding for the Patient Pathways telehealth nurse program from 1 July 2022 as an election commitment. He has now stated that funding for the program is still being finalised and will be delivered, if it is delivered, through the October budget, but is still subject to an independent evaluation. Why is the government now forcing the provider into a period of uncertainty?

         I'll have to take that question on notice. I understand the bits around going through the budget process, because those decisions are still underway. And as Senator Ruston, from sitting on the

           I rise on a point of relevance. I was actually asking the minister in relation to a commitment that had been promised on 1 July—why it was being considered in the budget in October when it actually had been committed to start on 1 July?

             Someone's trying to help me here. If it is relating to a previously funded commitment from the former government, we are also going through a process around that. Look, I think that in the interests of the chamber and giving accurate information, I'm not briefed on this matter and I would bring this information back to the senator following question time.

                     How is the government creating certainty for women escaping family, domestic and sexual violence by not honouring funding commitments? Funding was allocated in the budget for the Zahra Foundation for a national expansion of their successful confidential financial counselling support for victims-survivors of FDSV. Why is the government now proposing to review the budget funding provided for this critical support?

                      I completely reject the allegation that's implicit in the question—completely and totally. We are going through a process where we are assessing all financial expenditure through our

                      process. Again, that is good government and good governance, and we are being responsible with the nation's finances. If that means going through a process to assess and determine what should go ahead and what shouldn't, then we are doing that. But we'll be delivering on our election commitments and on our election policy in full. We will do what we said we would do. The Prime Minister has made that clear.
