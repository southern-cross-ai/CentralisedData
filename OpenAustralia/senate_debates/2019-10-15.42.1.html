        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Senator Birmingham. Can the minister please update the Senate on how a strong economy and strong budget will help Australia reduce waste, improve recycling and build our domestic recycling capacity in the future?

         I thank Senator Van for his question and his strong interest in recycling in particular and in practical environmental measures. The benefits of building a strong economy and being in a strong budget position is that governments are able to invest in practical things such as environmental protection and a cleaner environment. Doing so helps to underpin not only a better and cleaner environment but also a strong economy. The Morrison government believes that practical solutions such as reducing waste, increasing recycling rates and growing our domestic waste and recycling industry can deliver both a cleaner environment and a stronger economy. Indeed, evidence shows that reducing waste is not only good for the environment but good for the economy, with just over nine jobs created for every 10,000 tonnes of waste recycled.
        </p>
        <p>
         That's why we are leading a substantial investment in recycling and implementing a comprehensive $167 million Australian recycling investment plan. This includes $100 million through the Australian Recycling Investment Fund, delivered through the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, to support manufacturing of lower emissions in energy-efficient recycled-content products; $20 million through the Product Stewardship Investment Fund to accelerate work on industry-led recycling schemes, like batteries, electronic products, photovoltaic systems and plastic oil containers; $20 million through the Cooperative Research Centres Projects grant program to find new and innovative solutions to plastic recycling and waste; and of course continuing to work with state, territory and local governments on opportunities to get more recycled content into, particularly, road construction.
        </p>
        <p>
         At the recent
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
          COAG
         </a>
         meeting the Prime Minister secured agreement from state and territory leaders to establish a timetable to ban the export of waste that is unnecessary in areas such as plastic, paper, glass and tyres while building Australia's capacity to generate high-value recycled commodities and, importantly, onshore demand for that recycled content.

            . That's why we're supporting our Pacific neighbours to combat marine litter with the $16 million Pacific Ocean Litter Project. Earlier this month at the

              <p>
               Our government is showing clear leadership in this regard. Prime Minister Morrison demonstrates clear passion to reform Australia's recycling industry to deal with the issue of waste that is being exported, making sure that we create better scientific and economic plans not just in Australia but across our region. This will Australia's recycling capability and ensure we have cleaner beaches and oceans.
              </p>
              <p>
               In terms of other plans, we hear silence when it comes to these types of practical environmental initiatives. Those opposite often have lofty rhetoric when it comes to the environment but never deliver when it comes to practical policies or practical on-the-ground measures that can help households and businesses or, most importantly, set up economically viable, ongoing, resilient commercial industries to drive waste management and make sure we have greater recycling well into the future.
