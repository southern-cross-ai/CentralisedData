          I have an amendment to the government's amendment that has been circulated. I move the amendment to the amendment moved by Senator Ruston circulated in my name, which completely disagrees with the government's amendment:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Omit "not be referred to a committee", substitute "be referred immediately to the Education and Employment Legislation
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee" rel="nofollow">
           Committee
          </a>
          for inquiry and report by 1 May 2020"
         </p>
         <p>
          We do believe this is a fair request to put to the government. This is a highly contested bill. There were significant amendments made to the bill during the debate last year in this place. We think a quick committee inquiry into those changes and any further ones that are currently being negotiated, as we are aware through media reporting, should be explored by the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee prior to formal debate in this chamber. We would seek other senators' support for that amendment.
