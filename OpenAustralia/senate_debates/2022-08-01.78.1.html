        HUGHES () (): My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Gallagher. Labor's Powering Australia plan says, in black and white, that it will cut power bills for families and businesses by $275 a year, for homes, by 2025 compared to today. Will the Minister representing the Treasurer guarantee that Australian families and businesses will see a cut to power bills of $275 a year by 2025 compared to today?

         for the question. Again, they're leading with their chin on a matter around energy policy. The first question was on wages policy, the deliberate design feature of the economic architecture. The third one is on energy policy. How many was it? Twenty-two. And they didn't land one of them. Twenty-two in nine years, they didn't land one of them, and what have we got now? An energy crisis!

           A point of order: direct relevance. The question was around bills being cut to families and businesses, and a promise from Treasury that that would occur, not around climate policy. This was about cutting bills.

                   We will lower power prices by implementing the Powering Australia plan, which we took to the election, which was our one-and-only plan compared to their 22 plans that they didn't implement in nine years. We will take the plan—and the absolute gall of the opposition, when we know that the member for Hume, two days before the election was called, actually amended the industry code for electrical retailers, on 6 April, to delay the release of increases in the default market offer for

Not only did you not try to sweep it under, you amended the industry code so that people didn't know before the election. That's what you did. Now we will clean up this mess. We will implement powering Australia—

                          We will implement the Powering Australia plan. It will put more renewables into the grid; 82 per cent of the Powering Australia plan will be from renewable energy. It will put downward pressure on energy bills, on electricity bills. You guys weren't doing it because you didn't believe in renewables, right? You couldn't sign up to it. That is what will help put downward pressure on—
