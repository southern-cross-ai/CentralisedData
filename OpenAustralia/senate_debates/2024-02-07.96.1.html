        s,' and, 'This could have consequences for affordability and vehicle choice.' Minister, will you provide a clear guarantee to the Australian people that there will be no increase in the purchase price of any model of four-wheel drive, ute or SUV as a result of the government's new vehicle efficiency standard? Yes or no?

         . I can actually do better than that. I can do better than giving commitments from the Albanese government about this point. What I can do is point you to the remarks of Mr Fletcher, who was the Minister for Urban Infrastructure and Cities in May 2018, when the former government, momentarily, was going to introduce fuel efficiency standards. And what did he have to say about this? What Mr Fletcher, a member of the Liberal Party, a minister at the time, said was:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         So when fuel efficiency standards were introduced in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
          US
         </a>
         , the most popular models before introduction stayed the most popular models after introduction. Essentially, what Americans call pickup trucks and what we'd call utes, like the

           A point of order on relevance: the discussion paper released goes to cheaper cars. I am asking the government to back in Minister Bowen's claim around the costs of cars. Are they going to go up or down?

                 There is no evidence whatsoever, from international experiences, that prices of vehicles under a new fuel efficiency standard will increase in the way Senator
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKenzie" rel="nofollow">
                  McKenzie
                 </a>
                 suggests. Mr Fletcher made that point back in May 2018, when he said that, when America introduced fuel efficiency standards, 'There wasn't a material change in price and we don't expect that there would be a material change in price here.' But what we have, as expected, is the same old scare campaigns from the National Party. What we have is 'ending the weekend mark 2'. I notice that Senator McKenzie went awfully close to reinventing the weekend attack when she said on Sky News on 5 February that Australians want the work car to be their weekend car. They had to get the word 'weekend' in there somewhere, Pavlovian style. 'We're almost Scottish en masse where we don't want a work car and a separate weekend car. We like them to be together.' That's Senator McKenzie. Unfortunately for Senator McKenzie, Senator Sharma was on Sky News the same day, and we'll get to that shortly.

The government paid ACIL Allen almost $750,000 of taxpayers' money to undertake that modelling.

                             , order! Senator McKenzie, you rose on a point of order and then you went immediately to a debating point. I called you to order. You didn't come to order, and I repeatedly had to call you. That is disorderly. There is no point of order. The minister is being relevant.

                                 I would inform Senator McKenzie and all of her National Party colleagues who want to go on about ending weekends that there's another country not too far from here that is a little bit similar to Australia which likes its utes and pick-up trucks and likes driving long distances. It's called the United States of America. Do you know what? They've had fuel efficiency standards in place for 50 years. The last time I watched a movie set in America, there was a pick-up truck in that movie, because there are lots of pick-up trucks in America, despite their having fuel efficiency standards. That is exactly what will happen here at the same time as providing cost-of-living relief to Australians by reducing petrol prices. Why do you want regional Australians to keep paying more for their petrol rather than having what we are proposing now?
