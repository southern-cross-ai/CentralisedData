I always find that, when you ask a question on a policy in this place where your own government failed, you need to be very, very careful. I come from a party where we are very proud that individual members are able to represent and articulate their own views—unlike those on your side, where, if any one of you says what they really think, they get out. There is a former

        <p>
         In relation to 457 visas, let us put a few facts on the table first. Labor are very, very good at doing a lot of this, but, when you look behind everything they say at the actual facts, you will find time and time again that they are deliberately misleading and hoodwinking the Australian public.

           The point of order is relevance. It is a minute and five. I appreciate the minister always wants to talk about the Labor Party, but she was not asked about the Labor Party. She was asked about the comments of the member for Dawson, who said there was no need for the issuance of anymore 457 visas into the region. She was asked whether that was government policy.

             Again, I state: on this side of the chamber we allow our members to have their own views, and if they are inconsistent with government policy, that is what they are. The policy of the government is very clear: we believe that, where there is an Australian ready, willing and able to undertake work, that Australian should be employed. However, we also understand that a business that is unable to employ anybody closes down. So, if they need to access skilled foreign labour and they go through all of the hurdles that we put in place before they can get that labour and they satisfy those tests, to ensure that business is able to stay open and employ more Australians, we do not have a problem with that, because a business that has to close employs no-one.

                Again, I welcome Mr Christensen bringing it up in the joint party room, because I can tell you: we encourage rigorous debate in our joint party room, because we actually believe in freedom of speech on this side of the parliament. As I have said, on this side of the parliament we understand the priority must always be to Australian workers, but where you cannot find an Australian that is ready, willing and able to work and you go through all the hurdles that we put you through to ensure that you have tried to employ an Australian, you should be able to employ a foreign worker. But, if Senator Chisholm is advocating that there should be absolutely no foreign workers in Queensland, and if
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Christensen" rel="nofollow">
                 George Christensen
                </a>
                is advocating that as well, well I have to say it is not going to happen, because where there is a case for foreign labour, we support that, but on the basis that you have tried to employ an Australian first.

                   We believe that any Australian who is able to work should work, because we on this side of the chamber believe that the best form of welfare is a job. It is very different to your beliefs on your side of the chamber. We will do everything within our power to put in place policies that encourage Australians to work, because work gives you so many benefits other than just the ability to pay your bills. But, again, where you cannot get an Australian to undertake the job we are not going to stand by and watch businesses close down. Unfortunately, the closest those on the other side have ever come to a business is to close it down, and they are very proud of that fact. Again, a business that cannot access labour and closes down employs nobody.
