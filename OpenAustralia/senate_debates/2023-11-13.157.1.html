        Instead of cutting the record flood of overseas arrivals, the Albanese government is letting Australians suffer in a per capita recession and the worst decline in per capita income in all developed nations. According to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">
         Reserve Bank
        </a>
        and Bureau of Statistics June quarter data, Australian residents' spending fell, with the overall total spending driven positive due only to increased demand from tourists and international students. The government is running Australia's economy like a ponzi scheme, relying on a flood of overseas arrivals to prop up

        numbers. Meanwhile, for the typical Australian, life continues to get worse.
       </p>
       <p>
        Excluding tourists and short-stay visas, there are 2.3 million visa holders in the country likely to need a home right now. In one year, the Albanese Labor government issued a record 687,000 student visas—687,000! We only have 100,000 dedicated student accommodation beds. Yet Treasurer Jim Chalmers went on national

        and deceitfully told the Australian people the level of net overseas migration is 'not something the government determines'—blatant misinformation. It's no wonder the government have exempted themselves from their proposed misinformation and disinformation bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government claim their housing bill will fix everything. What they don't tell Australia is that we are short hundreds of thousands of homes yet their bill will only build a maximum of 6,000 homes a year. Any Australian who can't afford a house or who can't afford rent—if they can find a rental—knows Treasurer Chalmers lied when he said the government doesn't control how many people come into Australia. The Labor government is letting overseas arrivals—

          I withdraw that word and substitute 'misinformation'. The Labor government are letting overseas arrivals run out of control and don't even know how many will arrive this year. The government are making a deliberate choice to let Australians suffer so that their big business mates and the banks can profit from a cheap workforce and high property prices. We need to stop this crushing flood of overseas arrivals that are here purely to hide a per capita recession. Our first duty is to take care of people who are here already.
