         ’s role in improving access to health services for people in rural and remote communities
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Commonwealth Government recognises the health care needs of people living in rural and remote areas and is committed to developing flexible, long-term solutions to providing services for all communities and to supporting local solutions, developed in consultation with local communities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Over seven million people, or 32% of Australians, live outside major cities.  People living in rural and remote areas of Australia face difficulties in accessing the full range of medical and specialist services.  Difficulties in access to treatment can be attributed to factors such as geographical isolation, a relative shortage of health care providers, sparse health infrastructure, and a higher proportion of disadvantaged groups such as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
         Indigenous Australians
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The health status of Australians in rural and remote areas is generally considered to be poorer than that of other Australians. Rural Australians have a shorter life expectancy, higher death rates and are more likely to have a disability compared to city dwellers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Commonwealth Government is seeking to address the imbalance in access to health services for people in regional, rural and remote areas.  Targeted rural health expenditure supports programs aimed at increasing the rural health workforce, improving health infrastructure and improving access to, and sustainability of, health services.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        has also supported innovative health care solutions such as the development of Multipurpose Services and e-health solutions for rural and remote areas.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In 2009-10, the Government is investing more than $700 million in targeted rural health programs.  This is in addition to support provided through the Medicare Benefits Schedule (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MBS" rel="nofollow">
         MBS

        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government understands that an important element of health care for people living in rural and remote areas can be access to suitable transport for patients who are required to travel to receive essential medical and specialist services.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A range of factors determines the extent of community need for PATS, including the type of care required, the availability of services locally, and the capacity of the patient to meet costs. Because of regional disparities in access to health services, people living in rural and remote areas are more likely to need to travel to receive services.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Commonwealth Government makes a significant contribution to supporting access to health services so that patients’ needs to travel are minimised.  However, the states and territories currently have obligations under the new National Healthcare Agreement to provide
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        free public hospital services for all Australians, based on clinical need, irrespective of their geographic location.  Where hospital and other facilities are not located within a reasonable distance to rural and remote communities, patients may need to travel to access care appropriate to their clinical need.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        All states and territories have a travel assistance scheme for patients requiring specialised care not available within a specified distance from where they live
        <sup>

        </sup>
        .  However, while the state and territory governments have been responsible for managing their respective Patient Assisted Travel Schemes since 1 January 1987, the Commonwealth Government remains committed to working with state and territory governments to improve the system.

       <p class="italic">
        While there are some specific responses to the recommendations in the Senate Community Affairs Committee report, Highway to Health: Better Access for Rural, Regional and Remote Patients which follow, the Commonwealth Government is considering the issues raised by the Report through the various reform and collaborative processes outlined in this response.

       <p class="italic">
        In December 2007, the Prime Minister announced an audit of rural and regional health workforce shortages.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Audit" rel="nofollow">
         The Audit
        </a>
        of Health Workforce in Rural and Regional Australia, which was released on 30 April 2008, found that:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         the supply of health professionals is not sufficient to meet current needs;
        </li>
        <li>
         the supply of health professionals in many rural and regional areas is low to very poor; and
        </li>
        <li>
         there has been a reliance on 17-year old population figures in developing incentives for doctors and other rural workforce policies.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        In response to the audit, the Minister for Health and Ageing announced that the Government would establish an Office of Rural Health within the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health_and_Ageing" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Health and Ageing
        </a>
        to provide a focus for the reform of Commonwealth funded rural health policies and programs.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Office of Rural Health was established on 1 July 2008.  The Office draws together rural health service delivery, rural health policy and rural workforce distribution programs.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As a first priority, the Office of Rural Health was tasked to review all targeted Commonwealth funded rural health programs as well as the classification systems that determine eligibility for rural health program funding.  The purpose of the reviews was to ensure that incentives and rural health policies respond to current population figures and areas of need, and that programs which support rural health professionals target those communities in most need of assistance.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The reviews are now completed and outcomes include a significant new investment in rural health workforce and service delivery programs in the 2009-10 Federal Budget totalling $206.3 million (over four years).  This is in addition to existing funding for these programs of $843.4 million over four years.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Included in the Budget package is the “Rural Health Reform – Supporting Communities with Workforce Shortages measure”, which provides additional funding of $134.4 million over four years, in addition to $379.8 million already committed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This package specifically addresses the need to attract and retain doctors to rural practice and provides increased financial and non-financial incentives to support new and existing doctors.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Further, the package recognises that doctor shortages are particularly acute in the more remote areas and incentives have been geared (scaled), with increased benefits for practice in more remote areas.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Another important outcome of the rural reviews was the decision to progressively introduce, from July 2009, the Australian Standard Geographical Classification System (ASGC) Remoteness Areas (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RA" rel="nofollow">
         RA
        </a>
        ) to replace the Rural, Remote and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Areas" rel="nofollow">
         Metropolitan Areas
        </a>
        (RRMA) classification and other geographic classification systems used by rural health programs that were subject to the reviews.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        ASGC-RA, developed by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Bureau_of_Statistics" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Bureau of Statistics
        </a>
        , uses 2006 Census data and is widely used by Commonwealth and state agencies.  Using ASGC-RA will help to ensure that rural health workforce incentives are targeted to areas of need – ‘the more remote you go, the greater the reward’ – and that rural health programs are targeted to where funding is most needed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Finally, the review of rural health programs identified over 60 programs with significant rural health components, over 40 of which could be considered to be targeted rural health programs.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Most of these programs have been developed over time in response to different policy priorities and as such, there was significant overlap and duplication between programs.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In response, the Government has agreed to a new rural health program structure, comprising five major program streams and ten sub-programs. Through this consolidation exercise, it has been possible to reduce the number of targeted rural health programs by over 40 per cent.  As such, the burden of reporting for funded organisations will be reduced and access to services and programs will be enhanced for communities and health professionals.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In implementing the measures outlined above, the Department will be mindful of the outcomes of reviews taking place as part of the broader national health reform agenda, including the National Primary Health Care Strategy, the National Preventative Health Strategy, the Maternity Services Plan and the work of the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Commonwealth contribution to National Partnership funding includes: $1.75 billion for Hospitals and Health Workforce Reform; $872 million over the six years to 2014-15 to reform Australia’s efforts in preventing lifestyle risks associated with chronic disease; $805.5 million to close the gap in health outcomes between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians; $750 million to reduce pressure on emergency departments; and $108.9 million for the National E-Health Transition Authority.

       <ul>
        <li>
         regional integration;
        </li>
        <li>
         information and technology, including e-Health;
        </li>
        <li>
         skilled workforce;
        </li>
        <li>
         infrastructure; and
        </li>
        <li>
         financing and system performance.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Drawing from these building blocks are four priority directions for change:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Key Priority Area 1:  Improving Access and Reducing Inequity;
        </li>
        <li>
         Key Priority Area 2:  Better Management of Chronic Condition;
        </li>
        <li>
         Key Priority Area 3:  Increasing the Focus on Prevention; and
        </li>
        <li>
         Key Priority Area 4:  Improving Quality, Safety, Performance and Accountability.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        The Draft Strategy is accompanied by a Report, Primary Health Care Reform in Australia, which provides detailed information about the issues that emerged during the stakeholder consultation process and sets out the broader context in which primary health care in Australia operates and has developed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Draft Strategy focuses on what the Government can do to improve the frontline health care that Australians depend on, and provides a draft road map to guide future policy and practice in primary health care in Australia.

        The Minister for Health and Ageing, the Hon Nicola Roxon MP, and the Chair of the National Preventative Health Taskforce, Professor Rob Moodie, launched the National Preventative Health Strategy on 1 September 2009.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Strategy seeks to curb lifestyle related risk factors driving the growth in preventable chronic disease and specifically targets obesity, tobacco and the excessive consumption of alcohol.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The risk factors for chronic disease are particularly prevalent in rural and remote Australia, due in part to the relatively higher proportion of Indigenous people living in these communities.  The Strategy includes improving the health of rural and remote Australians and closing the life expectancy gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians as key targets.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government will consider on merit the recommendations made in the Strategy in conjunction with the findings of the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission’s report and the draft National Primary Health Care Strategy.

       <p class="italic">
        Amongst the measures, the package includes Medicare Benefits Schedule subsidised services and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme subsidised medicines provided or prescribed by appropriately qualified and experienced midwives working in a collaborative model of care.  It will also deliver more services for rural and remote communities through an expansion of the successful Medical Specialist Outreach Assistance Program and extra scholarships for GPs and midwives, particularly in rural and remote Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The package is the first step towards meeting the Government’s commitment to develop a National Maternity Services Plan to ensure the coordination of maternity services across Australia.

       <p class="italic">
        The new Medicare arrangements will be subject to agreement with states and territories on the Plan – states and territories will be asked to make complementary commitments and investments, particularly around the provision of birthing centres and rural maternity units.
