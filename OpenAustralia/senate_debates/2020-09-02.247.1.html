        This amendment seeks to delay the commencement of the bill until 1 December 2020. Currently the bill has different commencement dates for different provisions. The amendment will allow for a simplified starting date for the entire bill. Delaying the start date until 1 December will allow the

        and the parties to familiarise themselves with the new regime and ensure that they have their compliance systems in place. In addition, there are state jurisdictions that are currently undergoing state or local government elections. It's always important to ensure that electoral changes do not confuse voters or entities. As such, a starting date later in the year lessens the risk of confusion.

         The government supports those amendments. The intention was never to have any impact on the conduct of state elections in Queensland or anywhere else. This is about keeping arrangements for federal elections and state elections appropriately separate. From that point of view, the government is comfortable supporting the amendment.

          [by video link] I rise to make some brief remarks about the amendments moved by Senator Farrell. Given we think the bill itself is bad, we don't oppose delaying its commencement so we, too, will support the amendments.

            The effect of these amendments would be to reduce the federal disclosure threshold of political donations down to $1,000. It was originally $13,500 but it's indexed, so at the moment you can donate just shy of $14,300 to a federal political party for a federal purpose and you don't need to tell anybody about it; it's absolutely opaque. Donations just shy of the disclosure threshold are routinely made, and the public doesn't have the ability to hear about them. This amendment would repeat many amendments over the years that many experts and, in fact, other political parties have moved to reduce that threshold of disclosure down to $1,000.
           </p>
           <p>
            The public should know who is donating to political parties. Political parties should own up to who is paying for their re-election campaigns. This is a very straightforward transparency and accountability measure. The federal disclosure threshold has been too high since the days when
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
             John Howard
            </a>
            was Prime Minister and it is about time it was dropped back down to a level where the public knows who is paying for who.
           </p>
           <p>
            In Queensland, my home state, we have a disclosure threshold under our state laws of $1,000. That has not proved onerous from an administrative perspective to comply with, and we don't think there's any justification for retaining that significantly too-high disclosure threshold that the federal laws enshrine. These amendments would reduce that threshold down to $1,000.
           </p>
           <p>
            I thank the crossbench in advance who've let me know that they will be supporting this amendment. I haven't heard back from Labor, but of course they've got their own private member's bill to this effect and they had a second reading amendment as well—a bit of a departure there if they didn't vote for this. I'm hopeful that we will see this amendment pass shortly.

             The government will oppose this amendment. It will reduce the disclosure threshold from $14,300 to $1,000. It would also abolish indexation of the disclosure threshold, which would effectively mean that the threshold would shrink in real terms over time due to inflation.

                 I'm not talking to the point of order; I'm just talking to the issue and to all of the amendments in front of us as I've done in previous debates and as is widely practised.

                 amendment will mean more red tape for individual Australians who would like to participate in the democratic processes, including by making financial contributions to their party of choice or the member or candidate that they would like to support. It would deter political participation and, even worse, this badly drafted amendment would reclassify numerous very small organisations as third-party campaigners if they spent more than $1,000 in a year on electoral expenses. This change would drag numerous not-for-profit and charitable organisations under the reporting rules for third party. This could sweep up tiny groups like neighbourhood associations,

                 </a>
                 branches, footy clubs and other small players who comment favourably or critically on federal politics. This would be the effect of the amendment because, under the Electoral Act, if someone spends more than the disclosure threshold they get categorised as a third party and face more burdensome reporting and disclosure obligations—namely, they have to make annual returns and appear on the Transparency Register.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The current threshold of $14,300 is set at the appropriate level to balance facilitating political participation while also facilitating and ensuring appropriate levels of openness and transparency. But $1,000 clearly is not.
                </p>
                <p>
                 This extreme change proposed by the Greens in the reporting arrangements has not been discussed with the charitable or not-for-profit sector as far as we are aware. The bad drafting of these amendments may be unintentional, but the Greens made exactly the same drafting error when they moved similar amendments back in 2013. I pointed out those errors then, but here we are again with the same, obviously, very badly drafted amendments in the same form.

                  I'd like to make one comment by way of clarification to the leader of the Greens. To the best of my knowledge and to the best of the knowledge of my office, we've not actually received your amendments in a way where you have requested a response. I make this offer to Senator Waters that, if you choose to send us your amendments, we are very happy at all times to respond.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  As you'd be aware, Labor already has a bill before the Senate that seeks to achieve the changes proposed by this amendment but we don't support this amendment being made as part of this particular package. Based on our consultation on the not-for-profit sector with the charities, following the implementation of the ban on foreign donations, we understand that, although we would like to see this change as soon as possible, non-political entities who engage in the creation of electoral matters require further consultation and communication and time to adapt their systems. This is something that they stressed very strongly to us when we fought successfully to establish the ban on foreign donations, and it would be remiss of this parliament not to listen to the concerns of those stakeholders.

                   Minister, I've got just a couple of questions in relation to this. You talked about the burden this places on people who wish to make a donation. Can you articulate exactly what that burden is for someone who wants to make a donation that is below the threshold and how that might deter people from making a donation?

                     So, Minister, I'm putting to you that the burden is not significant in a balance of effort required versus the public interest in the disclosure. Senator Waters indicated that in Tasmania, for example, this is not a problem. Has the government looked at other jurisdictions to see exactly how any such burden would affect people who want to donate to a political party?

                     <p>
                      Well, I've got to strongly disagree with you, Senator Patrick, and this is not just a theoretical disagreement; this is a very practical disagreement. Much larger not-for-profit organisations that were getting captured by the initial draft of the ban on foreign political donations and the increased disclosure reporting requirements were very concerned about the level of red tape it would impose on them. The level of red tape on smaller not-for-profits that would inevitably be captured through this Greens amendment would be entirely disproportionate and would not be appropriately balanced. We are absolutely in favour of appropriate balancing facilitating political participation by all while also of course pursuing the public interest in disclosure. But we believe the current arrangements appropriately balance those requirements and what is in front of us does not.

                       So, say, I'm in a position to make a donation of $2,000 to a political party, how would the burden differ between someone who was making a $2,000 donation and someone who was making a $15,000 donation? I note that it might simply be an individual. I'm just trying to understand what pushes someone across a line in terms of not making a donation.

                        Obviously businesses that are making larger donations are likely to be larger organisations that have the capacity to comply with annual return and other requirements, whereas if you are a small volunteer not-for-profit or if you are a smaller organisation that doesn't have the same resources to deal with all the additional reporting requirements that would come with getting captured by this then that would make it disproportionate. That is certainly the feedback we've had from not-for-profits. In the end, nobody's arguing against the need for disclosure. It's just about making sure we capture disclosure in reporting requirements with organisations of an appropriate size and with donations of an appropriate size.

                         I want to speak to Labor's comments about having a private member's bill that seeks to do the same thing and therefore not wanting to support this particular bill. I think everyone who's listening needs to understand that private member's bills rarely get up. They're used to put pressure on governments to do particular things, to enable debate or to enable committee work in relation to particular policies or laws. No-one should pretend that when a bill that comes through the Senate that is a government bill and that will eventually go back to the House, if it is amended here, and be passed into law it will be ignored because you have a private member's bill up. It seems to be disingenuous to make a statement that you are in support of this but you want to have it up in your own private member's bill. That's the method by which you wish to seek the change. Labor has an opportunity here to implement something that it purportedly agrees with but is simply not prepared to back. I think people should at least appreciate that.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         I'd also like to go back to a discussion that I was having with Senator Cormann prior in relation to this bill. I did ask Senator Cormann a whole range of questions about his personal circumstance in terms of dinners that he might have attended and so forth. I want to make it very clear to the chamber that I was not directing that at Senator Cormann in any other way than in acknowledgement of the fact that Senator Cormann is not in a position to answer this question for other ministers. I am of the understanding that all ministers do it. I was simply restricting my questions to the minister at the table in appreciation of the fact that he has knowledge of his own affairs. I wasn't suggesting or in any way seeking to single him out.

                          [by video link] I'll address a number of the issues that have been raised in the last little while. The amendments were circulated last night, and I would hope folks have taken the opportunity to read the amendments that the chamber is now debating, so I was a bit confused by Senator Farrell's remark there. I take issue with what Senator Cormann said; the intention of these amendments is to lower the disclosure threshold so that members of the public can see who is donating to political parties. There is no other intention but that. I might point out that the drafting in these amendments mirror the drafting, I'm told, of Labor's own private member's bill which seeks to do the same thing. So I wasn't quite clear from Senator Farrell's contribution as to whether or not his party will be voting for the amendments that they have their own legislation for in exactly the same drafting format or not, but we'll find out in just a minute. I wanted to disabuse anyone who might be listening because they haven't got anything better to do at this time of night that the intention of these amendments is simply to improve transparency and to ensure that people know who's donating to political parties, as I believe is their right to know.

                            Senator Cormann will be pleased to know that these amendments are the ones about indexation, so he can give us the spiel about how that's so very bad, which we all can't wait to hear. These amendments would remove indexation of the federal disclosure threshold. It started off at $13,200 and it's just progressively increased over the years. It's now up to $14,300. It makes a mockery of having a disclosure threshold. These amendments would say that you can't index the disclosure threshold. I commend them to the chamber.

                              should not be a slippery slope towards voter ID at the polls. In dissenting reports to the 2016 JSCEM election review, both my party and the Labor Party noted that the government's claims of double voting and voter irregularity were actually not substantiated and were unsupported by the evidence. In Australia and internationally, the evidence supports the view that voter ID in fact suppresses and hinders citizen participation.

                             <p>
                              There's something a little bit odd in making voting compulsory and then fining people who don't vote but, at the same time, making it harder for them to vote. So we support making the questions used to establish a voter's identification more flexible, and this would assist migrants or people with low literacy. Our amendments simply seek to ensure that this flexibility is not used to introduce the government's long-coveted plan for voter ID—I refer to the remarks made earlier today about the excitement that the government showed when they thought that they might get support for bringing voter ID in down the track. This parliament should not take any step that would have the effect of reducing the number of Australians participating in our democracy. I commend these amendments to the chamber.

                               requirements to ensure the integrity of the voting process when there are about 20 jurisdictions in the world that have got compulsory voting—including the jurisdiction in which I was born, where I grew up and first exercised my right to vote. And, let me tell you, we had to show our identification card before we were able to vote, and that was not in any way problematic. The government, of course, is on the record as saying that we support voter identification as a way to manage the risk of multiple voting, which I have absolutely no doubt has occurred over the years and throughout history.

                               Having said all of that, this bill actually doesn't come anywhere near, in any way, shape or form, introducing voter ID requirements; in fact, the bill does the opposite. This bill allows greater flexibility for polling officials about how they can word the three mandatory questions before they hand out a ballot paper. This is intended to particularly help the

                               communicate with voters who face language barriers or disability issues. The three questions are about name, address and whether someone has voted previously in the same election—reasonable questions, I would have thought. Nowhere in the bill is there any new fourth question permitting an official to ask a voter for ID documents.

The amendment is based on a totally factually incorrect reading of the bill and an incorrect understanding of the Electoral Act. The amendment is partly predicated on an assumption that the AEC will do a poor job of training its staff, including senior officers, at each booth. We think it is not required and the government will oppose this amendment.

                                   The government oppose these amendments. The government amendments comprehensively and fairly deal with the interactions between Commonwealth, state and territory laws. These amendments would remove those changes from the bill, allowing state and territory laws to apply to federal donations at the same time as Commonwealth laws applied, hence defeating the entire purpose of the legislation in front of the Senate. If the government's amendments had not been made there would be ambiguity for regulated entities. Duplication of laws in relation to the same financial transactions would be unnecessary where a donation was spent on federal electoral purposes only, so a double-up of legal obligations would cause confusion and uncertainty. Uncertainty would continue to mean a dispute over the correct legal treatment would be taken to the courts. This has already happened once. It would mean different people complying with different laws during the same federal election, based on which corner of the country they resided in. It would mean complexity when the

                                    Labor welcome the debate on Senator Lambie's amendments. We've been talking to her since 8.30 this morning about some of these issues. We particularly welcome the senator's commitment to improving transparency and the integrity of the Commonwealth donations regime. However, we won't be voting for the amendments as we are of the firm view that the Commonwealth parliament should be able to make laws in relation to the conduct of Commonwealth elections without those laws being overridden by the states. If sections 302CA and 314B are repealed then it leaves open the potential for foreign donations to be funnelled through state branches and to avoid the Commonwealth ban on donations from foreign actors. Further, it will mean that there will be no uniformity in the treatment of federal parties and candidates. Rather, they will be governed by the laws of eight different states and territories. This is not a position we can accept.

                                    What we must strive towards is a better Commonwealth funding and disclosure regime. Labor's bill currently before the Senate, which would lower the donations threshold from $14,300 indexed to inflation to a fixed $1,000, and the introduction of a system of real-time disclosure would immediately provide greater transparency of those who are seeking to influence our elections. Further proposed reforms of donations and expenditure caps, increasing the rate of public funding and introducing administrative funding for parties and elected Independents would reduce parties' reliance on donations and improve the integrity of the system. Labor will continue to pursue these reforms and we look forward to working with Senator Lambie to achieve them.

                                        The TEMPORARY CHAIR: That is correct.

                                       <p>
                                        It's a bit different when you're not there in person; I apologise. Essentially, my understanding of the effect of these amendments is that they would close the back door that the government are, in my view—a view they don't share—seeking to establish. It is a back door enabling them to continue to donate to state parties, albeit into a separate bank account, from donors that would be prohibited from donating to that state party were they operating under state laws. It all gets a little bit meta, but I made some remarks earlier today about my concern that there is a very cosy relationship between donors that will not be stopped from donating to state parties.

                                        What I want to put to the chamber are some excellent remarks that were made on this very point by, of all people, the

                                        in their submission to the JSCEM inquiry. They put it in a more cogent way than I have. You can't win them all! They say:

                                       <p class="italic">
                                        Simply asserting a donation is for federal purposes does not insulate a state party, or the state candidates it endorses, from corruption risks.

                                       <p>
                                        The point they're making is, where you've got federated parties and you've got state organisations like, I believe, the
                                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
                                         LNP

                                        , which organises themselves in Queensland, a property developer will be able to donate to the state LNP; it just goes to a separate bank account, and that's permissible even though that same donor is not allowed to donate to that same party if we are in a state context. It's an artificial distinction, and our view is that the creation of this separate bank account does not properly insulate the cosiness and the sense of obligation, if you like, from the state party back to that donor. That is exactly why we want to clean up donations. That is why, when we come to the remaining Greens amendments, we will move to ban donations from people like property developers, big mining, big pharma and a number of others that I will regale you all with when the time comes. We don't think you can insulate a political party from that influence—particularly not where you've got a federated structure like we now know that the LNP does. So that is why we will be supporting these amendments. Senator Lambie's very welcome to correct me if I'm mistaken about the effect of her amendments, but that is my understanding of the effect of her amendments, and we, on that basis, support them.

                                          This amendment does a whole series of things, some of which might be worthy of exploration but others which are problematic. We are not in a position to support these amendments. Senator Lambie is proposing to require parties to establish an electoral expenditure account. We have sympathy for this, but we have already achieved this through the government's amendments to our own bill in response to a JSCEM recommendation. We do not support the proposition that we should provide for anonymous gifts of up to $500 at events per person per event. This could be criticised for creating a new loophole, I would have thought, and is inconsistent with the threshold that applies in the context of the ban on foreign political donations. So we think that the issues that Senator Lambie raises through this amendment should be pursued through the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in the first instance.

Senator Lambie is an experienced campaigner for transparency reforms, and Labor are open to work with her to ensure reforms can be achieved in the appropriate way. In addition, this amendment seeks an alternative disclosure threshold of $2,500—more than double the threshold that Labor has sought to achieve through our private senator's legislation.

                                            will be supporting this amendment which has a series of features within it. It lowers the disclosure threshold, which we support, as we've discussed already on this bill. It doesn't lower it quite as low as the Greens moved for. We wanted the threshold at $1,000, and my understanding is that this amendment would impose a threshold of disclosure of $2,500, but that's a damn sight less than $14,300. I understand that this now also has some changes to the time frame for disclosure. As I said earlier today, at the minute you need to disclose only once a year, on 1 February, and because of the time lag between calendar years and financial years it can be up to 19 months before it's put in the public domain as to which donor donated to which political party. That is so far beneath what is a transparent and accountable approach to disclosure. The Greens would like to see as close to real-time disclosure as possible, and I understand that the Labor Party's view is that they want a seven-day disclosure period. These amendments would have, on my reading of them, a six-month disclosure time frame—which, again, is not quite as rigorous as the Greens would like, but it is still better than the current rules. So, on that basis, we support that element, because it's an improvement.

                                           <p>
                                            I understand that there are also some provisions in this amendment that go to anonymous donations. They've long been discussed, because it's a balance between the administrative burden we place on donors and political parties and the need for the public to know who's paying whom. There have long been recommendations for a cap of between $50 and $500 on anonymous donations. And when I say 'anonymous', the example often used is buying a raffle ticket at a party function, so it's not anything that's necessarily nefarious, as 'anonymous' might imply; it's merely those smaller amounts of casual support that many people express and that aren't of a significant amount that would exert an undue influence.

                                           <p>
                                            Again, my understanding of these amendments is that they lower that threshold to $500. The Greens would like to see it lower than that. We've pegged it at $50 but, on the basis that this proposed threshold is at least an improvement on our current laws, we will be supporting that as well. So I again confirm that the Greens will be supporting these amendments.
