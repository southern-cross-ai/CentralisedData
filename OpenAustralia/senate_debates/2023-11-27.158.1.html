        Her Majesty made 16 visits to Australia between 1954 and 2011.

        Never has Australia had a sovereign with such a strong connection to our nation upon Coronation.

       <p class="italic">
        The Crown References Amendment Bill seeks to update references to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in various acts of legislation to reflect the accession of the new Sovereign.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Just as our nation marked the Coronation on 7 May 2023 with a National 21 Gun Salute by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia's_Federation_Guard" rel="nofollow">
         Australia's Federation Guard
        </a>
        on the forecourt of Parliament House.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Parliament now recognises and congratulates King Charles III with this Bill.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        King Charles III has clearly stated his service to the people of the realms including Australia when he said on 9 September 2022:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         "Whatever may be your background or beliefs, I shall endeavour to serve you with loyalty, respect and love, as I have throughout my life."
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill will recognise the Crown as is appropriate and in terms similar to other Commonwealth laws.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There are many examples of office-holders being referenced by office in Commonwealth laws.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Governor" rel="nofollow">
         The Governor
        </a>
        -General is simply referred to as the "Governor-General" in Chapter two of the Constitution.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Similarly, when we refer to Ministers, parliamentarians, and statutory office-holders, we honour the title of the office holder.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The
        <i>

       <p class="italic">
        The
        <i>
         Future Fund Act 2006

        establishes the office of the Chair of the Future Fund Board of Guardians.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As noted in the explanatory memorandum for the
        <i>
         Statute Law Revision Bill (No. 2) 2006
        </i>
        , circulated by the authority of the then Attorney-General Philip Ruddock MP:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        "
        <i>
         It has been Commonwealth drafting practice since the early 1980's for statutory provisions to be drafted so as to avoid the use of gender-specific language
        </i>
        ."
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill ensures consistency of references to the Sovereign across Australia's legislative framework.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill avoids the need for future amendments to legislation should a future Queen ascend the throne, and uses clarifying language that reflects Commonwealth practice.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This approach is consistent with the previous government's
        <i>
         Succession to the Crown Act 2015
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That Bill gave effect to the then government's commitment to change the rules on succession to, and possession of, the Crown.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This followed the agreement made during the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Perth on 28 October 2011, between the United Kingdom and other
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Realms" rel="nofollow">
         Commonwealth Realms
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It changed the law relating to the effect of gender and marriage on Royal succession.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Ending the system of male preference so that the order of succession is to be determined simply by order of birth.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill also introduces a new definition of "
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_Counsel" rel="nofollow">
         Senior Counsel
        </a>
        " into the
        <i>
         Acts Interpretation Act 1901
        </i>
        , amending references to "
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Counsel" rel="nofollow">
         Queen's Counsel
        </a>
        " and "
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_Counsel" rel="nofollow">
         King's Counsel
        </a>
        " in various acts of legislation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The purpose of this amendment is to remove any confusion where Commonwealth Acts and instruments make reference to "Queen's Counsel", "King's Counsel" or "Senior Counsel".
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This change reflects current practice at the Commonwealth level where a Senior Counsel is considered equal in status to King's Counsel (formerly Queen's Counsel).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This change will also reflect current practice in the legal community.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill would only amend primary legislation, with Ministers expected to amend subordinate legislation within their own portfolios to reflect these changes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        With the coronation of His Majesty King Charles III, this Bill brings an opportunity to introduce important updates to references throughout the Australian legislative framework.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These changes reflect the end of the second
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabethan_Age" rel="nofollow">
         Elizabethan Age
        </a>
        and the beginning of a new age.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A future which we as a nation will now share with our new King.
