        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Conroy. I refer the minister to a recent
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Australia_Bank" rel="nofollow">
         National Australia Bank
        </a>
        monthly business survey released that showed that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        has the worst business conditions in Australia. Given this government's flippant attitude towards the small business ministry—having five ministers since 2011, the most recent appointed this week—how does this government expect small business to survive, let alone thrive, given this level of delinquency?

         economy. Absolutely typical—because, unlike the opposition, the Gillard government has always had the best interests of South Australians in mind. In the infrastructure field all up we are providing an unprecedented $2.7 billion from our six-year Nation Building Program to rebuild and renew the state's road, rail and public transport infrastructure. Already federal Labor has more than doubled annual infrastructure spending from $109 to $272 per South Australian. On submarines, the federal government is committed to building 12 future submarines, which will be assembled in Adelaide. This is the biggest defence project Australia has ever undertaken. It means work for numerous Australian companies and for thousands of Australian workers, including boilermakers, welders, electricians, naval architects, engineers and many, many more. In the auto industry in March, the government has agreed to a $215 million co-investment deal with

           Mr President

           SA
          </a>

          believe that poor economic management by the Gillard government will be a major constraint on business in 2013. Why doesn't the government believe small businesses deserve the undivided attention of a minister solely focused on the engine room of this economy?

             South Australia

            was entitled to expect the undivided attention of a single minister—the senator having pointed out in his primary question that there have been five changes in that portfolio since 2011. The supplementary question is much narrower and more specific than the primary question. It asks only whether or not small business in South Australia is entitled to expect the undivided attention of a single minister. The minister has not addressed that issue at all.

                 is a matter of some interest, but they should listen to the facts. What small business in South Australia, and small business all around Australia, has been focused on is that the government has increased the small business instant asset write-off threshold to $6,500. Those opposite voted against it. Small business has the undivided attention of this government.

                  , I have a further supplementary question. Given that the government has introduced almost 21,000 new regulations since 2007 and the instability of a revolving door of ministers, will the minister now concede that the reason small businesses are struggling is because they have little faith in a government that burdens them with higher costs, higher taxes and more red tape?

                   What is a burden on small business is when those opposite vote against an instant asset write-off threshold increase. That is a burden on small business. What is a burden on small business is living in the state of Victoria where the Victorian coalition government have ground the economy to a standstill. What is a burden on small business in this country—
