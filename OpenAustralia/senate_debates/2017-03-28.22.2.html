           I thank Senator O'Sullivan for his question. Indeed, our thoughts are with the people and communities of

           at this very dangerous time. As Tropical Cyclone Debbie makes landfall in north-eastern Queensland, our ADF—its highly trained personnel, its equipment and their experience—are ready to assist those who are affected. The ADF has pre-positioned its humanitarian assistance and disaster relief assets to provide immediate assistance to local communities who may be affected. We are working closely with the Queensland government and
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Management_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            Emergency Management Australia
           </a>
           . The ADF has established a joint task force to provide support for the region. This task force is largely made up of personnel from the Townsville based 3rd Brigade. We are also sending additional assets to Queensland in preparation.

           At the request of Premier Palaszczuk, the Turnbull government has agreed that Brigadier Chris Field, currently the commander of 3rd Brigade in Townsville, will act as the recovery coordinator for Tropical Cyclone Debbie. As the

           personnel available to help Queenslanders in their hour of need.
          </p>
          <p>
           This is a very pressing task for the ADF. We hope that the emergency is not as considerable as predicted—of course we do—but we will be there with the people of Queensland is required.

That is why she is now sailing towards Queensland to assist those impacted by this significant cyclonic event.
