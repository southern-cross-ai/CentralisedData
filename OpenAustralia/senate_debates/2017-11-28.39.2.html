        My question is to the Minister for Communications, Senator Fifield. Yesterday,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        Co announced an immediate halt in the rollout of its second-rate
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HFC" rel="nofollow">
         HFC
        </a>
        cable because it's unable to deliver a reliable, quality service. When did the minister first become aware that NBN was preparing to halt the HFC rollout? When did the minister inform Mr Turnbull of the delays? And why was this kept secret until yesterday?

         I thank the senator for her question.

         advised me on Wednesday the 22nd that they were looking to have a pause. As you'd be aware, Senator, section 91 of the Public Governance, Performance and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability_Act" rel="nofollow">
          Accountability Act
         </a>
         states that the directors of a wholly-owned Commonwealth company must give the responsible minister reasonable notice if the directors become aware of any significant issue that may affect the company or any of its subsidiaries. Such requirements were put in place to ensure that shareholder ministers and their departments have adequate notice to assess the implications of issues raised by a government business enterprise. As colleagues are aware, NBN made an announcement yesterday.

               I note that the minister didn't answer the question relating to when he advised Mr Turnbull of the delays. In May, the

                NBN
               </a>
               Co confirmed that a seven-month delay to the activation of three million

                HFC

               premises would add $1 billion to NBN funding requirements. What impact will these most recent delays have on the NBN funding requirements?

As I mentioned, the section 91 notice is intended to give the opportunity to shareholder ministers to ask questions.

                       Thank you, Senator Macdonald. I can rule on this. There was noise coming from multiple places around the chamber. I will again remind senators that at virtually every question time I've been in this chair we've had requests, particularly from the end of the chamber, for senators to be able to hear both questions and answers. I will ask all senators to respect their colleagues and restrain themselves from interjections. Senator Fifield.
