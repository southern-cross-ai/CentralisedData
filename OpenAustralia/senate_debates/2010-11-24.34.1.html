        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities. Given that the Kimberley gas hub strategic assessment joint agreement between the federal and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australian
        </a>
        governments states in its terms of reference that the site assessment should include an analysis of viable gas processing options outside the Kimberley, including locations that already have substantial industrial infrastructure, what work is the minister aware of that has been done to look at alternative sites? Have sites other than James Price Point in the Kimberley been subject to any meaningful technical or economic assessment?

         The information I have, Senator Ludlam, is as follows. Following a site selection process in the Kimberley region, James Price Point was selected by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australian
         </a>
         government as the preferred site to undergo full assessment. It is the responsibility of the Western Australian government to ensure feasible alternatives outside the Kimberley region have been explored. I am advised that the James Price Point strategic assessment process is still at an early stage.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Western Australian government is seeking approval to develop a liquefied natural gas precinct to process gas from the Browse Basin. We are working with the Western Australian government on an
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC" rel="nofollow">
          EPBC
         </a>
         Act strategic assessment of this precinct. The strategic assessment process requires all potential environmental, heritage and social impacts to be fully assessed. Commonwealth concerns focus on impacts on protected species. Engagement with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberley_Land_Council" rel="nofollow">
          Kimberley Land Council
         </a>
         and traditional owners is another core component of the strategic assessment. Until all matters required by the terms of the strategic assessment have been appropriately investigated, the minister will not be in a position to make a decision on the plans to develop the precinct. A single

         precinct is proposed to prevent piecemeal development by individual companies and cumulative impacts from widespread industrialisation of the Kimberley coastline.
        </p>
        <p>
         If there are any parts of your question I have missed, I will take those on notice and seek further information from the minister.

If not, why not?

                  Can the minister perhaps identify whether he believes that the Commonwealth has no part at all in making sure that, under the strategic assessment, alternative sites are being evaluated? That was not clear from your answer to part 1 of my question. Can you tell us what the Commonwealth is doing to ensure that this assessment is being carried out and included in the strategic assessment report prior to release for public comment—so, the Commonwealth’s precise role in alternative site selection processes?
