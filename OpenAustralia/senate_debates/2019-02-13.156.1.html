         The speech read as followsâ€”

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The
        <i>
         Human Services Amendment (Photographic Identification and Fraud Prevention) Bill 2019
        </i>
        is intended to achieve exactly what it says, to stop, by including photographic identification, a Medicare card from being used by someone other than the person to whom it is issued.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Presently, there is nothing to stop someone from sharing their Medicare card with anyone who hasn't been issued with one, or is not eligible for a card, in order to source medical services at cost to the Government.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As a result, health providers have no way of verifying that the name on the card is that of the person they are treating.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Eligibility for a Medicare card is available to Australian and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        citizens, as well as visitors from a range of countries with which Australia has reciprocal agreements. These include Belgium, Finland, Italy, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Ireland, Slovenia, Sweden and the United Kingdom.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Anyone with a permanent resident visa can also get a card if living in Australia. Even if they aren't, they continue to be eligible for Medicare for 12 months after leaving the country.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        You may also get a Medicare card if you live in Australia and have applied for a permanent residency visa or permanent protection visa, provided you are on a visa allowing you to work or you are the parent, spouse or child of an Australian citizen or permanent resident, or a New Zealand citizen living here.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There are additional ways of qualifying for the free or subsidised health benefits which a Medicare card provides, depending on the type of visa you have been granted.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As it stands the use of Medicare cards is wide open to rorting, with nothing to stop a person who does not qualify for free or subsidised medical assistance from borrowing a card from a friend. And it does happen.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        When was the last time someone checked your
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID" rel="nofollow">
         ID
        </a>
        when you used your Medicare card? It has never happened to me.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The 2018-19 budget for Medicare, or 'medical benefits' as it is labelled, is $24.1 billion, compared to an estimated total expenditure in 2017-18 of $23.3 billion. It is forecast to grow to $25.5 billion in 2019-20, $26.8 billion in 2020-21 and $28.2 billion in 2021-22.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Medicare costs represent a significant part of the country's health budget and this is growing as the population ages.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Possession of a Medicare card has a financial value to whoever uses it, representing free or subsidised health care.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Passports and drivers' licences are protected in part from fraudulent use by having photographic identification of the person to whom they are issued. I see no reason why this should not apply also to Medicare cards.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        By providing for this, this Bill will stop fraudulent use and the consequent drain on the health budget.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It will strengthen the integrity of the Medicare Scheme, surely an outcome which everyone would welcome.
       </p>
       <p>
        I seek leave to continue my remarks.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
