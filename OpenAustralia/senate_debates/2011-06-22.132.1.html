        Mr Deputy President,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_Fielding" rel="nofollow">
         Senator Fielding
        </a>
        on Thursday, 16 June asked questions in question time regarding volcanic ash and flight disruptions. I have additional information which I seek leave to incorporate in

        Response to Senator Fielding's questions regarding notification of airlines by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government" rel="nofollow">
         Government
        </a>
        agencies in relation to the Chilean volcanic ash cloud.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        GOVERNMENT POSITION
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am advised that Government agencies have provided regular advice to the airlines on the volcanic ash clouds affecting Australian airspace.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In relation to weather forecasts, last week the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Meteorology" rel="nofollow">
         Bureau of Meteorology
        </a>
        put out advice on the possible tracks of the clouds in the lead up to the impacts experienced over the southern parts of the continent and Tasmania over the June long weekend.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bureau" rel="nofollow">
         The Bureau
        </a>
        of Meteorology has also continued to put out several daily briefing updates on the forecast cloud movements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In response to the initial volcanic ash cloud event last week in terms of air traffic management,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airservices_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Airservices Australia
        </a>
        has also kept the airlines and public informed including a media release on 12 June 2011.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In relation to the volcanic cloud activity this week Airservices media release of 20 June 2011 clearly indicated that flights could be affected around Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        encourages airline operators to provide as much notice as possible to the travelling public on the possible impacts of volcanic ash events on their operations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        However it should be acknowledged that these are constantly changing weather events where it is difficult to provide exact certainty about the extent of delays.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This is why travellers are also encouraged to keep in touch with their airlines, noting the major demands placed on airline staff during major disruptions as experienced in the past two weeks.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government commends the understanding shown by the travelling public that safety must be the number one priority during these events.
