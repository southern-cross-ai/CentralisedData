         Digital Economy

        , Senator Hume. Unlike the Labor Party, which included a retiree tax in its policy platform taken to the last election as just one part of $387 billion in taxes, can the minister advise the Senate on the headline results from APRA's release today of the very first annual superannuation fund performance test and how this forms just part of the Morrison government's plan to not only protect but enhance Australians' retirement incomes into the future?

         I thank Senator Small for his question—and a very important question it is too. In fact, it's a very important day today for all superannuation members and Australia's future retirees, because today the outcomes of the first annual performance test for MySuper products have been published on the YourSuper comparison tool on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATO" rel="nofollow">
          ATO
         </a>
         website. This performance test reveals that $56.2 billion of Australians' retirement funds is invested in underperforming products, and these products are held in almost 1.1 million separate accounts. The test assessed the performance of over 80 MySuper products and found 13 of them underperformed, and, as we predicted, it is a mixture of retail, industry and corporate funds that have underperformed.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Morrison government is hauling performance out of the darkness and into the light, into the bright sunlight of accountability, and it will be very uncomfortable for some of those funds, but it is so important, and let me explain to you why: the Australian superannuation industry has now reached the dizzying heights of $3.3 trillion. That, to put it in context, is bigger than
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
          GDP
         </a>
         , it is bigger than the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASX" rel="nofollow">
          ASX
         </a>
         and it has doubled in size since the coalition came to government. Reports of superannuation's death have been greatly exaggerated by those opposite. Back when we came to government, we inherited a system riddled with flaws that meant super wasn't delivering on its promise to the 16 million workers and retirees who rely upon it. Since then, the Morrison government has been chipping away at those inefficiencies. We're eliminating the unintended multiple accounts that you allowed to proliferate. We are reuniting lost and inactive and low-balance accounts with their rightful owners. We've banned exit fees. We've capped fees on low balances. We've removed unnecessary insurance premiums particularly for young people who do not need them, and we've empowered all Australians to choose their fund—something you have denied them for years and years.

               Well, at present, Australian households pay around $30 billion a year in superannuation fees. Now, to put that into context, it's actually more than the $27 billion that households spend on energy bills and the $12 billion that they spend on water bills.

              <p>
               It's now easier than ever for Australians to ensure that they are not being ripped off by their fund, with the introduction of the YourSuper comparison tool. More than 275,000 Australians have in fact already accessed the YourSuper comparison tool in just the two months since it was launched, and we know that many more Australians will now use that tool to compare their super fund after those performance results were released today. Finally, superannuation members can compare apples with apples. It's so simple to use: just jump on your search engine and look up 'super comparison tool'. Click on the

                  This is an extraordinarily important question, because, if your superannuation fund is failing, there are very serious consequences. Funds are now required to notify their members—to notify you—of their underperformance, by 27 September this year. Funds must provide members with the details of the YourSuper comparison tool, so that members can then consider whether a different product would better suit their needs.
