        My question is to Senator Evans, the Minister representing the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Ms Jenny Macklin. I refer to the minister’s comments today on income quarantining. Does the minister consider that all welfare recipients squander their payments on alcohol, drugs and gambling? On what evidence does the minister make the claim that income support recipients are wasting their money on alcohol, gambling and drugs?

         That was not what Ms Macklin was suggesting at all, I am sure. Ms Macklin was indicating, which I think all senators in this place know, that there has been serious concern and evidence over many years that payment of welfare to families does not necessarily improve the conditions and the lot of that family, particularly their children, and that the payment system does not necessarily result in the sort of care and support that we expect it to provide. That is not true of everybody. Not all people receiving income support from the Commonwealth are reliant on alcohol and drugs or are serious gamblers. But it is the case—and all the state welfare agencies will tell you—that there are large numbers of children who are in families on welfare support and who are not getting the care and support they need. They are not attending school often enough, they are not getting fed properly and they are often not living in safe environments. This government is trying to ensure that those kids get a much better chance, and it is trying to find new ways of ensuring that the support that taxpayers provide, through the Commonwealth government, goes to those kids and helps those families have a lifestyle that gives those kids an opportunity in life.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is true that we have identified in a large number of families who are dependent on welfare or income support measures issues of alcohol and drug abuse and gambling that have resulted in serious damage to those family units. This measure is a serious attempt to try and tackle that problem—a problem that the previous government was very much aware of and was trying to confront. I would urge all senators to treat this measure as a very serious attempt to deal with a very serious problem.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for his answer. Does the government think that only children in families who are dependent on income support have problems with drugs, alcohol and gambling? If they do not believe that, what are they doing about families who are not dependent on income support?

           It is clearly not the case that these problems are confined to people who are on welfare or income support. No-one has ever asserted that.

           and state governments as well as community groups run a range of programs to try and deal with these serious social issues. I actually think alcohol abuse is a more major problem in our society than most people acknowledge. It is often used to point the blame at young people. I think a lot of young people learn the habit from very mature people. It is not the case that it is restricted to those families. We are trying to use these measures to attack it in that way. We run education programs. We pass legislation. People like Senator Xenophon are focused in on things like gambling. These are problems of society. But income support is one of the ways we seek to support those families—

            , I ask a further supplementary question. Does the minister believe that the statements by the minister reported in the media today imply that all income recipients are squandering their money? Does the minister feel that it demonises those who are on income support?

             I must admit that I find that a bit offensive. I do not think anyone, Senator, would suggest that Ms Macklin is not serious about these issues, that she is not concerned about the families affected or that somehow she has this attitude that all persons who are on welfare have these problems. That is certainly not her attitude. She has been interested in this sort of public policy for all of her life. She is very concerned about families on welfare but she is also concerned about the broader community. What she is doing is highlighting the fact that the welfare system has not achieved the objectives that were set for it and that the straight payment of moneys to these families is not meeting the objectives we set. So we have to do something different. This is an attempt to do something different with those families to improve their lot. Other things need to be done as well, but it is in no way seeking to denigrate people on income support.
