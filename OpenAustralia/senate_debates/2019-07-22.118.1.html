         I seek leave to move amendments to business of the Senate notice of motion No. 1, moved by Senator Patrick.
        </p>
        <p>
         Leave granted.
        </p>
        <p>
         I move the amendments which have been circulated in the chamber in my name:
        </p>
        <p>
         After subparagraph (1)(h), add:
        </p>
        <p>
         (i) that current and previous Prime Minister's Statements of Ministerial Standards clearly provide that Ministers must act with honesty and integrity in all their activities. In particular, Ministers must:
        </p>
        <p>
         (i) make arrangements to avoid conflicts arising from their private interests, also having regard to interests held by family members (paragraphs 2.9 and 2.17), and
        </p>
        <p>
         (ii) not use public office for private purposes (paragraph 2.2);
        </p>
        <p>
         (j) that on 19 June 2019, the Guardian reported that, while a company part-owned by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angus_Taylor" rel="nofollow">
          Angus Taylor
         </a>
         MP and his brother was under investigation by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_the_Environment" rel="nofollow">
          Department of the Environment
         </a>
         for alleged unlawful clearing of a critically endangered grassland species, Minister Taylor met with Department of the Environment staff.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian" rel="nofollow">
          The Guardian
         </a>
         further reported on 27 June 2019 that an investigator from the office responsible for investigating the clearing allegations was present at a meeting;
        </p>
        <p>
         (k) that on 20 June 2019, the Guardian reported that former Minister for the Environment,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Frydenberg" rel="nofollow">
          Josh Frydenberg
         </a>
         , was approached by Angus Taylor in relation to the listing of the grassland species. According to the report, Mr Frydenberg subsequently sought advice about his powers to amend the critically endangered listing; and
        </p>
        <p>
         (l) that these meetings raise serious questions about whether such conduct complies with the Ministerial Standards.
        </p>
        <p>
         After subparagraph (2)(a), insert:
        </p>
        <p>
         (aa) extending the post-employment period during which former Ministers are prevented from lobbying, advocating or other activities under paragraph 2.25 of the Ministerial Standards to 5 years;
        </p>
        <p>
         (ab) enforcement of the Ministerial Standards including, but not limited to:
        </p>
        <p>
         (i) actions taken in response to allegations of improper conduct or other non-compliance with the Ministerial Standards,
        </p>
        <p>
         (ii) investigation of allegations of improper conduct or other non-compliance with the Ministerial Standards by the

        </p>
        <p>
         (iv) penalties for non-compliance with the Ministerial Standards, and
        </p>
        <p>
         (v) any policies developed to guide implementation of the Ministerial Standards;

            I just want to flag that the opposition will be supporting Senator Patrick's motion. We won't be supporting the Greens' amendments. But, since this motion was lodged, the Prime Minister has provided a letter to the Senate from his departmental secretary relating to the inquiry into the compliance of former ministers Pyne and Bishop with the ministerial standards. The letter advised the Prime Minister that former Foreign Minister Bishop assured the secretary she'd had no contact with Palladium as Minister for Foreign Affairs. Yet, on 9 June 2017, former Foreign Minister Bishop appeared in a video filmed in her office and published on Palladium's Facebook page titled
            <i>
             Australia's Foreign Minister,
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Bishop" rel="nofollow">
              Julie Bishop
             </a>
             , commends Shared Value and Palladium's Business Partnership Platform
            </i>
            . I think this does draw into question the findings relating to former Minister Bishop in the Parkinson report and supports the establishment of this inquiry. We do, however, have concerns with the Greens' amendments and won't be supporting them today.

               We'll be supporting the motion by Senator Patrick for an inquiry into the conduct of former ministers Pyne and Bishop, but it's tantamount to a protection racket to look at just those two isolated cases and not at the litany of examples from both sides of the chamber where the ministerial standards have been stretched at best, whether those folk be in the ministry or former ministers. Now, the amendment that I sought to move was to include scrutiny of ministers Taylor and Frydenberg and their conduct. I understand we'll be getting an explanation from Minister Cormann on those matters tomorrow, and we look forward to those and hope it's more fulsome than the one we received today, but the other parts of the amendment were actually to expand this inquiry to look at how we fix this code: how to give it teeth, how to make sure it's enforced and how to make sure it's not just at the whim of the Prime Minister to turn a blind eye by actually having an independent body. What a disappointment that none of you actually want to look at the source of the problem. You just want to play politics with it.

                  I thank the Senate. The government will be opposing this motion. There's absolutely no credible proposition that there has been any breach of the Statement of Ministerial Standards. In fact, the inquiry conducted independently by the Secretary of the

                  , Dr Parkinson, makes clear that there hasn't been any breach. I think we've got to be very, very careful with the proposition that a minister or member of parliament leaving this parliament would be prevented from taking on any job. I mean, clearly, former ministers need to be able to continue to work and be able to earn a living. I think we'd want to be very, very careful making that impossible for people leaving in these circumstances and for businesses to employ them. What does matter, of course, is that their employment doesn't breach ministerial standards. In relation to former ministers Payne and Bishop, clearly there is no breach and there's no case for this inquiry.
