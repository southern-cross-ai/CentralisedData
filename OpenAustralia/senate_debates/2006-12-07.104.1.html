          Yes, the outstanding Minister for the Arts and Sport, Senator Kemp. Will the minister please update the Senate on the coalition government’s commitment to strengthening the arts and sport in Australia?

          <p>
           I thank the senator for his very kind comments about my role as Minister for the Arts and Sport. The last five years has been a period of major reform and initiative in both areas of the arts and sport. I think the government can be very proud of the impact of its policies in both these areas. It explains one of the many reasons why the government continues to achieve widespread public support. We have achieved record levels of funding in the arts and sport, and this has provided a foundation for excellence while growing the numbers of Australians who are taking part in the arts and sport activities.
          </p>
          <p>
           Let me say a few words about the arts before I return to the area of major concern to the good senator: sport. In the arts area, we are putting in infinitely more money than was ever promised under Mr Keating’s Creative Nation, which was much praised at the time and which turned out to be a wimp, as so many Labor policies do. The increased expenditure that we have put into effect has benefited all sectors of the arts, including our national cultural institutions, the film industry, our major performing arts companies, Indigenous artists and all those who have been supported by the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Council" rel="nofollow">
            Australia Council
           </a>
           . The Nugent inquiry delivered an additional $45 million to the major performing arts companies. The Myer inquiry delivered an additional $39 million to the visual arts.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Strong" rel="nofollow">
            The Strong
           </a>
           inquiry led to an additional $35 million for Australia’s pit and symphony orchestras. In fact, only this week one of the major proposals of the Strong inquiry will be delivered when the ABC board agrees to divest the symphony orchestras to ensure their future sustainability and vibrancy.
          </p>
          <p>
           In relation to sport, of course we have been able to not only maintain and increase our support to elite sport but also increase our support to community support. I think Australia can be very proud of the record of its elite sportsmen and sportswomen and what they have achieved. Really, the last decade or so has been a remarkable period.
          </p>
          <p>
           The government has also been very concerned about what has been happening in community sport, particularly school sport. Many senators have indicated their strong support for the initiative in this area: the active after school hours program, which has enjoyed widespread support. It is a program which I hope will be continued and will continue to receive strong support from this government.
          </p>
          <p>
           I checked with the Parliamentary Library today and I was advised that 912 questions have been put to me over the last 10 years. Of course, as you know,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
            Mr President
           </a>
           , they have all been very carefully answered in great detail. I have had many great bowlers bowling questions down from the other side: the late
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Cook" rel="nofollow">
            Peter Cook
           </a>
           , whom we remember with great affection; Senator Sherry bowled for many years without much success; and, in recent times, Senator Lundy has shown considerable form. The only point I make to Labor senators is: 10 years, not out. But, of course, the captain can declare the innings closed at any time!
