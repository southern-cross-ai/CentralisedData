        My question is to the Assistant Minister for Health, Senator Nash. Given that, as the Prime Minister said today, the

        <i>

        report is profoundly disappointing and there has been little progress if any—very little; virtually none—in closing-the-gap targets for Aboriginal and

         Torres Strait Islander
        </a>
        peoples, and their chronic health issues are on the rise, how can your government justify cutting $168 million from the Aboriginal health budget when there is clearly still work to be done to close the gap? When the Prime Minister promised that this step backward would be followed by two steps forward, was that a commitment to return the funding that he cut in last year's budget?

        <p>
         I think the first thing to note on this day, the day of closing the gap, is the very bipartisan nature that we have had historically because we are all of the view that the circumstances for Indigenous people in this nation have to be improved. It is actually only by working together that we are going to get improvements for that sector, by working with community and indeed by working with others across the chamber to effect what we need to do to improve those circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
         I can indicate to the chamber that over the forward estimates this government will be spending $3.1 billion in the health sector for Indigenous people, which can I also indicate is $500 million more than it was in the previous four years. So, in terms of funding commitment, the coalition is leading the way in ensuring that we can effect the outcomes we need. We are also working very closely with the Indigenous sector, because it is only by listening to the sector and taking on board their views and their solutions that we are going to effect better outcomes. Everybody, including everybody in this chamber, including the crossbenchers, knows that we have to do better. And everybody in this chamber, and indeed out in the community, knows that money itself will not effect outcomes. It has to deliver programs and policy that are going to make a difference, and that is why this government is absolutely committed to ensuring we have the funding targeted to those areas we need to target to ensure that Indigenous health outcomes are improved across the nation.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I notice the minister did not answer the question about the $168 million. The minister did say that she is listening to the Aboriginal community. I ask: of the 158 Aboriginal community controlled health organisations around this country, each employing between one and 15 doctors, were any of these doctors or services themselves consulted over the impact of the Medicare co-payment on their clients?

           I, my colleagues and the Prime Minister continually consult with the Indigenous sector. Indeed, the feedback that we get is that we are indeed listening. I can indicate to the chamber that it is that very consultation that needs to take place to ensure we get the best outcome. When it comes to delivery—

               I would hope that those on the crossbenches would understand the processes of the representative organisations that represent those doctors in the 158 Aboriginal medical services across the country. Indeed, I can answer that I work very closely with NACCHO and with the organisations themselves on the ground to get their feedback on not only the issue of the way forward for how we can deliver better health services but a range of issues when it comes to delivering on the ground.

                , I ask a further supplementary question. Those health organisations are at the moment on 12-month temporary contracts. They do not know the future certainty of their funding. I ask the government: are they prepared to commit to long-term funding and contracts for Aboriginal health organisations, because we know that to close the gap we need long-term service provision?

                 I can indicate to the chamber and to those on the crossbench that there are continued discussions about the best way forward for funding those Indigenous services. Indeed, the fact that this coalition government is looking at this very closely to determine how we get the best possible outcome shows the very nature that we are trying to get the best possible outcomes. People know that the sector is very keen to get some funding certainty around this. The coalition is working towards it.

                 point out to the chamber the $681 million that this government has committed this year for those primary services—indeed, $380 million for

                  AMS

                 s themselves. It is this coalition government that has a commitment to ensuring we get the funding arrangements right to give that long-term sustainability to the sector that we all in this chamber want.
