           The government is concerned about any instances of homelessness in the veteran community and is committed to developing a more robust evidence base on this issue. Significant investments have been made to address the causal factors of homelessness, including major improvements to transition support employment programs, free mental health care for anyone with one day's service and immediate financial support for vulnerable veterans with mental health claims. The government is working closely with Defence, veterans and their families, and other stakeholders on new mental health strategies and an action plan, which will include further strategies to support those who are homeless.
