        2011, Labor made paid parental leave a reality, but super wasn't part of the deal until now. Our government will proudly extend this legacy by introducing superannuation on paid parental leave. Huge congratulations go to those who advocated tirelessly for this change: my colleagues, our unions and the broader women's movement. Without a Labor government, reforms like this just wouldn't happen. The coalition would never consider making these kinds of reforms. Extending super to paid parental leave highlights the undervalued role of caregiving in our society. The stark reality is that women retire with 25 per cent less super than men. This disparity is glaring, and we're not looking away from it. The policy isn't just about finances; it's actually about recognising the priceless contribution of caregiving, and it's about empowering women's choices. Parents just shouldn't face penalties for prioritising their newborns. By extending parental leave to 26 weeks by 2026, with four weeks reserved for each parent, and increasing the super rate to 12 per cent, we are paving the path to equality.

        Paying super on paid parental leave has always been a Labor priority. It's not just good for families; it's good for the economy and it's good for Australia. Around 180,000 families are set to benefit from this change every year. So, whether you're a mum or a dad taking that crucial time out, your job and your retirement just shouldn't suffer. This move empowers working parents, allowing them more time at home without losing out in their later years. For women, who most often bear the most caring responsibilities, this will help close the gender super gap.
