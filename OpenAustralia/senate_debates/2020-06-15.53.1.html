        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Payne. Australian citizen Karm Gilespie has been sentenced to death in Guangzhou, China, and has just 10 days left to appeal his verdict. He's been detained in China for 6Â½ years, and, according to media reports, many of his friends thought he had disappeared. Unlike other cases where Australians have faced the death penalty overseas, there's been no opportunity to mount a public campaign to support Mr Gilespie. Minister, when did the Australian government first become aware of Mr Gilespie's detention and when did you become aware that he faced a possible death sentence?

         Let me begin by saying that I am both saddened and deeply concerned that an Australian citizen, Mr Karm Gilespie, has been sentenced to death in China, and our thoughts are most certainly with him, his family and loved ones. There are a number of steps to go in the legal process, including an appeal opportunity. We are continuing to provide consular assistance to Mr Gilespie and his family, in line with the Consular Services Charter. The Australian government, through the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
         </a>
         , has been providing appropriate consular assistance to Mr Gilespie for the period of his detention. I would indicate to the chamber that the government has offered a briefing on this matter to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Greens
         </a>
         , and I would appreciate the opportunity to take that up with Senator Waters.

           Thanks very much, Minister; I look forward to taking you up on that. I'm sure many Australians were as surprised as we were to hear over the weekend that Mr Gilespie had been sentenced to death, given that the public appeared to be unaware of his case. Why is the Australian public only finding out about his plight now? Why have you allowed this to happen? At what levels and at which times did the Australian government raise this with the Chinese authorities?

                Australian Greens

               's first question, I would be very happy to provide the Australian Greens with a briefing on these matters. That offer has already been made today. There are a number of Australians in prison in China. In fact, there are a large number of Australians in prison in a number of locations around the world. That is obviously the case from time to time. Of course, what we remind Australians is: Australians are always subject to the laws of countries that they are in. There are severe penalties in many countries for behaviour particularly including drugs, and that includes China. But I will be endeavouring to repeat my offer to the Australian Greens to provide a briefing, an offer which was made earlier today.
