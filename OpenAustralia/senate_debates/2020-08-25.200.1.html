        Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Improving Assistance for Vulnerable and Disadvantaged Families) Bill 2020
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Improving Assistance for Vulnerable and Disadvantaged Families) Bill 2020 makes a number of improvements to the operation of the Additional Child Care Subsidy (child wellbeing) and some other technical drafting improvements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government's primary aim has been and continues to be to support families and the child care sector during the COVID-19 crisis to ensure that quality early childhood education and care is available to vulnerable and disadvantaged children and families.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Through the ECEC Relief Package, over 98 per cent of child care providers have kept their door open and provided free child care to the children of essential workers, vulnerable children and children whose families have an existing relationship with the service.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        When the ECEC Relief Package comes to end, the Government is committed to continuing to improve access to child care for vulnerable and disadvantaged children and families. The changes in this Bill will streamline access to the Additional Child Care Subsidy (child wellbeing), by cutting red tape for families and child care providers. The changes will also further support vulnerable and disadvantaged families to access quality and affordable early learning and child care by enhancing child care providers' ability to provide early access to the additional subsidy to vulnerable and disadvantaged families where appropriate. Notably, the amendments continue to maintain appropriate safeguards to support the integrity of the payment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Since the implementation of the Child Care Package, it is clear that the Government is delivering on its goal to create a more affordable, accessible and flexible child care system.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We have been listening to stakeholders regarding areas of improvement and the key measures contained in this Bill are in direct response to feedback received from the child care sector on the operation of the Additional Child Care Subsidy (child wellbeing) payment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill makes amendments to the
        <i>
         A New Tax System (Family
        </i>
        <i>
         Assistance) Act 1999
        </i>
        by extending the backdating of Additional Child Care Subsidy (child wellbeing) certificates and determinations from 28 days to up to 13 weeks in defined exceptional circumstances. This will mean gaps in subsidy entitlement will be avoided where a child has been identified as 'at risk' and it takes longer than 28 days to be able to provide a certificate or apply for a determination, due to circumstances outside the provider's control.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill also extends the period from 13 weeks to up to 12 months that Additional Child Care Subsidy (child wellbeing) determinations can be made for certain defined classes of children, such as children on a long term child protection order, including those in foster care. This will reduce unnecessary red tape for providers, families and state and territory governments by no longer requiring them to re-apply for a subsequent determinations with supporting evidence every 13 weeks, for such children whose circumstances mean they will continue to be 'at risk' for longer periods of time.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A further amendment will clarify that a provider is eligible for Additional Child Care Subsidy (child wellbeing) in respect of certain defined classes of children, such as foster children. This will mean that providers can receive the additional subsidy in respect of a foster child, who is at risk of serious abuse or neglect (for a maximum of 13 weeks) while the foster family confirms its Child Care Subsidy eligibility. This will ensure these children have immediate and streamlined access to child care.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The measures in this Bill will enhance the Australian Government's commitment to provide additional support to children at risk of serious abuse and neglect by streamlining access to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCS" rel="nofollow">
         ACCS
        </a>
        (child wellbeing). In particular the Bill will enhance child care providers' ability to provide early access to the additional subsidy to vulnerable and disadvantaged families.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill also makes two minor technical amendments to address previous drafting issues: These will:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        In conclusion, this Bill demonstrates that the Government remains committed to making life easier for providers and vulnerable and disadvantaged families and continues to make improvements based on feedback on how the Child Care Package is operating.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The changes in this Bill will reduce regulatory and administrative burden on families and child care providers, support vulnerable and disadvantaged families to access quality early learning and child care, and help parents to access financial assistance.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I commend the Bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
