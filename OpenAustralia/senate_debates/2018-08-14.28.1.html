        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Cormann. Less than a year ago the Prime Minister said, 'We have no plans to build a coal-fired power station.' Does the Prime Minister stand by that statement?

           A year ago the Treasurer said, 'There is no such thing as new, cheap energy with a coal-fired power station.' Was the Treasurer correct?

            The Treasurer was correct at that time, and that is, of course, precisely what we want to address. We want to ensure, through our National Energy Guarantee, that we can deliver lower priced and more reliable electricity. The Labor Party can go to the next election and tell the Australian people that you want higher electricity prices, which are bad for households and bad for business; which will hurt families and pensioners; and which will cost jobs. We'll go to the next election promising lower electricity prices and more reliable energy. It is higher prices versus lower prices. Your 50 per cent Renewable Energy Target and your 45 per cent emissions reduction targetâ€”guess what they are going to do? They are going to drive electricity prices up and up and up, which will hurt households and businesses and cost jobs.

              This week the Prime Minister capitulated to the hard Right of his party room by promising to build a new coal-fired power station. Despite this, 10 coalition members spoke against the Prime Minister's National Energy Guarantee, and former Prime Minister Abbott, the member for Canning,

               Andrew Hastie

              , Senator Abetz and the member for Hughes,

               Craig Kelly
              </a>
              , have reportedly reserved their right to cross the floor. Is the Prime Minister confident that he has satisfied the ideological hard Right or is he worried that the former Prime Minister is correct when he says that the explanation sounds like 'merchant bankers' gobbledegook'?

               Firstly, I completely and utterly reject the premise of the question. Secondly, what I would like to confirm is that part of the question which relates to proper policy debate inside the Liberal-National Party party room. That's what we do in our party room: we talk about policy. Perhaps they're all a bunch of robots inside the Labor Party, who get programmed as they walk in and somebody presses the button and they all have the same view. That is the socialist model, I guess.

                   I'm very happy to confirm that, in the Liberal-National party room, we talk policy. We genuinely assess the issues. We make judgements on the best way forward and, unlike inside the Labor Party, we're not a bunch of robots who come at issues, all with the same view to start off with. The party room has made a decision. We support the National Energy Guarantee and we will seek to implement it as soon as possible in order to bring down electricity prices.

                    My question is for the Leader of the Government, representing the Prime Minister. Yesterday, the Senate ordered the government produce the detailed modelling behind the $550

                    </a>
                    saving. This morning, the government's non-response confirms what we all suspected: there is absolutely no evidence to support your claims of lower power prices under the NEG; households are still waiting for the $550 that you promised after scrapping the carbon price.

                      This particular senator keeps making a statement and an argument to the Senate in the guise of question time. I've heard what you've said before,

Senator Macdonald, I'm happy to take this up with you after question time. I respect you've been here a lot longer than I, but it's the well-established practice that questions can take time to ask.

It is disrespectful and, in light of the conversation and your statement yesterday, what I heard from Senator Macdonald was him indeed dissenting to your ruling. It's unacceptable and he does it repeatedly.

                               , I have called the Senate to order. I've addressed the matter raised by Senator Macdonald. I asked for a question to start earlier before because the noise level was so high and no-one could hear it. This was about one interjection. I could hear the question, as could many others, but I was being consistent in my rulings to ensure a senator was heard in silence. I ask you to continue your question.

                                 In answer to that last question, if you provide improved certainty for investors and there's increased investment, increased electricity generation and increased supply. It's the basic laws of market economics: if you increase supply, prices will be lower, all other things being equal.

                                 What I would also say is it's a historic fact that the biggest fall in electricity prices was on the back of the abolition of the carbon tax. I know that you are carbon tax related and electricity fall deniers. You are deniers of electricity price falls on the back of the carbon tax repeal. That's fine, you can continue to deny that, but the historical facts are there.

                                 Moving forward, what do you believe? Do you believe that a 50 per cent renewable target and a 45 per cent emissions reduction target is going to bring electricity prices down? How is that going to bring electricity prices down? You want a 100 per cent renewable energy target. It's going to be an auction here. If

                                 were elected to government, we'd end up with a compromise between 50 and 100 per cent. They'd probably end up at 75 per cent. Families, pensioners, businesses and jobs would all be damaged.

                                     I draw your attention to standing order 73â€”I know you know it, but I'll repeat it for everyoneâ€”which says:

                                     That question is clearly an argument, and it's clearly debate about political matters. It is not asking a question.

                                      On the point of order, Senator Macdonald, you quite correctly read out the provisions of the standing order 73(1). The first part of that allows statements of fact and names to render the question intelligible. I take the point that occasionally imputations are being put in questions. I'll come back to the chamber on it, because it has crept in along with people addressing each other individually across the chamber rather than making comments to the chair, which is another thing that is happening more often. I'll ask senators to keep that in mind, but I'll come back to the chamber on that. Senator

                                          I did actually address that in my first answer. It's very simple free-market economics. I know that, in the world of the Greens and the Labor Party, you don't quite understand the basic principles of free-market economics. If you increase the level of investment to increase the supply of a product that is in high demand, you will bring prices down compared to what the prices would otherwise be. Of course, there are measures in our package that go to making sure that, through energy efficiency measures taken by governments over the years, demand is as efficient as possible. But, by the same token, if you increase investment to increase generation and increase supply, you bring down prices. That is as certain as Monday following on from Sunday. You might want to argue against the fact that Monday follows on from Sundayâ€”feel free.

                                            will deliver just four wind turbines and half a gas plant over 10 years. It'll reduce pollution in the energy sector by just 0.2 per cent a year. Can you explain what your plan to reduce emissions from the agriculture and transport sector by 26 per cent each looks like?

                                             Again, we are committed to bringing the price of electricity down to improve energy reliability and to do so in a way that is appropriately and environmentally efficient. If Senator

                                             was genuinely interested in all of the specific design features, I would encourage him to address those questions to the minister with the representative portfolio responsibilities in this chamber. But, of course, Senator Di Natale does not appear to be interested in the policy detail, because, if he was interested in the policy detail, he would be supporting a policy framework and a National Energy Guarantee, which is technology agnostic, which is merely focused on increasing the level of investment into energy generation so we can bring down the cost of electricity.

                                             You're saying Senator Di Natale is on a unity ticket. Is that right? Anyway, I think Senator Di Natale better understands that our approach is technology agnostic.
