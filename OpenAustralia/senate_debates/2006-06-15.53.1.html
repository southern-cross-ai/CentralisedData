        for refugee status determination in Nauru will rely on a country other than Australia accepting those people who are determined to be genuine refugees? Can the minister confirm how many and which countries have agreed to take those refugees who are determined to be refugees under the refugee determination process in Nauru? What will happen to those people if, as seems likely, no-one will agree to meet the transfer of Australia’s obligations to them?

         I thank the senator for the question. It is a three-part question. The answer to the first part is yes. The answer to the second part is that we will not be approaching other countries until we, in fact, have the problem. It is not a practical outcome to have our Minister for Foreign Affairs travelling around to a number of countries and saying: ‘I know you’re busy, but we might have a problem in the future. We hope we don’t. We think this law will be effective. But, if we do have a problem, have you got a few hours to talk to me about it? And will you make an agreement in the hypothetical?’ That is for

              <p>
               Yes. If we do, then we will deal with the matter at the time by approaching appropriate countries and having negotiations with them. But going to those countries and asking them to make firm commitments now when we do not know if we are going to get anybody, we do not know how many and we do not know where from would be in fact a completely impractical and frankly laughable proposition.
              </p>
              <p>
               The third part of the question was what would happen if—and the senator interpolated with ‘as seems likely’—no-one will have them. With respect, Senator, you need to wait until some boats arrive and we go to other countries and we get a no. Then you are entitled to say that it is likely that we will get noes. But you cannot assume that at this point. There is no possible way you can assume that at this point.
              </p>
              <p>
               There was a further question by way of interjection during my attempt to give this answer without interference from the other side. I do not know what is getting to them—maybe they are a bit excited because it is the end of the session. The question was: why do we need the bill? Because we are expecting the bill to work, that is why. Offshore processing has been the most successful border protection policy that has ever been introduced. Members opposite do not like it, but they supported it in 2001; they tried to get out of it later. It is the most successful border protection policy Australia has ever had, and this is simply an extension of that policy.

                , I ask a supplementary question. Minister, how much will you spend—and will that be real taxpayer’s money or hypothetical taxpayer’s money—in keeping Nauru open for your offshore processing? Isn’t it the case that either these people will be left to rot in Nauru or you will have to let them back into Australia, as has been the case for some 60 per cent of those who have been processed offshore already?

                 The senator asks: ‘Is this real or hypothetical money?’ I think we were meant to fall about splitting our sides laughing at that point. It is real money. We are investing real money in border protection. We think border protection is very important. You invest real money in a fire brigade at an airport. You hope that you will not have to ever use the fire brigade, but you invest real money in case it happens. The senator asserts that people will be left there to rot. That is your assertion. It is not the government’s.
