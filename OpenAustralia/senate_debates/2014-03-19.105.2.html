        STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR INTRODUCTION AND PASSAGE IN THE 2014 AUTUMN SITTINGS

        QUARANTINE CHARGES (COLLECTION) BILL

       <p class="italic">
        QUARANTINE CHARGES (IMPOSITION – EXCISE) BILL
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Purpose of the Bills
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The purpose of the bills is to enable the imposition and collection of charges associated with operating Australia’s biosecurity and quarantine imports system. Specifically it will enable cost recovery of services that provide general benefits to users of the biosecurity system.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is important to note that this action will not lead to any change to the quantum of charge imposed on clients. Rather, the legislation will ensure that quarantine and biosecurity cost recovery arrangements are consistent with the Australian Government Cost Recovery Guidelines.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Reason for Urgency
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Introduction and passage during the 2014 Autumn sittings is required to ensure that Australia’s biosecurity imports system is supported by an appropriate cost recovery structure. The risk based operating model that underpins biosecurity services has shifted the emphasis from high rates of direct intervention (funded through fees for service) to targeted interventions informed by risk assessments and supporting information (derived from compliance history, intelligence, assessments, surveillance and audit programs). These supporting services benefit users of the system generally and are not adequately cost recovered through a fees-for-service model.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bills will provide the appropriate legislative basis to recover costs associated with biosecurity services that provide broad benefits to users of the biosecurity system. The legislation will complement the existing fee-for-service cost recovery mechanism and support Australia’s capacity to manage biosecurity risks into the future.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The amount of the charges will be detailed in subordinate legislation. Three fees for service will be converted to charges under this legislation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR INTRODUCTION AND PASSAGE IN THE 2014 AUTUMN SITTINGS
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        CIVIL AVIATION AMENDMENT (CASA BOARD) BILL 2014
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Purpose of the Bill
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill amends the Civil Aviation Act 1988 (the Act) to give effect to the Government's commitment, announced on 30 August 2013 in the Coalition's Policy for Aviation, to expand the membership of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Aviation_Safety_Authority" rel="nofollow">
         Civil Aviation Safety Authority
        </a>
        (CASA) Board by two members and allow for more aviation experience on the Board.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill would also make minor amendments, consequential to the expansion of the Board, to increase the number of Board members required to constitute a quorum at a Board meeting and to increase the number of Board member requests required to call an ad hoc Board meeting.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Reasons for Urgency
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        expects to receive the report of the Independent Aviation Safety Regulation Review in May 2014.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is important therefore that the expanded and strengthened CASA Board be in place and stand ready to implement the Government's response to the Review. This response will include the Government issuing a new
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statement" rel="nofollow">
         Statement
        </a>
        of Expectations to CASA, establishing a new strategic direction for the Board.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Accordingly, the Government requests that this Bill is debated and achieves passage through both Houses during the current Autumn sitting period.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If the Bill is not introduced into the Senate until the Winter sitting period, the process for strengthening the Board's aviation experience would be unnecessarily delayed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This delay would result in a situation where the new Board would not be in place before the commencement of the next financial year when the new strategic direction for CASA is intended to take effect.
