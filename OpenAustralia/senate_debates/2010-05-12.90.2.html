             (viii)    when the Treasurer finally responded to the committee’s correspondence on 20 April 2010, he refused the committee’s request on the basis that to release the quarterly reports (either publicly or in camera) could reasonably be expected to cause damage to relations with the states and would therefore not be in the public interest, and
