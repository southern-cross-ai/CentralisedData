         Leader of the Government in the Senate

        </a>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ocean" rel="nofollow">

        We’ve got blood in the water and a blind eye in Canberra, it’s completely unacceptable … Whaling should never be occurring but for it to occur in Australian waters is an utter failure in Canberra.

        It is 2015 and the harpoon boats are now heading back. What is the Australian government going to do to stop the impending slaughter?

        <p>
         Thank you, Senator Whish-Wilson. It is an important matter, and I am grateful to you for raising it. The Australian government is very disappointed by Japan's decision to resume whaling in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ocean" rel="nofollow">
          Southern Ocean
         </a>
         this summer because Australia is, as you know, committed to the protection of whales. That is a position that has been held by both sides of politics since the days of the Fraser government.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government has made representations at the highest level to urge Japan not to resume whaling this year. The science is clear that all the information necessary for the management and conservation of whales can, in our view, be obtained by nonlethal methods. That is a position, as you know, that was endorsed by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court" rel="nofollow">
          International Court
         </a>
         of Justice. We will continue our efforts in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Whaling_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          International Whaling Commission
         </a>
         to promote whale conservation and uphold the global moratorium on commercial whaling.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia and Japan have a strong and productive relationship despite our differences on this issue. Both governments have consistently agreed not to let our differences on the issue of whaling affect the broader bilateral relationship. But, coming immediately to your question, Australia has taken the matter up at the highest levels and is urging Japan not to resume this practice.

         <p class="italic">
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
           The Government
          </a>
          should stop turning a blind eye to whaling in our waters and should have a Customs vessel in the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ocean" rel="nofollow">
           Southern Ocean
          </a>
          … It’s time finally for the Government to be focusing on protecting our waters rather than protecting their own back.
         </p>
         <p>
          The coalition government did go into the last election with a promise to send a Customs patrol vessel. Will you send it this summer to monitor the Japanese fleet as they head south to slaughter our whales?

           Senator Whish-Wilson, if I may say so we are getting a little ahead of ourselves. We are taking this matter up with the Japanese to see if they can be persuaded not to resume the practice of whaling. Might I respectfully suggest that we wait and see what the outcome of those diplomatic representations is? In the event that those diplomatic representations are not met with success then that is certainly an option before the government.

            , I ask a further supplementary question. I am disappointed that Attorney-General has said this issue will not affect our broader bilateral agreements on issues such as trade. Why would the Prime Minister not raise this issue in relation to a multibillion-dollar submarine contract when he meets the Japanese in two weeks time?
