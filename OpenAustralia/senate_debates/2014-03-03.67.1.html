        My question is to the Minister for Defence, Senator Johnston. Can the minister inform the Senate why it is important that senior Defence Force personnel receive bipartisan support from the elected representatives of the Australian people? Is the minister aware of any departure from this important principle and, if so, what is the government's response?

         I thank the senator for his question. It is, of course, obviously important that Defence personnel can act without fear or favour, as they do. They are on the front-line of defending Australia and Australians without, as I say, fear or favour. In return, they can expect bipartisan support in carrying out their orders and conducting their operations.

         Last week, I observed a most disgraceful attack upon a senior, respected lieutenant-general, who is dealing with one of the most difficult policy failures this country has had to confront—and, may I say, doing a sterling job in very difficult circumstances. This attack was one of the most disgraceful low points of this parliament. He was accused of engaging in a political cover-up. The opposition spokesperson for defence sank to a new low in this place. He has single-handedly demeaned the standing of his own party in the eyes of Defence personnel and the wider Defence community and members of the Australian community. This situation needs to be repaired. I say the senator should apologise and withdraw. Such behaviour reflects on all of us. Being robust is fine. Asking difficult questions in estimates is fine. But a personal attack on a professional member of the ADF—doing a very good job in difficult circumstances—is completely unacceptable. This is not the view of all parliamentarians. He should not have been attacked, and Senator Conroy should have apologised.

          , I have a supplementary question. I again refer the minister to the need for those serving in Australia's Defence Force to enjoy bipartisan support from both the government and the opposition. Is it beneficial to the morale of Australia's Defence Force for slurs against senior serving officers to go uncorrected?

           The Leader of the Opposition, having observed the conduct of the spokesperson for Defence from the opposition, should have taken measures, shown some leadership and replaced the spokesperson.

            , I ask a further supplementary question. Is the minister able to advise the Senate of any example of a failure to adhere to the principle of bipartisan support for officers who have served our country and the effect of this on the morale of other serving officers?

             After Mr Shorten's failure to deal with the opposition's spokesperson, he then conducted a most outrageous campaign against a sitting senator, accusing him of attacking a former
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_Army" rel="nofollow">
              Chief of Army
             </a>
             and calling him a coward. He was completely in error and subsequently, realising the error, apologised to the parliament and took steps to remediate the outrageous slur that he had perpetrated. Why would the Leader of the Opposition, having apologised himself, realising the damage to Australian Defence personnel from his having impugned the courage of a former Chief of Army, not take action against his shadow spokesperson? Why would he not do that, irresponsible and embarrassing as his commentary was?
