        My question is to the Minister for Defence, Senator Johnston. What action has the minister undertaken to ensure that the government meets its pre-election promise to have defence spending at two per cent of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
         GDP
        </a>
        within a decade? Can the minister confirm that the movement towards meeting this promise will begin in next year's budget and that it will be fully outlined in the defence funding guidance accompanying next year's budget?

         I thank the honourable senator for the question. It would be the first time in six years that a Labor senator has shown the slightest bit of interest in the Defence portfolio and the national security standing of this country—

          in terms of funding—not the slightest bit of interest. This is a very important and crucial question for the financial wellbeing of the

           Australian Defence Force

          . What I have been confronted with as the new minister has been an absolutely shambolic state of finances. It is almost a modern miracle that when
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon_Haiyan" rel="nofollow">

          around and send them up there to deal with that. We predeployed to people in the face of that cyclone. These are the sorts of things we are finding almost impossible to do because the resourcing of this portfolio has been plundered by the Labor Party for the last six years: $16 billion in four years just ripped out of this portfolio—and the senator comes in here to say, 'What are you going to do about it?'
         </p>
         <p>
          What we have said is that, first of all, there will be no further cuts—and may I say, in the face of what we have seen in the last four years, that is one hell of a turnaround, can I tell you. There will be no further cuts to the defence budget. We have then said that we will firstly thereafter steady the ship—that is, we will scope out what the damage has been to the capital account of the Defence portfolio into the next 10, 15 and 20 years, bearing in mind that senators on the other side would not understand that shipbuilding is a 20-year proposition from its inception.

           , I have a supplementary question, and perhaps the senator might like to attempt to answer this question. Does the minister accept findings by the

            Australian Strategic Policy Institute

           which show that achieving the government's promise to increase defence spending to two per cent of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
            GDP
           </a>
           within a decade would require an annual real rate of growth of around five per cent each year over the next 10 years, or around $35 billion? Will you now commit to that target?

                              I thank the honourable senator for his interest in defence. The previous Labor government has left me and the new government a number of financial hand grenades, most of them with the pins out. The first of these was the 2013 defence white paper. This was a 148-page document with only a page and a half devoted to how the defence white paper was to be funded. Bad enough as that sounds, the key omission was that there were no costings attached to an array of procurements—that is, 'We are going to buy all this stuff but we are not going to tell you where the money is coming from.' Not one single dollar figure appeared anywhere in the whole document—not one single dollar figure!
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              What was clear to me from the day that this white paper was released in May of this year, was that it is a completely flawed document, totally lacking in financial credibility. When I was appointed Minister for Defence, the first thing that became apparent to me was that my worst fears had been realised: the government's strategic objectives and forced modernisation plans, as described in this white paper, are completely unaffordable. They have simply treated defence like an

                              , and those proposals in this white paper were unaffordable in the face of $16 billion of cuts. The portfolio was financially on its knees. That is the legacy that the Labor Party had given us: grand plans on the front foot, making grand announcements in front of jet fighters and helicopters, but no dollars. The major problem was that there was not any funding for any of those announcements. That is what we are confronted with.

Cancelling, delaying or suspending projects means only one thing—jobs in the Australian defence industry have been lost. There have been lost, as a result of Labor's incompetence, 5,000 highly skilled jobs in the defence industry since 2009. Guess where they have been: in

                                  As many interested in this place would know, the Strategic Reform Program was to yield $20 billion over 10 years. The program lasted about nine days. That is because the budget that was brought down straight after the 2009 white paper failed to deliver any money in support of it. The promises of 2009 were simply left twisting in the breeze by a government that never regarded defence as a priority. Even worse, they regarded it as nothing more or less than a cash cow to be plundered. That is the legacy of Labor in defence.
