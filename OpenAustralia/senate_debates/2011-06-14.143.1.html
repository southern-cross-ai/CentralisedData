         (2) The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is aware that some private funding was provided to AILF participants, but it does not hold authoritative records on this question. Questions on the details of the private funding should be directed to the AILF organisers.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) My official bilateral visit to Israel coincided with the AILF, in which I also took part. Questions concerning sources of funding should be directed to AILF organisers or directly to participating MPs.
