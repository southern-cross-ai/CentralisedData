        We thank the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights" rel="nofollow">
         Human Rights
        </a>
        and the many other stakeholders, including members of this place, who have provided their valuable feedback on this bill. In response to this feedback, the government is moving these amendments to the bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        Firstly, in respect of functions of the board, while investing to diversify and transform Australian industry is the core objective of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NRF" rel="nofollow">
         NRF
        </a>
        , we also recognise that there are several important considerations that the board should have regard to in performing its functions. That is why we are proposing further amendments to clause 17 of the bill to make it clear that the board must have regard to a number of other important matters that have informed our design of the NRF from the outset, transforming Australia's industry and economy, attracting private sector investment and not crowding it out, meeting Australia's greenhouse gas emissions reductions target and decarbonisation, creating secure jobs and a skilled and adaptable workforce, enhancing resilience in Australia's supply chains, and encouraging the commercialisation of Australian innovation and technology.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our proposed amendments to clause 75 require the corporation to develop policies on how environmental, labour, social and governance matters need to be considered in relation to its investment functions and powers and also its subsidiaries. This represents modern investment best practice, and we thank those stakeholders who raised these issues. By introducing these amendments, the government reaffirms that one of the most important outcomes of the National Reconstruction Fund will be the creation of secure, well-paid jobs in these key industries that build upon our national strengths. The fund will revitalise and strengthen our local supply chains to ensure that we have our own industrial and manufacturing capabilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        By legislating the core functions of the board to include the creation of secure jobs, we are emphasising one of the biggest benefits that our domestic manufacturing industry provides and will continue to provide: opportunities for Australians to make a meaningful, high-skilled contribution to our nation's future. Nearly 85 per cent of the jobs in manufacturing are full-time.
       </p>
       <p>
        When we proposed the National Reconstruction fund in March 2021, Labor said we were doing this to rebuild secure work. When he announced the Inflation Reduction Act in August 2022, itself a huge investment in manufacturing capability in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        , President Joe Biden said that it would 'lift up American workers and create good paying union jobs across the country'. 'Union jobs' is universally recognised language for secure, safe, high-skilled, well-paid jobs. That is exactly what this government is doing with our National Reconstruction Fund, creating jobs that communities can build around, especially in regional, remote and outer-suburban Australia. We're investing in businesses so that they can invest in their workers, developing the skills that we need to meet any challenges that the future may have in store. But we're only going to get there by working together—government with business and their people. We all have a common goal: an Australian industry that will lead the world. This can only be achieved if everyone has a voice, which can be heard, and a stake in the success of our collective effort.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, in response to comments by the scrutiny committee, we also propose a minor amendment to clause 90, to make clear that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        may only delegate their powers and functions to senior staff. This amendment brings the clause into line with the CEFC Act and will not significantly change the operations or the functions of the NRF. I therefore commend the bill to the Senate.

         The opposition will not be supporting the amendments moved by the government. I do know that, unfortunately, this is going to be subject, the committee stage, to a guillotine that is going to kick in at 8 pm. I know that Senator Hume, Senator Scarr, Senator

         and, possibly, Senator Rennick—we have a number of issues that we would like to endeavour to get through in the short time, just under three hours, that we have available.
        </p>
        <p>
         In terms of the board appointments minister, as the bill currently stands, section 19(1) states that the ministers will, by written instrument, appoint board members. There is, however, no process stated for which these appointees will be selected from. Could you take us through what process the minister would enact to ensure that merit based appointments do occur?

          , for your question. There will be the normal processes that would apply in the consideration of board membership. Obviously, there will be merit based board appointments. When you're dealing with something like the National Reconstruction Fund, emphasis will be on people with those skills that might best be capable of implementing this much needed and very ambitious project.

                          We've established that—despite statements by the now government prior to the election and, in particular, even in relation to the political commentary that the minister himself made, in answering this question, to reflect on the previous government—under this government, in relation to the National Reconstruction Fund board, the board positions themselves will not be publicly advertised. Can you, then, advise whether board positions themselves will undergo a selection process, including interviews?

                                    Does that mean that the minister does not, in any way, need to accept the recommendations put forward by the department and, on that basis, the minister could themselves put forward their own selection?

                                      It's very important to understand because, obviously, there are other processes that will be gone through when these names are announced. The minister is not bound to accept the recommendations put forward by the department. I just want to confirm that means that the minister may themselves appoint anyone they like.

                                         I thought that would be an absolutely fundamental feature of a project as large and as ambitious as the National Reconstruction Fund. As I said in the address I gave at the start, today, we're looking for well-paid jobs in this sector—high-skilled, well-paid jobs—and I would have thought the wonderful unions, in this country, which have contributed over decades to the creation of those wonderful well-paid jobs would be a very important feature of any board that sets out to be as ambitious as this particular project.

                                          With all due respect, I didn't mention unions, so I do find it interesting that you jumped straight to that. I actually mentioned 'qualified persons' as defined in the act. But it is interesting, and the problem I have with your answer and your natural inclination to talk about unions is in relation to the next question I have for you. Why was the decision undertaken, then, to include section 19(2)(1) where it states 'any other experience the minister considers relevant is a suitable parameter for a board appointment' given, in particular, you said there was a skills matrix?

                                           I was here, very sadly, on the day that your government, Senator Cash, pushed Holden out of this country. This government is about rebuilding Australia, making up for 10 years of neglect in this sector and getting back secure, hopefully full-time, jobs for Australian workers in what will be one of the great transformative projects of this country. Rest assured that the fellow to do that is Mr Husic, the minister who's looking after this. I have the greatest confidence that the board he will select will have all the requisite talents and skills and abilities to make a success of this National Reconstruction Fund.

                                            <p>
                                             I remember when I was on the other side, and you used to ask questions and you demanded and expected an answer. We would do our very, very best to provide you with those answers. It is a great shame that you now treat the opposition—and the people of Australia, quite frankly—with contempt. You do not even make an effort to try and answer any questions, whether it's in question time or whether it is now in the committee stage, where we're subject to a guillotine in two and a half hours—two hours and 40 minutes—to try and understand better the way this bill will work.

                                             Based on the answers you have given to me: there is no process, basically, stated for which these appointees will be selected from, other than there's a skills matrix; the government will make recommendations to the minister; and the minister doesn't have to regard any of those recommendations. You've admitted that, with experience in industrial relations, that goes straight to unions. Any other experience—well, the good news is that the minister is the right person for the job and we should just trust them! So, basically, in relation to this line of questioning, this leaves board positions open to anyone the minister may choose. Is that correct?

                                              I thought I was being exceptionally helpful by providing all of the information, and I completely reject your categorisation of my answers as not answering your question. There are provisions in the bill as to how appointments will be made. There's a skills matrix. There will be a selection process done by the department—not by the minister. Names will come up to the minister, and a final process will be taken to select the best possible board members to run what is a very ambitious National Reconstruction Fund in this country. I don't think there's anything in all of that which is inconsistent with past practices in terms of significant boards and appointments of these types of boards. More particularly, I don't think I could be any clearer about how that process is going to work.

I hope that we can continue in that vein as we proceed to discussing upcoming bills on housing.

The amendments that the Greens secured in the House will ensure that the National Reconstruction Fund will be focused on creating high-quality jobs across a diverse economy, particularly in regional Australia. We note that the previous government did try and use public money through the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to fund coal and gas. They were unable to do so because of the guardrails that had been put in place on that bill by the Greens and Labor. We are pleased that we now have the same assurance that the

                                               140, I wish to indicate that the Greens will be supporting that amendment, which, amongst other things, means that the board must have regard to the Paris climate targets when making investment decisions. This is absolutely essential in a climate crisis. We also welcome the additional amendments, which require the board to have regard to the desirability of creating secure jobs. A thriving industry base relies on the reversal of the trend of casualisation and insecure work. We support viable industries driven by good jobs and powered by renewables. At this point, I want to foreshadow that we are also in support of the amendment by Senator Pocock on sheet 1895. We are not just in a climate crisis; we are also in a biodiversity crisis, with the sixth mass extinction underway. The Greens welcome this amendment from Senator Pocock and any consideration the NRF has towards biodiversity loss.

                                               During the inquiry into this bill and also into the National Energy Transition Authority Bill, the importance of taking a regional development approach to decarbonising our economy and the value of creating renewable energy industrial precincts were relayed by a number of witnesses. My question to the minister is: Can the minister confirm whether the NRF will be able to create industrial green energy hubs within existing industrial areas? If so, can the government provide examples of places where renewable energy industrial precincts could be developed using funds from the NRF? For example, would the NRF be able to invest in the development of green energy hubs in existing industrial zones in places like Gladstone, Townsville and the

I think your party's role is in stark contrast to the opposition's in how one might go about getting constructive changes that you'd like to see into important pieces of federal legislation. I should congratulate you on the approach you have taken in these discussions—open-minded and genuinely interested in making the

                                                I've seen the report that the senator references, and the point I would make is that coordination across government is going to be vital to the success of this terrific project. With the NRF, Rewiring the Nation, Powering the Regions as well as other government investment vehicles, like the North Australia Infrastructure Facility and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, we are confident that we're getting the right tools in place. That said, of course the NRF board will determine investment decisions independently.

                                                  Senator Hanson, thank you for your question. I think you might have misunderstood what I was saying there, so I'll just run through the process again. The bill itself sets out a skills matrix for the sorts of people the government believes are necessary to make a success of this new body. The department will then make an assessment about the people who have those relevant skills, and then we'll submit to the minister a list of the people they believe have the appropriate skills to do that job.

                                                   Minister, I find it very hard to believe that the department will have on hand a list of names of people they think will fill this role. All jobs must be advertised, and on a fair and democratic basis, people should be able to apply for these positions. Where are the names going to come from in the first place? Someone's got to present those names. It's got to be either the minister or the department that is going to present these names. Why isn't this opened up to the best eligible people around the country who may apply for a position to work on the board? Why isn't it open for anyone to apply for this?

It's a practice that governments adopt in the selection of the best people whom we believe will be able to do the job of setting up this body and making a success of it. I think you need to reference particularly section 19(2) of the bill, which sets out a matrix of the sorts of skills a person is going to need in order to do the best for the country in terms of this new body. I think when you look at that matrix, and you see the range of skills people will be looking for, you should have some confidence that the department will be able to find the people who are best suited for this job and give that list of names to the minister to make a final determination as to who will be the best people in this country to do that job.

They can't just put forward a list of names of people who want it—that is against the law. You must open it up for people to apply for these positions. Why do you think that you, or this government or this new department, have the right to put in place people who you think will do the job? That's not complying with the laws of the nation, which you impose on corporations and other businesses. They have to follow the guidelines; why do you think that you can do whatever you want to do?

                                                      I don't believe that what is being proposed here, with due respect, is contrary to the law. I think it's worthwhile noting that Treasury does keep lists of people who have the skills and abilities to meet the skills metric in the bill, and of course it's the bill itself that is setting out the criteria for the selection of these people. Anybody who's interested and thinks they have the skills can no doubt make contact with the department and say: 'Have a look at me. I have these qualifications.' As I said, Treasury has a list of people who have the skill sets in the skills metric that is set out in the legislation, and I am very confident that the best possible people—and the most skilled people in the country to build this ambitious new organisation—will it be selected. When you see the final list, you'll have great confidence that the best people in this country have been selected to do that job.

I hope there are some union representatives on the board, because a key objective of this new fund is to ensure that we get high-paid, well-skilled jobs, but being on the list doesn't mean that the department is going to select them. The department may decide that a union official or, for that matter, a representative of business, with skills in industrial relations, may not be the best person to be on the board. Let's wait to see that process work. I'm very confident that the department will come up with the best possible list of people who can do the job that we want them to do to start rebuilding Australia.

We're about to start building things in Australia again. Of course, you're well aware of the submarines that we're going to start building in due course. This government wants to build things in Australia, like we used to do—we used to build terrific Holden cars in Elizabeth, in

Ultimately, the people who are going to be on this board will oversee that process, and I think that, when you see the final list of names, you'll be satisfied that we've selected the best and most qualified people in this country to run this fund.

                                                          I'm not sure how you link the passing of this bill with the issue of higher electricity prices. As we discovered after we came to office, your government failed to disclose increases in electricity prices. This government is one that's been putting downward pressure on electricity prices by caps on gas and coal. I pay tribute to the outgoing Premier of News South Wales, Dominic Perrottet. To his credit, he was prepared to join forces with the federal government to assist in pushing that downward pressure on electricity prices.
                                                         </p>
                                                         <p>
                                                          This is not a government that's interested in higher electricity prices. We want prices lower. We don't keep them a secret. We don't keep them under wraps. We don't change the dates for disclosure of them like the previous government does. We acknowledge the problems that are existing right around the world, at the moment, as a result of the terrible war between Ukraine and Russia.
                                                         </p>
                                                         <p>
                                                          We believe in putting downward pressure on those prices, but there's nothing in this bill that would, in any way, see an upward pressure on electricity prices.

If you have consulted with industry, I'd be interested in knowing who in industry you have consulted with since the deal was done. If you haven't consulted with industry, I'd be interested to know why you haven't consulted with industry.

                                                            Knowing Minister Husic as I do, he's a great one for consultation. I don't think we've ever had a minister, in this space, who consults more and talks with manufacturers about all of the issues that are currently affecting them. I don't want to reveal confidential cabinet discussions, but I think I can say this: there's no finer minister, in this space, who is prepared to go in to bat for manufacturers.

                                                            I'm sure that he talks to them about a whole range of issues, including electricity prices. In fact, I'm told that they frequently complain that the previous government completely ignored their issues around rising electricity prices, and it's a breath of fresh air that we have a minister who's prepared to sit down with them, listen to their concerns and take some action. I might say, those stakeholders that you refer to are very supportive of the legislation, and it's a pity that the opposition have decided to deal themselves out of this process.

                                                            I have already gone through what I thought was a very good process, last week, in dealing with one piece of legislation that I know you were involved with directly, Senator Hume. Some of your colleagues could take a feather out of your cap and follow the very sensible way in which discussions should take place. We do want the opposition to be involved in these processes. The constant negativity and saying no I don't think does you any good.

If you really wanted to be an alternative party of government—I'm starting to think, now, maybe things are so bad and you've lost so many elections that you've lost any hope of ever becoming an alternative party of government. But if you are serious about being an alternative party of government then one of the criteria for that is engaging with the government of the day. Look at what the Greens did. They didn't just roll over.

I will go back and remind you that the deal with the Greens was only done yesterday. So can you confirm not that Minister Husic is a good fellow, because I'm sure he is, but whether he has in fact consulted with industry since that time—since the deal was announced—or potentially whether industry was consulted before the deal was announced? If it was consulted, either before the deal was announced or since the deal was announced, who in industry did the minister consult? Was it a peak body? Was it an individual manufacturer? Was it somebody that would qualify for this fund? Who is it that the minister has spoken to since this deal was done?

This is not a piece of legislation about the safeguards. We'll move to that later on this evening, after we've passed this legislation. We're here talking about the National Reconstruction Fund, and I personally think that your questions ought to be directed to that fund and not conflate it with another issue.

There was a deal done with the Greens on the safeguard mechanism, and that will have an effect on energy prices. There is no doubt about that, and I am asking you whether that effect on energy prices—which will not put downward pressure, as you continue to insist, but will in fact put upward pressure on energy prices—will have an effect on the National Reconstruction Fund, on the manufacturers that are going to potentially participate in the National Reconstruction Fund and potentially on those who may be eligible for this fund. Has the minister spoken to any of the manufacturers or peak bodies about whether higher energy prices resulting from the deal that your government has done with the Greens are going to affect their eligibility for the National Reconstruction Fund?

He's a bloke who goes out of his way to consult in a way that your government, when you were in office for nine or 10 years, never ever did.

In that vein, I would like to foreshadow that the Greens will be supporting the Jacqui Lambie Network amendment on sheet 1886, which expands the board membership from six to eight members. Given the range of fields set out in clause 19, we feel that the board will require an expansion in the number of people on the board. This will make it far more likely that the board will be comprised of members who have a greater depth of expertise, credibility and standing in their respective fields.
                                                                             </p>

We think that reducing the term of board appointments from five to four years does create the right balance between consistency and flexibility. We also think that bringing forward the independent review from five years to 2026 provides the opportunity to ensure that the fund is operating, as intended, reasonably soon after it becomes fully operational.

This is the amendment that requires the board to submit a strategic direction overview to the minister every five years and gives the minister the capacity to reject or not approve the strategic direction of the

Hence, we won't be supporting that amendment.

This amendment simply seeks to make explicit that the board will consider our international commitments under the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework and any subsequent global biodiversity frameworks in which Australia is a party.

We go to conventions, we sign up to non-binding agreements, then we come back home and we don't take the steps necessary to actually look after our incredible biodiversity. As a megadiverse country, this is something that we should be putting in every new body that we set up. There should be a regard to Australia's biodiversity and the impacts that any activities will have. We've got a shameful record. We have a government that is committed to no new extinctions. I believe it's a commitment that is welcomed by Australians, but that's going to take real work from all of us to actually deliver on that.

I believe it really is in line with what the government have promised the Australian people that they will do. I would urge the Senate to support it and to begin to better look after this incredible continent that we get to call home.

Protecting biodiversity is extremely important to the Albanese government.

Much of the current inflationary pressure is caused by global factors, including the supply chain restraints and, of course, the terrible war between Russia and Ukraine. Investments of the corporation will build capability, resilience and productivity in Australian manufacturing, improving the supply side of the economy and helping to place downward pressure on inflation, so I think we would suggest the opposite of what you were suggesting. Further, corporation investments will be phased over time and avoid adding to the current demand pressure.

The corporation will be a commercial entity, generating a positive rate of return over time. Returns on investments will be available for future investment by the corporation, ensuring that the corporation can continue to provide targeted, transformative finance. Providing grants would erode the corporation's capital value over time and would undermine the corporation's ability to deliver returns.

If the government's intent is to—and you're being clear in your contributions here. Why the legislation, unless it was just something to appease certain people one government shares power with? I don't see why you'd exclude that if it is something for which financing can't be approved.

The priority areas declaration will be a disallowable legislative instrument made jointly by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Science. The government has previously announced the seven areas of the economy that will be the basis of the first declaration to be made soon after the bill receives

The details of each area are still being considered, taking into account the comprehensive consultation conducted by the government in late 2022 and early 2023. Given that the government has not yet made a final decision on the drafting of the declaration, it is not possible to rule in or out particular projects or technologies.

The government is delivering a record $300 million in measures to the forestry sector that will support the expansion of the plantation estate, modernise our timber manufacturing and build forestry workforce skills. These measures include $112.9 million for the Accelerate Adoption of Wood Processing Innovation Program fund—that has had strong interest, I might add, with 84 applications received by the 28-February-2023 deadline; $86.2 million over five years from 2022-23 for the Support Plantation Establishment Program, which is fully subscribed and will support the establishment of at least 36,000 hectares of new plantations; $100 million for the Australia-wide

Firstly, I presume that anything the forestry industry is eligible to apply for under the programs you've just mentioned, particularly the forest and wood innovation grant programs, would preclude them from applying under this program. Could I have confirmation of that? Additionally, Labor made a commitment prior to the election that it would reserve $500 million for agriculture, forestry and fisheries out of the National Reconstruction Fund. How was that figure arrived at?

I'm wondering how you arrived at that dollar figure, given the lack of clarity around consultation and the sorts of projects that would be eligible.

I think I've made it very clear that Minister Husic has been one of the great communicators of this country and this government, and he extensively consults and discusses with the manufacturing industry in this country. As to your specific question, that was a commitment that we made in the lead-up to the last election. We've honoured all of our election commitments. We are bringing them to the parliament. It's just a pity that the opposition has decided not to engage and progress what the Australian people voted for, namely an Albanese Labor government. It's a pity those opposite have decided not to try and progress what we took to the Australian people and not to have sensible input to improve the legislation where they think it is deficient, as the Greens have done. They've come forward and said, 'Look,' as Senator Pocock has done. He's looked at the legislation and said, 'Look.' Yes, he's giving me a big smile there—happy fellow!

So the opportunity is still there, if you really seriously want to be a party of government ever again. I know Saturday's result—I was looking at you all today and yesterday, at the sad faces when you'd started to think about wall-to-wall Labor governments, state and federal, and no prospect of resurrection for the party. For the born-to-rule party to be in a situation like that—

There's still a chance if there are some people on the other side who can push the issue of engaging with the government about our policies and if you have ideas that you think can improve this fund and do what we want to do, which is to revitalise manufacturing in this country. Recognise that the last nine years were wasted years in this respect. Recognise that you've now got an opportunity to make up for those nine wasted years. Make a contribution by supporting the proposition that we start building things in this country again. Do it constructively. Take the opportunity. If you're that interested in the forestry industry in Tasmania, come and discuss with us how you think any of our policies—and I've listed a whole host of them before, for very significant investment in the forestry industry—can be improved. Come and talk to us about it. Our door is always open. We like Tasmania. We love going down there. Talk about forestry products! I went to the Wooden Boat Festival a few weeks ago, and it was a terrific event. There were record numbers at that event. So come and talk to us. If you've got suggestions, start engaging. This negativity, this idea that you sit back there and say no to everything, is not going to endear you to the Australian people.

Here we are on one day dealing with two bits of legislation. One is the one before us now, about revitalising the economy and creating manufacturing jobs—well-paid ones that are highly skilled et cetera, to refer to the minister's comments. Then, on the other hand, we have a bill coming up which is going to tax the life out of manufacturing in this country. So the government says: 'Oh, we're going to help you get jobs. We're going to bring industry here. We're going to restart manufacturing, but we're going to tax the life out of it.' How does it work? What's going on with this inconsistent, incoherent government policy?

But I want to ask my final question, because I know other colleagues have questions too. The final question I have is with regard to the prohibited investments list. We stumbled upon one thing which is also prohibited, and that is plantation logging. Are there any other sectors of the economy, any other minerals to be extracted or any other types of investments that are prohibited that are not expressly listed in the legislation? If so, I think it would be a great time to tell the Australian community what they are, because I don't want them finding out after applications open and suddenly they can't apply. I think you need to be upfront with Australia.

Can you outline for me how this fund will assist them to deal with the sustainability issues as a result of your deal with the Greens on the safeguard mechanism?

The laws of economics still apply, and what all serious economic commentators are saying about the deal that you've done with the Greens is that it will see an increase in energy prices.

They benefited from manufacturing. This fund will benefit people in regional Australia.

A number of these priorities have a strong regional presence, such as the value-add in resources, the value-add in agriculture, defence and renewables.

Investments, including the targeting of emerging opportunities, will help regional areas diversify their economies and workforce opportunities.

Minister, you say that we're seeking to conflate two issues but there is no way—you are seeking to bring before the Senate a $15 billion loan facility for advanced manufacturing and consequentially don't want to talk about the sustainability of advanced manufacturing, which relies on affordable energy. All sides of parliament have agreed on a net zero position. It's about making sure that you don't destroy whole communities, industries and regions on your way through. That's all. The deal with the Greens has shown certain communities and certain industries will be significantly impacted. You can't crab walk away from that. You can't pretend that what one ministry does in government won't impact on another piece of legislation. My question remains—

It is indicative of what we've seen in the last 10 months. My question remains: how many regional communities will benefit? Is there a weighting in the assessment for this money that will be provided to rural and regional communities or regional capitals? How will they be identified? How will that be weighted in the assessment of projects that this fund will seek to deliver on?

The corporation will strategically invest in high value adding projects in priority areas. A number of these priorities have a strong regional presence, such as value-add in resources and value-add in agriculture, defence and renewables, many of which are in country Australia. It's anticipated this will drive scale and growth, creating higher-value jobs in the regions.

Well I would hope you wouldn't be investing in overseas regions with these dollars. Can we narrow it down, Minister, because the last time the Labor Party was in government your own Regional Growth Fund funded major projects in capital cities. When the Labor Party says 'regions' I would like to have some confidence that it means that the third of Australians that actually don't live in capital cities in this country will benefit from the Labor Party's bill.

With friends like you I don't need enemies, with due respect, Senator. The corporation will make investments across all Australian states and territories. We expect that the corporation's investments in priority areas such as the value-add in resources and value-add in agriculture, defence and renewables will have a strong regional impact. Growth in the sectors will help regional areas diversify their economies and workforce opportunities.

Over two million people live in the basin, and they are very, very concerned about the Labor Party's water policy thus far. I think it is beholden on the minister to tell the chamber what research has been done about the impact of this decision.

I have been speaking about this since 1996, since my first main speech in parliament. I am not associated with the coalition, but I have doubts about this legislation. Are you really upfront with the Australian people? Are you being truthful about where the funds will go?

Will the union reps then appoint only moneys going to organisations that are unionised? I have a big problem with that. I also have a big problem with the fact that under part 6 section 75(1) it states:

That is exactly what you have done. This is only the start of it. You are holding the people of Australia in contempt by what you've put in this legislation. Is that the case? Please answer this. By putting this in the legislation, do you hold the people in contempt? Because you are not prepared to wait till what they say in a referendum that you've already overridden the people of Australia by putting this in legislation that you will consult with them.

It is such a broad spending power that you are giving to an instrumentality of the Commonwealth government, under legislation that can spend money. It can invest in equity shares, make loans and give out grants, and it can do so across a broad sector of the economy. Minister, what controls are in place to ensure that this entity does not, for example, make all of its investment in one state or territory?

The coalition have been reduced to cynical attempts at grabbing a headline rather than actually engaging with workers and the future of industry in this country. Just the other day, Senator Canavan and the members for Capricornia and Flynn got together and declared that Gladstone should be home to the $368 billion nuclear submarines. It is breathtakingly out of touch to think that the future of Gladstone is in a hypothetical nuclear submarine in the distant future rather than the very real opportunity we have right now to transition and build a strong manufacturing base.

Can you tell me: given all the matters that are covered in proposed subsubsections (a) to (k), why is it necessary to have proposed subsubsection (l), which says 'any other field that the ministers consider appropriate', which, as I read it, really gives the ministers a right to appoint anyone they want to the board, regardless of what their experience is, as long as they subjectively consider it to be relevant?

The structure is there. The structure speaks for itself. There is a skills matrix. We originally started with the proposition of six board members. Following consultation with those people who have been prepared to negotiate about this, we're going to increase that number to eight. So you've got eight people that you need to match with that skills matrix, as I explained earlier. The department will look at the requirements under that skills matrix. They'll come forward with a set of names of people who they believe meet those criteria. I have the greatest confidence that in that process we're going to get some of the best people in this country, who will be able to establish this board and give advice about how the fund should be best spent in the spirit of the legislation. Having prepared those names, the department is going to then forward those names to the minister. There are no surprises about this. This is how boards—

On the other bill we'll go all night. There's a stock-standard process here about how you might find the best people who are going to start the job of rebuilding manufacturing in this country—the manufacturing that you let slide over the previous nine years of your government—and we're going to start building things in this country again. When that list of people is submitted to the minister, he will, I imagine, very carefully and very calmly make the selection of the best people to represent all of the skills that are going to be required to get the best value out of this fund. As I say, there's nothing complicated about this. There's nothing unusual about this. This is how boards get selected all the time, whether they're boards that your government established or boards that we've established.

There's no need, in fact, to make sure each of the skills is represented on the board—isn't that correct?

The government previously announced the seven areas of the economy that will be the basis of the first declaration to be made soon after the bill receives royal assent. The detail of each area is still being considered, taking into account the comprehensive consultation conducted by the government in late 2022 and early 2023. Given the government has not yet made a final decision on the drafting of the declaration, it is not possible for me to rule particular projects or technologies in or out.

Reflecting how critical this issue is, the government will move an amendment to clause 17 of the bill, which will require the board to have regard to the desirability of enhancing Australia's resilience against supply chain vulnerabilities, along with other important outcomes.

Hopefully, sometime tonight this bill will pass the Senate and, in the next day or two, will become law when it goes back to the House of Representatives. This bill reflects the totality of all of those discussions and negotiations, and when it goes through it will present the Australian people with a great opportunity to start rebuilding in this country.

As you should be aware, the scrutiny committee has concerns with respect to any instruments which are not subject to disallowance. I note the crucial role that the so-called investment mandate plays under proposed section 71 of this bill, dealing with matters such as matters of risk and return, the allocation of investments of the corporation between various priority areas et cetera. I also note, with a great deal of concern, that in giving a direction the minister may have regard not only to the object of the act but also to any other matters the minister considers relevant. I'm not sure what that could, in fact, cover outside of the object of the act. Given that the scrutiny of delegated legislation committee has made clear, and this chamber has made clear, that there must be exceptional circumstances which apply to a statutory instrument, such as the investment mandate, not being subject to a disallowance process, could you, firstly, please advise us what those exceptional circumstances are?
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 </p>

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Secondly, I have read the explanatory memorandum, which purports to give reasons for the investment mandate not being subject to disallowance processes, which it should be, no matter which government it is. From reading that explanatory memorandum, it's clear to me that there is nothing that would prevent on any ground, including the ground of commercial certainty, that investment mandate having been prepared, or promptly being prepared, and a period of disallowance being allowed prior to the National Reconstruction Fund actually making investment decisions, so that this chamber would have an opportunity to apply its disallowance processes to that statutory instrument prior to any investments being made. In that way, there is absolutely no rational reason I can think of that commercial certainty or operational certainty would be compromised.

You've obviously thought deeply about the legislation, and I give you credit for doing that. Had the coalition decided that it was going to engage constructively in discussions about the legislation, I'm sure we would have happily engaged—as I did last week on the referendum machinery legislation, where I engaged constructively with the sensible members of your coalition—to try and get an outcome. You had the option, Senator Scarr, of doing that this time. I think if you'd been in control of these negotiations then we might have found that we had a positive contribution to this debate from the other side, but you've chosen not to do that. You've chosen to be an obstructionist, and, of course, that's meant that in order to get our legislation through we've had to go to discussions with the Greens, Senator David Pocock and other groups.

Consideration of climate risk represents best investment and governance practice, and the government expects the NRF will consider these issues as part of developing its risk-management policy.

We will be moving an amendment to clause 17, requiring the board to have regard to Australia's greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets and supporting decarbonisation when performing their functions. We are also moving a further amendment to clause 75 requiring the corporation to consider labour, environmental, social and governance matters in performance of its investment functions. We expect issues like this will be considered by the board.

I raised the dire situation of the last urea fertiliser plant closing in Australia this year. I note that, in reference to this bill, the minister for agriculture has mentioned a couple of times that somehow this could be a solution for this issue. The minister might be aware that the Senex Atlas project includes a proposal to build a urea plant at Dalby, in western Queensland, giving us access to that incredibly strategic sovereign capability. However, that project also involves the development of gas fields in western Queensland, because to make urea you need to have a feedstock of gas. They plan to extract 48 terajoules of gas a day. Minister, given the government's support for a Greens amendment that would prohibit investments that 'directly finance the extraction of coal or natural gas', would a urea fertiliser plant proposal that is combined with the development of gasfields associated with it qualify for funding under the National Reconstruction Fund following the government's agreement to these Greens amendments?

He said that very thing at Senate estimates back in February. Is the minister for agriculture misleading the Senate, then? Or do you have some further information to add here? The contribution from the minister for agriculture was very political in nature, pressuring members of parliament in Queensland, saying, 'Hey, you should support this, because we could get a fertiliser plant out of the National Reconstruction Fund.' Are you saying here that that's not the case? In particular, I draw your attention back to the Greens amendment. What is the effect of the Greens amendment that you have supported? Will that knock out a proposal to build a fertiliser plant that involves the development of gas resources?

My question went to an amendment that's in the legislation. So, obviously these priority areas post any bill can't use the funds from this bill in a way that would be inconsistent with the legislation. The legislation as amended through the agreement between the Labor Party and the Greens prohibits, as I mentioned, the financing of something that directly involves the extraction of coal or gas. I'll just repeat again, and maybe this is a good education for the minister—I'm not sure how much he's aware of this—that about half of our nation's agriculture comes from the use of urea. Urea is effectively a developed process from natural gas, through the Haber-Bosch process. You need natural gas to create urea. If we're going to have a sovereign capability to produce urea in the future, there'll need to be the associated production of gas. Will this fund help us solve this major issue which we'll be confronting, in just a matter of months, where we rely almost exclusively, and for half of our agriculture we'll be reliant, on the importation of a fertiliser from overseas? It's a shocking development in a nation that's prided itself for its history, at least since the days of the early settlers, on being able to feed itself. Well, in a few months time we won't be able to do that. Your own minister for agriculture has been holding out that this somehow is a solution to this. Can you please address this issue before we vote on it? Will the Greens amendment knock out the development of a urea fertiliser plant being funded by this fund?
