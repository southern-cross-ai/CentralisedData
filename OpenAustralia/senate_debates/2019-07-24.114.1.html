        . Minister, as you would no doubt know, Australia's resources and energy export earnings are on track to reach a record $285 billion this financial year. Can the minister update the Senate on how the Liberal-National government is on the side of Australian workers, including by ensuring that Australia's energy export industry remains strong into the future, particularly in my home state of Victoria?

         I thank Senator Paterson for his question and recognise that his home state of Victoria has made a proud contribution to our nation's resources history. Indeed, in some respects, it is the home of our resources industry, going back to the days of the gold rushes and, in more recent times, the use of its extensive brown-coal resources and oil and gas resources. It has played an enormous role in developing our nation.
        </p>
        <p>
         We're also seeking to make sure that Victoria in particular continues to contribute to the future strength of our resources sector. That's why it was so great last week to join my good friend and colleague Senator Birmingham and Minister

         from the Victorian government to turn the first sod on the Hydrogen Energy Supply Chain project in Victoria, an exciting project for our country. It is a $500 million project which builds on the best of what we have done in the past to develop our resources sector to create future opportunities. It is involving the best science and technology that we have in this country. The

            While this project is very exciting and is a world-first project—the first time creating a liquefied transport of hydrogen to the world—it is not all the government is doing. The Australian government recently contributed another almost $50 million in funds for 16 different hydrogen projects that have been funded by

            when it works with resource energy ministers across Australia to jointly develop our hydrogen resources and grow this industry for our country. It is a very exciting opportunity that will take decades of work to deliver on the potential promise of hydrogen. We have committed to that and we will continue to build with other like-minded countries in the world to develop this industry for Australia.

               To develop these types of industries, we need strong political support. As I mentioned, it was good to join the Victorian minister
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Pallas" rel="nofollow">
                Tim Pallas
               </a>
               in Victoria, and I recognise their support for the project. There are those that oppose this project, though, and say we shouldn't use our brown coal resources—they're terrible and evil and all these sorts of things. This project will generate around 100 tonnes of carbon dioxide. I was advised last week that that would be about 15 to 20 trips from Melbourne to London on a business class flight. So this particular project is one climate change conference, perhaps much less than that.
              </p>
              <p>
               It's a very important innovation—that we do this and support these projects. I also call on the Victorian government to support the development of their gas resources, not just their hydrogen resources. Hydrogen has enormous potential for decades to come, but we need Victorian gas to develop sooner rather than later to make sure we protect the thousands of manufacturing jobs that exist in Victoria today and, hopefully, will exist in the future—providing we have common sense from the Victorian government soon.
