        enator STERLE () (): I want to let the Senate know that back in 2015 I started a campaign called Bring

        </a>
        to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth_Now" rel="nofollow">
         Perth Now
        </a>
        . I was very happy to work on that campaign. I went to all the UFC pubs because of my love for UFC. We had a government that would not have the UFC in WA. We got 2,000 signatures—imagine walking around all the pubs on UFC fight night, getting signatures to bring the UFC to Perth. I'm so pleased to say that UFC 284 is coming to Perth, the

        Arena 12 February 2023. And guess what? We're going to have Alexander Volkanovski fighting at a higher weight. Let's get behind Alexander, Australia, he's one of ours.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to pass on my sincere best wishes to my very dear friend Peter Kloczko. Peter is the UFC Vice President, Australia
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">

        . I met Peter in New Zealand in his formative days with UFC. I've been to the UFC in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . I went to their headquarters, and you've got no idea how proud I am to say that this magnificent event is coming to Perth. Peter, to you and your crew, mate, what a magnificent achievement. I had the privilege of going to Melbourne at the time when
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronda_Rousey" rel="nofollow">

        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holly_Holm" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        were having it out, and let me tell you 90,000 Victorians came to that event. Then there's the money that it brings in, not only from UFC lovers but for tourism in Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Let me share these stats with you: the venue holds 14,000, and do you know that there were 78,000 fans registered with intent to buy tickets—78,000 into 14,000, work that out! Whoever got a ticket, half your luck, good on you. Of the 78,000, 59 per cent of those tickets were purchased by buyers from outside of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and outside of Australia. I said to Peter, 'Mate, next time we're going to have the UFC in our footie stadium,' because I know that Peter and his crew will fill that. So, Aussies, let's get behind Alexander, let's wish him all the best and let's continue to enjoy this magnificent professional sport, the UFC.
