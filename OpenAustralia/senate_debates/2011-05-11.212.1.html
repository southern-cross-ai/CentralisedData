        asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 6 December 2010:

        With reference to the proposed new treaty with China for precedent sale of Australian uranium in bulk (copper) concentrates:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) Is it proposed that a new treaty, rather than an amended treaty, be negotiated with China to provide for precedent sale of Australian uranium in bulk (copper) concentrates, with intended processing of that uranium into nuclear fuel; if so, is this process being undertaken by the

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) When, and how recently, have negotiations with China occurred since this treaty process began.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) What potential is recognised for inclusion of human rights and democracy clauses in the proposed new treaty with China, including for the protection of whistle blowers on uranium and nuclear issues.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (5) Will consideration be given to these clauses in the treaty Agreement to be 'conditional clauses' giving Australia the potential to suspend the Agreement if a breach of the relevant conditions has taken place; if not, why not.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (6) Does the Minister recognise the potential to call for the release of a prominent nuclear whistleblower currently jailed in China,

         The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) ASNO has commenced negotiations on an agreement to amend (or supplement) Annex D of the Australia/China nuclear transfers agreement, to facilitate

          BHP
         </a>
         Billiton's plan to export copper concentrates to China. The amendment would be designed to ensure any uranium extracted from copper concentrates would be subject to provisions of the Australia/China nuclear transfers agreement.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) The one and only negotiation was held in Beijing in January 2009.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) No. The Government's view is that linking human rights to trade issues is counter-productive. Liu Xiabo's case was raised in the 13th Australia-China Human Rights Dialogue held in Beijing on 20 December 2010.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) The Government's view is that linking human rights to trade issues is counter-productive.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (5) Refer to response to question 4.

        <p class="italic">
         (6) The Government's view is that linking human rights to trade issues is counter-productive.

         and Sun Dunbai's cases were submitted as cases of concern for the 13th Australia-China Human Rights Dialogue held in Beijing on 20 December 2010.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (7) (a) The Australia-China nuclear transfers agreement is not affected by

          BHP Billiton
         </a>

        </p>

         (b) Any increases in transport by rail would be carried out in accordance with existing regulatory requirements.

        <p class="italic">
         (c) This is a matter for China and the commercial entities involved to consider.

        <p class="italic">
         (d) This is a matter for China and the commercial entities involved to consider.

         (e) This is a matter for China and the commercial entities involved to consider.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (f) This is a matter for China to manage under its domestic laws and arrangements and the commercial entities involved.

         (g) Australia would be exporting copper concentrates, not waste.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (h) Australia would be exporting copper concentrates, not waste. Uranium extracted from the copper concentrate would be classified as AONM and would be covered by the Australia-China nuclear transfers agreement.
