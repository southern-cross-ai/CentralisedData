        It's right and proper to honour those who have made a lifetime's contribution to their community. Sir Max Bingham was such a person, who recently passed at the age of 94. Tasmania has lost one of its outstanding sons with the passing of Sir Max. Sir Max's reputation as a scholar, gentleman and intellect is without peer. I had the privilege of first meeting Sir Max when he was a member for Denison and leader of the state opposition when I first joined the Liberal Party in my home state of Tasmania. He was impressive with his insights and personal demeanour. Sir Max was a giant in the state parliament, and I have no doubt he would have made an exceptionally competent premier. Chances are, he was the best premier Tasmania never had.

        Unfortunately, he missed out on leading our state. Some would say he was too good for the cut and thrust of public life. But, as an attorney-general, deputy premier and police minister, he was exceptionally highly regarded by all within the legal fraternity and the police force, who considered him a true friend. After his distinguished career in the

        and as a barrister, magistrate and parliamentarian, he further distinguished himself by serving on the

        and then the equivalent of the integrity commission in Queensland as its first chair. Today I want to salute the life and service of Sir Max Bingham and extend my condolences to his family.
