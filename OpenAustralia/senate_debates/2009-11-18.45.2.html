       STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR PASSAGE IN THE 2009 SPRING SITTINGS

       APPROPRIATION (WATER ENTITLEMENTS AND HOME INSULATION) BILL 2009-2010

       APPROPRIATION (WATER ENTITLEMENTS) BILL 2009-2010

       <b>
        Purpose of the Bills
       </b>
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       To allow urgent payments for the installation of home insulation and for water entitlements for the environment in the Murray-Darling Basin.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       The opportunity to install ceiling insulation in homes has been widely embraced by the Australian community. The take-up rate has been substantial and is currently running well above demand. More than 500,000 Australian households have already installed ceiling insulation putting them on the path to reductions in their heating and cooling costs of up to 40 per cent. Further appropriations are required to enable payments to meet the current offers and demand in the Home Insulation program. Existing appropriations are expected to be exhausted in January 2009.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       A 2008-09 tender process to purchase water entitlements in the Murray-Darling Basin has been highly successful, with many more conforming offers than can be purchased within the current allocated budget in 2009-10. The acquisition of these water entitlements will greatly enhance the environmental water capacity within the Murray-Darling Basin and will ensure maximum benefit is derived from state agreements with the Commonwealth. Further appropriations are required to enable payments to meet the increase in demand. Existing appropriations are expected to be exhausted in December 2009.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       The additional appropriation required for the two programs exceeds what is currently available to the department and from the Advance to the Finance Minister. The 2009-2010 Additional Estimates Bills are not expected to be agreed to by Parliament until the end of the 2010 Autumn Sittings. Consequently, a set of supplementary bills is required to ensure that the payments to the Australian community for home insulation installations and for environmental water entitlements are undertaken in a timely and efficient manner.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       <b>
        Reasons for Urgency
       </b>
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       If timely passage were not granted to the supplementary appropriation Bills, payments for home insulation installations will have to cease from February 2010 and for water entitlements from January 2010.
