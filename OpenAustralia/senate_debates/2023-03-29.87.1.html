        My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Gallagher. The October budget forecast a 56 per cent increase in electricity bills for Australian households over the next two years. Does the government believe the actual increase will be higher or lower than forecast?

         We will update the figures in the budget in the normal way, as we do. They were released in October. They will be updated in May.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would remind the chamber of the efforts that we put in place to reduce those unacceptable increases in electricity prices caused by a decade of delay, dysfunction and failure to land 22 energy policies—22. They released them all; didn't land one of them. We are now in a world where those opposite, after creating the problem and then hiding the problem before the election, are standing in the way of any solution to this. Indeed, in December, when we did bring forward—

                      The government is getting on with implementing the powering the nation plan, which we took to the election. The legislation that's currently before the chamber, which was debated into the early hours of this morning and is being debated through the day today, is part of that. That is about dealing with the significant challenges we have in transitioning into the renewable energy superpower that we would like to be, which we will do without your help. The legislation will ensure that we are moving to renewables, that we're rewiring the grid, that we're supporting households with the transition, that we're supporting jobs in the transition, that we're supporting regions in the transition and that it's an orderly transition—or as orderly as it can be after a decade of delay and dysfunction from those opposite. That's what we're doing. We're doing exactly what we said we would do, and, where there are the challenges of the day, like a war in Ukraine that's increased prices around the world, we're dealing with them despite the opposition from those opposite.

                         Senator Colbeck refers to the Powering Australia plan, which we are implementing. I reject the assertion being put forward by Senator Colbeck, and I would similarly say to those opposite: why did you hide the electricity price increase before the election? What was that about? Was it because you didn't want to tell people? Was it because the member for Hume actually didn't want people to know that under your watch, with all of the energy leaving the system and not enough being replaced, there was going to be a significant increase in electricity prices? When you got confronted with that news, what did the member for Hume do? He hid it until a few days after the election. We are being upfront with the Australian people. Where there are challenges—we've seen them; we saw them in December, and we saw them in the budget—we've responded responsibly and carefully, and all those opposite did was oppose it, just as they oppose everything else we do.
