         I thank Senator Gichuhi for her question and her deep interest in the success of Australian exporters, who, of course, come from all walks of life, all backgrounds. Last night nearly 100 exporters gathered here in Canberra to celebrate the 56th Australian Export Awards. These were 100 amazing examples of Australian ingenuity, the drive, the innovation and of course the risk-taking that come from those who decide to look beyond our shores and to sell high-quality Australian goods, services and products into markets overseas.
        </p>
        <p>
         What was particularly pleasing to see last night is that 35 per cent of those participants at the national export awards were small businesses—businesses employing fewer than 20 people but who were out there selling their products on the world stage. They'd come through the export awards at a state or territory level to represent their state or territory and then gone on to be here at a national level. That's a credit to the fact that Australian business is willing to have a go. They're increasingly willing to have a go thanks to the work of our government in making it easier for Australian businesses to export and to access international markets. A significant number, 45 per cent of the participants in the export awards, are exporting into markets like Japan, Korea and China—markets in which our government has delivered free trade agreements over recent years, ensuring exporters can get improved, enhanced access into those markets. That is an example of where we have managed to expand the scope for business. Five years ago, Australian business only had duty-free or preferential access into 26 per cent of markets where goods and services trade occurred. Today that stands at nearly 70 per cent—a huge increase in terms of the markets our businesses can access, and that's why trade has contributed an estimated one-quarter of Australia's economic growth over these last five years.

               Exporters are critical because exporters provide the dollars into our economy that allow us to provide for the strong social safety net that Australia has and the strong investment in education and health services. Exporters are a core part of the strong economy that Australia has that is stronger thanks to the work of our government that allows us to be able to fund all of those investments whilst ensuring that we bring the budget back to balance as well. Export businesses also, on average, hire 23 per cent more staff than non-exporting businesses, pay 11 per cent higher wages and have labour productivity that is 13 per cent higher. We can see real benefits from those businesses who look outwards. But those opportunities are under threat, because, whilst our government has done such a great job expanding market access, we see from the Labor Party promises to go out and renegotiate Australia's trade agreements, a threat of uncertainty that will hamper investment and risk those many benefits that come to Australia—
