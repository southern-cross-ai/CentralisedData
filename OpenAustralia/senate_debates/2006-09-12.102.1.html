       </p>
       <p>
        Colin was a man who walked two roads: one as an author and one as an educator, providing inspiration, encouragement and insight to those who knew the man and those who came to know him and know of him through his writing. Born on 16 November 1920 near Eudunda, in South Australia’s

        </a>
        and Eudunda primary schools, and did his secondary schooling at Kapunda. He completed a degree at the

        </a>
        in 1941, followed by a course at Adelaide Teachers College in 1942. He served with the

        In 1945 Colin married Rhonda Gill, also a teacher, and they had two daughters, Janne and Sandy. From 1946 to 1955 he taught English at

       </p>
       <p>
        Colin joined the staff at Wattle Park Teachers College as a lecturer in English from 1957 to 1963 and during this time he was awarded a Fulbright scholarship to study teacher education. In 1964 he was appointed as vice principal; and from 1965 to 1972 he served as principal of the college. In 1973 Colin became principal of Murray Park College of Advanced Education; and from 1974, until his retirement in 1980, he served as director of Wattle Park Teachers Centre.

        It is not too extravagant to say his mind was a magnificent mansion which we entered when we turned the first page of one of his books. He engaged us, entertained us and often enchanted us.

        Colin Thiele was the last surviving member of the Jindyworobaks—a literary movement which aimed to revive a particular kind of Australian nationalism through exploration of images of the landscape and an affinity with Aboriginal culture. They turned for inspiration to Aboriginal art and to the stories of the Dreamtime.

       <p>
        Colin’s best-known work is his children’s book,

        Colin wrote and edited well over a 100 books on poetry, fiction, drama, history, biography, education and the environment. He was a great storyteller, and now his story forms part of the history of our nation. He has left an imprint on our society, among the people and the land he loved and portrayed so well through his imagination, insight and love for the written word. In Eudunda’s
