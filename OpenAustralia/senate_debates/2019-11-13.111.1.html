        (i) on 12 November 2019 the Stop the Debt Trap Alliance has today released its report entitled,
        <i>

        , and

        (ii) the report contains new data showing the scale of financial harm that payday lending is causing in Australia;

       <p class="italic">
        (b) recognises that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) payday loans trap people in a cycle of debt and leave them in a significantly worse position than they were in prior to taking out the loan,

       <p class="italic">
        (ii) payday lenders target people who are economically disadvantaged and excluded from accessing mainstream finance,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii) over a five-year period, around 15% of payday loan borrowers fall into a debt spiral,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iv) the number of women using payday loans has risen from 177,000 in 2016 to 287,000 in 2019 – this represents a rise to 23.13% of all borrowers,
       </p>

        (v) digital platforms have contributed to a rapid growth in payday lending, with payday loans that originate online expected to hit 85.8% by the end of 2019, and

        (c) further notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) in 2015, the Federal Government initiated a review into Small Amount Credit Contracts and accepted the vast majority of recommendations made in the final report of the review delivered in 2016, and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) in October 2017, the Federal Government released exposure draft legislation on Small Amount Credit Contract and Consumer Lease Reforms but since then has taken no action to introduce or attempt to pass the bill; and

        (d) calls on the Federal Government to urgently introduce and pass legislation to provide critical protections and stop the harm caused by payday loans and consumer leases.

           The government recognises the importance of protecting vulnerable consumers of financial products, which is why it is progressing changes designed to enhance protections for consumers of small amount credit contracts and leases. However, it also recognises that small amount credit lenders and consumer lease providers play an important role by providing credit to consumers who in many instances are unable to access mainstream forms of finance. The government is currently considering public submissions on a suite of reforms to small amount credit contracts and consumer leases.
