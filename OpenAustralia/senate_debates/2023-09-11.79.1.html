        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Today marks 50 years since the Pinochet regime came to power in Chile. Given the extensive evidence of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIS" rel="nofollow">
         ASIS
        </a>
        support for the coup, will the minister commit to apologising to the Chilean people and declassifying related documents so that the Australian community and the Australian nation can avoid making the same horrible mistake again?

         I thank Senator Steele-John for the question. Yes, I am aware of the coup d'etat in Chile which took place on this day in 1973. The tragedy that that was has been well documented. On this anniversary, we recognise the widespread suffering, the torture, the enforced disappearances and the human rights abuses which occurred during the brutal dictatorship over 17 years. I also want to recognise the Chilean diaspora and its contribution to Australia. There are many who arrived in this country as a consequence of what occurred in 1973 and the ensuing dictatorship. This commemoration serves as a sombre reminder of the importance of safeguarding democracy and the rule of law against attempts to use violence for political gain.

         I do have some concerns about some of the commentary that has been engaged in by the Greens political party. I appreciate the position you have on the

                       Minister, other countries have, or are in the process of, declassifying documents relating to their involvement 50 years ago. Nearly 300 Chilean Australians have signed an open letter addressed to the

                        Thank you, Senator Steele-John. What I would say is that I certainly won't be—and no foreign minister would be—responding to a declassification request on the floor of the Senate. Any request for declassification of national security documents would be considered in the usual appropriate way. It's not a political issue; it is a consideration of how these matters should be dealt with.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        I appreciate the political point you're making, and I don't think it would be reasonable to suggest that anybody in this chamber would be anything other than horrified by what occurred in terms of the oppression during Chile's dictatorship. What happened to the Allende government is something that many of us have been engaged with over many years.

                          alliance point, which is the point I was making at the start of my answer. But what I would say to you is that the security agencies serve the national interest, and that they are subject to oversight from ministers and, increasingly, from entities like the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence Services, which I served on. And that is a good thing; they should be subject to oversight. But, ultimately, political decisions are matters for which politicians take responsibility, and I think that Labor's position in relation to the coup—the overthrow of the Allende government, a duly-elected government—and the subsequent dictatorship can be demonstrated by Labor history.
