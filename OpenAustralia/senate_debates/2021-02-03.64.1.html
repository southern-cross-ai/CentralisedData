        I really appreciate the opportunity to be able to take this time in the Senate today to address an issue that is going on in my home state, in my home city of Perth right now. What we're seeing in the eastern suburbs of Perth is a very, very serious fire that is ravaging quite large stretches of land and, sadly, properties as well. We've seen reported that 71 properties have been destroyed so far as a result of this terrible fire that's been burning for about three days now. The disappointing news is that the weather conditions are expected to be catastrophic and to continue for a further three days. This is, of course, a very alarming and concerning incident that is occurring in Perth right now, as we speak. So I just wanted to take this time to bring a few messages but also to thank those that are involved in dealing with this very serious emergency.

        This fire is occurring in the eastern suburbs of Perth. It started up in the hills and it moved westwards, with a very strong easterly behind it, down into the foothills. It's in the shires of Mundaring and Northam and the City of Swan. For those that are not familiar with Perth and have not seen where these areas are, some of them are heavily wooded areas and heavily forested areas. Then there are peri-urban areas where beautiful homes have been built in these idyllic locations. But the fire is actually moving into the suburbs of Perth; it's not just in these peri-urban or rural areas. So it's a very serious incident that our emergency services in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        are dealing with right now.
       </p>
       <p>
        Residents of Perth are dealing with not only the impact of this fire but also with lockdown as a result of the COVID pandemic and a case that has occurred in Western Australia. I must stress for anyone who may actually be listening that if you're in these areas and you've been asked to isolate and quarantine at home, it certainly does not mean that you can't leave your home if you've been directed to do so, if you're in the face of this emergency. We simply ask that people continue to wear their masks as they relocate somewhere safe. So you don't need to stay in your home; if you've been directed to leave, you should leave and you should go and isolate somewhere safe.
       </p>

        I'm saddened to hear that the conditions are going to worsen over the day as 70 kilometres per hour winds are now flanking this fire and pushing the fire towards the housing estates right on the edge of Perth. Seventy-one homes have been lost, and I can't imagine what sort of impact that must be for those families. I read on the front page of

        newspaper today of a mother and her daughter who had to protect themselves by going into their swimming pool as they watched their home burn. That must have been an absolutely horrific scene—a home that they'd built about 20 years earlier now destroyed in front of them. There are no words that could be offered to provide the kind of support that is needed, but I—and I'm sure I'm joined by Senator Brockman, as he joins me here in the chamber—express my sincerest condolences and support to those who have lost their home and property.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian government are doing all that we can to support the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australian
        </a>
        government and the services that are operating there to protect these homes and to deal with this fire. The Minister for Defence organised for a large air tanker to be sent over, filled with fire retardant that can then be used to supply the smaller planes that are actually involved in the extinguishing of this fire. That was initiated very, very quickly at the request of the state government, and we gave them absolutely everything that was required.
       </p>
       <p>
        The other thing that has happened today is Minister Littleproud has announced that residents that have been impacted by this fire are able to access a disaster recovery payment of $1,000 per adult and $400 per child. This money will be available from 8 am tomorrow through Services Australia through Centrelink. I really want to stress these are very proud people that live in Western Australia and certainly in these areas, and I know many of them would feel that they may not necessarily need or want any kind of handout like this. But let me say there, of course, are some immediate issues that need to be dealt with, like supplies that you might need. There is no shame in accessing this payment at all. Australians stand with you. This government stands with you. If you've been affected, we encourage you to make use of this disaster recovery payment that is available. It'll be in your bank account straightaway and it will be there to help tide you over with a few of the immediate necessary things required to help you deal with this present situation. So the government are doing what we can and responding to those requests that come from the Western Australian government. Of course, if there are more requests that come through, I've got no doubt that the relevant ministers and, indeed, our Prime Minister will do everything within our power to support these communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a very challenging time for Western Australia, whether you're caught up in lockdown due to COVID or you're dealing with these bushfires. These are very serious incidents that are occurring. I'd encourage everyone to do what you can to stay safe, even if you're a long way from the fires and dealing with the COVID situation and doing what you've been asked to do, which is to stay home if you can, and, if you need to go out to get groceries and such things, to wear your mask. It's great to see the reports that are coming through where people are doing everything they can. The compliance with these requests is, from what we're hearing—obviously, we're over here in Canberra and not there present with the community. It is, as I think Senator Brockman would agree, a strange feeling not being able to be there right now with our community, but we're doing everything we can from here to support our communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's really good to see the way Western Australians are rising to the challenge. No doubt the generosity of Western Australians will come through over the next few days, and I'd encourage every Australian to consider, as the calls get put out, to donate to help people dealing with the impact of this fire. I've got no doubt that Western Australians and, indeed, all Australians will rise to the challenge in the way that Western Australians rose to the challenge when helping to raise funds and support the communities that were impacted by last summer's bushfires. As a Western Australian, I was very proud to see that support by Western Australians that went into the eastern states as we looked on the challenges that were going on in the eastern states and while we went through a relatively trouble-free bushfire season in Western Australia last year.

        I had a fire just down the road from my house. There were two of them that occurred over a week. Thankfully no serious amount of property was damaged. Literally 500 metres or so from my house, where we live, I got to see firsthand the tremendous effort that is put in not only by career firefighters—and of course police and other emergency services—but, indeed, by all of the volunteers who step up at times like this. I want to say thank you very much. You are heroes. You are incredibly brave. We appreciate all that you do, particularly when you're putting your lives in danger.
