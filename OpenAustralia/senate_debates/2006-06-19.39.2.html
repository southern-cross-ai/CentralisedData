        Senator Evans asked me a question about delivery dates for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRH" rel="nofollow">
         MRH
        </a>
        90 helicopters. I have an answer which I seek leave to incorporate in
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The answer read as follows—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        MRH-90 Aircraft Delivery Dates.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The announcement by the Government today was for an additional 34 MRH-90 helicopters. Together with the 12 aircraft already committed to under Project Air 9000 Phase 2, this will mean 46 new aircraft.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Today’s announcement means that both
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_and_Navy" rel="nofollow">
         Army and Navy
        </a>
        will be using the same aircraft.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This joint approach will allow the Government to allocate aircraft as they come off the production line to firstly establish the joint training and support environment, before aircraft are allocated to areas of most need. This initiative will allow both Army and Navy to gradually transition to the new MRH-90 squadrons without causing wholesale reduction in capability.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The first aircraft will be delivered by the end of 2007, with gradual deliveries allowing the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_King" rel="nofollow">
         Sea King
        </a>
        to be retired by mid 2010 as Navy aircrew are trained. Army will commence replacing its Blackhawk Squadrons as trained aircrew become available from between 2011 and 2015.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This process allows the Government to continue to provide capable squadrons able to protect Australia and its interests in a cost effective and timely manner.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The first aircraft to be acquired by Australia will be the 51
        <sup>
         st
        </sup>
        aircraft off the production line. By this time the other participating nations will have qualified the aircraft for service in their own defence forces.
