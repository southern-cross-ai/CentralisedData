         Through normal day to day management, supervisors of employees with a disability have the opportunity to discuss matters that are affecting the employee's desire to remain in Defence, and these are formalised through performance exchanges, which must be conducted at least twice each year. These matters include the identification and provision of necessary workplace equipment or reasonable workplace adjustments to accommodate a person's disability (refer to question 8 for further information).

         Career management for ADF members with acquired disability is managed in accordance with the Medical Employment Classification policy – in other words, the ADF must make all reasonable efforts to retain and provide appropriate employment opportunities for service personnel where their classification is downgraded during their service.

         ADF members with an acquired disability are rehabilitated to achieve optimal recovery. Then we assess their functional capacity and identify fitness for alternate military duties and their vocational options with the ADF. Discharge from the ADF is a last resort. However, if return to work in current or different duties or trade is not possible, they will be rehabilitated, medically discharged and supported to transition to the civilian environment.
