        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Senator Conroy. I refer to reports that the environment minister's decision to declare more than 2.3 million square kilometres of Australian waters as marine parks will potentially put Australia's largest aquarium supplier Cairns Marine out of business. What compensation is the government prepared to offer to the 30 people employed directly by Cairns Marine and many others directly or indirectly employed by allied businesses that are now at risk of losing their jobs as a result of the government's decision to declare the world's largest network of marine parks?

         I thank the senator for his question. The government will be providing up to $20 million to support a number of sectoral measures projects designed to assist the fishing industry to adapt to large-scale Commonwealth marine reserves. Funding will be focused on large grants of $200,000 to $2 million for projects to be delivered from 2014 to 2016. Eligibility and selection criteria for sectoral measures projects will be developed in consultation with industry organisations, fisheries managers and relevant research institutions. Entitlement buyouts will be undertaken to avoid the unsustainable concentration of commercial fishing outside of the reserve areas. The need for, and the level of, effort reduction—entitlement buyouts—will be assessed on a fishery-by-fishery basis. The relevant fisheries management agency, industry organisations and other experts will be consulted before decisions on entitlement buyouts are made. It is not surprising that, as we approach the end of what has been an extensive and lengthy process of consultation, various groups feel the need to emphasise their views through vigorous public campaigns. The sort of misleading of the Australian public that those opposite, and particularly Senator Boswell, have been engaged in is quite frankly laughable. It is simply misleading the Australian public. Petitions, rallies and email campaigns are a valid way of telling the government what people think, unless they are based on misinformation and outright lies about the government's marine reserves proposals. Some of those opposite are going very close to what I have just said.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is worth noting that, despite these campaigns, the public and informed scientific response to the marine reserves has been overwhelmingly—

          , I ask a supplementary question. I refer the minister to statements last week by the owner of Cairns Marine, Mr Lyall Squire, who said:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          We have grave fears for our survival, worse, this is not about science …
         </p>
         <p>
          Can the minister explain what specific threat this successful business, which exports species such as clownfish, sharks and rays, presents to the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_Sea" rel="nofollow">
           Coral Sea
          </a>
          ? Why will its access to Osprey and Shark reefs be soon taken away? Is this all about Green preferences and pandering to the American Pew foundation, who demanded to lock up the Coral Sea?

           It is good to see Senator Boswell likes to stick with a good conspiracy theory. The sort of private member's bill which we have seen moved from the other side to prevent the establishment of the marine reserves is the latest example of the type of fear based misinformation campaign being mounted against legitimate and considered conservation and environment protection measures. In this case, those opposite are even prepared to seek to undo a legal process that they themselves created and used when in government. Perhaps Senator Boswell did not notice. The minister and the department have consulted with Cairns Marine and will continue to do so. Those opposite should desist from misleading the Australian public.

             AFMA
            </a>
            cost recovery fees for the area of $270,000 will soon be borne by as few as three operators? Has the government given consideration that the increase in the financial burden for the remaining operators, who face fees potentially as high as $90,000, coupled with restricted access to the Coral Sea, will result in them simply becoming unviable and will force them to shut down?

             I thank Senator Boswell for raising some factual issues rather than alluding to conspiracies from all around the world. As I already indicated in an earlier answer, the government have a package, they are talking to the sector and they are working through the guidelines and the processes. We will take on board the legitimate points that Senator Boswell has raised and consider them. But, as to the conspiracy about some American organisation, if
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clive_Palmer" rel="nofollow">

             were a member I could understand why you would be particularly concerned. Clive Palmer has been very clear about what he thinks of the Liberal-National Party, but do not worry: the only person in the Queensland Liberal-National Party who he thinks is a good bloke is Senator Brandis.
