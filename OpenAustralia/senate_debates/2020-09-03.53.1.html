        I thank the Senate. The neglect of older Australians has to stop. I do not move this censure lightly. But, if this government, the Morrison government, will not act to protect older Australians, this Senate must act. Senator Colbeck has been warned repeatedly. Every three months since he has become minister, the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission has told him that standards were not met in as many as 45 per cent of site audits and 100 per cent of review audits.

        tells us that every week 100 older Australians are being raped, assaulted and killed in aged-care facilities. This is appalling, it is distressing and it is shocking, but most of all it is unacceptable. This nation must do better. This minister must do better. The Morrison government must do better, and the Senate should express its view that it must do better by censuring this minister. The country has lost confidence in this minister. He has lost the confidence of the parliament. He has lost the confidence of his colleagues and he should be censured.

           The government—Liberal and Nationals senators—in this chamber strongly oppose this motion. We stand with our colleague, Senator Colbeck, who is doing a very good job in a very challenging area in a very difficult context. Every death from COVID-19 is a tragedy and we send our condolences to affected families and loved ones. We continue to work, and Senator Colbeck continues to work, day and night to safeguard the most vulnerable in the community, with the government providing over $1½ billion in additional support to the aged-care sector to date to support senior Australians in aged care.
          </p>
          <p>
           Minister Colbeck has acknowledged, taken responsibility and apologised for not having the number of deaths in aged care due to COVID-19 at his fingertips at the recent Senate inquiry. The resources supplied to the national COVID-19 health response plan to support the aged-care sector are a clear demonstration of the important work undertaken in support of aged-care residents through the COVID-19 pandemic. Let me say I know firsthand how strongly Senator Colbeck performs in this—
