              Sadly, more Australians are being touched by this devastating drug each day. I am pleased to advise the chamber that the interim report from the ice task force was recently presented to
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
               COAG

              by the Prime Minister, looking to form a national ice strategy. The task force, led by former police commissioner in Victoria,
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Lay" rel="nofollow">
               Ken Lay
              </a>
              , and supported by Professor Richard Murray and Dr Sally McCarthy, consulted extensively across the country with experts and with community groups and received around 1,200 written submissions that have been taken into account in preparing the interim report. There is no single approach to tackling this drug, but the task force has identified six key areas to guide work toward the development of the National Ice Action Strategy, which include focusing on law enforcement actions, looking at primary prevention, looking at early intervention and treatment and rehabilitation services, supporting local communities to respond to this issue, improving tools for front-line workers and looking at research and data.
             </p>
             <p>
              In regard to law enforcement, new laws which passed the House of Representatives yesterday will crack down on middlemen and drug couriers bringing precursors into the country to make ice. Legislation was also changed to manage the proliferation of dangerous synthetic drugs at our borders and today the Prime Minister and Minister Keenan also announced funding totalling $18.2 million on a range of initiatives to bolster the fight against the ice scourge, with its money going to the

              to further strengthen its crime-fighting capabilities. This is not an issue just for the government; we must deal with this with states and territories and local communities.

                has reported that organised crime is making huge profits from the misery of ice use in our communities. There are very concerning trends, including the increased availability and use of ice where the drug previously has not been prevalent, particularly in our rural and regional and in our most disadvantaged communities. It has been made a matter of priority for ANACAD that they look at the issue of ice and the council has been working in close conjunction with the national task force. The members of the advisory council, very ably chaired by Kay Hull AO, are all experts from a wide range of areas including law enforcement, drugs and alcohol, Indigenous health, mental health, research and policy, and they will provide a broad range of expertise on this very important issue. It requires a whole-of-government response and ANACAD is providing invaluable advice to the government.

                  I have travelled the length and breadth of the country and one thing has become very clear: ice does not discriminate. It affects old people, young people, rich people, poor people, business people and people from all walks of life in our communities. Minister Keenan and I have held consultations across the country and even in the senator's great state of Queensland I recently held forums in Rockhampton and in Cairns. Listening to the people out in the communities has been absolutely vital in forming our government response as being a part of the national ice action strategy. What has also become clear is that we cannot arrest our way out of this problem. Law enforcement is a very important part of tackling this issue but it is certainly not the only way and it is across a whole range of issues. We need to look at education, we need to look at treatment and rehabilitation services and with all levels of government we will need bipartisan support.
