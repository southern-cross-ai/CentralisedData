        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Social Services
        </a>
        , Senator Farrell. Australians are living through a cost-of-living crisis, and the rate rise on Tuesday is rubbing salt into the wound. The people who are doing it the toughest are the people on Centrelink payments, who are making difficult decisions about whether to put food on the table, or to put petrol in their car to fulfil all their mutual obligations or whether to go to the doctor to check out their persistent cough. As a result of indexation, in this financial year a single renter and jobseeker will lose the equivalent of two weeks of payments to income tax. This is because their annual income will now be above the tax-free threshold. Minister, why is the government giving payments to the poorest Australians on the one hand and taking those payments on the other?

         Thank you, Senator Tyrrell, for that question. As I've made the point on numerous occasions during the course of this week, and before that, we do understand that many Australians are doing it tough with the combination of high inflation and the fact that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">
          Reserve Bank
         </a>
         is pushing up interest rates in this country. There is a mechanism for dealing with all of these issues, and you might have noticed from my previous answer the steps that this government is trying to take to ensure that those people who have an entitlement to something from Centrelink are actually able to go and see a person, talk to them and discuss their particular circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
         This government doesn't want to make things worse for any Australian, and all the things that we have been trying to do to put downward pressure on interest rates and the cost of living are designed to help the people in these circumstances who you're talking about. We're going to continue to do that, Senator Tyrrell, and we're going to try to provide assistance—particularly to those Australians who are doing it tough right now and who need it the most.

           Minister, the age pension is exempt from income tax. Why are you exempting pensioners from the tax-free threshold but not the poorest people in the country—the people on JobSeeker?

            There's a range of tax policies in this country and you of course have highlighted one in particular. I can tell you that of course we don't have any plans to tax the age pension—if that was an implication in your question. We continue to try to provide assistance to those Australians who are most in need. This is a caring and compassionate government, led by a caring and compassionate Prime Minister. We are doing our best to repair the damage that was done by the former government in a whole range of these areas, and we'll continue to do that.

              I love that answer, thank you so much, Senator Farrell. Will the government commit here and now, at the worst point of the cost-of-living crisis to date, to exempt people on JobSeeker from paying income tax on their government payments, or to reassess the current situation with JobSeeker payments?
