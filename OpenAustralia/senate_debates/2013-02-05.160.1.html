         Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) Yes.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (a-b) The Department of Broadband Communications and the Digital Economy (DBCDE) collects information from stakeholders and the broader community in relation to a broad range of matters. Details of the Department's programs and links to its funding programs/consultations and submissions are available via the Department's Information Publication Scheme on its website http://www.dbcde.gov.au/about_us/information_publication_scheme_ips
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The Department also provides its Personal Information Digest to the Australian Information Commissioner each year (as required under the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_Act" rel="nofollow">
          Privacy Act
         </a>
         1988), listing personal information holdings.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (c-d) Where forms (online/paper) are used to collect information, the forms do not request an estimate of time taken to complete. Forms are designed to only collect the data necessary, for example, to enable an assessment of a grant application. In the main, data is not collected on how long it takes to complete forms. However, it is noted that the Digital Switchover Taskforce collects information via the Digital Tracker telephone survey. Verbal responses to this survey are entered into a computer system and respondents are advised of the approximate duration of the survey (less than 15 minutes depending on the length of the respondent's answers).
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2)
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (a-b) Details relating to Regulatory initiatives since 2010 are outlined in the Department's Regulatory Plans 2009-10, 2010-11, 2011-12, 2012-13, all available on the Department's website at http://www.dbcde.gov.au/about_us/reporting_requirements_and_reviews/departmental_regulatory_plan/archived_departmental_annual_regulatory_plans
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Consultation opportunities are identified for planned regulatory activities in the Regulatory Plan. The Department complies with the Australian Government's regulatory impact analysis requirements administered by the Office of Best Practice Regulation. No formal complaints are on record with our central complaints manager as having been lodged about any consultation processes relating to regulatory initiatives. However, it is sometimes the case that there may be dissatisfaction with the consultation process expressed as part of the stakeholder's submission to a review or inquiry. These are dealt with as part of the review or inquiry process.

         Australian Communications and Media Authority
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) Yes. Information is collected in multiple ways and in multiple forms. Much of the information the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACMA" rel="nofollow">
          ACMA
         </a>
         receives is provided voluntarily by citizens, consumers, industry groups, industry participants and so on.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (a) Where the ACMA seeks to collect information a form is often provided for that purpose. The ACMA website provides a comprehensive online list of forms which can be downloaded or completed on-line (www.acma.gov.au).
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) As per above, these forms are provided online:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         i. All forms are available for download
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         ii. A number of these forms are able to be completed and submitted online
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         iii. All forms, since all of the electronic forms may be downloaded and printed.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (c) No. There is no such requirement for Commonwealth Government forms, however, the ACMA sometimes collects information on time taken to complete specific forms, such as through industry surveys or on the forms themselves, e.g. where a form is being released for the first time to meet a requirement of new legislation.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (d) No.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2)
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (a) The ACMA engages in full consultation in relation to all significant regulatory initiatives which it proposes, in line with legislative obligations contained in the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 and in the various pieces of legislation administered by the ACMA, and as required by the Australian Government's regulatory impact analysis requirements administered by the Office of Best Practice Regulation. Each such regulatory initiative therefore involves at least one consultation process. Within that consultation process there may be a large number of elements of various forms, tailored to the nature of the issue under consideration. Those elements of the consultation process may include one or more discussion papers, conferences, public hearings, one-on-one meetings with particular stakeholders, seminars, webinars, research activities and so on.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) It is sometimes the case that some persons may be dissatisfied with the process or outcomes of a consultation. Responses to consultation in relation to regulatory proposals are addressed in Regulation Impact Statements (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIS" rel="nofollow">
          RIS
         </a>
         s). These are prepared to inform decisions that are likely to have a regulatory impact on business or the not-for-profit sector that is not of a minor or machinery nature and do not substantially alter existing arrangements. Each RIS is a publicly available document which is available from the Department of Finance and Deregulation's website (www.ris.finance.gov.au).
