         The Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) Given the broad scope of the first question placed on notice, I consider that the preparation of answers to the first question placed on notice would involve a significant diversion of resources and, in the circumstances, I do not consider the additional work that would be required can be justified.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Information regarding the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities (the department) offset policy can be found on the department's website. The department has recently developed an offsets mapping tool which will allow future offsets to be entered into a spatial database to improve data available for decision-making, monitoring and compliance.

         Since 2000 there have been approximately 3661 decisions made on proposed actions referred under the
