        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Social Services
        </a>
        . As has already been mentioned today, White Ribbon Day is this Friday—a day that is about preventing domestic violence. We can all agree that domestic violence is abhorrent and that victims deserve support. Given that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Bureau_of_Statistics" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Bureau of Statistics

        tells us that one in three victims of domestic violence is male, do you think male victims deserve a proportional level of support services as female victims?

         I thank Senator Leyonhjelm for alerting my office to the fact that this issue would be raised today.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commonwealth" rel="nofollow">
          The Commonwealth
         </a>
         recognises that all victims of violence, regardless of their sex or gender, need compassionate and highly responsive support. Similarly, all perpetrators, regardless of their sex or gender, must be held accountable for their violence as individuals. I am sure that is a point that Senator Leyonhjelm would agree with me and the Commonwealth upon.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am advised that from the Personal Safety, Australia, 2012 survey we do know that one in six women and one in 19 men has experienced physical or sexual violence by a current or former intimate partner. The ABS's Recorded Crime—Offenders 2014-15 data for all included states and territories where men are between four and eight times more likely to be offenders of family and domestic violence related offences than women. While current evidence shows that the majority of victims are indeed women, these statistics do not always reflect personal experiences of violence. I am sure everyone hopes that when a complaint is made, regardless of someone's sex or gender, that the appropriate services—whether they be police forces or other government or public services—respond accordingly.

           I accept that most domestic violence is suffered by women, but about 24 per cent—nearly 25 per cent—of victims of homicide by intimate partners are male. As male victims of domestic violence are notoriously reluctant to seek help—often because they are automatically assumed to be the perpetrators—can you point to any government services or awareness programs specifically designed to help male victims overcome this problem?

            the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children 2010-22 does recognise that men and boys can be victims of domestic and family violence and sexual assault. The Australian government funds a number of initiatives to support men and boys who experience violence. These include: MensLine Australia, accessible by phone or over the internet; a counselling service that assists men to manage family and relationship difficulties including issues of violence; the 1800RESPECT service, again by telephone and available over the internet; and the National Sexual Assault, Family &amp; Domestic Violence Counselling Service. This is a free and confidential telephone and online counselling service for any person, regardless of age or gender, who has experienced, or is at risk of, domestic and family violence and/or sexual assault and their family and friends. Centrelink social workers can also provide up-to-date information about community support services, as well as provide counselling and support to people facing difficult personal circumstances.

              I have heard from constituents that boys in some Sydney schools are asked to stand and take the White Ribbon Day oath while female classmates sit and watch. Do you support this form of public shaming based on gender?

               could just add to the comments I made in response to the last question—it is not unheard of for men across a whole range of services, including health and mental health, to not be inclined to go forward and seek assistance. I think we could all say, when it comes to this issue as well as many others, we would encourage any and every Australian who is aware of someone suffering violence to actually take action or to encourage someone to take action and seek support. I am not aware of the claims that you have made there, Senator Leyonhjelm. White Ribbon Australia encourages men to highlight the role they can play alongside women to stop violence against women based on the understanding that the majority of men are not violent. It is not compulsory to participate and I am not necessarily always in favour of everything that happens in our schools, Senator Leyonhjelm. What I will say, though, is that raising awareness and voluntary participation in such activities is, I think, important to the issues you raised in your first two questions, and that is encouraging people to seek assistance when they need it.
