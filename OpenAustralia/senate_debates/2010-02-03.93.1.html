             several thousand Home Sustainability Assessors under the Government’s Green Loan Program (the program) have been denied any work for more than 1 month since Christmas 2009 due to the mismanaged shutdown of the program’s phone booking service, leaving many in severe financial hardship, and

             the company Fieldforce has consistently received preferential treatment through the program including being allowed to book as much work as it wanted during the shutdown period, despite thousands of other assessors being forced to go without work; and

         The government does have a response in relation to as to why we it will not support the motion. I seek leave to incorporate the statement.

         Leave granted.

          There has been a significant increase in the number of new Home Sustainability Assessments booked since 11 January, and the

           Department of the Environment
          </a>
          has allocated significant additional resources to process these bookings.
         </li>
         <li>
          Since 11 January 2010, over 24,000 calls have been received and over 50,000 new bookings processed.

        <ul>
         <li>
          Fieldforce is the single largest operator under the Green Loans Program, and to accommodate this, they make bulk bookings which are processed by the Department once a week.
         </li>
         <li>
          These bookings are subject to a weekly limit, in order to ensure there is adequate work for all assessors.
         </li>
         <li>
          Jobs are available to all assessors, whether they are individuals or part of a company.
         </li>
         <li>
          Over half the assessors contracted to the Department (59 per cent) choose to operate as sole traders, and are provided with bookings generated via the call centre. Work is allocated equitably.

         <li>
          The Green Loans program does not guarantee work for assessment companies or individuals, and each contract makes this clear.

           The Government

          made a commitment to deliver up to 360,000 home sustainability assessments through Green Loans, and this is being delivered.
         </li>
         <li>
          The Government understands that it is important for assessors to receive up to date information about the increasing demand for assessments, and this was done through newsletters eight times between September and December last year, and has been done another five times this year already.
         </li>
         <li>
          The Government will consider the future of the Green Loans program in the context of budget deliberations.
