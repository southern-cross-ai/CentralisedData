        Brain cancer day kills more adults under 40 in Australia than any other cancer, and more children than any other disease. While we have seen many great advances in other areas of medical research and technology, sadly, the prognosis for those diagnosed with brain cancer today has not improved in the past 30 years. There is still no cure, and, tragically, fewer than one in four will survive beyond five years of being diagnosed. I do have high hopes that the cure can and will be found.

        In the recent gathering on the lawns of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , the inaugural Head to the Hill event brought together brain tumour patients and their families and carers, and researchers and advocates. At this event I had the pleasure of meeting Zara Skepev, a truly remarkable and inspiring 14-year-old. Following in the philanthropic footsteps of her mother, Milena, who recently established the Australian

        Foundation, aspiring researcher Zara decided that she would help out with some fundraising of her own. Together with her best friend, Mila, Zara raised an incredible $14,325 for brain cancer research by crafting and selling their unique handmade earrings. This is an incredible achievement for any 14-year-old.
       </p>
       <p>
        Aware of the challenges faced by researchers in balancing motherhood and career, Zara decided to use all the funds to support brain cancer researchers in transitioning back to work following childbirth, hence the Zara Skepev Fund for Women in Brain Cancer Research was established at the

        â€”which, I am delighted to say, has already helped scientists to continue with their important research earlier than would otherwise have been possible.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's thanks to the efforts of inspirational people like Zara that we will find a cure and that lives will be saved. On behalf of every Australian who has been touched by this devastating illness: thank you, Zara.
