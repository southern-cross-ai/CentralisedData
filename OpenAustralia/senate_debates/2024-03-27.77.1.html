        I don't think that since
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PJ" rel="nofollow">

        Keating was Prime Minister and referred to this chamber as 'unrepresentative swill' has a minister shown such disdain for the processes of this Senate.
       </p>
       <p>
        I saw Minister
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Neil" rel="nofollow">
         O'Neil
        </a>
        , the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Home Affairs
        </a>
        , interviewed before I came to make this two-minute statement. She was throwing a tantrum because this Senate—we, the senators—have decided that we want time to scrutinise her most recent migration amendment bill. She wants parliament to get on and do its job. Well, I've got news for Minister O'Neil. Our job as the Senate—as a house of review and scrutiny—is not just to come in here like a herd of sheep and vote for her legislation simply because she presented it. Our job is to scrutinise and review that legislation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Maybe we should have a work experience program in the Senate. Minister O'Neil can come and do work experience in my office and see how the Senate works. She could see how the Legal and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Affairs_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Constitutional Affairs Committee
        </a>
        works in terms of giving stakeholders an opportunity to give their views on legislation—because they're the ones who are going to be impacted by them. Minister O'Neil, during her work experience in my office, can actually come along to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee and see how that committee scrutinises legislation and how it impacts the rights and liberties of everyday Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm sorry, Minister O'Neil, that we are such an inconvenience for you, but the checks and balances provided by this place, this house of review, are an absolutely integral part of our parliamentary democracy.
