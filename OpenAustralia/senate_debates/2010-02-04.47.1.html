               are seeking for these private health insurance bills not be put together because we have separate positions on each of the bills and we do not think it is therefore appropriate that the bills be taken together. We want the ability to be able to comment and vote on these bills separately because they are dealing with two separate issues. One is about means testing the rebate, which the Greens have been very clear about supporting; the other is about the increase to the Medicare surcharge levy, which the Greens have a different opinion on and would like to discuss separately. By putting these bills together, the government forces the debate to be taken together. I can see what they are trying to do; however, the Greens believe differently. We would like to be able to comment and potentially vote on the bills differently. We have made no bones about the fact—and I said this last time in the chamber—that we support the concept of means testing the rebate. We have a different opinion on the surcharge and we would like to be able to comment and vote on that differently. Rather than cause confusion during the committee process by debating these bills together, it would be better to deal with them separately. We are seeking to split the bills so that they can be dealt with separately.

                 are seeking to split the bills and deal with them separately. I do not believe that that would then alter the way you would deal with it in committee, quite frankly. We would be able to deal with them. As we deal with all bills, we deal with them in seriatim and the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_of_the_Whole" rel="nofollow">
                  Committee of the Whole
                 </a>
                 process is designed to ensure that the questions are put separately in relation to amendments to each particular bill. So I think you would achieve the same objective. In dealing with them separately, it means that you would have three second reading debates and you would then extend the period because people could then choose to speak on each individual bill. You would then have three separate committees of the whole. It would take a significant time. The government does object to that. Where bills are related bills they can be dealt with concurrently and it is a more sensible process, in the government’s view, to deal with them in that way. You are now seeking to use up more of the time of the Senate—and we all know that the time of the Senate is precious to deal with the legislative program which we have before us. Without going into a full-blown debate on this, I have indicated that the government’s position is to oppose the matter.

                  had not alerted us to the fact but we have some sympathy with them wishing to vote separately on the bills, as presented by Senator Siewert. I think we are inclined to support Senator Siewert on the understanding that that is the only way the Greens will be able to vote separately on the bills. In light of that, we will support the Greens.

                     . I have a question I would like to put to you, if that is appropriate. Given the government’s concerns about having three separate committee stages and also the concerns of the Greens that there be a separate vote—given that they have, as I understand it, a different position in relation to one of the bills—is it possible under the standing orders for there to be a

                     </a>
                     in respect of all the bills but then for there to be a separate vote with respect to the bills that are the subject of the Greens’ concerns?

                      Senator Xenophon, it is a matter for the committee to determine how to handle them. They can determine that they are going to handle them together or individually. That is not a matter for me to determine from the chair. Senator Xenophon, you will need leave now.

                         , to me the argument seems quite academic. If some senators—indeed the Greens and agreed to by us—want to deal with the bills separately, I do not see what the argument is about having the committee stage together. In any case, the committee stage will deal with each bill separately and, if there are amendments to each individual bill, they will be dealt with one after the other rather than all together. So I do not see that there is any problem with dealing with the whole three bills quite separately but one after the other.
