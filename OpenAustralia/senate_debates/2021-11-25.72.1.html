        Violence of any sort by one human being against another is an ugly and completely unacceptable activity which deserves unequivocal condemnation. Violence is assault and a crime. The law, rightly, seeks to protect each of us against the other in this regard; it's vital for an orderly civilised society.
       </p>
       <p>
        Into these self-evident observations comes the term with which I've had great difficulty: the concept of domestic violence. It's as though it's of a lower category or lesser significance. It is not. If anything it's worse, as it is inflicted on those who are entitled to believe in the trust and protection of the perpetrator. As I've said before, domestic violence is in fact a crime, and should be called out as such.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the informing experiences of my life was when I joined a group of fellow volunteers to establish a women's shelter in my local area. Serving on its inaugural committee and as its honorary legal adviser for a number of years, I saw and heard firsthand accounts which were simply horrifyingly ugly, not only physically but emotionally and psychologically as well. Not only is assault not okay, it's never acceptable, because it's a crime. And, while I've concentrated on violence against women, I recognise that family violence is a two-way street. But let's also recognise that the vast bulk of the traffic flows in one direction. Let's also recognise that it exists in all types of relationships: none, regrettably, is immune.
       </p>
       <p>
        Violence in all its forms is to be abhorred and considered criminal. Let this Christmas period be one of true peace, love and harmony amongst us all, especially in our households.
