         I thank Senator Cameron for his genuine interest in this policy area.

         widely considered the leading economics journal in the United Kingdom, published a paper titled
         <i>
          Broadband Infrastructure and Economic Growth
         </i>
         . Of course those opposite and their leader are known to dislike economists so it is entirely reasonable to assume that they have not bothered to read this document. But like many other studies before it, it found that an increase in broadband penetration would raise annual per capita

         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Interesting, and a much more relevant finding to Australia, was that it also found that fibre-to-the-home technology is the only broadband technology that can provide general-purpose technology benefits. General-purpose technologies like fibre to the home and electricity create ongoing improvements in GDP because they underpin other technologies and multiply their value. The paper explains:

         This paper was discussed in an article today in the

           This government has not shied away from tackling the tough reforms in the telecommunications sector, the tough reforms that will lock in productivity and social benefits that we believe that this country deserves. We all know that genuine competition will lead to more choice, more affordable prices and higher quality services for all Australians no matter where they live.
          </p>
          <p>
           Those opposite took a public monopoly, turned it into a private monopoly, and called it reform, and Australians were left to suffer the consequences of a broken industry structure which failed to deliver the investments in high-speed broadband, which the Gillard government is now delivering. It has taken the Gillard government to understand that true reforms of the telco sector and building the
