        I table a supplementary memorandum of understanding relating to the government amendments to this bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian government has committed to modernising laws and providing services on Norfolk Island comparable to those in mainland jurisdictions. The measures in this bill will authorise the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Norfolk_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Supreme Court of Norfolk Island
        </a>
        to sit on the Australian mainland in the exercise of its civil and criminal jurisdiction. It will allow for a matter to be heard and a jury to be empanelled in another state or territory. The measures are modelled on similar amendments made for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Christmas Island
        </a>
        in 1987. This measure will ensure trials can be conducted fairly, improving community confidence in the Norfolk Island justice system.
       </p>
       <p>
        Further measures in this bill will remove the time limits that apply to prosecution of historical sexual offences on Norfolk Island and remove any immunity for legal offenders arising from these limits. In doing so, the bill is consistent with Commonwealth criminal law policy that a prosecution for a serious offence may be commenced at any time after the commission of that offence. Time limits on prosecuting sexual offences, including historical sexual offences, and the immunity that may arise is no longer in line with community standards. Similar amendments have been made in other jurisdictions, including Victoria, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        . These measures also implement for Norfolk Island a key recommendation of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Commission
        </a>

        which recommended time limits and remaining immunity from prosecution for historical child sexual abuse offences be removed.
