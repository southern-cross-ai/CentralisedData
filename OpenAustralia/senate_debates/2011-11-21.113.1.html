        My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig. Can the minister explain why the government did not conduct modelling to determine the average increased electricity cost to farmers from the carbon tax and whether its compensation package would cover these costs? Given that farming is an industry that generates $155 billion a year in production, underpinning 12.1 per cent of

         Far from neglecting this area, the government has had its Carbon Farming Initiative, which is part of the Gillard government's commitment to reducing carbon emissions and building resilience in farmers to deal with the impact of climate change. Part of that is that the initiative will allow farmers to generate carbon credits and new earning opportunities through a range of activities.
        </p>
        <p>
         Only last week one of those visits to a piggery was about doing exactly that—using effluence to provide and generate carbon credits. One of the challenges from those opposite is that they have refused to get on board where the rural community is already getting on board. Consultation with stakeholders has indicated overwhelming support for the objectives of the Carbon Farming Initiative. Going back to that piggery, the farmers themselves significantly indicated that they were looking for low-carbon pork to go onto the market because they wanted to participate—

          , I rise on a point of order. As you know, the minister is required to be directly relevant to the question. The question asked why the government had neglected to model the farming sector for the carbon tax. That was the only topic of the question—why there had been no modelling of the farming sector for the carbon tax. I ask you to bring the minister to the question.

                    In relation to the national food plan, those opposite have failed to recognise, firstly, that we produced an issues paper and asked for information from stakeholders and those interested. Those opposite were completely uninterested in it because they are not interested in rural and regional Australia. We then announced a green paper-white paper process. There will be an opportunity for them—

                     , I ask a further supplementary question. Can the minister explain how the government will guarantee adequate compensation to farming families when an emissions trading scheme takes place in 2015 and the carbon price fluctuates according to the market?

                      will play a vital role. The difficulty is that they do not want to hear it. They have closed their minds and they have closed their ears to it. They are neglecting their own constituencies, whereas the Labor government will invest $4.3 billion in regional Australia—

                        $4.3 billion in investments in the 2011-12 budget to drive improvements in regional hospitals and to help education facilities and community and transport infrastructure. That is what this government is doing. When those on the other side were in government they neglected it. Why? Because the Nationals kept getting rolled by the Liberal Party—and they were happy to be rolled.
