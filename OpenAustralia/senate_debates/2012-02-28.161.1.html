        Following the recent release of the Gonski report on school funding, tonight I would like to focus on the Gillard government's reforms in school education and, indeed, challenge some of the comments often made by some opposition senators in this place in these areas. As a Labor government we are moving forward with reforms across a range of areas in school funding. We are introducing a new era of transparency through MySchool—not achieved by the opposition. We are implementing a national curriculum—not achieved by the former government. We are improving and empowering local schools. We are working towards a new funding system that is transparent and accountable and is fairly applied to all schools. We are partnering with school authorities in national partnerships for smarter schools, which are now achieving impressive results.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Gillard government has always understood that investing in education is a national priority. In total the government is investing $64.9 billion in school education over four years, twice as much as what the coalition spent in the previous four. Making sure we have world-class schools has never been more important as we face the challenges and opportunities of a changing global economy. We have seen recent reports highlighting this critical factor.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to focus for a moment on infrastructure investment. This is why we have already completed the largest school improvement program in our history, a $16.2 billion investment in the nation's education future. We have built libraries, science labs, classrooms and multipurpose halls. These are some of the facilities that will change the way our students learn. These facilities are an investment in our future and will deliver better educational outcomes for students.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recently I read with interest an article in the
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Telegraph" rel="nofollow">
          Daily Telegraph
         </a>
        </i>
        titled 'Catholic schools find bigger is better'. It spoke of utilising new facilities to provide children with an open learning environment and personalised learning. Classes that were in box-like facilities are now enjoying facilities that encourage teachers and students to work more effectively. I remember visiting Seaford Park Primary School last year to open a new $2 million multipurpose centre which is its first-ever permanent building as the rest of the school consists entirely of portables. Whilst the federal opposition gets a kick out of ridiculing the government's investment in education, these bricks and mortar are merely a foundation for the improvements we will see in the future. I have been excited by principals reporting changes to teacher performance as a result of these new facilities. These will bring with them an improvement in student outcomes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Research increasingly shows that teaching is a critical determinant of quality. A

        </i>
        report recently explored the effect of good teachers on student outcomes, noting, 'There is an increasingly compelling argument that the fundamental key to quality education outcomes is quality teaching.' If teacher quality is vital to student outcomes, how to attract and retain quality teachers and provide them with the best tools to teach effectively is important for any government. We now know that investing in school infrastructure is an investment in teacher quality. Instead of one teacher per classroom, teachers are now planning and working together. They are now able to provide each other peer support and accountability. The feedback from schools and principals is overwhelmingly positive. The long-term educational benefits will continue to flow to Australian students for years to come.
       </p>
       <p>
        But, with respect to the Gonski report, we need a funding system that also encourages educational benefits. The Gillard government continues its reform process as we believe we can do better here. Consistent with our other reforms we commissioned the first comprehensive review of school funding in almost 40 years. The report found that the current system is too complex and lacks transparency. It offers ideas for government to pursue that will further enhance our education system; and, as Minister Garrett noted last week at the school funding forum here in Canberra: 'The model proposed in the report is very different to the way schools are currently funded. All governments and stakeholders, mums and dads, teachers and principals need time to understand and work through what is proposed by the review panel.' Indeed, the review panel report recommends that much of their proposal be validated.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government will now consult with stakeholders, states and territories, parents and the community to better understand how the current system operates and their thoughts about how it can be improved in light of these recommendations. We want to hear from parents and teachers about how our schools should better be funded.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Prime Minister kick-started a nationwide discussion with Australian schools, teachers and parents. Last week I visited
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marist_Regional_College" rel="nofollow">

        and

        . Concerns were raised, details were discussed and feedback was given. I was encouraged by these visits and look forward to hearing from other schools about how to better fund our schools. In particular I am leading the work on capital funding and philanthropy.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Gonski report highlights a number of concerns about our ability as a nation to determine the adequacy of existing school facilities and to plan for the future needs of new and expanded schools. While we are open to continued discussion about the most effective way to deliver capital needs for schools, we do not envisage a significant expansion of the Commonwealth's current capital role. But I do look forward to working with the sector on ways to better fund school infrastructure into the future. We can take many lessons from our recent success delivering new classrooms and facilities to every school across the country. The government believes that every school, regardless of its location or sector, should offer facilities that provide its students with a high-quality, 21st century education.
