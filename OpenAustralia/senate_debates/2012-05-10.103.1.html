        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Disability Reform, Senator Evans. Why has the government allocated $1 billion for a National Disability Insurance Scheme over the next four years when the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">

         Given, again, the Howard government's record on this, it is a bit rich. I am very pleased to say that the budget included a strong commitment to the new National Disability Insurance Scheme, that we made a decision to bring forward the commencement of that scheme by a year, that the government allocated a very substantial investment in the commencement of that program.

         It has been very well received by the disability sector and the community more broadly. It has been recognised that the government has made a very serious attempt to deal with this long-standing neglect in the Australian community and the absence of appropriate support for people with a disability and their families and carers. We were hoping to have a bipartisan approach to this—

             Order! There is no point of order at this stage. The minister still has 32 seconds. I am listening, when I am given the opportunity, as closely to the answer as I can—with the interference that is coming from certain people on my right, which is not appreciated.

              I do not think anyone other than Senator Fifield has not acknowledged the serious commitment to reform the government has made to reform in this area. One billion dollars in this budget, at a time of a tight economic situation, is a very major achievement by the minister to make sure this is a priority for the government. And I point out that we have not followed exactly the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
               Productivity Commission

              recommendations; one of the things we have done is bring it forward. We have actually begun the scheme a year early—

               <p>
                I point out to Senator Fifield that, as I understand it, the Liberal Party's position is to set up a committee to look at this issue. But, if they are serious about it, no doubt we will see in the budget reply speech tonight a $4 billion commitment. No doubt tonight, in the budget reply, we will see the commitment from the Liberal Party to fully fund the recommendations of the Productivity Commission. Senator Fifield, I look forward to that commitment in the budget reply speech, and I look forward to discussing this matter with you further in the light of that speech.

                  It disappoints me that the Liberal Party want to play politics with this, but I will remind them that, in 12 years of government, they did nothing for people with disabilities—nothing! And they will do nothing tonight in the budget reply, I am sure. But, if there is $4 billion allocated, that will add to the $70 billion black hole they already have. People with a disability know the Liberal Party will do nothing to support this scheme; they also know that, to fund the $70 billion black hole that the Liberal Party has in its costings, it will have to cut health, it will have to cut education and it will have to cut support for people with disabilities. They know what your priorities are. They know that, without the mining tax and the other savings you will have to make, that sort of support will never come under a Liberal Party government. We have made a strong commitment, and the people I talk to are very grateful for that.
