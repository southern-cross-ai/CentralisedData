        <p>
         I will go through them in turn. The government proposes to move amendments in response to public feedback and recommendations from the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. We have agreed to address all of the committee's recommendations made in relation to amendments to the bill. This includes recommendations to sensibly adjust the complaints burden for political actors, including relevant charities. We have reduced red tape, simplified compliance arrangements and made penalties more proportionate to the size of any breaches while ensuring that the measures reducing regulatory burdens do not compromise the bill's ability to protect our national sovereignty. Importantly, these amendments clarify that spending solely on issue advocacy is not treated as electoral expenditure when that spending is not aimed at influencing voting in a federal location. The amendments also clarify the overlap of state and Commonwealth disclosure regimes, an issue that has arisen in recent state based litigation.
        </p>
        <p>
         These amendments ensure that federal law regulates federal elections, including political donations towards federal elections, and state and territory laws regulate donations for elections within their jurisdictions, namely state and local government elections. This week, we also have agreed to a further change, following discussion with the opposition, to make clear that communication that expressly promotes or opposes a member or senator is presumed to be a regulated electoral matter only where the matter relates to a federal election. In other words, criticism of a federal member in relation to their views on a state issue should not be presumed to be a federal electoral matter.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government has always been open to recommendations on how our bill could be further improved and we have appreciated, as I have indicated in my summing-up speech, the constructive work by the members of JSCEM to help us design a foreign donations ban that is effective and fair. The additional amendments on sheet UV100 simply add two explanatory notes to add additional clarity about circumstances where our amended bill will not interfere with state laws regulating state locations or local government elections.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government has listened to JSCEM concerns about particular scenarios where additional clarity is desirable. While the government's other amendments already address JSCEM's general concerns, the addition of these two explanatory notes also deal with a specific integrity risk that has been a point of concern. The notes include an example to make clear that silence about the purpose of a donation does not prevent the application of state law where a donation is ultimately used for a state purpose. Under section 15AD of the Acts Interpretation Act, an example like this has the effect of extending the operation of the relevant provision that it illustrates. Those notes recognise that a recipient may identify the true purpose of a gift at any time up until the time the money is spent. These notes explain that deciding to use a particular donation to pay a particular election expense will be enough to make an amount subject to the electoral laws of the relevant jurisdiction. These notes give a very strong level of assurance about where federal law starts and stops and where state law starts and stops.
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to some of the other amendments, I have moved government amendments which delete clauses from the bill to streamline obligations and reduce the regulatory burden. The government has already publicly explained in considerable detail where it is making changes to simplify the bill and this information has been released publicly through the website of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. I commend the government's amendments to the Senate.

          As I stated in my speech during the second reading debate, the opposition will be supporting this set of government amendments. These amendments are in direct response to the work undertaken by the opposition to fix the government's legislation.

           <p>
            Yes, that's right—continuing fearmongering in order to justify their opposition to a ban on foreign donations. It was Labor who negotiated this outcome to ensure that state law is protected, as the minister just indicated. Labor was incredibly concerned to hear that the Commonwealth law could be used under any circumstances to override or avoid state disclosure regimes and electoral regulation.
           </p>
           <p>
            The opposition believes in the right of state jurisdictions to determine their own electoral regulations and we requested that the government close this loophole immediately. Labor has sought constant assurances that state provisions will not be undermined by this bill. Provided this amendment is successful, that assurance and clarity has been provided. As we have stated throughout this process, Labor is committed to reviewing the operation of this legislation and will reserve the right to review the act and its application at a later date. Labor will not accept Commonwealth legislation being exploited by any party or political actor to avoid their obligation in state jurisdictions. I'd like to thank all of my colleagues in Queensland, in particular, for working constructively to ensure that state law is protected.
           </p>
           <p>
            Meanwhile, the Greens have never engaged in the process of reviewing this legislation and they've never sought the views of the opposition. At least former Senator Rhiannon would engage constructively in policy rather than merely grandstanding.

            <p>
             As I outlined earlier, whilst we acknowledge that this bill has been softened considerably in its impact on the not-for-profit and charitable sector, we are still concerned about the sheer weight of regulation that has now been placed, disproportionately, on that sector by this bill and by five years of attacks by this government on that sector. This amendment seeks to put beyond doubt that any activities conducted by the not-for-profit and charitable sector in furtherance of their charitable purposes are not then required to comply with this new barrage of regulations. So this is an amendment that seeks to ensure that charities are able to continue their legitimate activities in a way that isn't being muzzled by this government, which can't take criticism.

              The government will oppose this amendment. Where charities spend significant amounts of money to influence the outcome of an election they are already subject to disclosure requirements in the Electoral Act. This is necessary to protect the integrity of the electoral process and will continue to be the case.

               Charities Act
              </a>
              already prevents charities from engaging in partisan political activities. The Charities Act prohibits registered charities from having an overall purpose of promoting or opposing a political party or candidate for political office. However, this does not prevent registered charities from undertaking an activity of promoting or opposing a political party or candidate in pursuit of their broader charitable aim. For example, a charity focused on reducing homelessness might lawfully oppose a candidate seeking to eliminate public housing, to use an extreme example to demonstrate the point.

             <p>
              In the 2015-16 financial year, which included the last election campaign, third-party campaign groups spent almost $40 million on election advertising, polling and campaigning and, indeed, issuing how-to-vote cards. It is clear that elections are no longer just fought between political parties and candidates, and it is appropriate that all participants who choose to make significant amounts of political expenditure are subject to consistent transparency, disclosure and reporting requirements that apply to all other relevant political actors.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters considered evidence, including photographs in social media, showing charities and not-for-profits opposing the election of some candidates and promoting the election of other candidates. New political actors do not field candidates from their own ranks or seek to form government, but they actively seek to influence who gets elected and can sway the outcomes of elections. While this is a positive indication of the strength of Australian civil society and civic engagement in our democracy, it is important that these actors be subject to appropriate transparency and accountability rules when their election spending is significant.
             </p>
             <p>
              I would make the general point, which I have made on the public record on many occasions, that a blanket exemption of charities from, for example, the proposed ban in this bill on foreign political donations would make that ban entirely ineffective, because it would create a massive loophole and a massive incentive for those foreign actors intent on influencing the outcome of elections here in Australia to channel their donations through relevant charitable organisations.
             </p>
             <p>
              We have considered the views, assessment and recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, and we believe that we have ended up with an appropriate balance. Of course, issue advocacy is important and will not be affected through this bill, but, where there is significant expenditure to a relevant level on political campaigns, of course the same or similar transparency, disclosure and reporting requirements should apply and the same ban on foreign political donations should apply.

               . Labor has worked with the charities and not-for-profits for almost a year, guaranteeing that the bill before the Senate, the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Funding and Disclosure Reform) Bill 2017, protects public policy advocacy. Labor has approached this debate and the year of negotiations that has preceded it with careful consideration of why the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Electoral_Act" rel="nofollow">
                Commonwealth Electoral Act
               </a>
               exists and the important role it plays in ensuring any organisation that seeks to influence an election meets the expectations of the Australian public, especially relating to transparency. In advocating for the charities and the not-for-profits, Labor has ensured that the very definition of 'electoral matter' is sensibly defined. Our changes, moved today by the government, have ensured that those who should not bear the burden of political actors do not and that those who seek to influence elections are regulated appropriately.
              </p>
              <p>
               Labor has always opposed seeking blanket exemptions in the Commonwealth Electoral Act, and the reason is clear: blanket exemptions, regardless of their intent, create loopholes in our law. Any organisation seeking to deliberately influence an election, insofar as it is still captured by the narrow definition negotiated by Labor, should comply with those transparency measures outlined in the revised bill and the ban on using foreign money. We cannot support an exemption where those seeking to deliberately influence an election can hide behind an unintentional loophole of charitable purpose. That is not good government, not good policy and not good for our charities.

                 There has obviously been a level of public debate and public reporting here in Australia over the last two years in relation to these matters. As I've indicated in my summing-up speech and also in introducing the amendments, Australia is actually one of very few Western democracies in which foreign donors can still influence domestic elections. In the United States, for example, if you are foreigner, you are not allowed to donate towards a presidential or congressional election.

                   You're not allowed to run for president, that's right. That counts the two of us out, Senator Farrell. But Australia is one of the few Western democracies in which foreign donors can still influence domestic elections. Senator Hanson would remember that the government announced some time ago now, I think this time last year, a package of reforms, of which this is a component, to protect Australia from undue foreign interference in our internal democratic processes.

Under our Constitution we are not able to ban donations from Australian residents or from Australian companies, so this ban on foreign political donations has been structured to be as effective as possible, as mindful of the limitations in terms of our authority to legislate to that effect under our Constitution.

                      Minister, under the Electoral Act you would be changing the electoral funding so it is actually going to be on receipts—is that correct? So $10,000 if you receive four per cent of the vote, and you will automatically receive $10,000 if your electoral funding is more than that? In that case, for anything over $10,000, is it that all candidates, all political parties, must submit their receipts to the Electoral Commission for electoral funding?

                       I thank Senator Hanson for that question. Public funding entitlements have not changed under this bill. Public funding will continue to be payable in relation to candidates that receive at least four per cent of formal first preference votes and will be calculated in the same way. What has changed is the process. To assist less well financed candidates and to minimise red tape, the first $10,000 of funding will continue to be paid automatically shortly after polling day. A claim setting out electoral expenditure will need to be submitted for more than the first $10,000 to be paid. The amount of public election funding paid will be capped at the amount of electoral expenditure specified in the claim. Claimants must keep records of claimed electoral expenditure for five years after polling day. Records are likely to be receipts and invoices in most instances. In examining claims, the
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Electoral_Commission" rel="nofollow">
                        Australian Electoral Commission
                       </a>
                       will be checking that claimed electoral expenditure is accurate and unique. In other words, no double-dipping by claiming the same expense in different claims, for example for different states, or claiming fictional expenditure. Like the way the tax office checks for fraud in claimed tax credits, the Australian Electoral Commission will have flexibility in determining what they need to do to conduct this check at any particular time. This flexibility allows them to minimise red tape. For example, if the Australian Electoral Commission determines there is a high risk that claims will be inaccurate, they might require that all receipts are submitted with the claim. Or they might decide to randomly select claims for audit and ask to see selected claimants' receipts. If they determine there is a low risk of fraudulent claims at a particular time or for a particular type of claimant, they might not ask to see proof of electoral expenditure at all. As the Senate is well aware, the Australian Electoral Commission of course is an independent statutory organisation which acts in an entirely non-partisan fashion.

                        In your amendment 112, item 33, at the end of subsection 302CA(3), you've got:

                       <p class="italic">
                        … a gift recipient may identify the electoral process for which a gift is to be used at any time prior to using that gift.

                       <p>
                        There is no specification in this as to what the limit or the cost of the gift is. It's just reference to 'a gift'. What is the gift—in relation to what cost?

                         The relevant limits are of course specified in other parts of the bill and in the amendments, but this is a highly technical question. Given that this will require my advisers to review and reference a number of different parts of the bill, I suggest that we deal with some other matters and I will get back to the chamber at the earliest opportunity.

                            These amendments relate to, firstly, the commencement date of these new laws. Importantly, amendment (2) goes to whether or not the federal government can override state donation rules. Senator Farrell has received advice that is in conflict with the advice that I've received, and I've formed my own view on the effect of the amendments. My understanding is that, as the bill is currently drafted, it will still enable property developers to avoid the donations ban that would otherwise apply in Queensland. My understanding is that the Queensland laws will now need to be amended to require that donations be placed into a separate bank account. If that amendment goes through the Queensland parliament—presumably it will—we won't have a problem. But until such time as that amendment occurs, this bill enables the developer donation ban to be circumvented.
                           </p>

                            I take objection to the description of my legal view of that as being grandstanding. It's quite the contrary. We're actually trying to clean up politics here. We're trying to get big money out of politics and we're trying to make sure that the rules that were brought in in Queensland by your counterpart, Senator O'Farrell, are effective. So we have moved this amendment in—

                               Sorry. It was my mistake, Senator Farrell. I do apologise. It was not deliberate. I apologise. So that was amendment (2). I'll just move to briefly outline amendment (3). We are seeking here to lower the disclosure threshold for donations to $1,000. We think that enables far more public scrutiny of what money is being received by whom and, in particular, by which political parties.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                               Amendment (4) goes to the fact that, at the moment, membership fees aren't considered donations and moneys provided to political parties to attend fundraising events are also not considered donations. There is so much dark money flowing around, going into the coffers of the larger political parties, that is not properly accounted for and that is not able to be scrutinised by the public. This amendment, amendment (4), would say that those contributions are to be considered a donation and therefore should be subject to the other rules that donations are subject to; namely, the disclosure threshold—and, if our amendment is successful—a cap on the amount. I moved those four amendments, as listed earlier.

                                The government will not be supporting any of the Greens amendments. The first Greens amendment would change the commencement date to push back commencement until after the next election, rather than allowing a ban on foreign political donations to come into effect from proclamation, which would be well and truly in time, before the next election, to ensure we can prevent inappropriate foreign political interference in our next federal election. I don't quite know why the Greens would want to help facilitate continued foreign political interference in our Australian federal election next year. I don't understand the intent behind this amendment, to be honest. It would be bad policy to deliberately delay the start of a foreign political donations ban until after the next election, given the increased evidence around the world of the risk of foreign interference in elections. The parliament needs to act in a timely way to prevent future risks to our democracy.

                                In relation to amendment (2) Senator Waters is entirely incorrect—Senator Waters is not correct—in her assertion that Queensland laws would need amendment to avoid conflict with federal law. I can only assume that Senator Waters hasn't sufficiently reviewed government amendments that were passed through this chamber a few minutes ago. The government's amendments make it clear that the mere decision to spend a donation on a state electoral expense will invoke state law. That's a very important point. The mere decision to spend a political donation on a state electoral expense will invoke state law.
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                The government's intent here has been very clear from the start. We have worked successfully with the opposition to refine the way that we are approaching this. Our intent is to ensure that there is clarity, that federal laws regulate federal elections and that state laws regulate elections under state jurisdictions; principally state and local government elections. We also believe it's very important there is clarity for all of the impacted stakeholders who have to comply with various regulatory regimes in terms of where the boundary is between federal law and the regulation of federal elections and state law and the regulation of elections under state jurisdiction.
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                Government amendments comprehensively dealt with the Commonwealth and state law interactions. This amendment would reverse those changes. If the government's amendments were not made, there would be ambiguity for regulated entities and, in light of recent court decisions, overlap between various state, territory and Commonwealth laws on political donations. Any ambiguity and overlap would increase the regulatory compliance burden for affected entities, with multiple laws in different jurisdictions applying to the same financial transaction. On that basis we would urge the Senate not to support this Greens amendment.
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                In relation to the disclosure threshold, this amendment would reduce the disclosure threshold from $13,800 to $1,000. This amendment is very badly drafted, because it not only impacts donors but also has the consequence of reclassifying numerous very small organisations as third-party campaigners if they spend more than $1,000 in a year on electoral expenses.

                                would tie up the sectors that they supposedly support in massive additional red tape; they would choke the charitable sector in massive additional red tape. This change alone would, as I say, drag numerous not-for-profit and charitable organisations under the new reporting rules for third parties. This would sweep up tiny groups like neighbourhood associations,

                                branches, footy clubs and other tiny players who comment favourably or adversely on a federal politician or federal party. This extreme change in this third amendment, in terms of expanding the reporting net, has not been discussed, as I understand it, with the charitable or non-profit sector, and, unlike other major amendments, was not considered by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. You see, we, the government, have exposed ourselves to proper process; we have exposed ourselves to thorough, constructive and good-faith engagement with the opposition, and so we have a high level of confidence that there is broad support—perhaps not 100 per cent support—for the balance that we have reached. This third amendment would be an extreme change in the reporting net and, as I say, would actually have a massively negative impact on the charitable and not-for-profit sector, which the Greens assert they are standing up for in this chamber today.

                                The fourth amendment, redefining gifts, is in our assessment lacking in logic. The amendment would treat the cost of food at a fundraising event as if it were a gift. By contrast, the government's amendments, which are supported by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, have greater logic, because it is only the profit component of an event price that should be treated as a gift.

                                 amendments seek to place obligations on donors but not on recipients of donations, a clear loophole allowing those receiving donations to flout the law. Most troubling, the Greens amendments seek to delay the commencement of this legislation until after the next federal election, allowing foreign donations to flow into the coffers of political parties for the next poll. Labor has longstanding policy for electoral reform, including lower disclosure and shorter disclosure times. However, the Greens again are seeking to conflate, with a series of poorly drafted changes, the issues that Labor has been negotiating with our trusted charities for close to a year.

                                 The substantive issue here is a foreign donations ban. Labor has sought to ensure that third parties and charities are protected from the government's overreach without creating further issues within the

                                 . Labor believes the issues surrounding disclosure require further consideration and consultation with those third parties that we have worked so hard to protect. Labor, as a party of government and as a party who wants the system to work, is committed to addressing these matters constructively and will always do so.

                                         No—Mrs Zou, for instance. If we take the last state election in

                                         , there was Sally Zou's contribution to the Liberal Party. She originally wrote a cheque for $1 million which she then took a selfie of, and we understood she was going to donate that to the Liberal Party in South Australia. A $1 million donation by a foreign citizen to a state campaign is a very large amount of money. We had every reason to believe that it was correct that she was going to do that, because she had already set up a foundation. I might have the name of this incorrect, but it was something like the Julie Bishop Glorious Foundation. I see Senator Cormann is laughing there. He would know much more about this particular donation. You wanted me to name one. I think there is a number there that you can refer to. I would be happy, Senator Hanson, to go back and try to provide you with as much information as I can get on all of the political donations.

                                         Just so I'm not seen to be partisan, the reality is that the Labor Party has also been receiving donations from these foreign groups, and we will lose those funds from these foreign groups. But I have to point out that our leader six months ago took the very principled stand of saying, 'We will stop accepting those foreign donations.' So, yes, we have in the past, as a political organisation, accepted foreign donations. It has been legal, up until this legislation, for Australian political parties to do that.

                                         took the principled stand that we would no longer receive or accept political donations. You might recall that, in my initial speech on this matter, I called on the government to take that same principled stand today when this legislation passes and not to wait until it passes the lower house.

                                          I'm very disappointed that my good friend and valued colleague Senator Farrell allowed himself to be provoked into partisanship, but the only thing that I could detect in the garbled first half of his contribution was that he was talking about a donation that never happened. It took him a very long time to get to the proposition that there was some suggestion of a donation that might happen but never happened. He didn't quite get to that conclusion, but that was the effect of what I heard him say.

                                          Let me give a more coherent answer to the question that Senator Hanson has asked. At present, while details of political donations above the threshold of $13,800 need to be disclosed under the current rules, it is often not possible to ascertain whether a foreign source is involved. Thus it is not possible to ascertain, under the current disclosure rules, how common foreign donations are or what their value is. However, we do know that preventing undue foreign influence and the perception of such undue influence is critical to our democracy. Our amendments will increase the transparency and assurance about the source of donations to help keep foreign donations out of Australian elections.
                                         </p>
                                         <p>
                                          Media reports increasingly document foreign attempts to influence elections around the world, which is a disturbing development. As I've indicated, Australia is one of the very few Western democracies in which foreign political donations are not as yet prohibited. It is good electoral reform housekeeping for us to catch up with what is already the prevailing law in most other Western democracies. Nobody can actually tell you with precision what has happened in the past, but, given international developments, given what's clearly been a matter of public debate in Australia for some time and given the views and the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters on what should happen here, this is the best way forward. I hasten to add that it was, of course, the Liberal-National government that put forward this legislation. We put forward this legislation a year ago. It would have been great if we could have passed it more quickly, but we did think it was important to get this right in time for the next election, which is why we engaged in good faith with all relevant stakeholders and the opposition. I was somewhat saddened to see that that level of constructive bipartisanship disappeared for a moment.

                                           I commend the government, the opposition and Labor on their stance against foreign donations; the principal parties now won't take these because of the influence it may have over their political decisions in this place. So I ask this question: what is the difference between receiving foreign donations and receiving donations from organisations, corporations or developers—for instance, in the tobacco industry, as the Greens have said? Will these organisations not have influence over government policy?

                                            , Australians—including Australian businesses, Australian organisations and Australian residents—are entitled to participate in our democracy. There's nothing wrong with Australians seeking to influence each other in terms of how they ultimately vote. The ultimate decision is a decision for individual voters who vote in secrecy. That is, of course, the way the process works. What we are very deliberately seeking here is to prevent attempts of foreign interference in our domestic democratic process. In particular, through the ban on foreign political donations, we are seeking to prevent and prohibit influence by foreign donors on our Australian democratic process. In terms of attempting to do what Senator Hanson appears to be suggesting we should consider, which is similar to what the Greens appear to have been suggesting, the best available advice we have is that that would not be constitutionally sustainable.

                                                 This is an amendment that would allow and require real-time disclosure of donations made to political parties. I'll move some other amendments that say we think that shouldn't happen for particular vested interests that have a stranglehold on our democratic decision-making process, and I'll move separately another amendment that says we think all donations should be capped at $1,000, because we don't think big money should play a role in decision-making, but this particular amendment relates to real-time disclosure. I will be very interested to see how the chamber votes on this issue because I understand, in fact, that there's some agreement that this is a good idea. Will those parties have the courage to actually vote for it? That is what I am very keen to know.

                                                 I want to hearken back to the fact that we've had some by-elections recently. By the time we get to the next general election, the public still won't know who donated to the large political parties at those by-elections, yet we'll be at the next election. So how on earth are people meant to know who is pulling the strings? It's pretty clear that the big donors are pulling the strings, but these parties don't want to tell the public who is donating to them.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                 So that's why this amendment would give the public the right to know who's paying these folk who are making decisions on behalf of their donors to promote the donors' vested interests and putting the community a distant last. These amendments would give the community a right to know so that, when people cast their vote, they are doing so in full knowledge of the priorities of the people that they might consider voting or not voting for.

                                                  The government will not be supporting this amendment, nor will we support the other amendment that relates to this particular proposition. It's quite strange, in our view, that the Greens propose that the onus of making real-time disclosure should only be on the donor and not on the political parties that benefit and can most efficiently undertake reporting. This amendment is also contrary to a fundamental principle in the bill in that it would create inconsistency between the transparency of donations to parties and that of donations to political campaigners. I leave it to observers and analysts to speculate as to why that would be. The government's view is that organisations which spend over half a million dollars a year on federal election expenditure, including

We believe that donations over $1,000 should be disclosed and disclosed quickly. Labor has a strong record on transparency in politics, and we approach every issue on the facts before us. As I've stated before, including to members of the crossbench in our discussions on this legislation, real-time disclosure at a federal level requires a significant consultation with the

                                                     There are longstanding transparency, disclosure and reporting requirements under the Electoral Act, as it stands, that apply to political parties and other relevant political actors, principally associated entities. That is a longstanding arrangement and it is not something that is changed with this bill. What we are doing in this bill is adding a further category—the category of political campaigner—as a new category of political actor that has to comply with the relevant disclosure, transparency and reporting requirements and will be subject to the same ban on foreign political donations. I mentioned the example of

Off the top of my head, I seem to remember that at various times GetUp! bragged that they had distributed half a million or a million how-to-vote cards—I can't remember, so I'll get it back to you on notice, but half a million or a million seems to ring a bell. I think it was a million how-to-vote cards at 500 polling booths. I'll check it out and get back to you.

                                                     The point is that all organisations, including unions, businesses and individuals, have to comply with the requirements in terms of disclosure and reporting that are already in place. The bill in front of us strengthens those requirements in relation to some organisations that currently are not captured. It also ensures that we put in place a ban on foreign political donations, which we believe is widely supported across the chamber.

                                                       I will outline for the chamber the effect of these amendments. We have already seen how enormous the influence of big corporates is over this chamber, and the public are absolutely sick of the vested interests of donors getting put ahead of the interests of the community. This amendment would seek to ban donations from eight of the most influential and self-interested industries that so far have had a stranglehold over this parliament. This amendment would completely ban donations from the property development industry, mining, tobacco, alcohol, gambling, the big banks, defence and big pharma. The Australian people have the right to expect that decisions are made in their interests and not in the interests of those big corporations. There have previously been some comments about the questionable constitutionality of these amendments. I would simply direct anyone interested in that to the

                                                       case. We are perfectly able to have those restrictions; it is simply a question of whether or not the big parties want their money to dry up. I am not expecting support for this amendment, because we know that both of the big parties have taken $100 million in donations from the big corporates in the last six years, but we live in hope.

                                                        Let me firstly agree with something that Senator Waters has said: the Australian people are absolutely entitled to expect that decisions be made in their interest. Do you know who judges to what extent is we have made decisions in their interest? The judge of that is the Australian people at every election. That is the process. Senator Waters is essentially implying that the Australian people are too stupid to form their judgements in relation to how individual candidates or relevant parties are performing. This is clearly just part of the democratic discourse.
                                                       </p>
                                                       <p>
                                                        If there is a level of concern about policies, and a view by the Greens about what influences certain policies, then under our democratic system you are entitled to express that view and to inform the Australian people. The Australian people might believe you and then they will vote for you if they think that it is a really terrible thing that there is a particular policy that supports the mining industry, the farming sector or access to pharmaceutical products. If people share your view that that is a bad thing, they'll vote for you; if they believe that policies that support the mining sector, the agricultural sector, the education sector and access to pharmaceutical products for patients across Australia are good things then they will support relevant candidates and parties who promote those particular policy agendas. That is the way democracy works: if you have a concern, you point out your concern and seek to persuade the Australian people of your point of view. Ultimately the Australian people are the judge.
                                                       </p>
                                                       <p>
                                                        I also agree with Senator Waters—so there are two agreements in relation to one amendment; I am sure the senator is very surprised by that—that the Senate will be opposing this amendment, because the Greens are proposing an entirely arbitrary ban on eight different specific categories of businesses from giving donations. There are clear questions of constitutionality. Senator Waters dismisses this. Clearly Senator Waters doesn't believe in freedom of political communication, but some of us do believe in freedom of political communication.
                                                       </p>
                                                       <p>
                                                        A level of internal logic and consistency is also lacking. For example, under the Greens amendment, businesses manufacturing pharmaceuticals would be banned, but not those involved in distribution or sale of such products. If you are involved in the manufacture of tobacco you are banned, but if you are involved in the distribution of tobacco you are fine. Even more unusually, the proposed ban will put only donors at risk of criminal offences while keeping it lawful for a recipient to accept such a gift. That doesn't sound very internally consistent.
                                                       </p>
                                                       <p>
                                                        The more fundamental point is that, under our Constitution, under our principles, under the constitutional principle of implied political freedom of communication, the best advice that we have is that this would not be constitutionally sustainable. In any event, we have great confidence that the Australian people voting at elections are very capable of making judgements on what they think is right and wrong.

I can understand what they are saying, but then again I find it very hypocritical because the Greens are quite happy to take their donations from environmental groups and organisations that are quite happy to see mining, which provides jobs in Australia, shut down. It actually brings in resources and royalties to our nation—a lot of money. And they are quite happy to shut down the fishing industry, with lost jobs again. And, of course, with their native vegetation management acts they are actually destroying Queensland's farming sector. In that case, they are quite happy to take their political donations—

Coming to amendment (7), there has been a lot of talk here, particularly in relation to the last amendments, where only the Greens and a couple of our other colleagues voted to oppose donations from large corporate vested interests. Some of the earlier criticism was, 'You're singling out these people unfairly.' Folks, now is your chance! This amendment would say that all donations will be capped at $1,000 per year. We don't care who you are—absolutely everyone, whether you're an individual, a union or a business: no more donations of more than $1,000 a year. We genuinely want to clean up politics, and this is how you do it.

                                                             There is a small step forward in this bill that restricts some foreign donations. We think you can drive a truck through the loopholes. We want to fix those loopholes with an amendment just like this. Let's get big money out of politics. Let's put people back into the heart of decision-making. Now is your chance to show whether you actually want to fix this problem or whether you just want to look like you're doing something in the hope that this issue goes away. The community wants something done about this. There is widespread support for this amendment. Getting big money out of politics is the single most common issue raised with me as I move around the state and the country.

                                                                The committee has already voted on the substance of the issue that Senator Waters is raising. Greens amendment (7) on sheet 8546 revised is in fact redundant, because it is a consequential amendment in relation to some previous amendments that the committee has already voted to reject. So it should, in fact, have been withdrawn because it can't actually have the effect that Senator Waters is advising the chamber it would have.
                                                               </p>

                                                                Even if this amendment were to apply in the context of the government's bill, it also introduces imprisonment for gifting over the disclosure threshold, which is explicitly contrary to what the cross-party Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, which considered these matters carefully, recommended. So the Greens are proposing to introduce imprisonment offences. But, as I've indicated, this amendment is, in fact, redundant because it is consequential to some amendments that have already been rejected by the committee.
                                                               </p>

                                                                This amendment also lets political campaigners off the hook. Again, I'm not quite sure why the Greens political party takes the view that political campaigners spending substantial amounts of money on political campaigns in the lead-up to elections, seeking to influence election outcomes, should not be subject to the same disclosure, transparency and reporting requirements and the same ban on foreign political donations as other political actors, including political parties. The government's view is that they should apply on the same basis or a similar basis to all those actors.

It is not a consequential amendment. I have renumbered it. It is a standalone amendment, and I stand by everything I've said. Your vote will be very telling.
