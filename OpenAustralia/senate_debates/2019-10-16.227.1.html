       <p>
        I am delighted to rise today to acknowledge the 170th anniversary of the Launceston Chamber of Commerce. Located just a block from my electorate office, the Launceston chamber is the oldest chamber of commerce in Australia. It is an organisation that my family and I have had a longstanding association with.
       </p>
       <p>
        Earlier this month, the Tasmanian Premier, state Treasurer, Minister Ferguson, Bridget Archer MP and the Launceston mayor joined Launceston Chamber of Commerce members and board members and their guests to celebrate this magnificent milestone with an event at Country Club Tasmania. It certainly was an occasion that deserved high recognition.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the chamber marks this significant anniversary and looks forward to continuing for yet another 170 years, I thought it appropriate to reflect on its history. The Launceston Chamber of Commerce was established in August 1849, with a remit that still stands today: to boost Launceston's economy. Its first meeting was held on 22 August 1849, after Mr
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JW" rel="nofollow">

        Gleadow and 15 other merchants placed an advertisement in the local newspaper,

         </a>
        </i>
        , inviting fellow colonists to meet them 'for the purpose of deliberating such measures as may be proposed for benefitting the commercial and maritime, as well as the agricultural interests, of this country'. Mr Gleadow was voted as the chair, with all 16 businessmen forming the first standing committee. At that meeting, Mr Munro was voted secretary and convener and Mr Henty treasurer. One of the first undertakings by the newly elected chamber treasurer, Mr Henty, was to make a 'prompt demand for sixpence on each gentleman present',
        <i>
         The Examiner
        </i>
        reported at the time.
       </p>
       <p>
        The chamber was originally set up to promote the community's commercial, industrial and civic interests through cooperation with different levels of government. Other discussion points included opening up country districts, port development, marketing, transport, industrial relations, immigration, relations between farmers and businessmen and defending Tasmania's interests when it came to federal shipping policies.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the time the chamber was formed, Launceston—and indeed

        </a>
        —was already establishing itself as a place of innovation and action. Convicts were still being transported to the state, although it was not long after that that the Australasian Anti-Transportation League was established to end this activity. Australia's first operation with anaesthetic had recently been undertaken by Dr William Russ Pugh at St John's Hospital, which is now

        , Launceston. During that operation, Dr Pugh had used equipment he had designed from a magazine article. In 1849 the chamber and its members acted as an advocate for the advancement of the whole community, but meetings were conducted free of politics.
       </p>
       <p>
        One hundred years later, during its centenary year in 1949,
        <i>
         The
        </i>
        <i>
         Examiner
        </i>
        reported that the Launceston Chamber of Commerce:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … owes its initiation to a desire to increase individual and community success and prosperity. During its existence it has shown a practical belief in the outstanding value of self-help.
       </p>
       <p>
        The article went on to state:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        One hundred years ago a number of businessmen of Launceston felt that there was need for action to combat the effects of trading systems. Particularly were they alarmed at the repression, by ad valorem duties, of traffic in commerce with the adjacent colonies.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This, it was pointed out, was a serious matter for the man engaged in commerce and agriculture, for it was realised at that early date that the two were interdependent, that the towns could not prosper unless the country districts around them prospered.
       </p>
       <p>
        There have been many changes within the Launceston business community in the past 170 years, not least that chamber of commerce members now number men and women. However, the chamber's original ideas and goals do not differ much from those discussed today. Launceston businesses still celebrate their connections with the surrounding agricultural districts; and the city still works towards better trading relationships with Hobart and the state's regions, as well as with mainland Australia and internationally.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now, the 2019 vision of the Launceston Chamber of Commerce speaks about how the region's economy is reinvigorated and how the business community is innovative, sustainable and globally engaged, all of which creates somewhere people choose to live, work and invest. The organisation has continued to support Greater Launceston businesses through advocacy on issues such as public holiday consolidation, premises security during a rise in CBD burglaries, and job losses when companies have closed. It also recognises business excellence in the region during its annual awards program.
       </p>
       <p>
        Launceston was a dynamic business centre 170 years ago and continues to be so today. I congratulate the Launceston Chamber of Commerce board.
