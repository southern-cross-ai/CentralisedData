        I wish to ask a question of the Minister for Women's Economic Security, Senator Hume. Can the minister please update the Senate on the recently announced labour force figures, especially with regard to women's employment and how the Liberal and National government's economic plan is supporting our recovery and delivering economic opportunities for Australian women?

         for this question. The Morrison government's plan to drive down unemployment in Australia is working. More Australians are in a job now than before the COVID-19 pandemic and the COVID induced recession that it brought about. Importantly, the Morrison government's economic plan is delivering for Australian women specifically. Workforce figures published recently for May highlight that there are more women in the workforce now than ever before. There are even more women in the workforce now than the record female participation rates that were achieved in April this year. Overall unemployment has dropped to 5.1 per cent from April to May. The number of employed women has increased by 69,000 in May—that's 1.6 per cent above the start of pandemic levels. The good news doesn't stop there. The hours worked are also up: now 4.1 per cent higher for women than prior to the pandemic. In addition, more women who want additional hours are able to get them, with female underemployment now 1.9 per cent lower than prior to the pandemic. This is the lowest rate in over a decade.
        </p>
        <p>
         These are not just numbers; these are Australian women who are getting ahead. These are Australian women who are improving their lives, who are getting more hours of work than ever before. Each one of these success stories is a story of independence. It's a story of women taking control and managing their own economic security, their own economic wellbeing and their own future prosperity, as well as securing our economic recovery and strengthening Australia. There are few things in this world more important to women's economic security than a good job, and the Morrison government is delivering on exactly that for Australian women.

           Minister, it's disappointing that those on the other side are so uninterested in women's participation. I ask you to continue to outline to the Senate the most recent women's workforce participation figures and what is driving them.

             . You're right; I couldn't really hear the question, but I'll guess what it was. The most recent women's workforce participation rate is higher than has ever been recorded in Australia. Increasing by nearly four per cent in the course of 2021, the latest women's workforce participation rate beats Australia's record figures in April this year. Senator
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald" rel="nofollow">

             </a>
             asked what might be driving this increase in economic participation. Well, it's the Morrison government's strong economic management and this government's plan for a stronger Australia that are delivering for Australian women. But the Morrison government is also providing more women with more choice by reducing the cost pressures of child care. With even more support announced in the 2021-22 budget, women will have the incentive to stay connected to their employer and to work that extra day or those extra hours should they wish to do so.

                again, and I'm very glad you asked, because the present gender pay gap is in fact at a record low—a record low of 13.4 per cent. It's no coincidence, because it's coalition governments that drive the gender pay gap lower. In fact, when the coalition left government in 2007, the gender pay gap was 15.4 per cent and on its way down. However, when Labor came to government, they oversaw a gender pay gap that went as high as 17.4 per cent. That's right; the gender pay gap in Australia went up considerably under Labor. It's taken a coalition government to get this figure back on the right trajectory, heading down once again.

                  And we won't stop here. In the 2021-22 budget, we announced a targeted review of the Workplace Gender Equality Agency, with the aim of pushing that gender pay gap even lower. Australians know that it's the Morrison government that delivers those opportunities for Australian women. Real equality is not about platitudes; it's about opportunity.
