          In one of life's strange coincidences, after sailing in the Sydney to Hobart last Christmas, I was down at the docks buying a coffee and I got chatting to a guy at the bar, who wanted to buy me a drink. He then insisted that I come and sit with his group. After a few minutes, I realised that this group of people I was sitting with had sailed also from Sydney to Hobart. They were a group of veterans called Mates4Mates, a support network for veterans. They had actually sailed a boat down and had trained—and they work with philanthropists. To cut a long story short, as we parted ways after one or two rum-and-cokes, they made me swear that I would try and do something about support for veterans.

          I am pleased today to have Labor's support and support from the crossbench to get the Senate to look at something that was raised very recently by

          : the dire situation for veterans in this country with regard to suicide, homelessness and mental health issues. I thank the Labor Party and the crossbenchers for their support.

             The government acknowledge the unseen psychological wounds from conflict and training, and we are resolutely committed to caring for those carrying physical or psychological scars as a result of their service. The government understand the unique nature of military service and the importance of providing comprehensive and timely support to veterans with mental health conditions.

             spends almost $179 million a year on meeting the mental health needs of the veterans and ex-service community and has developed a range of significant resources to support them, and this expenditure is demand driven and not capped.
            </p>
            <p>
             The government have also launched the $5 million Transition and Wellbeing Research Program as part of its ongoing commitment to support ADF personnel and their families. This initiative represents the largest and most comprehensive program of study undertaken in Australia to examine the impact of military service on the mental, physical and social health of serving and ex-serving personnel who have deployed to contemporary conflicts, and their families.
