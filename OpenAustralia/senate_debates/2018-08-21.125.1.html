             <p>
              The Centre Alliance has no objection to improvements being made to the child support system. This motion stems, actually, from questions asked in Senate estimates asking for the cost. In fact, it goes back even further, to a Senate inquiry into digital services, where the department were simply unable to answer a question on how much they've spent on the system. I don't mind an upgrade, but it's irresponsible to not understand what resources have been assigned, how much money has been spent and when the system will be completed. In asking questions, and indeed in writing to the minister and getting no response, I've had to ask for an order for production of documents so that I can then inspect the project material myself. So I urge the Senate to support this motion.
