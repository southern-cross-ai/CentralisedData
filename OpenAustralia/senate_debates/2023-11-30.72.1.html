        I rise to pay tribute to the outgoing chair of Equality Australia, Mr Tom Snow. Very few people have a material impact on a massive social reform like marriage equality, but Mr Tom Snow is one such person. He made an outsized contribution to the delivery of a very important and critical reform in our country, which we're all proud of.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tom was a founding chair of Equality Australia, which has done enormously good work in engaging on behalf of the

         LGBTQI
        </a>
        community over the last few yearsâ€”often in very difficult and challenging circumstances. Tom has always held himself with grace and dignity, even in the most challenging circumstances, and I want to pay tribute to his personal qualities of being a great organiser and a great campaigner, while also a very compassionate and decent person who has held himself in such grace.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tom, just this week, has been able to avail himself of these new laws. He's married his partner, Doug, in front of his children, and that is a wonderful thing that has happened. This was a reform delivered by many people, and I want to pay tribute to a number of people who are here today in the chamber: Senator Dean Smith, who of course authored the bill, and Senators Pratt and Rice, who were all part of this magnificent change which has made our country so much richer.
       </p>
       <p>
        Stephen, who is Tom's brother, is here today. Thank you for being here. We're all so proud of you, Tom. Go well, and thank you for all you've done for Australia.
