        I have additional information to give to a question asked by former Senator

         Watson

        , representing the Minister for Education. As a result of special coalition funding, the University of Tasmania was able to lift the proportion of Tasmanians with bachelor’s degrees or above from 11 to 15 per cent. Will the government live up to its rhetoric about the education revolution so that, in the case of the University of Tasmania, it is in a position to lift the proportion of Tasmanians with a bachelor’s degree or above from 15 to 20 per cent, which is the national average?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Senator CARR—I thank Senator Watson for his question, and I wish him well in his retirement, as one of the 14 senators leaving today. The question he asks with regard to the University of Tasmania and the fact that the Rudd Labor government has committed so much to the higher education system in such a short time are duly noted, and I appreciate the opportunity to highlight the fact that, in the first six months of this government, we have introduced measures that will improve substantially the opportunities for people to embark upon a tertiary education.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        With regard to the specific matters he raises about the University of Tasmania, I would like to seek further advice from the minister, and I will do so.
