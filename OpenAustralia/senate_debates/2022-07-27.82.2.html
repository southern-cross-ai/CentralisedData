         Thank you, Mr Deputy President, and congratulations on the new role. I rise to take note of the answers from Senator Watt—surprise, surprise! I move:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (Senator Watt) to questions without notice asked today by Opposition senators relating to the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in Indonesia.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government hasn't been in power long—obviously the minister hasn't been in power very long—and it faces a huge challenge to the agricultural sector. It's probably one of the most significant threats to the agricultural sector that we have seen in this country for a very, very long time, and the response so far has been wanting. It's been confused, it's been weak and it's been untimely. We have seen a government that has not reacted in the way that the agricultural sector of Australia, particularly the agricultural sector of my home state of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         , would want a government to react.
        </p>
        <p>
         We've heard some comments recently from the state Labor agriculture minister in Western Australia. Here were her comments in the
         <i>
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Australian" rel="nofollow">
           West Australian
          </a>
         </i>
         from just a few days ago:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I know this isn't the line that newspapers want to hear but we've got to keep this in perspective …
        </p>
        <p>
         The most serious threat to Australian agriculture in, probably, my lifetime, and we have to keep it in perspective?
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         We're not going to see … our cattle industry decimated.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is from a state Labor agriculture minister.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         We will still have a domestic industry.
        </p>
        <p>
         She said that meat and milk might actually become cheaper!
        </p>
        <p>
         This is what the state Labor minister said! And she said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         It's not going to stop milk or meat being available to us. And some people might argue it might actually make it cheaper because there'll be more of it available domestically.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is what a state Labor minister said! And this is someone that this minister, Minister Watt, is relying upon to work with. In fact, he stated today that it was the states who have the principal responsibility in this area—'the states have the principal responsibility'. He's washing his hands of responsibility; he's giving the responsibility to the states. And what have we heard from the state Labor minister in Western Australia? That it's not going to decimate the cattle industry—in fact, it might actually make milk and meat cheaper!
        </p>
        <p>
         Now, she's repudiated these words—as she should have. She's been repudiated by her state premier—as she should have. She should have been repudiated—as she should be repudiated by all, including all in this place. I stand right beside my good friend the member for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Connor" rel="nofollow">
          O'Connor
         </a>
         in the other place,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Wilson" rel="nofollow">
          Rick Wilson
         </a>
         , who called for her resignation. And she should absolutely resign.
        </p>
        <p>
         Walking away from these statements from an agriculture minister is not enough. It is not enough to say that foot-and-mouth disease won't decimate our industry and then to just apologise and carry on.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is an industry that is so fundamental to the agricultural sector of my home state of Western Australia. It's so fundamental to the agricultural sector of the entirety of Australia. It's fundamental to our economy. Foot-and-mouth, it has been estimated, could cost our economy $80 billion over 10 years—$80 billion! It would decimate our trade if it were found in this country—decimate our trade across the globe. It would severely damage our major export industries, like the dairy industry of Victoria, and, obviously, the north of Australia, particularly Queensland, which exports so much meat. It would decimate our sheep industry.
        </p>
        <p>
         And yet we have Labor ministers—Labor ministers of the Crown—saying: 'Oh, it's not to be worried about. It might make meat and milk cheaper'! This is an absolute disgrace! The Labor minister in Western Australia should resign. She should resign immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
         We need ministers who will actually stand up for agriculture. We need ministers who will stand up for agriculture in this place. And, sadly, in the effort we've seen today from the current minister, we do not have that. We have a weak, ineffectual minister, who is reacting, and reacting slowly, to an existential crisis for our livestock industries.

              <p>
               That was an extraordinary response from a senator who stood up and characterised the response by this government, a Labor government—I'll just say that again, because I really like to hear it: 'a Labor government'! He characterised the response by our Labor government as lacking, when the response by the minister—a very capable minister; in fact, it's been a long time since we've had a capable agricultural minister!—has been a quick response, a coordinated response, and a comprehensive response. And not only that, but we had Minister Watt in here today responding to questions directly. And, quite frankly, they were questions from senators that didn't take the issue seriously; they weren't taking the issue seriously.
              </p>
              <p>
               This is a serious issue. It's an issue that the Albanese Labor government takes seriously. And that's why we've introduced some of the toughest biosecurity measures ever used in Australia. The minister—

                 <p>
                  We have a senator that keeps
                  <a class="glossary" href="/glossary/?gl=1" title="An interjection is when a member of parliament says something that can be...">
                   interjecting

                  and talking—as far as I can see, with what's been put in the media—about going down and washing feet. I'm not sure why she thinks that's some sort of a good response.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The minister outlined quite clearly what has been happening. For the benefit of the senators opposite, I will go through some of the responses that have been put in place, but it is a coordinated and comprehensive response. In fact, as the minister has said, the responses and the initiatives that have been put in place are the most comprehensive ever seen in Australia. That's because the Albanese Labor government take the issue of foot-and-mouth disease very seriously.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  To be honest, it is a sad, sad day when, in the very first question time, the new opposition comes up with questions that show their lack of real interest. They're only interested in political pointscoring, when the issues around foot-and-mouth disease pose real and serious risk to Australia. The Labor government has introduced the toughest biosecurity measures ever used in Australia, and the minister has been very effective in the rollout of measures to combat foot-and-mouth disease but also in his discussions with the Indonesian government.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  As the minister has talked about, we are providing at least one million doses to Indonesia for their foot-and-mouth vaccination program. We've put together a $14 million biosecurity package for Australia's frontline defence and are providing more technical support for countries currently battling foot-and-mouth disease and lumpy-skin disease. As the minister also indicated in his response, foot-and-mouth disease is currently in over 70 countries.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  What the opposition should be doing is joining—in fact, they should be supporting the minister in his work, because the minister has put together and rolled out a very comprehensive set of measures. The foot-and-mouth disease did reach Indonesia prior to the election being held, but you couldn't get a better response than what is being put together and rolled out, by the minister, on behalf of the Albanese Labor government.

                   As a senator proudly ensconced in Rockhampton, the nation's beef capital, this is an extremely important issue to talk about. If there were to be an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease—let's very much hope that does not happen—there probably would not be a town in Australian more affected than my home town of Rockhampton.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I must say, talking to the graziers in the Fitzroy Basin, there is a lot of concern that this government does not have the proper focus on this issue. The graziers are very concerned about the kneejerk and haphazard response over the past few weeks, where, at one point, foot mats were ineffective and not needed and then, just days later, they were going to be rolled out everywhere. And we're still waiting for them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   It's not just those anecdotes or my political points here that are confirming this lack of confidence; it's the market itself. The market has no confidence in this minister, no confidence in this new government. Indeed, in the first week that the Bali outbreak was exposed, the first week of July, the price under the eastern states young cattle indicator—that's basically a benchmark for cattle prices across Australia—sat at $11.18 per kilogram, a very good price. That's a very, very good price, mind you. But, in just the two weeks since then, it is now down below $9, at $8.92 a kilogram, a 20 per cent drop in two weeks, confirming a vote of no confidence in this minister. And it's not the drop to $8.92—that's still a very good price, a fantastic price; all cattle producers pretty much will be making money at $8.92—but it's that that price is on a vertical drop right now, and we need that to be halted. We need to bend that curve back so we don't get prices back down to the levels we saw 10 years or so ago during the drought and, dare I say, the live export ban.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   For that, we need the government to wake up and deliver on their promises and show the Australian people that they have got this and they have got their eyes focused on this. The Prime Minister hasn't been across this. He's been overseas and has not been across domestic issues. He's refused calls for him to take charge of this issue, given the consequences for this country, and regional areas in particular that would be hurt, and he is not helping out.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Today's contribution from Minister Watt does not help this lack of confidence. It does not help at all, unfortunately. Hopefully, it will be better tomorrow. It was his first day today. I suppose we all get given a bit of slack on our first day. But he couldn't even answer basic questions on numbers put by my colleague Senator McKenzie, who asked how many passengers have come through from Indonesia the last few weeks. You'd think, if you were concerned and focused on this issue, you'd have that number off the top of your head. I remember colleagues on the other side being very critical of ministers who did not have significant numbers off the top of their head. He didn't know that. He took it on notice. It was one of many questions he took on notice. Later on in question time he took the 'not my job' excuse. 'It's not my job. I don't have these answers.' So 'Not My Job' Murray is not across his brief and he's not giving confidence to the Australian cattle industry and to the Australian people that the government are responding appropriately to this issue.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I do appreciate the briefing was put on earlier today by Minister Watt and the government. There was a lot of good information there. The takeaway I had, though—what I'm concerned about—is that this minister and this government are putting too much faith in the advice they're given and not providing appropriate scrutiny of that. Again, it's their first day. It's Murray's first go here—sorry. It's Senator Watt's first go as a minister, and I don't think you understand that your job is not just to enact the advice you're given by your departments and agencies. They're well meaning, they're good people, but they often have to protect their own advice and their own history. They're not going to necessarily bring you a 100 per cent account of what's going on on the ground.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   What I hear quite often from the government right now is 'We're told that there are mats everywhere; we're told that everybody's being checked.' At the briefing today, you were saying, 'I'm told a hundred per cent of people are fine.' Yet we continue to get stories from actual people who come in from Indonesia, coming in from overseas, that there's nothing at the airports. There's nothing there. Now, something's wrong. Either these people contacting us are lying or maybe—just maybe—the advice that's being pushed up through the Public Service is not quite a hundred per cent accurate and truth-tested about what's going on on the ground.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   So one thing I would hope, after this searing experience for new Minister Watt is that he goes away and tries to ground-check exactly what is going on in airports. This is so, so serious for our country. We cannot just sit back and take every piece of advice we get. We have to have scrutiny. We have to hold them to account here in this place. That is our job.

                    I thank the opposition for their questions to Senator Watt on the very serious foot-and-mouth outbreak in Indonesia. The Albanese government is taking this threat extremely seriously, very seriously, just as Australian travellers are. What we are doing is taking the very best advice on managing this risk, and the very best advice on protecting Australia's trade as well. We're very grateful to those travellers who understand the seriousness of the disease and are complying with the measures that we're putting in place. We're very grateful to Australians for understanding the seriousness of this disease, which is more than we can say about those on the opposition benches. Those on the opposition benches have demonstrated today that they have been infected with something themselves, and that is a dose of absolute hysteria on this issue. They have been infected with a dose of confected hysteria on this issue.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Let's talk about the opposition's response to this issue. We've had the opposition leader, Mr Dutton, calling for the borders to shut. We've had the Leader of

                    </a>
                    , Mr Littleproud, immediately back away from that call. We've had the former Nationals leader—remember him—Mr Joyce, calling for the borders to be closed. And, of course, we've had Senator McKenzie wanting to wash people's feet—and making that offer again today.

                        These hysterical calls, these confused calls, to shut the borders, to open the borders and to wash people's feet are the things that are damaging our response to this crisis right now. Calls to shut the border are damaging Australia's agricultural reputation. The unnecessary hysteria that those on the opposition benches are fermenting will do nothing but damage the international trade that you are saying that you want to protect. As it stands in Australia today, we have no evidence at all that the virus is out in Australia. Your response affects our international trade if people think that we do have this disease. So your hysteria is helping no-one. What we do know is that the disease is evident across many countries—and the opposition is not calling for borders to be shut to them. So, once again, what you are doing is playing politics rather than listening to the experts.

                                . But this gives me an opportunity to talk a little bit more about the incredibly impressive and powerful response that the Australian government, under the leadership of the minister, Senator Watt, have put in place to deal with this outbreak in Indonesia. We are taking this outbreak very seriously. We are managing the risk of foot-and-mouth disease across our shores, and we are doing that with the biggest biosecurity package that has ever been introduced in this country. We are installing sanitation foot mats in international and domestic airports and we're monitoring travellers from high-risk areas. There are thousands of passengers being assessed in Melbourne and in other major cities every day. We are delivering vaccines. As Minister Watt explained, those vaccines are expected to arrive in August. We are increasing screening to monitor undeclared meat products. This is a serious biosecurity issue for Australia. It's one that we are taking seriously, and the response is not helped by those on the opposition benches.

                                 tor DAVEY (—) (): I congratulate Senator Walsh on her admirable defence of Minister Watt on this issue. However, the first point that I want to raise is this claim by the government that this is the largest investment in biosecurity in Australia's history. Thanks be to the coalition government! Thanks to the coalition who, when in government, made sure that we had in the budget $1.1 billion extra investment in strengthening Australia's biosecurity. That funding has enabled Minister Watt to resource 18 extra biosecurity officers, even though they're not yet on the ground. He shouldn't have needed to wait for so long—for eight weeks—because the funding was already there, thanks to the coalition government.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                 I also want to address the time line issue and the claims that we are fearmongering. I live on Australia's oldest single blood line sheep stud. If

                                 comes into this country, that sheep stud will be devastated, just like Senator Canavan's cattle industry, our dairy industry and our goat industry. We cannot underestimate the impact that this disease will have on our trade. You claim that we're impacting negatively on our trade markets. Well, it would be far more serious if this disease actually encroaches on our borders and comes into our country, which will decimate our trade.

                                <p>
                                 I also want to address Senator Watt's response to multiple questions and his inability to actually answer anything properly. What we've seen is a lot of rhetoric. We saw Senator Watt, on returning from Indonesia, tweet a photo of himself disinfecting his shoes, saying that shoe disinfection was being implemented. It must be being implemented only for Minister Watt and his touring party because no-one else has had to disinfect their shoes on arriving back in Australia. We'd like to see it implemented. We called for foot baths or sanitation mats on 5 July when the first cases of foot-and-mouth disease were detected in Bali. It took until 22 July for the minister to actually announce it was happening. It took until 25 July—a full 20 days after we called for them—for even the first foot mat to be rolled out.
