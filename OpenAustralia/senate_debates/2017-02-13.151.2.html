       <p class="italic">
        Purpose of the Bills
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Agriculture and Water Resources Amendment Bill 2016 will make amendments to a range of portfolio legislation and repeal redundant legislation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A companion bill called the Excise Levies Legislation Amendment (Honey) Bill 2016 will make minor amendments to the
        <i>
         Primary Industries (Excise) Levy Act 1999
        </i>
        and to the
        <i>
         National Residue Survey (Excise) Levy Act 1998
        </i>
        to remove unnecessary regulation relating to the giving of certificates that are no longer used by the honey industry.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Agriculture and Water Resources Amendment Bill 2016 will amend 13 portfolio Acts to cease four redundant statutory bodies, remove unnecessary regulation and improve the operation of existing legislation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Agriculture and Water Resources Amendment Bill 2016 will also repeal 12 Acts that are redundant or no longer required relating to legislation covering agricultural and veterinary chemicals, the national residue survey, export charges and quarantine fees, rural adjustment and the meat and live-stock and wool industries.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Reasons for Urgency
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Passage of the Bills in the 2017 Autumn sittings will enable a number of portfolio industries to directly benefit from the removal of unnecessary regulatory burden, streamlined government administrative practices and reduced legislative complexity.

        BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY (IMPROVING PRODUCTIVITY) AMENDMENT BILL 2017

        <i>
         Code for the Tendering and Performance of Building Work 2016
        </i>
        (the Code) as a condition of eligibility to submit expressions of interest, tender for or be awarded Commonwealth funded building work. The exemption currently runs until 28 November 2018 and the bill would bring this forward to 31 August 2017. The bill would also provide that building industry participants could submit expressions of interest and tender for Commonwealth funded building work within this shortened exemption period, but it would no longer extend to being awarded that work if the relevant enterprise agreement is not compliant with the Code.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Reasons for Urgency
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The timely introduction and passage of this bill would bring forward the full implementation of key provisions of the Code that seek to improve productivity and reduce costs in the building and construction industry.
