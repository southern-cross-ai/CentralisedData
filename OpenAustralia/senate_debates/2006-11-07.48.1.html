        My question is addressed to the Minister for Justice and Customs. Will the minister inform senators of recent successes in the Australian government’s fight against illicit drugs?

         This is an important question relating to a recent successful operation in which
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
          New Zealand
         </a>
         Customs seized 27 kilograms of cocaine from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV" rel="nofollow">
          MV
         </a>
         <i>
          Tampa
         </i>
         and its sister ship the MV
         <i>
          Taronga
         </i>
         . What this and recent attempts to bring cocaine into this country demonstrate is the extraordinary lengths to which organised crime will go to bring illicit drugs into Australia. It is alleged that this cocaine originated in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" rel="nofollow">
          South America
         </a>
         . The extraordinary aspect of the allegations in this matter is that the drug was secreted on the hulls of the two vessels—and, of course, an organised syndicate was involved in the attempted importation of this drug.
        </p>
        <p>
         The MV
         <i>
          Tampa
         </i>
         came under the surveillance of Australian authorities when it visited the ports of Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and Fremantle. The drug was seized by New Zealand Customs whilst that vessel was in a New Zealand port, and subsequently, in September, its sister ship the MV
         <i>
          Taronga
         </i>
         was the subject of a similar operation when New Zealand Customs officers seized the drug concerned.

         Two people have been arrested in

          New South Wales
         </a>
         . This has been an outstanding success, involving the

         , demonstrating yet again the importance of a having a whole-of-government approach in the fight against organised criminal activity which is attempting to bring illicit drugs into this country.
        </p>
        <p>
         I will be meeting my New Zealand counterpart, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Customs" rel="nofollow">
          Minister of Customs
         </a>
         , the Hon.

         </a>
         , on 22 November. We will be discussing a range of cooperative measures between New Zealand and Australia. This matter, of course, will be a key part of that, demonstrating the successful cooperation we have with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Police" rel="nofollow">
          New Zealand Police
         </a>
         , New Zealand Customs and other agencies working in New Zealand. We are in a region where we have the targeting of organised crime with drugs such as cocaine and amphetamine type stimulants, and it is essential that we work together in this regard.
        </p>
        <p>
         It also is the first attempt we have seen to bring illicit drugs into this country in this manner, and I think it demonstrates yet again that we cannot be complacent in the fight against illicit drugs. It certainly demonstrates the very good work that has been done by the Australian Customs Service and the Australian Federal Police, and it demonstrates that continued cooperation is essential with New Zealand.
