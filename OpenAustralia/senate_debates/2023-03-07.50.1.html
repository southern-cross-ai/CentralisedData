        Hundreds of truck drivers and their families are marching on Aldi stores around Australia today, demanding that Aldi take responsibility for the crisis in their supply chain. Already 45 people have died in truck crashes this year, including 10 truck drivers. Last week we saw the collapse of one of the largest cold chain logistics companies in Australia, Scott's Refrigerated Logistics. Scott's had revenues last year of half a billion dollars, but their margins were so razor thin that they were not able to survive. John Waltis, a driver at Scott's, said: 'Myself and 1,500 others just lost our jobs at Scott's because of the squeeze on transport contracts from the top. One of my mates had just had a baby and now he's lost his job. Retailers like Aldi are responsible for this.'

        Economic pressure from Audi, Amazon and others like them have squeezed margins and drivers quite literally to their deaths to meet another trucking cost. Many drivers are forced to overwork, speed and delayed maintenance just to make ends meetâ€”45 deaths, 1,500 jobs lost, countless families ripped apart. However, Coles and Woolworths have committed to safe and sustainable supply-chain practices, and I commend them for turning around and taking those steps. But Aldi and Amazon are standing by their deadly practices. The

        has called on Aldi, Amazon and 38 others to join Coles and Woolworths in committing to safe and fair supply chain practices. This government is committed to reform in this space. Blood is on the hands of Aldi, Amazon and other companies at the top of the supply chain operating like them.
