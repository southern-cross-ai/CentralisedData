         I can, indeed. Three weeks ago, I cited research by AlphaBeta Advisors, a firm headed by

          Andrew Charlton

          NBN
         </a>
         is driving business growth across the country and, in particular, female entrepreneurship. For example, the research found the growth in self-employed women in NBN-connected areas is 20 times the pace of that in non-NBN-connected areas. Last week, a televised address featuring three leading businesswomen at the

Indigenous woman Mikaela Jade built her cutting-edge tech firm, Jabiru, three hours drive from Darwin. Mikaela showed how augmented reality technology is bringing ancient Indigenous stories to the world via an impressive app which you can download on your phone. She spoke about how internet connectivity is helping Aboriginal and

            In today's world, being connected is an essential service, and it's one that offers significant economic benefits for business. According to the AlphaBeta research, in the 2017 financial year, the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
             NBN
            </a>
            was estimated to have generated $1.2 billion in additional
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
             GDP
            </a>
            nationally, including $450 million in regional Australia. Once the rollout is complete, it's estimated that the network will deliver an additional $10.4 billion in GDP per year nationally, including $5.3 billion a year in regional areas. Thanks to the actions of this administration, the majority of Australians are, I'm pleased to report, having a good experience. In March, the

             ACCC

            's Rod Sims said that speed delivery was 'better than expected' and that the results 'go against the current wisdom that the majority of consumers and businesses are having issues with NBN speeds'.

               Last week, the

               began installing the new G.fast technology over the fibre-to-the-curb technology, which will deliver the same gigabit speeds as fibre to the premises but at around $1,500 per premises less and with no need to dig up everyone's front yards to deliver it. In August, NBN released
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOCSIS" rel="nofollow">
                DOCSIS
               </a>
               3.1 technology which will nearly double downstream capacity and provide gigabit speeds over the

                HFC
               </a>
               part of the network when future demand requires it. When our colleagues opposite were in office, the NBN wasn't allowed to deviate in the slightest from the fibre-to-the-premises model, no matter the cost and no matter the weight. They were paralysed by technology constraints which saw some houses costing $20,000 and more to connect to fibre. This government is not taking a theological approach to the NBN. We're taking a technological approach. We're getting it built. It will be done and dusted by 2020. That's good news.
