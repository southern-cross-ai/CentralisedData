        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. The Albanese government has made it clear that its No. 1 priority is addressing inflation and cost-of-living pressures with a targeted and comprehensive $23 billion 10-point plan to help address cost-of-living pressures in our economy. Can the minister please explain how this relief has been calibrated in a way so as to not aggravate inflation, and how is the government paving the way for future economic growth?

         Thank you, Senator Pratt, for a question on the cost of living. What I would have said if the opposition had asked me some of their questions is that, while you might need academic analysis and definitions, we on this side do understand that Australians are doing it tough. Unlike you, we are delivering $23 billion of cost-of-living relief to Australians. Whenever they come in and bleat about the cost of living, let's remember they opposed cheaper energy, they opposed cheaper medicine, they opposed more Medicare bulk billing, they opposed fee-free

         , they opposed more housing for Australians and the expansion of paid parental leave, and they opposed getting wages moving again. So whenever you come in here and talk to us about the cost of living—

           Let's remember those opposite when it comes to cheaper medicine. Six times you voted to prevent Australians getting cheaper medicines. Every time you come in here and talk about the cost of living, we're going to remind you that six times you voted against cheaper medicine. What about cheaper child care? Senator Hume said this was not a policy that you would introduce. So you don't want cheaper child care? You don't want cheaper child care? Let's remember also—

              I'm very happy to address you directly, President, and I understand why they feel sensitive and why they don't like the word 'you'. They don't want to take responsibility for being the party of higher energy prices. They don't want to take responsibility for being the party that voted against energy price relief. They don't want to take responsibility for being the party that voted against cheaper medicines. No, they just want to come in here and make political points. They have no plan when it comes to the cost of living.

                 Thank you, Senator Pratt. This month, additional cost-of-living relief—again, opposed by those opposite—is rolling out, which will help Australians, particularly in health and housing. Last week, on 1 November, the bulk-billing incentive was tripled. Under this Labor government which supports Medicare, unlike those opposite, the bulk-billing incentive was tripled, making it easier for 11 million young and low-income Australians to see a

                 </a>
                 without out-of-pocket costs. That is what this government is working to deliver in a tough environment for Australian families—delivering more assistance so more people can see a doctor without out-of-pocket costs. That's something only a Labor government will deliver because we know what the coalition have always thought about Medicare.

                   Can the minister please detail the specific measures the Albanese government has implemented to help Australians afford essentials over this difficult inflationary time? And what impact is that support having on people who need it most?
