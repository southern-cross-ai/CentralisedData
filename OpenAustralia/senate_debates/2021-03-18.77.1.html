        The time allotted for debate on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Strengthening Income Support) Bill 2021 has expired. In accordance with the resolution agreed to earlier today, I will now put the questions on the remaining stages of the bill and then put the questions on the remaining stages of the other bills listed in that resolution. I will first deal with the second reading amendments circulated by the

         Australian Greens
        </a>
        . The question is that the second reading amendments on sheets 1262 and 1267, circulated by the Australian Greens, be agreed to.

            Okay. I am happy to do that. I will recommit that matter and deal with them separately. The question is now that the second reading amendment on sheet 1262, circulated by the

             There has been a bit of confusion here. What I wanted was for clause (a) to be separated from clauses (b) and (c) in the second reading amendment on sheet 1262 and taken separately.

             <p>
              So with the amendment on sheet 1262 revised, Senator Lambie, you would like (a) dealt with separately from (b) and (c). Is that correct?

My memory of such matters is that when we're dealing with matters under a limitation of time debate, unless there's an inconsistency, or someone asks for them to be dealt with separately, they're dealt with together. They can only be put separately if someone is going to vote on them separately. The question now is that the remaining requests and amendments circulated by the

                              Amendments (1), (2) and (4) are framed as a requests because they amend the bill to provide that the ordinary income-free area for jobseeker payment, youth allowance (other) and parenting payment (Partnered) be permanently increased to $300 per fortnight rather than $150 per fortnight. As income free area means the amount a person can earn before their payment begins to decrease, increasing the income free are from $150 to $300 would result in recipients receiving a higher rate of payment.

                              Amendment (2) is framed as a request because it amends the bill to increase the maximum basic rate amount of age pension, disability support pension and carer payment to $1115 per fortnight. As the effect of this amendment will be that relevant recipients will receive a higher rate of payment, it will result in an increase in expenditure under the standing appropriation in section 242 of the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999.
