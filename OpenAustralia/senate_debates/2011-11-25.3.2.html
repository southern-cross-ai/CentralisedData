          Mr Deputy President, I ask if the senator who has moved this motion would go beyond just saying 'ministerial duties'. This is a sitting of the Senate. We have important matters before us. It is about to be followed by a motion requesting leave of absence for an equal number of members of the opposition. I believe the Senate is owed an explanation that is explicit about the need to put the Senate sitting second to the activities of the seven senators we are about to be asked to give leave to.

            The Senate

             No. The motion has been taken as formal. Permission was given by the Senate for the motion to be taken as formal. I have now put the motion. So you are debating the point but there is no further discussion.

                         You are correct, Senator Macdonald, and it is my error for calling that incorrectly to you in the first instance. However, it has been the tradition of the Senate that when these motions are moved they are treated as formal motions even though we are not in formal business. Leave was sought for a motion to be moved, and that is how they have normally been dealt with. If Senator Brown now wishes to debate the motion, as will be your entitlement, he can do so. I have called Senator Brown. He has the call.

                               On a point of order, Mr Deputy President, I think that Senator Brown is very close to misleading the Senate. This is not the last day of the sitting of the Senate. The last scheduled sitting day of the Senate is Wednesday next week.

                                 There is no point of order. I can see that Senator Abetz has gone Dickensian and I suppose that suits him. I am making a very logical and reasonable point here on behalf of the voters of Australia and the importance of the parliament and, not least, the importance of the sittings of the Senate. There is large-scale absenteeism of frontbenchers of both sides showing up here. This sitting is not sudden; we have all known about it for quite some time. The voters of Australia deserve to have a better explanation.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                 Of course, if there is a family illness or a major occasion which requires a senator to be absent, or a ministerial requirement which is beyond that of the requirement for a senator to be present in the chamber, or if there is a parliamentary duty which is more important than the sitting of the Senate, then let us hear what it is.

                                 Of course Senator Abetz would call this a stunt, but I am serious about it and I think the Senate is owed a better explanation than a one-word adjective to say why a senator is away. It is a legion of absenteeism on the last day of the sitting of the Senate and the big parties should do better than that.

                                  to shut down this parliament three days early. Three days early they have combined with the ALP to guillotine through 20 bills by the end of the day without a single word having been spoken on those bills. And the reason for the guillotine, the reason for this abuse of parliamentary process and the abrogation of parliamentary duty by Senator Brown, the Australian Greens and the ALP, is that they do not want to sit the extra three days that have been on the parliamentary calendar since day one. Why is that? It is because Senator Brown and Senator Milne want to scuttle out of this place to go to Durban. They are the absentees, and what they are now putting up before this place is a ruse to suggest that somehow there are absentees from both sides to cover up for the fact that they have deliberately forced the government not to sit next week for those three days so that they can scuttle off to Durban and be absentees—the whole lot of them—for a full three days!

                                    Senator Brown foolishly interjects, and of course whenever anybody interjects on Senator Brown, what does he do? He puts out his hands, Messiah-like, and says, 'Chair, will you protect me from these interjections?' This is the sort of Pecksniffian attitude we get from Senator Brown day after day after day in this place, and we are getting sick and tired of it.

Much as we on the opposition would like to know the detail of it, we believe that it is inappropriate to make those sorts of inquiries of each other. If the Greens were ever to be in a position to require leave of absence—and I am sure that it has occurred in the past—we do not go inquiring into that sort of detail.

                                     I did not want to delay the opportunity for the opposition to be able to debate bills later on this morning. I just want to inject a little sense in this debate. These are ordinary notices of motions that go through to give senators leave for both personal reasons and parliamentary business. They are generally not debated. Why? Everyone from the opposition, the government and the cross-benchers will at some point seek the same result; they will ask for leave of parliament for private or personal business or for parliamentary business and it will be granted without debate. We all know in this place that there are reasons for people to undertake that and it is not undertaken lightly. People do have to convince their own side that they do have work that will take them away.

                                        . You tell me that Senator Evans is here. Therefore we have Senator Carr, a very senior minister; Senator Wong, a very senior minister; and Senator Farrell, who is no doubt somewhere organising another leadership coup in the Labor Party. Three very senior members of the government choose to absent themselves on the last day of sitting—I beg my own pardon, it is not the last day of sitting. The last day of sitting is next Wednesday.

                                        I want the people of Australia who are listening to this debate to understand that for almost nine months the Senate has agreed to sit next Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. Were we to do that, we would not have needed to guillotine through some 20 bills without a word being spoken on them—not a word in favour of them nor a word opposed to them. I think the people of Australia, and there are many who do listen to these debates, need to understand that the Greens and the Labor Party combined to guillotine through in excess of a dozen bills without a word being spoken on them. They also guillotined through perhaps the most complex parcel of bills that this parliament has seen in the last decade; they were the carbon tax bills, the bills based upon a promise by the Prime Minister that she would never introduce a carbon tax. She then introduced a carbon tax with 18 complex bills, which were guillotined through this chamber without proper debate. And we are already seeing that those bills are suffering because they were not subject to parliamentary scrutiny. We are already finding, by reports from around the globe, that these pieces of legislation on the carbon tax have suffered because they were not properly considered in this chamber. The whole carbon tax issue will become a farce at Durban next week when the United States, China, Japan, Korea, Russia and India indicate that they are not going to have a $23-a-tonne tax on their particular emissions of carbon dioxide.

                                        I am very angry about the guillotining—about the dealing of these bills without any discussion whatsoever, and I think the people of Australia expect better than that of this parliament, and particularly the Senate, which has a reputation for scrutiny. We have a very extensive committee system, and the people like that because they understand that the Senate does expose difficulties with government legislation.

                                        We have three senior ministers leaving this parliament four days before the parliamentary year concludes. The Labor Party stands condemned and the Greens political party, which have made a virtue over decades of allowing parliamentary scrutiny, of allowing people to have their say, even if they disagree with them, have joined with the Labor Party in curtailing debate on important bills, and particularly the carbon tax bills. It is outrageous that ministers should be given leave four days before the parliamentary year concludes. If Senator Abetz has suggested—I am not aware of this; I do not think I have seen it on the

                                            Yes. It is about leave being given to leave this parliament four days early. And I know Senator Bob Brown does not like this. I hear him

                                            . When anyone else interjects he is first on his feet. Again, it shows the different standards this man has for himself as opposed to anyone else. It is okay for him to interject, but if anyone else does it, 'Oh, please Mr Deputy President, protect me.' But he does not mind it himself. If Senator Brown is, as Senator Abetz suggests, going to join with the Labor Party and shut this chamber down three days early so that he can go for a jaunt to

                                            then that needs to be condemned. I want to say that the people who have in the past supported the Greens for what they thought was their principled approach to parliament should now understand that there is nothing principled about the Greens political party.

                                                        Thank you, Mr Deputy President. Senator Hanson-Young will find that people do actually take an interest in democracy—and, increasingly, the emails coming through to me are saying how hypocritical the Greens political party are.

                                                        . I think that is hypocrisy in the extreme on the part of the Greens political party. Their retribution will come at the next election. If they had any principles they would vote with the opposition to facilitate an early election so the people of Australia can have a view on the carbon tax bills and on the Labor Party's propensity to ram bills through this parliament without debate.
