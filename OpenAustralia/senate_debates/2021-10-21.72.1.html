        ns what life is like in WA right now, most would say that they're living their best lives. There are no local restrictions, no venue limits, no regional travel limits and no masks required anywhere. The only thing you can't do is travel in and out of the state to

        or overseas. Frankly based upon the recent reporting in the west's newspapers, the vast majority of people seem to have expressed that the closed borders have very little impact on them, and therefore the lure of holidays by way of an aeroplane to some distant location is not the overwhelming thing occupying the minds of most Western Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        This being said, I draw Western Australians' attention to the fact that the Premier has not ruled out lockdowns occurring in WA if there is an outbreak after we reach the 80 per cent fully dosed vaccination level. The implication of this is that should we get an outbreak of COVID, which is entirely possible before Christmas, your Christmas lunch or your hard-earned Busselton, Albany,

        or Esperance holiday plans could be cancelled. Instead of motivating Western Australians to go and get vaccinated by way of an incentive, the WA Premier is resorting to fear and threats.
       </p>
       <p>
        Yesterday, the Premier announced that 75 per cent of the workforce would face up to a $20,000 fine if they turn up to work without being vaccinated. This is outrageous and a massive admission of failure. Freedom, personal choice and privacy are big values. Why is it so easy for Labor to trample all over them? Stick to the plan, Premier. This all stick and no carrot approach is wrong. We know that we will reach 80 per cent by mid-December. Please, please commit to Western Australians that their Christmas plans will be secure if we get there. Stop the politics of fear and give us something to aim for. Set the date. I have faith in Western Australians, Premier. Why have you lost yours?
