        My question is to the minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Brandis. With the United Nations Framework Convention on

         Senator Milne, I take it that your question is an intended reference to the remarks that the foreign minister made that were reported in the papers yesterday about the importance of having a rational discussion—a 'rational discussion': two words very unfamiliar to the Greens, I know—about nuclear energy in this country.
        </p>
        <p>
         May I say, Senator Milne, in view of your advocacy of alternative energy sources I wonder why it is that the Greens party are so theologically opposed to the possibility of a rational discussion of all options?

             Senator Milne, I am not going to acquaint you with the Australian government's negotiating brief in Lima, but I can tell you what the Australian government's position in relation to this matter is. The government is committed to ensuring that Australians have ongoing access to reliable and competitively priced energy. We are also committed to acting on climate change domestically, as well as internationally. It is important that all energy options are on the table for discussion, and that was the point I was trying to make to you, Senator Milne. And it applies in international fora, by the way, just as much as it applies in domestic fora.

            <p>
             And do not shake your head at me, Senator Milne, because it is your party that steadfastly, resolutely, zealously and theologically refuses to countenance even the possibility of a public discussion of all options.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now, Senator Milne, Australia is currently undertaking an energy white paper process, which will include a thorough consideration of traditional sources, including coal and gas. But as well, it will include the role of renewables and other low-emission energy sources, including nuclear.

              , I ask a supplementary question. I note that the minister did not answer the question so I will try another one. Given the $300 million shortfall in reaching the $10 billion target of the Green Climate Fund at the beginning of the talks, will the Australian government make a contribution to build confidence in the global negotiating process, or will Australia undermine it by refusing to contribute to the Green Climate Fund?

               Australia means to be a constructive contributor to this discussion. The Australian government intends to be a constructive contributor to this discussion at both the domestic level and at the international level. But the point I am trying to make to you, Senator Milne, is that there is a variety of views available and if we are going to have a rational public discussion—whether here at home in Australia or in international fora—then all options should be considered.
              </p>
              <p>
               Views change on this topic over time, you know, Senator Milne! Some years ago, in October 1981, the founder of your party, Dr Bob Brown, opined that coal fired power is the best option in an opinion article in the Hobart
               <i>
                Mercury
               </i>
               . That is not a view that Dr Bob Brown would adhere to today. But it is a view he did adhere to some 30 years ago, so views change as to the right energy mix—

Will the foreign minister, or the Australian delegation in Lima, correct the record and inform the German and French delegations that, contrary to the Prime Minister's statement, Australia intends to abolish the Clean Energy Finance Corporation so that it can make no contribution to greenhouse gas reduction?

                 Well, Senator, I would not presume to say what Minister Bishop said to her counterpart French and German ministers in Lima last week, but what I can assure you of, Senator Milne, is that the Australian government will play a constructive role. We will continue to support funding for renewable energy, as we have done; we will continue to promote on the international stage our forward-thinking

                 policy which is, in substance although not in rhetoric, almost identical to President Obama's policy in the United States, to which you devote so much time singing the praises; and we will contribute, in particular, by promoting a rational discussion in which a variety of views are on the table so that when these decisions are made they can be the best-informed decisions that they can be.
