            , which is to exclude the operation of state and territory unfair contracts jurisdictions which apply to independent contractors. It would ensure that only state and territory laws which expressly empower a court, commission or tribunal to amend, vary, set aside or find void or otherwise unenforceable parts or all of a services contract are excluded to the extent that they apply to independent contractors covered by the proposed legislation.
           </p>
           <p>
            This amendment would also ensure that antiavoidance protections for vulnerable workers in state and territory laws, such as laws requiring a court to construe a contract with an outworker to contain certain minimum conditions, are not overridden by the Independent Contractors Bill. I am advised that Minister Andrews’s office negotiated these amendments with the outworkers’ stakeholders.

              which would have established a minimum remuneration guarantee for independent contractor textile, clothing and footwear outworkers in the absence of any state or territory law setting a minimum level of remuneration. This proposed part would also have established a record-keeping regime, under which a person who engages a contractor

               TCF
              </a>
              outworker must keep certain documentation relating to pay. These provisions had been modelled on existing protections in part 22 of the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workplace" rel="nofollow">
               Workplace
              </a>
              Relations Act, which provide a minimum rate of pay for contracted TCF outworkers in Victoria. It was intended that this proposed part of the Independent Contractors Bill would guarantee a minimum level of wage protection for outworkers not entitled to a similar protection under a state or territory law.
             </p>
             <p>
              However, during

               Legislation
              </a>
              of the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Committee inquiry into the provisions of this bill it became apparent that the existing state and territory protections were comprehensive in this regard and that it was unlikely that the proposed remuneration guarantee would be relied upon to set the rate of pay for any TCF outworker. The government, therefore, considers that it is preferable to remove this proposed protection and repeal part 22, as neither had any practical application. This will reduce the regulatory burden on all players within the textile, clothing and footwear industry.
             </p>
             <p>
              I also indicate to the chamber that this amendment has been agreed with representatives of FairWear, of the Textile Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia and of the Victorian government. It also implements one of the unanimous recommendations made by the Senate committee that inquired into the provisions of this bill.

               Labor will be supporting the government’s proposal. We do so because, as we said from the beginning, whilst the original bill purported to protect outworkers’ terms and conditions, in practice it did not. It is interesting to note that the government refused to respond to Labor’s propositions on this and has been faced with the embarrassment of its own senators, on examination of the bill, agreeing that part 4 should be removed because it serves no useful purpose. So really the proposal that is now before the chamber is an embarrassing backdown for the government, demonstrating that the errors inherent in the legislation which were pointed out to the government were in fact proved to be there. The government now has to delete aspects of its original bill in light of the Senate committee and its own backbench demonstrating this to be the case.

                support the government’s proposal. In my view this outcome exposes the Senate committee system at its best. We experienced concerted and admirable advocacy by the outworker representatives that was considered, objective and passionate, but not political. They made a great impression upon committee members, and the committee members unanimously supported changes to the government’s originally intended provisions. Of course the chair of the committee played a particular role because it is important for the chair to carry the campaign into the ranks of the government itself, so she is to be congratulated on her efforts in this.

               <p>
                With respect to outworkers, this chamber on all sides has generally speaking had a strong and positive approach in the 10½ years I have been in this chamber. So I am pleased that these proposals have come forward, and we fully support them.

                 </p>
                 <p>
                  These amendments relate to the definition of employee, which I will be moving later in the Workplace Relations Act amendment. I need to put these in context now, because obviously if they relate to provisions that are going to go into another act you need to put them in their context.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The bill claims that one of its objectives is to recognise independent contracting as a legitimate form of work arrangement that is primarily commercial, but in fact the bill offers no solution and no further enlightenment as to who is a genuine contractor or employee or who is a disguised contractor or employee. As the chamber knows, various state legislatures have grappled with this but at the federal level the common-law provisions continue to prevail. The bill only includes a very minimal definition of an independent contractor; instead it defers to the common-law definition, which in any case is subject to change over time as jurisprudence advances. Many, including the Democrats, believe relying on the common-law definition of employment is fraught with problems.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  As noted in my minority report on this bill, the common-law definition of an independent contractor is not a definition as such; it is a set of principles established through jurisprudence and it is not about defining who is an independent contractor but defining who is not an employee. The common-law approach relies on a test which involves the consideration of a number of court established factors or indicia. This means effectively a case-by-case approach, which is an unsatisfactory way to proceed with employee contractor definitional disputes that may affect many hundreds of thousands of Australians. I think it is important to recognise that this issue is at the heart of a genuine policy contest between the government and people of my persuasion.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Both the government and the Democrats agree that there should be a national regime which establishes the nature of independent contracting. The difference between us really comes down, at its heart, to the issue of the definition of an employee. The government has, as a policy matter, adopted the common-law approach. We think—and we agree with the states, because they have tried to address this fundamental issue as well—that you do need a definition of employment. The government, in another field, has attempted to address this issue in a different way in tax law, through the alienation of personal services income test, which does seek to provide specific indicia of what constitutes an employee.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Because we have looked at the matter carefully, we have paid great attention to the work of Professor Stewart. I should point out that he is not only an academic researcher in labour law but also a labour law consultant to a national law firm that advises and acts for business, so he cannot be categorised, if you like, as someone with a particular political or industrial bent. He argues that a common-law test is unreliable, and I quote him:
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  The approach is necessarily impressionistic, since there is no universally accepted understanding of how many indicia, or what combination of indicia, must point towards a contract of service before the worker can be characterised as an employee. In effect, this “multi-factor” test proceeds on the assumption that the courts will know an employment contract when they see it.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The danger, as everyone knows, is that to get to the courts requires a time and cost factor—and I would rather avoid that. Professor Stewart also argues that it can result in different outcomes depending on the adjudicator’s starting point. He says:
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  If a judge (whether consciously or subconsciously) starts with the assumption that a relationship is one of employment, and looks for factors that suggest otherwise, they may well reach a different conclusion to one who proceeds from the opposite direction. It is this, more than anything else, which I believe explains how the same facts can be viewed so differently by judges apparently asking the same questions and applying the same basic principles.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  There are people in this chamber more familiar than I with the varying views of judges—that is both one of the attractions and one of the drawbacks of common-law determinations. Of concern is Professor Stewart’s assertion that any competent lawyer can take almost any form of employment relationship and reconstruct it as something that the common law would treat as a relationship between principal and contractor thereby avoiding the effect of much industrial legislation.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Stewart also refers to another, even surer method of avoiding an employment relationship, which is:
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  ... to interpose some form of legal entity between the worker and the client business, since in the absence of a direct contract between the two there cannot be an employment relationship ... that entity might be a personal company, or a partnership constructed for the purpose between two or more workers, or some kind of family trust. Whether or not the worker is technically an employee of the interposed entity, they cannot and will not be an employee of the ultimate user of their services.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  He continues:
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  In a purely legal sense there is nothing “illegitimate” about either of these arrangements (the carefully drafted contract for services or the use of interposed entity). As the law stands it is quite lawful to set out about creating a relationship that is not one of employment. They are not “shams”, in the very strict sense of that legal term. It is only a sham when parties construct what they would both understand to be an employment relationship and then try and disguise it as something else by adopting an arrangement that does not genuinely reflect their intentions.
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  Nonetheless, for the reasons advanced at the beginning of this submission, it should not be lawful to contract out of labour regulation by exploiting these possibilities.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  For an increasing number of contractors, the notion of independence is a myth and any choice and flexibility in their arrangements have been constructed for the benefit of those who hire them, not their own. That is a legitimate motive on the part of the employer but, in my view, an illegitimate outcome. So this legislation not only does not define what a genuine independent contractor is but also does not prevent business from exploiting loopholes in the common law that allow workers to be classified as contractors when for all practical purposes they are employees. As Stewart notes:
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  Various approaches can be and have been adopted by legislators to bring “employment-like” arrangements within the scope of particular regulation.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  As I said earlier, the states have used deeming provisions which deem workers in various occupations or circumstances as employees. As already noted, one drawback is the broadbrush nature of deeming, where some genuine contractors may get caught up in such provisions. Of course that is a weakness. The flip side to this, as Stewart points out, is that business can avoid the deeming provision by rewriting a contract and an employee can be converted into what a common-law test would regard as a nonemployee.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Stewart also points to some state payroll tax statutes which he considers very effective in identifying employment characteristics, but he notes that the drafting is so convoluted that only the most dedicated lawyers can make sense of it. In 2000 the federal government introduced the alienation of personal services income legislation, which the Democrats supported, which amended the tax laws to ensure that contractors were taxed as if they were employees unless they satisfied certain tests showing that they were genuinely running a business.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I note that the report to the House of Representatives inquiry into independent contracting and labour hire,
                  <i>
                   Making it work
                  </i>
                  , noted the difficulties with the common-law distinction between an employee and an independent contractor. The report also analysed other possible distinctions that could be used to distinguish an employee from an independent contractor. In particular the report looked at the possibility of relying on the test used in the Australian income tax assessment alienation of personal services income legislation. The report in the end recommended that the government maintain the common-law definition and—and I emphasise ‘and’—adopt components of the
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSI" rel="nofollow">
                   PSI
                  </a>
                  legislation test to identify independent contractors. This bill does not implement this recommendation, and that is to be regretted. The House of Representatives did a thorough and interesting job in analysing this area.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  In his second reading speech the minister explained that the government decided not to include aspects of the PSI legislation as it is ‘easily manipulated’. In their submission to the House of Representatives inquiry into independent contractors, the Civil
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contractors" rel="nofollow">
                   Contractors
                  </a>
                  Federation identified how tax laws are being manipulated and the need for them to be tightened. They said:
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  There are some operators who may genuinely believe that, because they have an
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABN" rel="nofollow">
                   ABN
                  </a>
                  number, they are an independent contractor for this reason alone. It is acknowledged however that some operators who are not independent contractors claim to be purely to obtain a taxation benefit. Minimising or avoiding taxation is an incentive to claim to be an independent contractor and a comprehensive formula in the Taxation legislation that proof that certain requirements have been met would reduce this incentive.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Democrats" rel="nofollow">
                   The Democrats
                  </a>
                  agree with the minister that the PSI is still problematic and is unlikely to fully address the problem. However, it is ironic that, while the government was quick to protect its revenue back in 2000—and we supported that—it made no attempt then and is making no attempt now to ensure that workers who are taxed as employees are also treated as employees for other regulatory purposes such as in this legislation. The Democrats support Stewart’s assertion that a more effective approach is to tackle the problem at source, the common-law definition, and define employees in legislation. The aim would be to draw a more realistic boundary between the two categories of genuine contractors and employees and to reduce the ease with which hirers can presently disguise employment arrangements.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  On 11 August 2003 and again on 22 March 2004 I moved an amendment to the Workplace Relations
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amendment" rel="nofollow">
                   Amendment
                  </a>
                  (Termination of Employment)
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill" rel="nofollow">
                   Bill
                  </a>
                  s Nos 1 and 2 respectively to define an employee, in an attempt to bring precarious and atypical employment into the unfair dismissal system. The Democrats drew heavily on Stewart’s work in drafting the definition. Here I want to record my gratitude to him for his continued assistance. I note that he was a significant witness to the House of Representatives inquiry. I noted in my second reading debate speech on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Termination of Employment) Bill No. 1:
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  One would assume that the federal government would support such an amendment as the federal system has always supported access to genuine employees, so the government should have no objection to provisions that ensure genuine employees—and I stress ‘genuine’ employees—are captured by the unfair dismissal system. To further make the point: you cannot at one level deem an employee for tax purposes and then for workplace relations purposes exclude them. We have made it quite explicit in our suggested amendments that any person who is categorised as an employee for tax purposes will also fall under this act for unfair dismissal purposes.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I regret that this bill before us will still result in this situation—that people who are designated as employees for tax purposes will be designated as independent contractors for other purposes. Neither the government nor the
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
                   ALP
                  </a>
                  supported that amendment on either occasion. I regret the fact that Labor did not because I think this matter is at the heart of the policy contest. This issue is not about politics; it is about what you think is the best way to categorise a person as an employee.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The definition before the parliament—the one that we are going to be moving later—is a rework of our previous definition and replicates the definition outlined by Stewart in his submission to the House of Representatives inquiry into independent contracting and labour hire. The Democrats recognise, as does Stewart, that the definition does not have to be universal and that there may be particular policy arguments for why a particular type of worker—for example, an owner-driver—should or should not be covered. We have followed the current bill in its exemptions of owner-drivers and outworkers in recognition of their unique circumstances and in the knowledge that the government have indicated they will look further at both these industries with respect to rights and protections.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  We believe it is highly desirable in the private and public interests to be able to readily determine when a person or a business is subject to laws of employment or the law of contract. The Democrats recognise it is a complex area but believe that the current situation in the bill before us fails to address the fundamental issues. It is our view that a definition of ‘employee’ is the best solution.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Mr Temporary Chairman, Minister and shadow minister, I have deliberately detained you with a lengthy dissertation on a busy day because we think this is a fundamental area which will need to be resolved. I believe that what the government is proposing will not resolve the issue of who is a genuine contractor and who is a genuine employee. This particular issue is at the heart of our belief that we cannot support the bill because it has chosen a policy direction which we disagree with. We base it on fundamental policy considerations. With that motivation and context, I hope you will support those two amendments.

                   I thank Senator Murray for his contribution. He might be pleased to know Labor is supporting his amendments. There are a number of issues I want to touch on. The first is—and this really goes to the heart of some of the problematic policy in this legislation—the difficulties with the common-law test in determining who is an independent contractor and who is an employee. Senator Murray has outlined some of those. Certainly anyone who is practised in the area of employment law or is an industrial relations practitioner on either side of the fence would know that there are a great many arrangements entered into by parties where the name and title of the relationship probably does not indicate the true nature of the relationship.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Certainly many of us would have experience in dealing with people where they have been termed and treated as independent contractors when, for all intents and purposes, they have been an employees. And often, as Senator Murray has pointed out—and this really is the critical issue—there are occasions when the principal clearly has a fairly strong vested financial interest in continuing to treat somebody as an independent contractor, notwithstanding that the person might, for all other intents and purposes, effectively be an employee. It is arguable that the difficulty with the common-law test—and this was alluded to in quite some detail in the second reading debate—is that it is possible, because of the multiplicity of factors, for justice not to be done, that the common-law test application may not yield what we as legislators and as policymakers would think is an appropriate outcome that is fair to the person who is working.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Labor does believe there is clearly a place for genuine independent contractors. There are a great many Australians who choose to work under those arrangements, but our concern is for those who do not have a choice, for those who are effectively employees but are being made into, essentially, sham independent contractors because the principal concerned has a financial interest in having that occur. I indicate to Senator Murray that Labor does support a statutory test. As we indicated in our second reading contributions, we do believe that we need a better statutory test. We are going to support Senator Murray’s amendment to this bill, and I think there are related amendments to the

                   One of the points that Senator Murray made, which is a good one, is the inconsistency with income tax legislation. The government is happy to have at least the inclusion of a statutory test in looking at personal services income but is not prepared to look at a statutory test, other than to pick up a common-law test, in the context of this legislation. Labor will be supporting this amendment. We think it is critical to any regime that you have a sensible and clear statutory test to determine who should be an independent contractor—someone who is genuinely in such an arrangement—but equally there should be a statutory test for those people who really, from a public policy perspective and from a legislative perspective, should be regarded as employees and have the benefit of entitlements pursuant to industrial relations legislation which would normally accrue to employees.

                    There are many flaws with this legislation, but the fatal flaw is the very thing which Senator Murray’s amendments seek to address. The legislation does not seek to define the term of independent contractor beyond its meaning under common law. And Senator Murray is dead right: the problem with the

                    At common law, employees are engaged under a contract of services, whereas contractors are engaged under a contract for services. In other words, an independent contractor is generally a person who is engaged on a labour-only contract, usually determined as a one-off flat rate. Generally, the independent contractor remains responsible for a number of aspects of the relationship that would usually be the responsibility of an employer—for example, superannuation payments and remitting income tax to the
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATO" rel="nofollow">
                     ATO
                    </a>
                    . We say this is very problematic, and it means that an independent contractor is seen to be a person who contracts for services to be provided without having the legal status or protections of an employee even if they are dependent upon that contract. Of course, owner-drivers are a good example of that.

                   <p>
                    The common-law test that has been applied by Australian courts and tribunals for many years is quite difficult and complex. The criteria applied by the courts involve many factors, and I just want to go through them to demonstrate the test’s complexity and why we get substantially different outcomes from different judicial rulings. The criteria go to the question of the degree of control the worker has over the work; the degree to which the worker is treated as part of the principal’s enterprise—for example, whether the worker wears the principal’s uniform or, for owner-drivers, whether their truck is painted with the employer’s logo; whether the worker is using his or her tools and equipment; how the principal pays the worker; whether it is at the worker’s discretion to work; whether the principal has the right to dictate hours of work and whether or not the worker can refuse those hours; the provision of leave, superannuation and other entitlements by the principal for the worker; the place of work; whether the worker has the right to delegate work to others; whether the worker provides similar services to the general public; and whether the worker is providing skilled labour or labour that requires special qualifications. They are not all of the provisions, but they are the main criteria used under the common-law test.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    While we were conducting the Senate inquiry into this legislation, Professor Andrew Stewart, who appeared before us—and Senator Murray has touched on this to a degree—said in relation to the common-law test:
                   </p>
                   <p class="italic">
                    The fact is that any competent employment lawyer can take almost any form of employment relationship and reconstruct it as something that the common law would treat as a relationship between principal and contractor … thereby avoiding the effect of a wide range of regulation which is typically applicable only to employees, such as industrial awards, registered agreements, leave and superannuation legislation and unfair dismissal laws—
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    if they apply to companies with more than 100 employees. What this bill really does is try to stop the attempts of state legislatures to overcome the difficulty of the common-law test by putting in their own legislation. While we agree that some of those efforts are not perfect, dismissing them, disregarding them and overruling them through this legislation just takes us back to something which is considerably worse. That is why we say the real motivation of this legislation is not to define what independent contractors, dependent contractors or genuine contractors should be; it is simply another government legislative attack on any form of regulated employment standing.

                    s, which simply fail to protect the standards, wages and conditions that they have enjoyed for many years. Of course the independent contractors legislation provides the second avenue of pushing people out of an employment relationship altogether into what this bill calls ‘independent contracting’. If you are an independent contractor, whether genuine or not, under this legislation the minimum standards of Work Choices—the lowest wages and conditions that are allowed for—do not apply. Under independent contracting, there is no protection of wages and conditions. There is no regulation for even the minimum wage. We say that this legislation in its entirety is flawed. We will certainly be voting against it. We understand the numbers and the reality these days that the legislation will get up, but if the government is serious about trying to address the problem of genuine independent contractors having rights and people being properly and easily determined as employees, it will seriously consider the amendment.

                     For the Greens this issue goes to the heart and the intention of this legislation. It is about removing even more workers from a regulatory system that protects their rights at work. A critical element of this legislation is that it takes them further away from any structured process where they can have their conditions protected. As I articulated in my second reading contribution and as has been said in the chamber today, there is a contradiction in terms of a worker being defined as an employee under common law and the taxation act when, under this legislation, it only applies to common law. What is good enough for the taxation act should be good enough for this piece of legislation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The legislation clearly moves the balance even more in favour of employers and leaves employees further out in the cold. It makes it even easier for employers to shift people so they become so-called independent contractors and thus exempts them from the further requirements of providing the normal conditions that people expect as an employee rather than an independent contractor. By failing to define what an employee is it makes a farce of the supposed intent of the legislation. Basically, it makes a farce of the whole legislation.

                      I think it is imperative that I direct my comments to honourable senators opposite. We talk about employees, independent contractors and employers, but there is a huge group in the Australian workforce who are left out of this discussion—that is, dependent contractors. Quite frankly, I am getting annoyed at the way in which the government and those opposite try to muddy the waters and make it look like every contractor in Australia is independent. I can assure you that in the trucking industry they certainly are not. I dispute some figures put out by the

                        I hope the minister is listening. In the other house the minister said in his second reading speech that the bill recognises that owner-drivers, like outworkers, have particular vulnerabilities. To lead up to how they have these particular vulnerabilities I would like to point out a very few pertinent facts that seem to have been missed through the whole debate from those opposite. We always referred to these people as ‘subcontractors’—before the government started making promises at the last election to their mates at the top end of town. I will still refer to them as subcontractors.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        The majority of subcontractors perform work for one employer. In performing work for that one employer, they are directed as to the time they commence work, where they go and where they load and unload. The company also directs them as to the time they will finish, when they and their truck will be available to perform transport duties and when they can have some time off. If they want to have a holiday, in many circumstances the transport company requires that they go out and find drivers. So their trucks are locked into the transport company. In the majority of cases the trucks of the subcontractors are painted in the company’s livery or they carry the company’s stickers on the sides of their doors. The majority of subcontractors who are dependent upon these employers wear the uniform of the company. There is this great myth being generated from the government side of this chamber that subcontractors can walk into a trucking yard and just demand what they are going to be paid, when they will make themselves and their truck available and when they will work. I can assure you, Mr Temporary Chairman, with the greatest of respect, that that could not be further from the truth.

As I said in my speech in the second reading debate a couple of days ago, when they were quizzed as to how many members they represent in the transport industry, they could not tell us. Mr Ken Phillips had no idea. All you do is pay $5 and make an application then they ring you up—they were his words—and have a little chat and you are in. And these people turn up purporting to represent the transport industry.

                        and your good state of Tasmania. I assume that fuel is very close to the same price around Australia, bar Queensland. There are still truck payments, insurance payments, repairs and maintenance, truck purchases and the like. For the life of me, Minister, I cannot understand why Minister Andrews can accept New South Wales and Victorian legislation to protect owner-drivers in those states—legislation that was put together by both sides of industry, those representing the employers and those representing the employees, and government. In Western Australia it was a hand-in-hand operation.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        I can go further, Minister, and give you some more insight into my thoughts and those of transport operators in Western Australia. Back in 2000 we were looking at a major shutdown of the industry. There was a dispute—I do not have it in front of me, Minister, but I can provide it to you. I think the cost to the economy of the port dispute was about $30 million. We were heading for a shutdown of the long-distance operations in and out of Western Australia. You can understand that, in the great state of Western Australia, if it is not going by road once it leaves Geraldton we rely on ships. But we do not have ships running regularly into our northern ports so you can appreciate that everything in and out of these mining centres and agricultural centres is by road.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        But that shutdown was avoided at the last minute by good-faith negotiations between the Transport Workers Union representing these 2,000-odd owner-drivers and the Transport Forum of Western Australia, which is not a left-wing radical mob, I can assure you. They are the peak transport industry representative body in WA and they saw the problems that were being confronted too. They were getting absolutely squeezed by their markets—certainly, major mining companies were guilty of that. They wanted a resolution because they could not attract the men and women to the industry to carry on the transport tasks through the state of Western Australia.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        I kept very close to that issue, as you can appreciate. It was wonderful to see both sides of industry, supported by the Gallop Labor government, saying: we have a responsibility not only to make sure we have a safe and sustainable transport industry but to provide a safe road system to other road users. Plus, in Western Australia, as around the rest of the country with the drought and all that, we have centres not in the major cities that are really struggling, and they rely on a safe and efficient transport system. Minister, I will give you the opportunity—I look forward to it—to explain to me: what the heck is the difference between contractors in New South Wales and Victoria and their counterparts in every other state and territory of this fine nation?

                         would alter the objects provisions and remove the reference to these entitlements. This would create uncertainty about the status of fundamental contractual rights that are usually accessible by any person who enters into a contractual arrangement.

                         The government does not support this definition of ‘employee’ and, as a result, does not support the application of it to the
                         <a href="http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:legislation/billhome/R2584" rel="nofollow">

                         </a>
                         . This definition does not approach the question of the person’s status with an open mind, as the common law does, but requires a court to presume that a person is an employee unless they can prove otherwise. The government opposes any amendment that places an increased burden on independent contractors to prove their status. This is a disincentive to flexible working arrangements.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         More fundamentally, however, the government opposes the definition of employee proposed by the Democrats because that definition would include an exhaustive list of factors that point to a person being either an employee or an independent contractor. This is less flexible and narrower than the existing common-law test that allows consideration of all relevant factors and circumstances impacting upon the relationship between the parties. The government will not support amendments that reduce flexibility by departing from the long-established and well-understood common-law tests.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Amendment (2) proposed by the Australian Democrats would seek to unnecessarily confine the meaning of ‘services contract’ as defined by clause 5 of the Independent Contractors Bill 2006. In effect, the amendment would mean that a contract is not a services contract where it is for the supply of labour within the meaning of the definition of employee that is being proposed by the Democrats. As currently drafted, a person cannot be a party to a services contract if they are a common-law employee. Subsection 5(1A) of the legislation requires a party to a services contract to be an independent contractor. Because of this, the government considers that an additional provision stating that a person cannot be a party to a services contract if they are an employee is unnecessary. However, more fundamentally, the government does not support the operation of the Independent Contractors Bill being confined by reference to the definition of employee proposed by the Democrats. This definition does not approach the question of a person’s status, as I have indicated before, with an open mind, as the common law does.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         That is all I need to say in relation to the technical aspects of the amendments. However, a number of issues have been raised such as why we would have a common-law definition as opposed to that which is used for income tax assessment purposes. The government position is that they are substantially and indeed materially different. The test in the Income Tax Assessment Act was developed with taxation and revenue considerations in mind and not suited for use in the Independent Contractors Bill.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         There are two reasons for that which I would like to advance. Firstly, for tax purposes the test only applies retrospectively. It determines a worker’s status for the previous tax period based on the nature of the income earned in that time. This is problematic in the context of the Independent Contractors Bill as parties to a contract need the ability to determine their status at any point in time. It is not practical for them to wait until the end of the tax year to find out whether they are entitled, to or obliged to pay, annual leave entitlements, superannuation, workers compensation insurance et cetera. Secondly, to apply the tax test, the principal must know details of all of a worker’s sources of income and claim base for the previous 12 months. As this information is particular to the worker, not the hirer, it would make it difficult for a hirer to know whether the person they have engaged in fact satisfies that test. The common-law test is a simpler, more flexible and better understood method of distinguishing an employee from an independent contractor. Indeed, the High Court has ruled in relation to the common-law test of what an independent contractor is. As much as these things can ever be settled, I think the common law is relatively stable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         It would be fair to say that the Labor Party’s approach, especially in relation to this, is to seek to have as many people as possible classified as an employee as opposed to an independent contractor. I do not think that would necessarily be the motivation of Senator Murray. From the Labor point of view, that is a difficulty they confront.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         I forget who raised during the discussion the issue of implementation of the provisions, but I simply indicate that the government has allocated $15 million over four years for compliance and education concerning these bills, including assisting people to assess their status as an independent contractor.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         In relation to the possibility of sham contracts being entered into, there are substantial new penalties for sham independent contractual arrangements in this legislation. As a government we are concerned that opportunistic behaviour is dealt with and that there is an appropriate disincentive for that. But, having said that, we do support flexibility, and the bill reflects that independent contracting is a commercial relationship. It strikes me as somewhat surprising that we believe that independent contractors have sufficient nous, skill and capacity to negotiate the purchase of their tools, their prime mover—

                           In fact, independent contractors usually do buy their own tools and equipment. They buy their own truck. They negotiate their commercial arrangements with a financial institution. They arrange their own commercial contracts for the provision of the supplies and services they need. They do all these things, but somehow, when it comes to negotiating their own terms of providing their services, they are completely unable to do so. I simply suggest to those opposite that, if you accept that independent contractors have those commercial capacities, chances are they have those commercial capacities in relation to themselves as well.

                           parliament. This government is not in a position to consider whether to exempt legislation that is yet to pass the Western Australian parliament. The government has announced a review of owner-driver laws in 2007—that is next year—with a view to achieving national consistency where possible. So there is some degree of validity in Senator Sterle’s comments, and that is indeed why the government had already decided to have this review.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           Where the legislation already exists, as it does in Victoria and New South Wales, we have been able to take that into account. In brief, regarding Western Australia, we cannot legislate in relation to legislation that does not exist. The review will be an opportunity for everybody to put their assertions and counter-assertions. We as a government encourage all stakeholders to participate in that review so that the truth can come out.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           During this debate I think Senator Sterle made some comments about dependent contractors. The term ‘dependent contractor’ is used by some to refer to a worker who is at common law an independent contractor who provides a service to only one entity or to primarily one entity. Proponents of dependent contractors consider such workers to be employees. The term ‘dependent contractor’ incorrectly assumes that a contractor who performs work for primarily one entity is financially dependent on that entity and in an unequal bargaining position as compared to their principal.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           This ignores the reality that independent contractors may be comfortable performing work for one principal or being engaged on a long-term contract. For example,
                           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT" rel="nofollow">
                            IT
                           </a>
                           professionals or contract engineers tend to be engaged on more complex and long-term contracts than independent contractor fruit-pickers. Highly skilled professionals are in a strong bargaining position as compared to their principals. The common law does not recognise the existence of dependent contractors. At common law, there are employees on the one hand and independent contractors on the other. Consistent with the common law, the government also does not recognise the existence of dependent contracting. The government considers that to adopt and use such a concept in the

                           Bill 2006 would blur the distinction between commercial arrangements and the employment relationship.

                          <p>
                           I think that deals with all the matters that have been raised during this bracket of discussion. It will not come as any surprise to Senator Murray that the government opposes his amendments.

                           <p>
                            I want to respond to a number of propositions put by the minister. The first is his point that there is no such thing as a dependent contractor because the common law does not recognise it. There are a great many things that the common law does not recognise, and that is generally why we have parliaments, legislation and policies. We are not governed entirely in our world by common law. We recognise that, whilst the common law has been one of the strengths of our system of democracy and law, at times—for good public policy reasons and to reflect the reality of people’s lives—parliaments need to legislate. So for him to fall back on a technical argument that the common law does not recognise anything other than an independent contractor or an employee probably demonstrates some of the problems with relying too much on the common-law definition.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            There are a great many Australians who are effectively dependent contractors. In terms of legal form, their relationship may well be that of an independent contractor. But one would also argue that, in terms of their bargaining position, their ability to negotiate, their dependence for their livelihood and the terms and conditions of their engagement on a particular principal, they are significantly removed from the kind of orthodox construction of what an independent contractor is.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            There is a second point I want to make, and this is probably the more important one. Senator Abetz suggested that we on this side somehow do not believe that independent contractors have sufficient nous—I think that was the word he used—and capacity to negotiate with the contracting party. He seemed to suggest that, given that they had sufficient nous and capacity to negotiate the purchase of equipment, why would we think that they did not have the nous to negotiate with the contracting party? This demonstrates the heart of the government’s philosophy on this and its absence of understanding about who has economic power. This is actually nothing to do with whether people have the ability, intellectually or otherwise, to negotiate. Nobody on this side is saying that. We are saying that there are relationships where the economic power is such that, no matter how good you are, you are not in a position where you can negotiate better rates and conditions.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            So yet again we have from the government this abstracted notion of choice that is removed from the reality of working relationships and of those who have economic power in those relationships. The same flaw that is at the heart of
                            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_Choices" rel="nofollow">
                             Work Choices

                            is perpetuated in this legislation—that somehow people have this choice. In reality they actually have very little or no choice, because they have so few options for alternative work and do not have the sort of bargaining power that is ascribed to them. The government simply do not acknowledge it. They simply say, ‘That doesn’t exist.’

                            This week a person came to see me, and I understand he also spoke to the media. I believe his name was Mr
                            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Murray" rel="nofollow">

                            . He was a contractor with, I believe,

                            , which is contracted to Telstra. His story was pretty compelling. This man has worked in this sector for a substantial period. He is a highly skilled worker who overnight effectively lost around $25,000 from his annual income because of changes that the principal imposed on his rates of work, conditions of work and conditions of engagement. I think he resides and works in Orange, and essentially he has no choice but to accept what has been altered in his contract of engagement with this firm.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            To tell John Murray that Labor, in standing up for people in his position, is somehow saying that he does not have the nous is to completely misunderstand the predicament this gentleman and many like him find themselves in, where they are effectively dependent on a single entity for their work, and that entity has the ability to simply redetermine, at will, the conditions of engagement. What is the choice that Mr Murray has? This is the fallacy at the heart of this legislation.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            I want to make a point about vulnerable workers. In his contribution, the minister seemed to ignore the fact that legislatures around Australia have recognised that the common-law definition of employee simply does not adequately protect many vulnerable workers. Outworkers are an example of that, and the government has belatedly come to recognise that fact. In the regulation impact statement in the explanatory memorandum—not the supplementary
                            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EM" rel="nofollow">
                             EM
                            </a>
                            but the EM to this bill—you can go through, at attachment A, which begins on page 27, a range of workers who are going to be affected by this legislation who previously were under state deeming provisions in industrial relations laws in the states. The parliament said that these workers may not or do not meet the common-law definition of employee but there are very good public policy arguments for giving these workers access to those rights which would normally be accrued by employees
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            The minister countered this by saying, ‘The Labor Party just want as many people as possible to be employees.’ Do you know what we want? We want people to be reasonably protected. We think there should be legislation to deal with unfair contracts. We think there should be statutory definitions to minimise the prospect of sham contracts. We think those employees who are vulnerable and who have been deemed by legislation to be employees because they do not meet the common-law definition ought to be protected.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            You can go through the sorts of people who are going to be left out in the cold—for instance, the milk vendors and cleaners who are under the New South Wales legislation. Cleaners have been deemed employees under
                            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                             South Australia

                            n legislation for some time. These are not people who have an enormous amount of bargaining power. The industry is generally dominated by women and has a high proportion of people from non-English-speaking backgrounds. Is the minister seriously saying, ‘It’s a commercial arrangement and we don’t have to worry about them’? This is the illogicality of the government’s position, which is actually driven by ideology and not by the reality of the experience of the lives of many working Australians. So Labor will be supporting Senator Murray’s amendments and we will continue to oppose this legislation.

                                John Murray

                               circumstance that was described to us by Senator Wong. From time to time I think it is not all that helpful to try to personalise these things. However, I would have thought that you cannot unilaterally cancel a contractual arrangement, but, of course, if it comes up for renewal or reconsideration then that is one of those things that contractors have to face. We make no bones about the fact that, when you enter into contractual arrangements, like any contract there are the advantages and, yes, there are the disadvantages. That is what people have to weigh up in their minds before they enter into these arrangements.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                               Whilst Labor and the Democrats are in support of these amendments, I do seek to separate out or quarantine the Democrats in relation to what I am about to say. The Labor Party clearly want to see as many people as possible classified as employees as opposed to independent contractors. I think most people around Australia would be surprised to know that, in New South Wales, the Labor government deems the following to be employees: carpenters, joiners, bricklayers, plumbers, drainers, plasterers, ready-mix concrete drivers and others prescribed by regulation. The Labor Party clearly want fewer and fewer independent contractors and more and more employees, and of course we know the reasons and the rationale for that. That is their trade union background. It is their right, but of course—as I think Senator Murray quite rightly said—this is a genuine contest of ideals and beliefs. The government approaches this on the basis that that which has been developed by the common law over many years is a good way to go. The common law is relatively settled in this area.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                               I simply say to Senator Murray: you legislate and put it down in black on white; lawyers and courts will nevertheless still argue about the interpretation, the meaning and the breadth and width. Just in recent times we had that sort of discussion within the Australian community about the highest piece of legislation in this country, if I can call it that—that is, the

                               So, with great respect to the honourable senator and the Democrats, I do not think that the legislative provisions that are being suggested will necessarily provide the certainty that the Democrats hope for. Albeit that I accept and understand that the motivation is to create that certainty, I just do not share the Democrats’ faith in legislation. I think Senator Murray and I have exchanged views on that from time to time in this chamber, where I—possibly uncharitably—accused the Democrats of immediately thinking, whenever they see a problem, that legislation is the means to fix it, whereas we do not necessarily take that legislative approach. But that is a difference in styles, a difference in philosophy. I indicate, as I did earlier, that the government opposes Senator Murray’s amendments.

                                , captive of the unions’, saying that all we want is to have as many people as possible classified as employees. Just so that anyone who is listening does not misunderstand us and does not get sucked in by Minister Abetz’s political agenda, which is what is really driving this bill: what the ALP wants is to have genuine contractors classified as genuine contractors and having the rights of genuine contractors and to have employees classified as employees and having the rights and protections that go along with that classification. That is what we seek to happen—nothing more and nothing less. To suggest that we are anti independent contractor or anti genuine contractor in any way is an absolute fallacy.

                                Let me say this, and it is not just words: I am an electrician by trade, and I know full well that the union I was a member of had as members more contract electricians than the employer federation, the employer organisation—many more. Unions are actually excluded by legislation that this government puts forward from representing contractors in collective contract negotiations. Why do they do that? It is because, many genuine contractors wish to use the union movement to negotiate for them on their behalf in contract negotiations—

                                  does not have policies very strongly in support of contracting and people who contract. What we seek to do, though, is to have people properly classified so they have the appropriate protections. Senator Abetz says, ‘People will enter into these negotiations, and if they enter into negotiations they have to take the good with the bad.’ Again, we accept that in terms of genuine contractors. But this legislation allows for so many people to be forced into an arrangement where they are called contractors but where they are not contractors, where they have no say in it at all.

                                  Does Senator Abetz really expect anyone to believe that those children who are employed as vendors at football matches, who are deemed by their employer as independent contractors, sat down and negotiated a genuine contracting arrangement with their employer? Does he really expect anyone to believe that? The reason the employers in those situations deemed those children to be independent contractors was simply to avoid paying them the rights that would normally have been available to them if they were employees. It was simply to avoid paying the casual loading. That is what they did. And what this legislation does is remove any state legislation that seeks to remove that sort of exploitation.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  Does the minister really expect anyone to believe that a cleaner in an office block, at a school or anywhere else sits down and negotiates a contract of work with the employer? It is just a ridiculous scenario for him to put to us. And that is because he comes from the environment where he is really talking about lawyers and professionals at the higher level who may have those skills, who have unique skills to sell, and they can negotiate around and bargain for them. They may have some economic and some bargaining power in some of those situations from that area which Senator Abetz represents. But the people we represent are vulnerable. They can be exploited. They are people who live and work in ordinary circumstances. Having them deemed as independent contractors simply removes their rights as employees.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  Senator Abetz can wax lyrical about freedom of choice and about people who want to be small business people, as if anyone who opposes this legislation wishes to stop that happening if it is genuine. We do not. We do not seek to stop that happening in any way. But we do say that if you are an employee you should be classed as an employee and it is not up to the employer to simply say, because it is cheaper for them and they can avoid their obligations as an employer, that you are an independent contractor.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  Senator Abetz then says, ‘Oh, yes, but there are sham arrangements and there are penalties.’ How does a school cleaner take their employer to court to say, ‘I am an employee not an independent contractor’? How do you do that? You go and get a lawyer. I was part of the inquiry into this bill, so I actually went and got a legal quote, because the only way to determine this is to go to the
                                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Magistrates_Court" rel="nofollow">
                                   Federal Magistrates Court
                                  </a>
                                  or the
                                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Court_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                                   Federal Court of Australia

                                  . So the school cleaner goes to a lawyer and says: ‘I really think I am an employee. I should get annual leave, superannuation and sick leave. I should get other provisions and other protections—all things that employee status gives me—and some security of employment.’ The lawyer says: ‘All right. We’ll run this case under this legislation in the Federal Court or the Federal Magistrates Court.’ The quote that they gave me if the employer was going to defend that action was that it would be a minimum of $30,000. Where does a school cleaner find $30,000 to get a determination from the court under this legislation to say, ‘I am really an employee’?
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  Just accept they do—someone might have $30,000 laying around in their back pocket—and they win and they are then determined to be an employee. The employer is not going to be very happy about that. They are covered by the
                                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_Choices" rel="nofollow">

                                  legislation and under the Work Choices legislation, of course, there is no more unfair dismissal. So what happens? The employer simply concocts a reason to terminate the employment of that person and then re-engages someone else on an independent contract status. The government says there are some protections in the act for sham arrangements, but those arrangements are shams in themselves, because ordinary people will not have the means to access that provision to have the determination made whether they are an employee or whether they are in fact an independent contractor.

                                  So it is about ideology, and that is where I started. That is what Senator Abetz is all about and that is what this government is all about. This is simply an ideological piece of legislation complementing Work Choices. It is not about the Labor Party saying, ‘We want as many people as we can to be classed as employees’; our objection is that the government want to ram as many people as they can into independent contracting when they know full well they should be employees, because it gives employers the ability to avoid their employer obligations.

                                   I do not want to delay this debate for too long, but through all the rhetoric of Senator Marshall there may have been two points that people may have taken as being true and they are demonstrably untrue. In relation to child labour—very emotive; undoubtedly a lot of people got sucked in by Senator Marshall’s comments—he would know full well, and he should know full well, that child labour laws are specifically the jurisdiction of the state governments. They are specifically excluded by this legislation. Therefore, any assertion being made about child labour laws against the Australian federal government or against this legislation is simply unsustainable and untrue. Indeed, as a former union official, he should know that in his own home state of Victoria a child needs to get a work permit from the state Labor government. Let us be quite clear on this. This legislation specifically upholds all the child labour law provisions in each of the states and territories. So to try to draw child labour laws into this debate is disgraceful, is dishonest and has no basis in fact whatsoever.

                                   We then got the other tear-jerker about the poor cleaner: how would that poor cleaner be able to go to the

                                   ? Filing in the Federal Magistrates Court will be about 40 per cent of the cost of filing in the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission. The current fee structure of the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission will cost a worker $1,916 to file an unfair contracts application and have the matter set down for a one-day hearing. In the federal jurisdiction that we are proposing it will only cost $769.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                   So once again we have deliberate misinformation being peddled by the former trade union officials in this place. If they are genuinely concerned about the plight of workers, they should go to the New South Wales state Labor government and say, ‘You should reduce the fees charged to poor workers who want to get access to the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission and you should follow the lead of the Howard government—the friend of the workers—who have reduced these sorts of fees within the federal jurisdiction right down to $769 in comparison to state Labor’s $1,916.’

I will not respond to their empty rhetoric but, when they make points that are either deliberately or unwittingly untrue, I will respond because I think the Australian people are entitled to the truth in this debate.

                                    In the interests of correcting ‘unwittingly or deliberately misleading’, which I think was the phrase that the minister used, I want to make this point: I think it was filing fees that the minister talked about—how much it costs to file an application in either the New South Wales Industrial Relations Commission or the

                                    . Let us be clear: he is not including legal fees in that analysis. The

                                    is a lay jurisdiction and a reasonably accessible jurisdiction. The government is proposing in this legislation a process of determination before either the Federal Court or the Federal Magistrates Court, so frankly it is completely misleading for the minister to make a comparison only on the basis of filing fees and not to address the issue that Senator Marshall was raising, which is the lack of access for an ordinary worker to a fully litigated and defended action to determine that they are an employee in the Federal Magistrates Court or the Federal Court.
                                   </p>
                                   <p>
                                    The figures the minister is talking about do not include any legal representation, so Senator Marshall’s point is a very good one. How is a cleaner working for a school who thinks that she or he should be entitled to annual leave and the rest of the entitlements that employees would ordinarily get supposed to pay a lawyer to run a case in the Federal Magistrates Court or the Federal Court? It is simply justice beyond the reach of most ordinary working Australians.

                                   <p>
                                    This is the lie at the heart of the government’s approach in this area. They say: ‘Look, we have these sham contract arrangements. You can go off to these courts and you can get these remedies.’ The reality is that people will not and people cannot, because the sorts of employees who we are seeking to represent on this side of the chamber—the sorts of Australian workers who we are concerned about in our position here—are not people who have tens of thousands of dollars to go to a lawyer to take an action through the Federal Court or the Federal Magistrates Court.

                                       Through the chair, I would like to explain to the minister exactly how it happens. It is fantastic that the trucking industry attracts true people—people who are true to their word and are the salt of the earth. Unfortunately these people get tricked, conned or misled. They may work for an employer as a company driver on all the right rates of pay, conditions and superannuation and with the protection of unions that go with awards. Then the boss comes out one day and says to the truckies: ‘Boys, gather around. We’re going to put in a bid for this you-beaut contract. We’re going to be running up to the north. We’re going to have 40, 50, 60 trailers a week; freezers; general; chillers; car carrying—the whole lot is all rolled into one. We need trucks. We need trailers. We can’t get the money from the board. Who wants to be a subbie? You’ve been driving for us for 10 years. You know we’re decent; you know we’re respectful; you know we won’t let you down.’ A lot of times truck drivers have done that, but unfortunately they have gone out on the word of their manager, which most of the time has been honourable, but it is not honourable in three, four or five years time. I notice that the minister is not even listening. The minister has his head firmly planted in the sand, and he is not even going to take advice from people who know what they are talking about—

                                         They do know what they are talking about; they have not been stuck in an office all their lives. I can tell you, Minister, it would probably do you good to get out to the trucking areas in Footscray or Kewdale and actually talk to real people who perform these duties and who rely on their unions to negotiate on their behalf. I would like the minister to take this in, as I would also like the senators opposite to take this in: a lot of them are members of a union because they do what they do best—that is, loading, unloading and driving their vehicles, their trucks, their road trains. That is why they went into it, because they are very good at what they do. In about 80 or 85 per cent of small businesses that are engaged in transport in this great country, the wife or the partner at home is running the business—the man drives the truck, although in quite a few examples the woman drives the truck, and they do that very well; they do not wear the blue singlet but they do that very well—and is taking the phone calls because another letter has come with a stamp and a finger with a ribbon tied around it saying: ‘Reminder: your tyre bill is now 30 days overdue. You know your $17,000 fuel bill? Guess what: that is overdue too.’ It is the wives and partners who are doing all the hard yards.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                         When the boss goes to renegotiate a contract with a major mining company or whatever, the major mining company normally says ‘Sharpen your pencil.’ When a contract like that is plonked down in front of these people, how the heck do they sharpen their pencil? I will tell you how they sharpen their pencil. For those opposite, who would not have a clue—if they do have a clue, they should hang their heads in shame if they are not defending truck drivers around this country who rely on certain bills to protect them—they go out and say: ‘Boys and girls, you pay so much for your fuel, you pay so much for your tyres and you pay so much for your insurance. We pay roughly the same. We might have a little bit more bargaining power, but we’re not buying vehicles. We’re not employing people; you’re doing all that. You need to sharpen your pencil. If you don’t like it, tough.’ That is exactly what happens.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                         So, Minister it could not be further from the truth to come out and lead Australia to think that truckies sit down and negotiate intense contracts when they enter into agreements when carting or hauling for a company, and that is no slur upon the great men and women in the trucking industry around this country. I think that it is quite insulting of the minister to even assume that and for him to jump up and attack my colleague Senator Marshall. If we are going to play by the rules, both sides should play.

                                          Very briefly in relation to Senator Wong’s comments about contract cleaners: she would be aware that any cleaner who feels aggrieved could go to the Office of

                                          Services. And the Office of Workplace Services, undoubtedly depending on its consideration, depending on the merits of the case, would take that case for free. Of course, that is what those opposite do not like. There is an independent body now that is willing to assist workers in times of difficulty, and of course those opposite are concerned that that deals the trade union movement out of the game to a certain extent. That is why they are so vociferously opposed. I can also understand some of the excitement opposite, and I will not take it personally because I understand they are confronting a ballot on Monday and I wish them all the best in that.

                                          On Senator Sterle’s comments, and this is going to surprise him: I agree with him. If truck drivers are, to use his term, tricked or conned, I think most of us would say that if it is a trick or a con it is a sham, and part 22 of our legislation deals with sham contracts. If an employer is engaged in a sham contract, if they are listed as a company—and I assume most of them would be—they face a penalty of $33,000 per event and potentially, depending on the amounts involved, would be required to make back pay as well. So we as a government are quite clear on this. If people are being conned, if people are being tricked, then it stands to reason that they are sham contracts. That is why we have this increased penalty regime to protect people from those shams.

                                           I think I will try to close this section of debate and put my two amendments to the vote. In closing, I will just make a couple of summarising remarks. I think the nature of the debate has exhibited exactly what I said earlier: how you define employment is indeed at the very crux of the dispute on this bill between the conservative side and the non-coalition senators. I said earlier, in my opening remarks, that this was not a debate that was political, meaning that it was not political in the sense of a daily, tactical and tit-for-tat sort of contest. It is, in fact, ideological. It is about ideas.
                                          </p>

                                           There is a long history of conservative ideology in this area which essentially is market orientated, which says: if you remove as many impediments as you can to the relationships which exist between people in work, whether they are self-employed or employed, you will lower the costs, you will therefore create a more efficient marketplace, and the consequences are general in that you will grow employment and grow the economy. The contrary view is that, taken to its extreme, that is a recipe for declining living standards and declining civil standards and it results in a deterioration in the social contract. Essentially, the view of those who say that employees should be determined to be so wherever they are genuinely so is that accompanying the definition or the belief in an employee status are protections that society has built around that status which are designed to ensure that society operates to the greatest benefit of the country as a whole. That approach goes back hundreds of years. It was the

                                           , Bismarck, who first introduced pensions to the world. We Democrats and, as you can see from the debate, the Labor Party and the Greens are of the strong opinion that we should maintain the wages, conditions and legitimate entitlements and security that attach to employee status. Our problem is that this law threatens to reduce those.

Sometimes that is true, but as I have done before I will remind the minister that this week we have probably had before us on the

                                               I take the minister’s interjection: ‘Far too many,’ he says, and I would agree with that. I am one of those who genuinely celebrated the Treasurer removing a couple of thousand pages of redundant tax law. I remind the chamber, in view of the minister’s remarks, that more legislation has been produced in the last 15 years than in the previous 85. So we are being swamped by legislation, and the government has got a lot to do with that.

                                                   Yes, but it would be even better. So I will not detain the chamber too much in that respect, but whilst I accept the minister’s obvious point that any statute is open to interpretation in the courts, the purpose of a statute is in fact to reduce the number of times or the circumstances in which you go to the courts. The government recognises that constantly in its legislation. Our amendment, to which these two amendments lead in in the next bill, would seek to reduce the circumstances in which you would have to go to the courts. It would reduce the need for deeming provisions because it would be more certain and more apparent as to when employee status exists.

I urge the Labor Party, when one day they get into power, to maintain the national regime that is predicated on this bill but to make the national regime much fairer and to introduce an employee definition.

In making that remark, I would appreciate it if the minister would deal with that particular perception from the Transport Workers Union.

In Western Australia, of course, they drive much further. I enjoy reminding visitors from overseas that Western Australia is the size of western Europe. It is a pretty big place to drive around.

They also respond that they recognise this problem and are going to review the matter in 2007. That is fine, except that a review takes time, a government takes time to respond to a review and it takes time to initiate legislation. Let us assume, for argument’s sake, that the

Even then we do not have any certainty that they would respond favourably to that. So what this amendment tries to do is to anticipate future legislation and to allow for the same exceptions that apply to New South Wales and Victoria to apply to those states and territories that introduce legislation which is consistent with New South Wales and Victoria.

                                                      What Senator Murray has indicated, and I think I am quoting correctly, is that his amendments are trying to anticipate future legislation. That is really asking this parliament to engage in hypothetical legislation because, just as much as we might take 18 months to respond, we might be legislating on the basis of something that does not occur in
                                                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

                                                      —the legislation could be withdrawn, deferred, delayed or whatever. Therefore, the government has taken the view that that legislation which is in place at the moment will be preserved—in other words, the status quo as it exists; where there is legislation it will be preserved and where there is no legislation in the states that position will be preserved. We will have a review next year, and depending on the outcome of that review we will take the matter forward. I indicate that we will be opposing amendment R(3) albeit that I think we will be voting on them together.

                                                      In amendments (4) and (5) the Democrats are seeking to alter amendment 10 of the bill to prevent the making of regulations that are inconsistent with the exceptions to the exclusion provision in section 7(2). Such regulations are currently permissible under clause 10. The exclusion provision and the exceptions to the exclusion provisions are very complex. Although I am confident that the provisions work as the government intends, it is always possible that there may be some unintended consequences. The regulation-making powers in clause 10 of the bill give the government the ability to promptly respond to any unintended consequences flowing from the operation of the exclusion provisions. The government does not intend to use these regulation-making powers to make wholesale changes to the exclusion provisions which enlarge their effect. Nevertheless, of course the parliament has a supervisory role over regulations and it can disallow those regulations. I think we would all agree that making a regulation to overcome unintended consequences is a lot quicker than seeking to amend legislation. So that is why we seek to have them stand as they exist. On amendments (4) and (5) I can also indicate that the government opposes the Democrat approach.

I would like to touch base on what the bill is about. I will not take up all the time in the chamber. I did say how it was done in conjunction with both sides of industry and the support of the government, so there was no-one forced into it. I must also note that it represents a heck of a lot more truck drivers than the 2,000 owner-drivers that are being represented by the
                                                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TWU" rel="nofollow">

                                                       and the 700 companies who engage owner-drivers in Western Australia. That figure could be anything—who knows?

                                                       The road freight bill will provide owner-drivers with security of payment. It will require principal contractors to pay owner-drivers a safe, sustainable rate, enabling them to operate safely. It will also—and this is very important—establish a road freight transport industry council, which will establish a code of conduct, including guideline rates and other provisions regulating the relationship between the parties. And it will create—and this is another very important part of the bill—a low-cost conciliation focused road freight transport industry tribunal to hear disputes between the parties regarding breaches of contracts, codes of conduct and payments. It will also allow owner-drivers to appoint bargaining agents, and they can be either union or non-union. That is spelt out very clearly in the bill. It can even include an industry body. That shows how much good faith has been put into the road freight bill in Western Australia by the industry with the support of the Labor government.

Together with other laws to be introduced into WA, such as the chain of responsibility legislation, it will reduce road trauma and the WA road toll, which is currently being impacted upon by road crashes involving heavy vehicles. It will enable thousands of struggling WA small owner-driver businesses to become financially sustainable, viable and safe operations.

                                                           The bill is going to be looked at in 2007 in terms of the exemptions if the state parliament puts in the road freight bills in WA, which it will. But what is the guarantee, with the threat of the independent contractors association pulling support for the bill, that we will not be driven down to the lowest common denominator—‘we’ being dependent contractors? I know you did say that we will review it and look at it but, and you have to forgive my cynicism, that could lead to us going backwards—‘us’ being owner-drivers in New South Wales and Victoria. Minister, can you categorically confirm that that will be the case?

We think it is appropriate to support Senator Murray’s amendments.

Amendment (6) amends the bill to give the court an express power to examine a contract that has become unfair because of the conduct of a party or for some other reason. The New South Wales provisions give the court this capacity, and it is pivotal in owner-driver cases, especially in what are known as goodwill and ‘starve out’ cases. I do not know if ‘starve out’ is special terminology they use, but it essentially means you hold out until the other side are so weary that they give in. Amendment (7) amends the bill to give the court the express power to examine the fairness of a contract where the contract is terminated. New South Wales provisions give the court this capacity.

At the moment the bill, unlike the New South Wales and Queensland provisions, allows the court to amend the contract only when unfairness has been found. If a party does not act in accordance with that amendment an applicant would have to take a breach of contract claim to get a monetary order—the same monetary order the New South Wales court can make in the first instance presently. This inserts an extra and costly step for applicants. This is a problem. Under this bill you have to do a two-step tango and in other jurisdictions there is easier and cheaper access.

Absent such an amendment, respondents with deep pockets will be able to unreasonably refuse settlement and starve out an applicant who will have to fund these costly cases. On those motivations I have moved the amendments.

We think that is meritorious—that there may be occasions when that is merited. Obviously that would be a matter for the court to determine. I also draw attention to amendment (7), which enables a post-termination review—as Senator Murray said, if a contract has been terminated—to enable the court to look retrospectively at whether or not some compensation should be ordered.
                                                                </p>

We think the flexibility to enable the court to look to what is just in the circumstances of the case is sensible. For those reasons we will be supporting amendments (6) to (9).

Prior to the government’s amendment there were problems with the unfair contracts provisions. The amendments which have been moved by Senator Murray and the Democrats would have substantially rectified those. But at least there was an avenue that could be used by independent contractors to redress unfairness in, or as a result of, their contractual arrangements. This unfair contracts provision of the bill has been held out by the government as evidence that it was putting in place protections for independent contractors. Despite the faults prior to this amendment, the provisions may have proved of assistance to some independent contractors. This must have upset the big business lobbyists, like the

                                                                 </p>

In reviewing a contract, the court must only have regard to, firstly, the terms of the contract when it was made and, secondly, other matters existing at the time the contract was made. This is ludicrous. It is designed to reduce to almost nothing the claims that could be successful under the provisions. To fully comprehend this just consider what an unfair contract application entails. An unfair contract application seeks to set aside or vary the terms of a contract to rectify unfairness. Take the example of an owner-driver. As the courts have consistently found, it will be an unfair contract if an owner-driver who has paid goodwill for entry into a business has their contract terminated without compensation for that goodwill or without the opportunity to sell the goodwill. It is only at the point of termination that the unfairness crystallises. Under this amendment, a court could not, as a matter of evidence, have before it the fact that a termination of the contract had occurred because the termination would obviously not be a fact existing at the time the contract was made. Therefore, despite the unfairness, the application would fail.
                                                                 </p>
                                                                 <p>
                                                                  There are other important areas which we should also consider. Just imagine there is another hurricane off the Gulf of Mexico—let us hope there never is one, but we have to admit that it could happen—and watch what happens to fuel. We have witnessed massive spikes in the cost of fuel in this country within the last 12 months. Unfortunately, the price of fuel went up about 30c a litre. That might not sound a lot, but let me use the extreme example of owner-drivers. Take the road train operators running from Perth to Darwin on a round trip of nearly 9,000 kilometres who are using one litre per kilometre. It is not hard to work out that if the cost of fuel goes up 30c in one spike, and this was not allowed for in their contract when they initially signed it, it has a devastating effect on that small business.
                                                                 </p>
                                                                 <p>
                                                                  Sadly, the majority of owner-drivers, who are small business men and women, have their family home on the line. It is as simple as that. They get in and buy a truck—well, they do not buy a truck but rather go to the bank, the bank graciously goes through what they own and what they have to their name and, as long as they have next week’s payment and equity in the home, the bank makes the loan and they can have a truck. So off they go. When you have a massive fuel hike like that, you, Mr Temporary Chairman Ferguson, would appreciate as much as any in this chamber, through your background in farming, what that can do to your business and to your family.
                                                                 </p>

One of the flow-ons from that was the massive hike in insurance premiums. I cannot talk in this place only about owner-drivers and the transport industry being badly affected by the spike in insurance premiums. It hit everyone in this country—every single business, homeowner and person insuring their car. The trucking industry in

Some 300 or 400 truckies—companies, owner-drivers, the whole lot—would shine up their vehicles, wash them, get the wheels polished, companies would donate vehicles and there would be a big fundraiser with rides for the kids, Ferris wheels and all sorts of things. There was very cheap food, and it was a good cheap day out. Entertainment was also provided. After September 11 the insurance for the park that used to be used in

The insurance hike on that park went above the $20,000 we used to raise on that day. So you can understand that, if we let this go through, the industry will really be in trouble. The Labor side see this as the government promising something with one hand, if amendment (6) gets through, and taking away with the other hand. So the Labor Party fully supports Senator Murray’s amendments.

                                                                   </a>

So it would allow the rewriting of commercial contracts applying to independent contractors even when the terms of a contract are fair when entered into. The government believes that that would create substantial commercial uncertainty. The current case law supports the proposition that the existing federal unfair contracts jurisdiction is concerned only with the unfairness or harshness of a contract at the time the contract is made.
                                                                  </p>

                                                                  </p>

This merely reflects the existing federal unfair contracts jurisdiction. The proposed amendment would broaden the scope of the orders that a court could make, consistent with the state Labor regime in New South Wales.
                                                                  </p>

That is already provided for and those sorts of provisions in all legislation—I say that as a personal comment—are always good to ensure that parties to court disputes do not behave unreasonably. It is an incentive for them not to do so if they think that costs can be visited upon them, but we already have that in clause 17(2).

We have fundamental concerns with the entirety of the sham contract regime that is proposed in the bill and the range of remedies that are set out in the bill. In the second reading debate I set out the reasons for our concerns and they have been touched on today in the debate. We do not consider the government amendments do anything more than tinker around the edges. The fundamental problems with the legislation remain. We do not consider these amendments deal sufficiently with the core problems in terms of the enforcement provisions of the legislation.

Government amendments (2) to (4) make changes to the sham arrangements, in particular misrepresentation of the employment relationship as an independent contract arrangement. Trying to attack sham arrangements is a good idea but it seems on the face of it that these changes soften the intended arrangements as originally put. The old provision said that:

                                                                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amendment" rel="nofollow">

It also allows for a person incorrectly dismissed to be paid compensation. My instinct is that amendment (1) is machinery, so we do not have to worry about that, and amendment (5) looks as though it is one we could support. But I have the feeling that amendments (2) to (4) soften the existing provisions and therefore should be opposed. I would appreciate hearing the minister’s motivation.

In relation to the provisions that he spent some time on, the government believe that they are generally minor. Under the new defence, an employer would need to prove that at the time the misrepresentation was made the employer did not know that the contract formed an employment, rather than an independent contracting, arrangement and that they were not reckless as to the nature of the contract. The employer would bear the onus of proof in relation to that. Basically, what we are doing there is ensuring—which I think most people would accept—if it was an honest mistake, that in those circumstances the employer would need in effect to prove that it was so. That is the purpose of those amendments. We are concerned to protect people from sham contracts, as we indicated earlier.

Bianca’s absence for the additional 8 hours will not be paid leave, and will not count as service, but it will not break her continuity of service (see subsection (8)).

So, consistent with that, we are not going to support these amendments. I want to make some comments in relation to amendments (10) to (13), but it might be as well to do that after the minister has outlined those amendments.

As we understand it, these amendments give inspection and prosecution powers to Australian Building and Construction Commission inspectors. We have had a consistent position in relation to the building industry, which has been a focus of much regulation and intervention by the government. Labor will never stand to support any corrupt practices, regardless of the industry in which they occur. However, we completely disagree with the idea that separate industrial rules and regulations for separate industries and workplaces is required. As I recall, Senator Murray, we have had fairly lengthy discussions, including some that went into the early hours of the morning, about this over a number of years. We made the point that, if there were issues with enforcement, they ought to be dealt with in the context of the existing legislation that applies to all sectors of Australian industry rather than in the context of an entirely new, separate regulatory system, which we consider is being set up to implement in large part a political agenda of the government. We will be opposing amendment (9).

Attached to that view is the need for a national regulator. The one thing labour laws lack in this country is an independent regulator. A tribunal or an industrial relations commission, whether state or federal, is not a regulator in the sense that I mean it.

They are fairly important, although obviously highly problematic, amendments, but I want to comment about the process. I think it was almost a year ago that we were in this chamber debating the Work Choices legislation. From memory, at that time 330-odd amendments were provided to the opposition and minor parties less than 40 minutes before the debate began. The bill and explanatory memorandum ran to over 1,500 pages in total, I think, and then several hundred amendments were provided less than 40 minutes before the debate began. I recall a number of senators, including Labor senators, very strongly making their views known about the inappropriateness of the government ramming through legislation with this level complexity in such a short time. Such concerns are obviously in addition to our concerns and our opposition to the extreme ideology which is at the heart of the government’s ‘Work No Choices’ legislation.

It really is another demonstration of the disregard for proper parliamentary processes that this government is demonstrating.
                                                                                 </p>

They have not been considered by the relevant committee. On top of Labor’s opposition to the entirety of the government’s ‘Work No Choices’ legislation, we are also opposed to poor legislative processes. There is a reason why the Senate has used a process of sending bills—particularly complex, difficult or controversial bills—to committees, with the government then considering the committee’s recommendations. Australia’s laws have been better for that. We had an example today already where the outworker provisions of the Independent Contractors Bill have, after the Senate committee unanimously recommended it, been removed from the bill. That is an example of the Senate committee process working. And I want to add my acknowledgement of the work done by Senator Troeth in this regard. She has convinced the government to back off from what was extremely unfair legislation in relation to outworkers.
                                                                                 </p>

These provisions deal with issues such as redundancy entitlements and stand-downs which Labor regards as entirely objectionable. They deal with the Fair Pay and Conditions Standard and a range of other matters contained in schedule 6.
                                                                                 </p>

This is extremely complex legislation. The government ought to have redrafted the entire Workplace Relations Act. Instead it chose to bundle into this parliament 1,500 pages of amendments plus explanatory memoranda and then, on the morning of the debate commencing in the Senate, put up 330-odd amendments. Now, in the context of discussing another bill, the government is tacking on a whole range of amendments to its industrial relations laws. That is what is happening—without the benefit of the Senate having perused them properly through the Senate committee process.
                                                                                 </p>

I am happy to have a further discussion shortly about the content of some of the amendments. I am not sure whether my colleague wants to make a contribution—it does not appear so. Senator Murray and Senator Siewert may wish to speak in relation to these amendments first.

The way in which the Work Choices legislation hearing and debate were dealt with were in fact offensive, not just offensive to the senators who were opposed, because of the way in which the debate was managed, guillotined and cut off, but offensive to good process. Good process as a legislator means the opportunity to identify problems with complex legislation which even the brightest of advisers in the department will not be able to see all the way through to realise what the effects are.

I will be frank: we as the Democrats have not had the opportunity to really understand and comprehend them to the fullest extent possible. We would have been considerably assisted by a committee process to establish where they were favourable, where they were unfavourable and where there were drafting problems. The fact is that, whatever the law, governments constantly need to amend it. It is far better to amend it in its primary form than to have to amend it thereafter, because of course those to whom the law applies then have to adjust their systems, their understanding and their own reference points.

We did ask the whips to convey a message that we wanted these matters examined in a short committee process. That has not happened, although I note that the government did give a few extra days for us to get across these. There do appear to be drafting errors which might need correction.

The government is now referring bills to committees for inquiry with short reporting dates, and, in some cases, the very short inquiry is then followed by a long gap before the bill actually gets to the parliament.

Just last week, the minister removed from a social security bill a key and controversial schedule giving search and seizure powers to Centrelink officers. The Independent Contractors Bill itself benefited from the minister reacting positively to the committee’s views on outworkers. So the committee system does still work, despite what we regard as most unfortunate changes to the way in which committees operate. I must say that we would have appreciated running substantial amendments through the committee, and we ask the government to consider, for future significant amendments to workplaces legislation, giving sufficient time so that committees can examine these matters.
                                                                                  </p>

The government is moving to address those unintended consequences. We think mistakes will have been made—and have been made—in that legislation. It is good to see the government correcting them, but of course, in the meantime, it puts business and employees in difficult situations where the legislation is imperfect to begin with.

Firstly, it stops people waiting for that decision before deciding how to deal with this legislation. I think there has been a bit of that going on. Secondly, it makes the community realise that, if they want that legislation to change, they will have to overturn the coalition government. It is my view, I might say, that, if the coalition government is returned at the next federal election, it will be an indication that that legislation has been given an official tick-off by the electorate, because this Work Choices policy was not taken to the last election. Thirdly, there is a danger that this wider power granted by the High Court will be used in other areas, which will make the states very unhappy.

Amongst the cases I can think of over the recent past are the Spotlight case, the Cowra abattoir case, the Lufthansa call centre case, the Heinemann Electric centre case, the

Those sorts of cases have a number of advantages. Firstly, they inform the political and policy debate amongst the broader community. Secondly, of course, they have the value of alerting the government to genuine issues and problems and, because the government want to get re-elected, they therefore react positively in some cases to fix this.

Government amendment (10) relates to protecting redundancy entitlements and preserves the agreement terms providing for redundancy pay where the agreement is terminated or where there is a transmission of business for a 12-month period, unless the parties agree otherwise. These measures would apply in relation to workplace agreements, pre-reform certified agreements and pre-reform Australian workplace agreements. In the case of a workplace agreement, redundancy provisions would be preserved where the agreement is unilaterally terminated by the employer with 90 days notice. In the case of a pre-reform certified agreement or pre-reform Australian workplace agreement, redundancy provisions would be preserved where the agreement is terminated by the Industrial Relations Commission on application by the employer, where it is not contrary to the public interest.
                                                                                  </p>

                                                                                   The changes to schedule 3 would also provide for the treatment to preserve redundancy provisions on transmission of business. These provisions seem to be a direct response to the

In spite of there being no work at Tristar, the longest serving employees are being kept on until after 30 September, when their enterprise bargaining agreement expires. While the provision is an improvement on the current situation, we Democrats have been alerted to potential flaws and administrative problems. The new provision preserves the agreement for 12 months. The question then is: what is to stop an employer keeping someone on for 12 months, say in the transmission of business, and after 12 months letting them go? So it is effectively a transition arrangement and not a protective arrangement. There are also concerns that the new provision will not protect those let go for operational reasons. The government’s Work Choices amendments made it easier for employers to use operational grounds for releasing a worker. The new provisions also leave it up to the employer to inform employees about redundancy entitlements rather than an independent third party like the commission. As I said, there are uncertainties that the new provision will meet the stated objectives, and we are not in a position to form a final opinion.
                                                                                  </p>

It modifies the frequency of payment guarantee so that a contract of employment or workplace agreement guarantees an employee frequency of payment for periods of one month or less and compels the employer to comply with such provisions; caps the accrual of annual and personal carers leave so that leave does not accrue in respect of hours worked above 38 hours per week; changes the payment rule for personal carers leave, compassionate leave and leave for pregnant employees who cannot be transferred to a safe job so that an employee is entitled to be paid a rate for each hour of leave taken at his or her hourly basic periodic rate of pay, which is consistent with the payment rule for annual leave; and enables an employee to request to cash out an amount of paid personal carers leave each year, provided the minimum balance of at least 15 days leave remains available after cashing out for full-time employees and pro rata for part-time employees.
                                                                                  </p>

Others are concerned that it will encourage people to stay at work while they are sick so that they can get more cash. It may discriminate against those with chronic illnesses if they do not get to bank their sick leave. So there are supporters for and those against. The amendments do appear to be a result of drafting errors in the original legislation, which the government has been criticised for and which have caused concern for business in terms of calculating and paying leave in accordance with the new standard. So some of amendment (12) is an improvement on the current act and some makes a return to pre-reform conditions. There do seem to be a couple of negatives within that amendment, such as  giving the minister greater power under section 12(4) to exclude more categories of shiftworkers.
                                                                                  </p>

Again, without sufficient time to consult and examine the consequences of this amendment, it is difficult for us to form a final opinion. The parts of the amendment which we consider to look attractive are amendments which will require an employer to give a copy of an

A simple solution would have been to require both the employer and the employee to sign a statutory declaration. I have a few other remarks to make but, in broad, I hope that indicates that we think it is a bit like the curate’s egg—there are parts of the egg we are not sure how to evaluate.

As I understand from the minister’s contribution and from the supplementary explanatory memorandum, amendment (10) tries to improve the situation for employees.

I understand both from advice I have received and from the public discussion that with Tristar you have an agreement that has been in place for a number of years, negotiated by the employees and their union with the employer and relied on in good faith. The profile of the workforce is that you have quite a lot of people from non-English-speaking backgrounds and a number of employees with very long years of service. As I understand it, the employer has sacked the employees who have been at the workplace for only a short period of time, while the long-serving employees, as Senator Murray pointed out, continue to be in employment, despite the fact that there is little or no work being conducted, and the employer has applied to terminate the agreement.
                                                                                   </p>

Does the government have any advice as to whether or not this amendment will protect Tristar workers? I would appreciate it if, in answering that, the minister could give the government’s view on the fact that the insurance bond protecting employee entitlements at Tristar expires on 30 December and our understanding is that there will then be no money to pay the employees. Does the government intend this amendment to deal with circumstances such as Tristar? Does the government consider that this amendment will protect those long-serving employees at Tristar who continue to be engaged apparently to avoid reasonably generous redundancy entitlements? It appears the minister is getting some advice on that, so perhaps while he does that I will deal with the stand-down provisions, unless Senator Siewert wants to intervene at this point.

These address a mixture of what were apparently drafting issues—and I will come back to that in a minute—and of substantive changes to the act, such as the stand-down provisions and the cashing out of carers leave and sick leave. The drafting errors are a result of legislation hastily rushed through last time, and both Senator Wong and Senator Murray have addressed this issue as well. As we all know, it was a large piece of legislation given very little time for review. About 700 pages of amendments with 40 minutes notice were dumped on us in the committee stage of the

At the time we all very carefully articulated our concerns that we had not had time to review them and that there would be drafting errors in the process. Surprise, surprise—of course there were drafting errors.
                                                                                    </p>

                                                                                     Then, to compound that, these series of amendments were given to us with about 40 minutes or less notice as well. Not only were those amendments attending to drafting errors; there were as I said substantive changes. We have not had time to adequately consider those substantive changes, and the point is that those substantive changes have not been out for community consultation and have not been subject to committee review. We managed to pick up some drafting errors last time—textile outworkers are a very good example of what was picked up last time through the committee process, and a number of other issues were also picked up—but this time the normal committee process has been circumvented and it has not been subjected to that, so we have not had time to see whether there are any substantial drafting errors and to make fixes.
                                                                                    </p>

People can be stood down for a downturn in work, ‘a breakdown of machinery’, ‘a strike’ or industrial action or any ‘stoppage of work for any cause for which the employer cannot reasonably be held responsible’.
                                                                                    </p>
                                                                                    <p>
                                                                                     Look at a breakdown of a piece of machinery as an example. As I articulated previously, I am deeply concerned that an employee could be held responsible for a breakdown of a piece of machinery. We have not had time to look at whether that would mean that a breakdown of a piece of machinery is not a cause for a stand-down or whether that overrides a stoppage for which an employer cannot be held responsible. I would argue that, if the machinery was being properly maintained, it is less likely to break down. However, I believe this is open slather for employers to abuse and be able to use any excuse to stand down any employee.
                                                                                    </p>
                                                                                    <p>
                                                                                     The same goes for carers leave and sick leave. I have heard both sides of the argument, but I have not been convinced by the side that supports being able to pay out sick leave. I think this is an essential part of what we should take as standard conditions in the workplace. That is, if people are sick they are entitled to take sick leave. The point is that nobody actually knows when they are going to get sick. If we knew when we were going to get sick, we could just wad it out as leave. But we do not: we do not know what the seriousness of the illness will be; we do not know when it will occur or with what frequency; and we do not know whether it will require a longer amount of leave.
                                                                                    </p>
                                                                                    <p>
                                                                                     I have heard several stories over the last couple of days of people saying that they have relatives who have suddenly become sick. In one case, the person has cancer and therefore needs to use their leave. Particularly when you are young, you never think anything is going to happen to you. You think you are well; you think you are healthy: ‘Why do I need sick leave?’ So in particular I am extremely concerned about young people being encouraged to think: ‘Oh, it will never happen to me; I will trade some in.’ I am also concerned about what it means for women, in particular those with family and carer responsibilities who might be tempted or subtly pressured into cashing out their leave. This would then directly impact on their caring abilities and their family relationships. It makes the family-workplace balance even harder than it was before—even harder than Work Choices has made it since last year.
                                                                                    </p>
                                                                                    <p>

We could not properly analyse the first set of legislation, and now we have not been able to properly analyse this set of amendments. There are other concerns around clause 10, dealing with redundancy. I know there are a number of concerns around about what this actually means beyond some of the other issues that have been raised and what it means in terms of the supposed new greenfield arrangements. We went through a lot of debate during the last debate over Work Choices about the concerns we all had about greenfield arrangements. It affects what happens following a takeover or transfer of ownership of an existing business. We have not had time to analyse those provisions adequately. We have had no community input. We have not been able to go to experts to check on this legislation in the same way that the committee was able to get in experts over the

We do not know whether the amendments that are being brought in to fix the previous drafting arrangements actually fix them adequately. Other things that have been slipped into this package of amendments that do not specifically address independent contractors are not only on stand-downs and sick leave but also on the ability to waive your right to a seven-day review of your

Now this so-called drafting oversight is brought to us as well. We have not had time to analyse that. The community has not had time to assess it.

Give no-one in the community time to look at them. Give no-one time to go to experts to have a look at them, and give nobody time to report to the Senate on what these amendments actually mean.’ This is a bad way of legislating. It is likely to introduce more drafting errors into this already complex, error ridden legislation and it does not do anything to improve workers’ rights in this country. In fact it substantially undermines those rights. There are a few positive amendments in this package. Those are substantially and totally undermined by the negative amendments, such as the provisions on stand-down and cashing out sick leave, and by many others.

Proposed new section 691A of division 7 sets out the powers of an employer to stand down an employee because of: a strike, a breakdown of machinery or any stoppage of work for any cause where the employer cannot be held responsible. There are a number of comments I want to make about this. First, it seems to the opposition reading this amendment that it is quite clear that it effectively gives employers the power to stand down their employees in quite a wide range of circumstances. It is a significant tilting of these arrangements in favour of the employer. We are extremely concerned that the move could further undermine job security. There is nothing in this amendment for employees.
                                                                                     </p>
                                                                                     <p>
                                                                                      There is one particular detail I want to focus on, and that is new clause 691A(1)(c)(ii). This essentially has the effect of saying that, even if you and your employer have agreed to a provision which deals with the process of stand-down—one that says, ‘There has to be this discussion or this notification,’ and the employer has the right to stand an employee down but first they have to go to the commission, a state industrial authority or another person or body which has been agreed—that agreement has no effect. That is the effect of the combination of clauses 691A(1)(c) and 691A(5). So even if you have an agreement with your employer to undergo a process before the employer can stand down employees—a process which includes going to the commission, a state industrial authority or another body which has been agreed—these clauses say that you do not have to comply with that.
                                                                                     </p>

It gives a lot of weight to the notion of freedom of contract where it is the employer’s freedom to offer an

But here, where these are agreements which might give an employee some protection in terms of a process or a third party being involved prior to a decision by an employer to stand an employee down, the government say, ‘No, we want to bypass that.’ It is a bit like—and I think we had this discussion previously—the prohibited content provisions of the, ‘Work No Choices’ legislation which enable the minister to determine that something that has been agreed between industrial parties is prohibited content and therefore has no effect.

We on this side of the chamber are vehemently opposed to them. We think they unfairly tilt the balance of power in favour of the employer. We think there is very wide scope for those provisions to be misused and we will be opposing them. So I ask the minister, if other senators are not making any further contribution on these amendments, whether he could respond, particularly to the Tristar redundancy issue that I raised.

First of all we had a degree of rhetorical flourishes from senators generally, and I do not want to go into too much detail in responding to those other than to say that Minister Andrews did in fact issue a press release some 17 or 18 days ago indicating these releases. I might add that it was not just a normal one-page press release; it was a four-page press release. So there was some extensive material covered in that.
                                                                                      </p>

                                                                                       I was delighted to hear senators saying that on some occasions they believe the Senate committee system works and on others it is an absolute disgrace. Of course what that indicates is that when they get their way the system works and when they do not get their way it does not work. Really it is a bit of a churlish and childish argument. What I think we now have, by way of agreement, is that we accept that the Senate system is still working and working very effectively. When the Senate committee system comes up with good ideas, we as a government of course will take them on board. But we are the government that have been elected and we have to make the decisions as to whether the decisions thrown up by Senate committees are good, bad or indifferent. It stands to reason that from time to time we will say, ‘Good idea, we’ll adopt it,’ and at other times we will say, ‘Bad idea, we won’t adopt it.’ I do not think it a robust approach to the criticisms that are being sought to be made to try to say that the Senate system does not work when we reject certain proposals.
                                                                                      </p>

In fact the power is granted in the

They do not have the power to actually grant extra power to the federal government. Suffice it to say there are previous examples of federal governments, especially of the other persuasion, using the corporations power in the area of industrial relations.

                                                                                       Dealing now with the comments made mainly in relation to schedule 10, this is a new protection of redundancy that in fact has not existed before. The government is concerned that employees bound by agreements may lose redundancy entitlements where the agreement is terminated by an employer and no replacement workplace agreement is made. If an agreement is terminated, an employee may no longer have any redundancy entitlements regardless of their length of service with their employer. Therefore, in order to protect employee entitlements, the amendments proposed by schedule 3 will preserve the operation of agreement based redundancy provisions for a maximum period of 12 months after the agreement is terminated.
                                                                                      </p>
                                                                                      <p>
                                                                                       Agreement based redundancy provisions will only be preserved where an employer unilaterally terminates the agreement. The government is primarily concerned that employers may seek to terminate an agreement unilaterally—that is, without an employee’s consent—in order to avoid meeting their obligations with respect to redundancy pay. Any redundancy provision in a workplace agreement, pre-reform Australian workplace agreement, pre-reform certified agreement or preserved individual or collective state agreement will continue to operate post termination of the agreement. Redundancy provisions mean all provisions relating to redundancy pay where the entitlement or obligation crystallises because of a termination or proposed termination of employment at the initiative of the employer on the grounds of insolvency or genuine operational reasons. This definition is consistent with the allowable award matters definition of redundancy pay in items 9, 19, 21 and 22. All machinery and incidental provisions will also be preserved in order to ensure the workability of the provisions.

I look forward to his support in relation to those. In relation to Senator Wong’s comments, we are not embarrassed by moving amendments. We as a government have always said and always accepted that, when you bring in reform legislation, be it the goods and services tax or indeed

The one that I will deal with quickly is the issue of sick leave being able to be traded away. As I understand it, at all times an employee will need to have in their, if you like, bank balance of sick leave a minimum of 15 days. Anything above that can be traded away but only in circumstances where the employee is agreeable to that taking place. This, of course, is portrayed by some as the harshness of the Howard government et cetera. I say to those senators opposite: guess where we got the idea from? Out of a pre-reform industrial award negotiated by a trade union.
                                                                                      </p>

                                                                                       If you want to visit all that rhetoric upon us as the Howard government, have the decency and honesty to do so as well with the trade union movement. But you will never do that because all you ever want to do is, unfortunately, besmirch the Howard government and say this is extreme legislation, when of course these extremes are picked out of some of the better award provisions that exist around the country negotiated by the trade union movement. I just wish there was a bit more rigour and also a bit more acknowledgement in the debate as to how the industrial relations system in this country has moved on to where trade unions themselves have seen the benefit of allowing workers to trade off their sick leave entitlement whilst ensuring that there is at all times a balance of 15 days.
                                                                                      </p>

Senator Siewert and I think Senator Wong took delight in going through some of the bases on which workers could be stood down. As I have asserted about those on the opposite side from time to time, what they do is they tell half the truth, not the whole truth. What they say is that the employer has the capacity to stand down in a whole range of circumstances. That is true. What they will not tell you is that, if the employer does so unlawfully, penalties apply. Therefore, if an employer seeks to abuse those provisions and not abide by the tight provisions contained, they suffer a real penalty. I would invite those senators, when they engage in the detail of this debate, to tell the whole truth, to indicate the totality of the provisions and not just half.

In reading union negotiated awards and advising ourselves about the different awards and different approaches, from time to time we have found good information and good ideas in them—and we are willing to adopt them. But, when we adopt union award provisions, do not come in here and visit upon us all this rhetoric about our somehow being extreme. If you want to do that, you will have to look in the eye the trade union officials who negotiated these awards and say, ‘You’re no better than

That is why it is in these awards and that is why it is in this legislation as well.

The scope of the provisions is similar to the stand-down clause in the Metal, Engineering and Associated Industries Award 1998—an even earlier award which has been in operation for some eight years. The amendments provide a number of remedies to deal with unauthorised stand-downs—and that is the countervailing or balancing provision. As a result, the claims being made by those opposite are even more extreme than what they say about the government’s legislation. A lot of this is, of course, informed by what has been in the industrial system for quite some time. If the Howard government adopts in legislation the views and approaches of trade unions in particular awards, it is deemed to be extreme, nasty and grinding workers into the ground. But, of course, if trade union officials negotiate these agreements then somehow it is all okay. There is in fact enhanced protection in relation to stand-downs, which has not been provided for before, by providing the penalties I have referred to in relation to any breach of the particular parts of the schedule that are being referred to.

He is quite mendacious in the way he has constructed his argument. Senator Abetz is very good at picking up on one aspect of something that has occurred previously and using it to put his point. The example he often uses is that unions have previously negotiated these types of provisions and, therefore, we should support them in the legislation. So, often, he conveniently overlooks anything that might have been negotiated in addition to those provisions. It is extraordinarily inaccurate to argue that, because penalties might have been traded away in a previous union agreement, it is okay for the government to give employers the ability to unilaterally remove penalty rates—that if penalty rates or other entitlements had been dealt with under the pre

Remember that the context prior to the ‘Work No Choices’ legislation was that there was a no-disadvantage test—a test against the award—so you could not be worse off overall. That is what the government removed. So now you can have an agreement where you are worse off. That is the core of the government’s legislation. What you are saying is that you want employers to be able to tell employees they are going to remove penalty rates, overtime rates, shift allowances, leave loading, redundancy, rostered days off and so on. But guess what? The Howard government does not think you deserve any compensation for it. That is your policy, so do not come in here, Senator Abetz, and say that unions used to do this, or this used to happen, because you know that the context was entirely different. The reality for employees was entirely different. People were entitled to get something for something. If they gave something away, they were entitled to get something for it. Your legislation says, ‘Give it away without getting anything back’—and you know it.
                                                                                       </p>

Through awards, employees had so many other conditions as a matter of right—well above the minimum five conditions. So do not come in here and say to people, as if they have been given something, that they have five conditions in law. They had them anyway—and many more. You just took away the many more. You chucked a few conditions into some legislation and tried to tell people that you were making things better. The reality is that you are actually making things worse. If we are going to talk about what has occurred under previous agreements, perhaps we could have a little more honesty and detail in the debate. Senator Abetz could acknowledge that, previously, where things were given away, people had to get something for it—but now they do not.

It does set off a few alarm bells as to what the employer is doing. The question is: is the government going to allow the kind of behaviour to occur which is clearly designed to undermine the employee’s redundancy entitlements and to disentitle these employees from redundancy? The minister says, ‘Well, it is a pre-reform agreement.’ You are putting provisions into this legislation which are supposed to be about preserving redundancy entitlements. My question is: are they going to preserve these people’s redundancy? Instead of just whacking a union, maybe answer the question, because there are a few employees who have worked for this company for a great many years who might actually like to know the answer. I think those are all the issues at this point I want to respond to Senator Abetz on.

In relation to Tristar, I in fact did respond to all those matters. This seems passing strange. If we did not legislate at all and if we did not have a package of amendments being debated here now, would the Tristar employees be any better off? The simple answer is absolutely not. So to somehow try to portray this legislation as being an affront to Tristar workers is absolutely disingenuous.

What I do know is that since Work Choices came into being there have been another 200,000 jobs created in this country. Unemployment is now at a historic 4.6 per cent low and real wages are continuing to go up. Since the Howard government came to power, with all its industrial reforms, workers have enjoyed a 16.5 per cent increase in real wages over 10 years. During the 13 years Labor was in government, with a trade union movement with its feet under the cabinet table, the workers got a 0.2 per cent real increase in wages. That is why when the workers of this country look at their pay packets each week or each fortnight they see real wage increases the like of which the Labor Party could only dream of. Labor could only dream of it and we actually delivered it, because we were willing to make the tough decisions to reform some of the tax and industrial relations practices in this country.
                                                                                          </p>

You would have thought that if workers were dissatisfied there would be a huge spike in industrial disputes. In fact, it has come right down and it is at its lowest level since records were first kept. That is the record of the Howard government, and we stand by it. We are proud of that record, we are seeking to ensure at all times that workers are looked after, and the record of the government speaks for itself.

But I will take you to task, Minister. I will tell you why we have had the lowest level of industrial disputation over the last 10 years. It is because, when the Labor government introduced enterprise bargaining, one of the key clauses in every enterprise bargaining agreement was a dispute resolution procedure. All the hotheads can cool down while we go through the process and work resumes as normal—work carries on. It is amazing how it can diffuse a problem when someone is unfairly dismissed or when there is a problem for some other reason. Minister, you are very good at picking out the bits and pieces that suit you but, with your government’s latest shenanigans and

I have said this time and time again during this debate, and Labor senators deliberately seek to deceive the Australian people by saying that this somehow will impact on that. It is the responsibility of state Labor governments to deal with child labour laws. If there is a problem with child labour laws, do not point at us; point to your Labor premiers all around the country.

That was under the Labor government with the regime that they introduced that is so good. Do you know what it is today? It is now 3.1 days. It is still the same regime that Senator Sterle promotes to this country as being the reason that industrial disputes are so low. If that is the case, explain to me why under your regime, while you were in government and while Mr Beazley was employment minister, this country used to have to endure 104 lost days per year per 1,000 employees, whereas today that figure is right down to 3.1. I will tell you what changed: the government changed. We have made reforms, workers are getting paid more, they know they are better off and as a result there is no longer the need for industrial disputation at the levels that we used to have to endure when Mr Beazley was employment minister and the Labor Party, with the trade union movement, used to run this country.

I am obviously aware that the High Court does not grant a power; they confirmed a power and enlarged it, in my view. That was the view of two of the minority judges, and I agree with them. That is where we are.

Minister, I want to ask a question that you might consider taking on notice, because I very much doubt that you will have the information available right now. As I understand the minister, the minister has claimed that 200,000 jobs have been created as a result of Work Choices—not since Work Choices but as a result of the introduction of the Work Choices legislation. My understanding is that somewhere between a quarter and a third of all employees are still under state industrial relations law. Perhaps the government could confirm whether that is so and be specific about how many are under laws which are not the Work Choices law. Secondly, I understand that there is a substantial swathe of workers still under transitional arrangements. In other words, they are under certified agreements and other industrial instruments which are still subject to the pre Work Choices regime. Therefore, it would seem to me that perhaps a minority or perhaps a small majority of all employees in Australia are not yet affected by Work Choices. Can you tell us how many workers fall under Work Choices in each state and how many do not, bearing in mind the fact that many people are still on transitional arrangements?
                                                                                             </p>
                                                                                             <p>
                                                                                              Following on from that, once all those people have been through their transitional arrangements, how many more jobs will that create? As I understand it, you are saying that as soon as people move on to Work Choices large numbers of extra jobs are created. I would like to know how many extra jobs will be created when those people move out of the pre Work Choices regime into the Work Choices regime. The minister knows what I am on about. Essentially, my belief is that you are entitled to say that your changes to law are assisting the creation of jobs. My difficulty is that I do not think that you are entitled to say that Work Choices has created 200,000 jobs. Many other circumstances come into play there. The point has been made that in some of the states, such as New South Wales, there are actually negative effects on job creation at present. But I would like to know the actual figures. If the minister was able to refer that to the department and provide that in due course, I would be grateful.

I was quite confident, but then you asked a further question about the division between each of the states. Believe it or not, I do not carry that figure in my back pocket with me. I will accept Senator Murray’s chastisement that possibly it is not appropriate to claim that all the jobs that have been created since Work Choices are as a result of Work Choices. I accept that point. However, I would ask the Australian people to consider this: why did the unemployment rate in this country hover between five per cent and 5.3 per cent for well over 18 months—it was for about 20 months—and we could never break the five per cent unemployment barrier? Work Choices came in, and we are now down to 4.6 per cent. I invite people to ask what changed since 27 March 2006 such that we have seen that huge spike in employment other than the new environment in which employment now operates under—namely, the Work Choices legislation.
                                                                                              </p>

                                                                                               In my assessment, the overwhelming reason for the huge spike in employment—the huge decrease in unemployment—was the removal of the unfair unfair dismissal laws, because, as soon as employers felt confident that they could dismiss an employee who was not performing, guess what? They were a lot more willing to employ. As a result, whilst I will not claim this for all 200,000 people who have got jobs since Work Choices came into being, I have a funny hunch that a fairly substantial proportion of them have got employment as a result of our reforms.

The minister can try and say otherwise, but the exploitation we have seen of people under the age of 18 since this government introduced its legislation—and we will continue to see it with the independent contractors legislation—is not the responsibility of anyone other than the Commonwealth.

Senator Abetz wants to constantly say that they replaced the no-disadvantage test with five minimum conditions. What in fact they replaced in the no-disadvantage test was all of the other conditions, including the five minimum conditions which they have now legislated for. They took them away. The point that was made by my colleagues on this side of the chamber is absolutely correct: if there were going to be some changes to the award structure, there had to be a no-disadvantage test applied against all of the conditions so that in total people could not go backwards. If a condition was traded away—and this happened on a regular basis—it had to be compensated for in another way so that the totality of the package remained intact. People did not go backwards. People were unable to go backwards in totality under the old legislation.

For the minister to try to argue here, very disingenuously, that there is no real quantitative difference in what used to happen under the old legislation and what is now happening is simply wrong, and it simply seeks to mislead people about the truth of the effects of this legislation.

If anybody working an hour a week is classed as employed, I do not think that is an accurate reflection of what our employment market is in the year 2006.

That is a very significant proportion. With the figures of, I think, two months ago, there was a substantial reduction in casual employment, but that was offset by a huge increase in full-time employment, which I think confirms my thesis that, as soon as employers felt confident they could dismiss employees in circumstances where they were not up to scratch or failing, as soon as that shackle was removed from them, a lot of people who used to have casual jobs all of a sudden got full-time jobs, and that must be good for everybody.

You can spread the hours—and we have had this debate—split shifts and average people’s working hours over 12 months. What has been happening—and we see it all through the workplace—is that people who were working casual hours have simply been converted to full time on flexible hours, because you can spread the hours over 12 months and avoid paying the casual leave loadings because there is no requirement for that under this government. For this government to say that Work Choices has resulted in a conversion of casual to full time and that that is a good thing is simply a misrepresentation of what is really happening in the workplace.

I have been corrected by advisers in the advisers’ box: in fact, it was 184,000 who got full-time jobs. So the figures are even better.

And we were beaten around the head for having extra casuals. Now that the casuals are leaving and becoming full time, once again it is a conspiracy against the workers! The Labor Party really have to get their lines right on this. I suggest Senator Marshall have a chat with Jenny Macklin, get their lines right and then tell us what stance the Labor Party takes on this. Having said that, despite the provocation that might come from the other side, I will desist from responding so that we can get to a vote.

We had delayed amendment (6) and voting on item 4 of schedule 2 to allow Senator Sterle to come back into the chamber. I thought Senator Sterle had forgone the opportunity to speak. Clearly, he has not. Given that I understand Senator Sterle will be supporting the amendments, we do not have to recommit the vote, but undoubtedly Senator Sterle would want to put certain matters on the record. Allowing him to do that and then moving to Senator Murray’s amendments might be the quickest way. If Senator Sterle were to seek to do that, I would be delighted on behalf of the government to permit it.

I rise to say that Labor supports amendment (6). I would like to follow on from the comments of my colleagues. It was interesting that, when we had the committee down here, one of the best submissions I saw was the submission by the

As part of the submission they brought with them some 30 outworkers who would be grossly affected by this bill had this amendment not gone through. Once we heard from these people and saw exactly what they were confronted with, it really did make you appreciate that things are certainly not what they seem.
                                                                                                               </p>

After that submission, I can understand why. One of the witnesses who came and put a submission to us was a lady named Kim. Kim said, through an interpreter, that she considered herself one of the better clothes workers in the outworking industry. Some figures she passed to us showed that she gets paid $3.50 for a shirt, $3 for a long skirt and $2.50 for a plain cotton shirt. Coming from a background of living in thongs, shorts and singlets, it did not really click with me what that actually meant in terms of time—the time put into making these garments. Like I said, she considered herself a very good clothing maker, if that is what I can call them. She said that she cannot complete two garments in an hour. So it did not take long to work out that Kim was working for approximately $3 an hour. The sad part about this is that they are major labels that are in the major clothing stores. It was disgraceful.
                                                                                                               </p>

                                                                                                                To Senator Troeth, Senator Marshall and the rest of the committee’s credit, we found this amendment coming through. I notice that my colleagues have put Senator Troeth up on a pedestal. I would comment on Senator Troeth’s effort too. I tend to think that Senator Marshall was doing a heck of a lot of work behind the scenes, but I would probably liken it to banging his head against a brick wall. Eventually, it does hurt when you find the wall is not going to move. I also note that Senator Troeth is a bit of a snappy dresser. She probably thought that, if we do not look after them, she might not be snappily dressing quite as much!

But I think Senator Troeth and the government could have done a lot better. If we can have the moral conscience to look after those who cannot look after themselves, or those who would be exploited, why the heck did we not move and do something more for the truck drivers who are the dependent contractors around this country?
                                                                                                                   </p>

I know that, in the other place, Mr Tuckey, the member for O’Connor, has been furiously working behind the scenes to get his peers to knock out any exclusion for truck drivers. I use the term ‘knock out’ very loosely, because I know that that has probably been a touchy word to use in the coalition party room lately. Mind you—if you will indulge me, Chair—I recall that in 2001 when Mr Tuckey was minister for fisheries he was talking to a group of bluefin tuna fishermen. The meeting was going well until someone mentioned bluefin and then he wanted to knock them all out. I think the wording was that he offered to take them outside for a fight. So I can understand that a lot of senators opposite were probably very touchy on having the opportunity for truck drivers to have exemptions around the country.

What I do not know is what the independent contractors have to gain out of this.

He has not been involved in any of the debate here, but he could not wait to vote with the government. I would like to see the family impact statement on these bills. It would be interesting, because Senator Fielding has been very conspicuous in his absence. He stands there and bleats about looking after families—the families of Australia happen to drive trucks as well.

I think it allowed us to reflect on the quickness of the vote. It may be appropriate for us to recommit the vote—which I was suggesting against only a few minutes ago—because, if we have a look at government amendment (6), we would be inviting the chamber to vote in favour and then, in relation to item 4, I understand ‘that item 4 of schedule 2 stand as printed’ should, in fact, be the question. We would not want it to stand as printed; therefore, we should be voting no. If we could recommit those two votes, I think that would allow for clarity.

With respect to amendments (1) to (3) on sheet 5072, I have taken the opportunity of the government seeking to amend the Workplace Relations Act to deal with the issue of conscientious objection, because it has been very much in the news of late. I have done so because the present conscientious objection provisions in the act are directly a consequence of an agreement between the coalition and the Democrats in 1996.

I record my gratitude for their historical work. The note says that earlier versions of the federal Labor legislation promoted the formation and registration of associations of employers and employees. One aspect of this encouragement principle was that workers should contribute to the relevant union by way of membership in return for award rates and the employment conditions secured by unions. The federal law allowed awards and industrial agreements to provide for union preference until 1997, although it did not promote compulsory unionism. However, at different times state laws have promoted union preference and/or compulsory unionism.

These are religious groups which apparently do not tolerate their members joining unions or, for that matter, political parties. It was the

Similar exemptions were introduced in other industrial jurisdictions. New South Wales introduced exemptions in 1951. In 1956, provision was made in the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 for exemption certificates to be granted to non-unionists. This exemption was modelled on the provision in the New South Wales act. Thereafter, other states also allowed conscientious objection:

These fears went to coercion, intimidation and political association. Compulsory unionism and preference were made illegal in Western Australia in 1979. Queensland weakened preference clauses in 1976 and later in 1985.

It repealed union preference and introduced freedom of association and freedom of non-association. The Democrats supported freedom of association and it remains one of our key platforms. I must emphasise that we remain strong supporters of the right to join a union and the right not to join a union.

The fact of the matter is that, with respect to the provision exempting the Exclusive Brethren from the Workplace Relations Act on conscientious religious grounds, Peter Reith rang me late in the final stages of our negotiated agreement to say he was being heavily lobbied by them and effectively wanted to be rid of the lobbying. He saw it as a minor nuisance, saw no reason not to continue past practice for a small religious group if it meant so much to them and asked whether I and the Democrats would object to their previous status being continued. I replied, ‘No.’ I saw it as a small, unimportant side issue amidst the broader controversy and bigger policy issues of the bill.

I found him an engaging and warm man, with a strong intellectual and philosophical base for his views. It did not stop us having some very feisty discussions, but I always found him good to deal with.
                                                                                                                        </p>

Peter Reith and the coalition did intend to drop the provision and we Democrats were happy with that. Then they were lobbied and decided to backtrack, and we also accepted that. The phone call to me from Peter Reith produced the result that we now have in law.

That was never my impression, and certainly Peter Reith never, ever indicated anything of the sort to me. At the time of the amendment, the government had initially sought to repeal the conscientious objection and then decided not to. In hindsight, perhaps I should have insisted on the repeal, but I had more pressing issues to worry about at that time.

                                                                                                                         The parliamentary research notes on conscientious objection state that later the federal conscientious objection provisions were to have a new function similar in nature to those in New South Wales. This happened in 2001, firstly in an unsuccessful stand-alone bill, then it was reintroduced in 2002 as a Workplace Relations Act amendment, this time attracting Labor support. Union entry was prevented where a small business employer objected to membership of organisations on religious grounds, where the employer obtained a conscientious objection certificate from the Industrial Registrar and where the employer’s staff did not oppose the denial of entry. The provision concerning denial of entry on religious grounds is at section 762 and the related provision is at section 812. About 30 current certificates are issued under that schedule, and it is advised that all have been issued on application from the Exclusive Brethren. So the conscientious objection grounds are not employed, to my knowledge, by any other religious group and, as we know, in Australia there are millions of people adhering to religious groups.

The right of entry laws now have more stringent requirements for officials who wish to obtain and then maintain an entry permit. The procedures they must follow when entering workplaces have also been tightened. Unions must obtain a permit for conditional entry to certain workplaces to investigate a suspected breach of the Workplace Relations Act or to hold discussions with employees. Unions may only enter a workplace to investigate a breach of an award or collective agreement, or of the act itself, if a member of the union is carrying out work at the premises and the suspected breach affects a union member.

If all employees are on AWAs, or if there is a collective agreement to which the union is not a party, a union does not have a right of entry under the Workplace Relations Act for discussion purposes. However, the union does not need to have one member to enter for discussion purposes per section 760. It is my understanding of the Exclusive Brethren’s belief that members—and hence their employees—cannot belong to a union; therefore, under the new right of entry laws a union cannot enter the workplace of Exclusive Brethren business, because there would be no union members.

At the Senate building and construction industry inquiry on 20 May 2004, Mr John from the Exclusive Brethren stated:
                                                                                                                        </p>

But the same principle of conscience applies to membership and participation in the union endorsed agreements and funds which, we believe, go well beyond the requirements of the law.
                                                                                                                        </p>

If we ignore the political issues and just focus on the practical application of the Workplace Relations Act, the previous reasons for inclusion of conscientious objection provisions to avoid association and involvement with employee and employer associations on a compulsory basis no longer apply. My view, therefore, is that the provisions should be repealed.
                                                                                                                        </p>

Firstly, it is a contentious issue, according to media coverage. Secondly, the Democrats previously supported the conscientious objection provisions being in the act and I wish to advise the chamber that we no longer do. Thirdly, I believe that the way in which industrial relations law has now changed throughout the country, particularly with respect to the Workplace Relations Act, makes these provisions redundant. That is why I am taking this opportunity to move those amendments.
