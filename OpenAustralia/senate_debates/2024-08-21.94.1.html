       <p>
        Today, I have the pleasure of hosting a delegation of Tasmanian workers and representatives of the Tasmania salmon industry, who are here with us in the gallery. Also with them is Alison Jarman, the mayor of Devonport, and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        mayor, Shane Pitt. I extend a very warm welcome to you all here in the parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        The delegation represents a mighty industry that produces the best salmon in the world, and the Prime Minister has said the workers that produce Tasmanian salmon are also world-class. This industry creates jobs in regional towns. It is the lifeblood of local communities, and we are proud to back it. And I am proud to back all of you.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the things that I'm very clear about, and that the Prime Minister has also made clear, I will reiterate: we want the salmon industry to be able to continue to operate sustainably across Tasmania. Tasmanian salmon generates over $1.3 billion of economic activity and employs over 5,000 Tasmanians in good, secure and well-paid jobs, and, last year, it hit a milestone of $1 billion in exports over the previous five years.
       </p>
       <p>
        The industry has a vital role to play in Tasmania not just today but well into the future. We in Labor stand on the side of jobs, and we also stand on the side of sustainability. The Prime Minister was very clear when he said, 'We think the two things aren't contradictory; they go together.' My union motto was 'Never give up'. These workers are facing a massive challenge. They have a fight on their hands, and I'm standing with you in that fight.
