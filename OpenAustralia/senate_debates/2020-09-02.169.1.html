         I thank Senator Smith for his question. We're certainly aware that many Australians are facing hardship overseas because of the global travel restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Many Australians have been able to return—more than 379,000—since the government advised Australians to reconsider their need to travel overseas. However, about 30,000 people are registered with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
         </a>
         as being overseas and of those about 20,000 have expressed a wish to return. The government, through its network of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFAT" rel="nofollow">
          DFAT
         </a>
         consular staff, has been helping those Australians, with a focus on people who are most vulnerable because they have no means to support themselves or perhaps have medical conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
         Today the government has indicated that we will provide further support through an expanded hardship program, which will build on our existing traveller emergency loans program. These are one-off loans which will be available to cover emergency living costs until a person is able to return. Loans will also be available to help with the cost of airline tickets to return to Australia. Loans will be made to the most vulnerable Australians, and applicants will need to meet strict eligibility requirements, including, for instance, being able to show that they have attempted to return to Australia. This financial assistance is available to Australians, much like the traveller emergency loans, as a last resort. For further information, we of course continue to encourage people to visit smartraveller.gov.au. We understand that many Australians have found themselves in difficult circumstances resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and travel restrictions globally, as I said. The program we are announcing today will alleviate some of this hardship.

            I thank Senator Smith for his supplementary question. The government did act early to slow the spread of COVID-19 in Australia by recognising this as a pandemic and restricting entry to the country. Without these measures, taken based on clear health advice, the pandemic would have hit our communities much harder. Around 4,000 Australians continue to return each week. The states' and territories' incoming passenger caps remain in place through the national cabinet process to protect the Australian community; although, as the Prime Minister has advised, they are being regularly reviewed. The situation in Victoria has illustrated how dangerous a compromised quarantine system can be. Today's national accounts data also underscores the fact that, as well as the tragic loss of life, the economic damage is unparalleled in our recent history. We acknowledge that domestic caps are making it harder for people to return but we ask that Australians understand that there is a balance which has to be struck in the circumstances.

               I think it is important to note that this is a global pandemic which is far from over. There is no guarantee about when international travel, for example, will return to some form of normalcy.

               continues to work with airlines and other governments to assist Australians in returning, but it is going to be some time before flights are available. In that context, we encourage Australians seeking to return to stay in close contact with their airlines, their travel agents to confirm plans as they are able to do so. For those who are unable to obtain flights, we continue to encourage them to ensure they have arrangements in place to allow for a possible extended stay. The support announced by the government today is designed to help the most vulnerable Australians overseas maintain those arrangements. Australians overseas are also able to follow the advice of local authorities, of course, and continue to monitor the government's advice on Smartraveller.
