         I thank Senator Carr for his question. Senator Carr would know that the matter is before the High Court and, as such, it would be improper for me to comment. The government is awaiting a decision. In relation to Senator Carr's question about the return of asylum seekers to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka" rel="nofollow">
          Sri Lanka
         </a>
         , I have before me something those on the other side might be interested in. In fact, I am happy to have leave given, Senator Dastyari, for me to table these press releases. They are of course press releases that were issued by the previous government every single time they returned a group of asylum seekers to Sri Lanka. For example, on Saturday, 22 September 2012:

            , that was okay, but, when this government allegedly or does return asylum seekers to Sri Lanka, apparently that is bad. Senator Carr, your hypocrisy is astounding.

             I was on my feet before the minister had completed her question. However, I would like to make a point of order in terms of relevance. The particular question which I raised before was a specific question about numbers, but it also refers to return where there was an injunction issued by the High Court. I do not believe that was addressed at all by the minister in her response.

Senator Carr, in relation to your question, I believe that you are referring to the enhanced screening process. I advise the Senate that the process that we have followed in relation to enhanced screening is the same process that was practised by the previous government.

                      , I rise on a point of order. The question is very simple: have asylum claims of people aboard any vessels at sea been assessed via teleconference? That is the question. The standing orders require that a minister be directly relevant to the question. I would ask you to ask the minister to address the question.

As I was saying, though, in relation to former Minister O'Connor, he stated—

                            , firstly, congratulations on your new position. My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Abetz. My question is in relation to the 41 asylum seekers who have been forcibly removed to

                            , with 153 still remaining unaccounted for. Minister, after only a five-minute interview and knowing that asylum seekers will face an imminent jail sentence upon their return, what assurances does the government have that these people will remain safe from ongoing torture and persecution?

                             There are two issues here that do require a degree of circumspection. One is that we still have an operational matter underway, which would be unwise to comment on. Secondly, these matters are currently being canvassed in the High Court and therefore it would be inappropriate to canvass the matter any further in this particular forum.

I just point out that there is obviously the matter of 41 asylum seekers who have been returned, and that is not a matter before the High Court. Given the Prime Minister's comments that screening of these asylum seekers on the sea was in line with Australia's international obligations, despite what the

                               It has been a long-agreed process of this parliament both in the House of Representatives and in the Senate that legal advice to government in general terms is not released. Also, in the middle of a matter being determined by the High Court, it would be highly inappropriate for legal advice to be canvassed elsewhere other than in the High Court. In relation to some of the assertions being made about

Is the return of asylum seekers back to their persecutors what the government has been warming up for or are we to expect even more cruelty from this government?

                                 In stopping the boats, we as a government are warming up to take our full complement of refugees in an orderly fashion from the refugee camps around the world. As someone who has visited some of these camps in relatively recent times, I can assure you that they ask me the question: why is it that the then government allowed all these queue jumpers to come in when we have been waiting patiently for over 12 years, sometimes 15 years, for placement and they allowed queue jumpers who paid criminals to jump the queue? I see no sense of social justice whatsoever in giving priority to those who bypass safe haven after safe haven after safe haven and then pay a criminal to get them to the front of the queue. I would prefer to look after those who neither have the moral compass nor the financial capacity to queue jump.
