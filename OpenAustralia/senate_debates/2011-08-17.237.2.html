       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (g) to what extent have the impacts of the floods and cyclone in Queensland altered the planning for the exercises; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (h) based on the understanding that the Great Barrier Reef and other marine environments have been damaged by the recent extreme weather conditions and given the intense naval activity associated with the exercises, will the department consider postponing the exercises in order to give the region an opportunity to recover; if not, why not.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) In regard to the rights of traditional owners:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) to what extent has the department, representatives of any other government agency, or the ADF consulted with the Darumbal people, the traditional owners of the Shoalwater Bay area, on the use of Shoalwater Bay for these exercises or any other training exercises;

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) In regard to nuclear and chemical risks, the PER acknowledged that live firing can cause environmental contamination:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) are military activities exempt from the Commonwealth's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999?

       <p class="italic">
        (d) will depleted uranium armaments be used during the exercises.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (5) In regard to the use of white phosphorous and explosives that contaminate groundwater, and given that perchlorate, the primary ingredient in rocket fuel, has been found to have contaminated groundwater in 20 United States of America (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        ) states as a result of its use at rocket test site, military bases and production plants, that it has been linked to thyroid conditions, birth defects and problems with newborn development and that reports indicate it has contaminated food supplies in some parts of the US:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) will perchlorate be used during the exercises;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

       <p class="italic">
        (e) to what extent will heavy metals, including mercury and lead, be dispersed into the environment during the exercises.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (6) In regard to sonar risks, the PER notes that active and passive sonar will be used:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) can it be confirmed that mid to low frequency sonar is associated with whale beaching, brain haemorrhaging, and disruption to breeding cycles;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) given that the PER states that 'Australia and the United States are committed to environmental stewardship and take the need to protect marine mammals from the effects of underwater sound sources very seriously' â€“ can the Minister confirm that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Navy" rel="nofollow">
         US Navy
        </a>
        has exemptions from US legislation designed to protect endangered species and to allow their use of sonar virtually anywhere;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) is the Minister aware that in 2008 environmentalists in the US took the US Navy to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Supreme_Court" rel="nofollow">
         US Supreme Court
        </a>
        to try to stop them using sonar during the Talisman Sabre 2007 exercises in Hawaii because intense sound waves can harm or even kill 37 marine mammals, including sea lions and endangered whales;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) what guarantee can the department provide that sonar use during the exercises will not have adverse affects on marine life, including the beaching of whales, brain haemorrhaging in cetaceans and disruption to breeding cycles;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) how will the impacts of sonar on whales and mammals be measured during the exercises;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (f) how can the Minister guarantee the war games have not killed or injured cetaceans unless affected animals wash up on shore;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (g) what measures will be taken to mitigate any detrimental impacts of sonar on marine life during the exercises; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (h) measured from the vessels in yards, how far can the sonar currently being used in the exercises travel, given that the PER proposes that sonar will be suspended if a whale is sighted within 1000 to 4000 yards from a ship.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (7) In regard to the PER, which states that the exercises will destroy 2 hectares undersea in Shoalwater Bay and create significant noise and residue, and that 'the risk of psychological harm to marine fauna' is of concern:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) what is the anticipated psychological impact on marine fauna; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) what resources and services will be provided to address the concerns for psychological harm to marine fauna.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (8) Given that Shoalwater Bay is home to the east coast of Australia's biggest endangered dugong population, the PER states the animals will have to be moved away and that during the 2010-11 Supplementary Budget Estimates hearings of the Environment and Communications Legislation Committee it was described that large marine animals would be ushered out of the area:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) how many dugongs live in the affected area;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) what percentage could reasonably be expected to be ushered out of the area; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) what other measures are being undertaken to protect marine life from the effects of excessive sound caused by the exercises.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (9) In regard to noise and impacts on the local community:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) what has been done to protect the community of Byfield, Queensland, near the designated live firing range, or any other community in the area, from the risk of fire being caused in nearby forest;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) what measures will be taken to avoid excessive noise in habituated areas;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) will the US and Australian military honour edicts regarding flight paths to avoid excessive noise in habituated areas; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) can a guarantee be provided that 2 hectares is the maximum area that will be directly affected.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (10)Â Â Â  In regard to waste and water dumping, what measures will be in place to ensure that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) ballast water carrying introduced species will not be dumped in the marine environment; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) shipboard waste, which can starve, amputate, maim and infect marine life, will not be dumped in the marine environment but be disposed of properly.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (11) In regard to social or political impacts that question the rationale behind the exercises:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) do the exercises require state or federal environmental impact statements or assessments to be formally assessed by the Commonwealth or state governments;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) what independent mechanisms of assessment on the conduct of the exercises are in place;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) will the department conduct an analysis of the social impacts of the exercises; if not, why not; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) will the department conduct an analysis of the potential political impact of the exercises in the region in the current geo-strategic environment; if not, why not.

        <p>
         The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) Talisman Sabre 2011 is a joint and combined exercise and the funding is broken down across the Services and Headquarters Joint Operations Command (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HQJOC" rel="nofollow">
          HQJOC
         </a>
         ). The total cost to Defence to conduct the exercise incorporates the participation of other areas in Defence, and will not be known until after the exercise is complete, including any clean-up operations. For Talisman Sabre 2009 the cost of the exercise to Defence was estimated at approximately $48 million, excluding the cost of ownership of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Defence Force
         </a>
         (ADF) assets.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         It is not possible to separately cost Defence's environmental management of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercise_Talisman_Sabre" rel="nofollow">
          Exercise Talisman Sabre
         </a>
         2011. Environmental management responsibilities for the exercise are incorporated into participating staff's duties as part of Defence's ongoing
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_Management_System" rel="nofollow">
          Environmental Management System
         </a>
         . No financial resources will be dedicated to herding dugongs out of live fire areas as this is not the approach that Defence takes to mitigating risks to dugongs. Defence vessels avoid dugongs by altering course, slowing or stopping altogether when encountering these or other marine mammals, and activities such as live fire exercises are suspended if dugongs are at risk of harm.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) (a) Talisman Sabre 2011 is a United States (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
          US
         </a>
         ) led, Australian supported combined exercise focused on the planning and conduct of warfighting. The exercise does not include any scenarios involving training for nuclear warfare.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The environmental impact assessment process is designed to identify the potential risks of exercise activities and mitigate any effects to the extent practical. Talisman Sabre exercises do not cause any significant damage to the environment. It should be noted that Defence training areas like
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoalwater_Bay" rel="nofollow">
          Shoalwater Bay
         </a>
         Training Area (SWBTA) have been specifically set aside by the Government for the military to undertake training activities that have some risk of impacts.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Defence has been conducting major combined joint exercises at SWBTA for many years. Capricornia Conservation Council (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCC" rel="nofollow">
          CCC
         </a>
         ) observed on 22 March 2011 that 'for the past 16 years, conservation interests have been represented on the SWBTA Environmental Advisory Committee (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EAC" rel="nofollow">
          EAC
         </a>
         ). CCC has, in the main, been supportive of the measures taken by Defence to study, monitor and manage the SWBTA environment. Recent activities have included improved fire and pest management practices, the temporary closure of roads and damaged sectors to ensure remediation can occur following exercisesâ€¦ CCC believes that Defence has provided effective custodianship of SWBTA.'
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Risk workshops are conducted for each Talisman Sabre exercise with Defence, the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities (SEWPaC) and environmental consultants. An example of a previous 2005 workshop which evaluated various Defence activities including nuclear accidents is on the

        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) The potential for environmental impacts of major exercises are assessed by Defence in accordance with the requirements of relevant environmental, health and safety laws, international treaty obligations and Defence's own internal policies and procedures. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef" rel="nofollow">
          Great Barrier Reef
         </a>
         Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) also provides environmental advice to Defence on the potential impact of Defence activities on the

          Great Barrier Reef Marine Park
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (c) As is the case with other major exercises, Defence has undertaken the assessment of Talisman Sabre 2011 using the services of a professional environmental consulting company. The process has also involved regular consultation with representatives from State and Commonwealth environmental regulatory agencies.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (d) The assessment has not yet been completed and will not be finalised until after the final exercise planning conference confirms the activities that will be undertaken as part of the exercise. To date no significant environmental impacts have been identified.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (e) and (g) The condition of Defence training areas are routinely assessed as part of Defence's training area management procedures and environmental management systems.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         SBWTA terrestrial areas were not affected by the

         (b) All emissions and contamination arising from Defence activities associated with the exercises are managed in accordance with international treaty obligations, Australian domestic environmental, health and safety laws, Defence internal policies and procedures and specific exercise plans and protocols. Environmental monitoring data has been collected from water catchments around impact areas at SWBTA which demonstrates that use of SWBTA for military training is not having an impact on neighbours or the Great Barrier Reef. There have not been any significant incidents that have caused contamination of the environment arising from major exercises.

         (b) Perchlorate contamination is an issue on military training areas particularly where large numbers of rocket propelled munitions have impacted on training area targets. In Australia, Defence has done some monitoring of target areas to assess whether perchlorate contamination might be a significant issue. Given the comparatively low number of perchlorate containing munitions used in Australia, contamination is not considered a significant risk. No targeting of the marine environment by ordnance containing perchlorate is planned for Talisman Sabre 2011.

         (a) The PER identifies accidental physical and/or psychological harm to marine fauna caused by collisions from vessel manoeuvres and amphibious landings as a potential impact to the marine environment. This potential risk and impact is mitigated to an acceptable level through management controls such as the Talisman Sabre 2011 Environmental Management Plan (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMP" rel="nofollow">
          EMP

         ) and the ADF Maritime Activities EMP. The ADF Maritime Activities EMP dictates strict procedures recognised as leading the world in terms of the level of protection afforded to marine mammals. Procedures in place require activities to cease if marine mammals are detected prior or during the exercise, reducing the risk of physical harm to marine mammals to very low.

        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) The PER does not state marine mammals will be ushered out of SWBTA. The claim that large marine mammals are moved is not correct. The mitigation measures in place for Talisman Sabre 2011 used to prevent injury to marine mammals do not include any form of herding, relocation or displacement. The measures require the participants to cease activities if marine mammals are detected during a monitoring period before the activity commences, or during the activity itself.

        <p class="italic">
         (c) Talisman Sabre 2011 activities have been carefully programmed to avoid areas where marine mammals are known to congregate. As a secondary precaution, vigilant monitoring and, where necessary, shutdown of activities is mandated by the Talisman Sabre 2011 EMP and the ADF Maritime Activities EMP.

Environmental risk assessments involve both Commonwealth and State representatives from environmental regulatory agencies. For Exercise Talisman Sabre, the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, populations and Communities and the GBRMPA participated in the environmental risk assessments. Where impacts that are likely to be significant are identified these are referred to the Environment Minister for consideration. Defence also has its own professional environmental impact assessment staff who review exercise plans and procedures. For a major exercise like Talisman Sabre an Environmental Management Group is also appointed within the Combined Exercise Control group to advise senior military planners running the exercise on environmental mitigation and compliance issues.
