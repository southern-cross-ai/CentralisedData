        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Cormann. On Monday, the minister told the Senate that the report of the Religious Freedom Review Expert Panel was 'received by cabinet in May'. On the same day, Prime Minister Morrison told the House of Representatives:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … I first saw this report not long after I became Prime Minister …
       </p>
       <p>
        If the cabinet received the report in May, why did Prime Minister Morrison not see the report until at least five months later? Who is telling the truth—the minister or your Prime Minister?

         It is a matter of public record that the report was received by the government in May. Senator Pratt, who was asking a question, verballed something that allegedly was written in a letter that I'd sent to the Senate purporting to quote something which wasn't a quote. I can again confirm that the government received the relevant report, which was commissioned by cabinet, in May, that the deliberative processes of cabinet have not been concluded, that the relevant minister—

         —
        </p>
        <p>
         The deliberative processes of government have started. As I indicated on Monday, the deliberative processes of cabinet don't just start with cabinet receiving final submissions with final recommendations in response to a particular report. The deliberative processes of cabinet actually start with relevant ministers preparing a submission to cabinet and, of course, this particular document is the key input into the cabinet deliberations on this topic. It was specifically commissioned for that purpose. It was received by government in May, as is a matter of public record, and the deliberative processes of cabinet have not yet been finalised. It continues to inform the deliberative processes of cabinet. It is subject to the deliberative processes of cabinet. So, in due course, this will go in front of the full cabinet for a decision and, in due course, the government will release the report, together with the response the government has adopted.

            The government received the report in May. In terms of the specifics of that question, to make sure it's 100 per cent accurate, I'll take that part of the question on notice.

              Given that the leaking of the report of the religious freedom review panel is just the latest in a series of cabinet leaks since Prime Minister Morrison toppled former Prime Minister Turnbull, what steps will your Prime Minister take to identify the source of these leaks?
