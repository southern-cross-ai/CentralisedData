        My question is to the minister representing the Minister for Health, Senator Nash. Can the minister confirm that the Turnbull government is cutting funding to headspace's vital early psychosis programs by 70 per cent? Can she confirm that as a result of these cuts these centres will have to close? And is former Australian of the Year Professor McGorry right to say that if the centres close then almost certainly lives will be lost. Futures will be lost, because recoveries produced as a result of these programs lower suicide rates and save money for the health system?

         Thank you very much. If the senator's question is in context of the budget, then of course I am not going to speculate on anything that may or may not be in the budget this evening.

         In mental health, it is actually this side of the chamber that is focused on doing this. Those opposite know very, very well that last year there was a comprehensive strategy brought forward that is changing the way we are dealing with mental health in this country. Those opposite think that a Canberra based silo approach to mental health is appropriate. We do not. That is why we have put the work in and the mental health program that we are going to run out through the Primary Health Networks is going to be based—

           , on a point of order: this is a serious question about cuts to and closures of early psychosis programs. If the minister does not know—not only is that extraordinary, but perhaps she could also do us the courtesy of taking it on notice and finding out.

            <p>
             Those opposite might laugh, but this is a very serious issue. It is this side that is actually taking mental health seriously. In terms of headspace, we have expanded the headspace sites, not cut them. We are the ones who took the headspace sites to 100, not those opposite. It is this side that has concentrated on youth mental health, that has concentrated on all aspects of mental health, knowing that if we have locally based decisions that look at the best interests of mental health patients we are going to get far better outcomes. It is the coalition government that has put the work into developing a proper plan and outcome in this area.

                PHN

               rollout, this will be phased into the PHN rollout and there will be no cuts. Those opposite should stop scaremongering, and perhaps start focusing on developing some decent policy for this country, which clearly they are unable to do. When we look historically at those on the other side it is rolled out today in their incapacity to do anything properly. We have just seen a $19.5 billion black hole from those opposite, which was apparently a 'rounding error'.

                    , I ask a further supplementary question. Can the minister confirm that the Turnbull government is refusing to guarantee funding from July 2018 for the almost 100 headspace centres across Australia as part of the government's so-called mental health reforms?

                     I do not think I can be any clearer than saying the outline for this going forward, for what those opposite have raised, is being rolled into the Primary Health Network. It will move into the flexible funds. Those opposite should stop scaremongering, and start paying more attention to developing decent policy for the people across this nation who are sick and tired of the Labor Party doing nothing more than coming up with—

                       , I rise on a point of order on direct relevance. The minister was asked to confirm the government was refusing to guarantee funding for the 100 headspace centres. If she is unable to answer it she should take it on notice and sit down. Are you really unable to answer the question, Minister?
