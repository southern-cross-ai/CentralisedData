Is the minister aware of reports in today's media that in the year following the introduction of Labor's job-destroying carbon tax Australia's carbon emissions fell by just 0.1 per cent? Does the government believe this reduction in emissions is worth the damage being caused to the Australian economy and jobs?

The recent media articles have highlighted the ineffectiveness on the environmental front whilst also highlighting the job-destroying and household-budget blowing impacts of the carbon tax. Let us be quite clear here: if the carbon tax was such a good idea why did the Labor Party rule it out before the 2010 election by saying there would be no carbon tax? If it was such a good idea, why did they campaign on that issue?

            , in 2013, knowing how toxic the carbon tax was and is in the Australian community, they went to the people of Australia saying that they had abolished the carbon tax. Well, they had not. We are seeking to remove the carbon tax and those opposite, along with the Greens, are deliberately standing in the way of removing the huge mandate we got from the Australian people to remove the carbon tax. I invite those opposite to search their consciences. In 2010 they said there would be no carbon tax. In 2013 they said they made a mistake and 'We're going to get rid of it'.

              In fact, a very strong case can be made that Australia's carbon tax has made the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CO2" rel="nofollow">
               CO2
              </a>
              emissions in the world so much worse. That is the perverse outcome of this carbon tax, because what has occurred is the exporting of a lot of Australian manufacturing, under clean environmental rules in this country, having been costed out of the business, moving to countries such as China where the CO2output is so much greater. Whilst Australia can boast—if we call it that—of a 0.1 per cent reduction courtesy of the carbon tax, we know that as a result of manufacturing deserting Australia those CO2emissions are occurring elsewhere in the world—exactly the same experience as Europe has had with its
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETS" rel="nofollow">

                Australia's contribution of 1.4 per cent in general terms is relatively small, one would have thought, by anybody's standards. But it would be fair to say that, per capita, it is relatively high. But you know one of the important things—and Senator Collins might be interested in this—is we are the most efficient producers of wheat and dairy product for the world. We in fact feed millions of people around the world each year. Yes, in producing the wheat, in producing the dairy produce, we do in fact increase our

                 CO2
                </a>
                emissions; but, when you take into account the good that that does for the world's food tasks, one can only accept that it is in fact for the betterment of humanity at large. I would invite those opposite to take those sorts of considerations into account when they are seeking to destroy our economy and jobs.
