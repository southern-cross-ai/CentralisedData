         Thank you, Senator O'Neill, who I know is a very strong supporter of the manufacturing industry, particularly in her state of

         . A key commitment that the Albanese government made at the election was to rebuild Australian manufacturing after 10 years of neglect and turning our back on manufacturing under the former government. The Albanese government committed to build a future made in Australia, and the National Reconstruction Fund is a key part of doing that. The National Reconstruction Fund will provide finance to co-invest with industry to drive investments to grow advanced manufacturing and support businesses to innovate and create more good blue-collar jobs right across our country. The National Reconstruction Fund will also leverage Australia's natural and competitive strengths and shore up our supply chains.
        </p>
        <p>
         We saw through the pandemic how our supply chains were under huge pressure. Products we expected were hard to get. Across a range of products our supermarkets and pharmacies couldn't get us what we needed.

           </a>
           , and who could forget going to supermarkets with those empty shelves when we couldn't get the products that we needed? That was when some of us took note of the fact that our manufacturing industry had been run down, and some of us took note that we needed to be able to stand on our own two feet and make more things here. That's when the seed for the National Reconstruction Fund was planted. We know you hate manufacturing and we know you sent the car industry offshore. We know you don't like manufacturing jobs, but you finally have a chance to repent and get behind the National Reconstruction Fund.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Albanese Labor government is committed to building resilient supply chains and national sovereign capability to reinforce the prosperity, security, and wellbeing of the nation. The National Reconstruction Fund will attract investment, it will help to grow the Australian economy, and, most importantly, it will deliver good quality manufacturing jobs across our country.

                        I withdraw. As I was saying, the National Reconstruction Fund priorities have a very strong regional presence in sectors like resources, agriculture, defence and renewables. It's no wonder, therefore, that so many industry groups with a large regional presence are backing the National Reconstruction Fundâ€”to begin with, an organisation I've heard of called the

                        who, when Labor announced this commitment, talked about the opportunities for a renaissance in regional manufacturing. I would encourage all senators, particularly a little group over there to listen to groups like the

                           Well, Senator O'Neill, it is my melancholy duty to say that there are threats to this proposal. While the resources and agriculture industry are saying yes, yes, yes to the National Reconstruction Fund, those opposite keep saying no, no, no. These are industries that the National Party of all groups are supposed to be champions for in this place.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           I take the interjection from Senator McKenzie that it is a coalition, and perhaps that suggests that, maybe, there's not full agreement between the Liberals and the Nationals on this point. That would be very interesting to explore. I note that, in the past, Nationals Senator Matt Canavan has acknowledged that the past 20 years of federal governments, including his own, have dropped the ball on Australian manufacturing. He said that they dropped the ball, but there has been a real renaissance in manufacturing in Australia. Well, Senator Canavan and all the Nationals: I invite you to join with us with the

                           and with the

                           to get behind regional manufacturing. There's an opportunity to stand up to the north shore Liberals and back regional Australia.
