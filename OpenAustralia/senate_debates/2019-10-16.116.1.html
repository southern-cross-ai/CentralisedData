        slashing Australia's economic growth forecasts to only 1.7 per cent in 2019 and 2.3 per cent in 2020—it's in the other folder—what is the minister doing to assist young people looking for work in New South Wales?

         The one thing that we are doing is ensuring that we keep the fundamentals of the Australian economy strong—that's what we're doing—so that every young Australian has the opportunity for employment. As I explained yesterday, we've got a number of employment programs in place to assist young people to work their way through the system, but if, as the Labor Party projected at the last election, they had imposed $387 billion in new taxes on the Australian economy, where would the Australian economy be today? And how much of that $387 billion in new taxes did they project for youth programs?
        </p>
        <p>
         They actually voted to remove youth programs that we put in place, so I don't intend to be lectured by the Labor Party with respect to how we manage the Australian economy. We have said that we will continue to maintain our economic settings by keeping the economy strong despite the global headwinds that have been projected by the

                    , on the point of order: I will always respond to a call to order by whoever is in the chair. I have to say that I thought I had been very gentle with this minister today. We have one in five young people unemployed in this region, so perhaps he could treat the question with some respect.

But the youth unemployment rate in Australia now is lower than it was when Labor left office. It is one per cent lower than what it was when Labor left office. That's why we put in place programs like the PaTH program I spoke of yesterday, which is to assist young people to get into jobs—

                           . That's why we've put in place projects like the PaTH program—which the Labor Party voted against—to assist young people to get into work. Yesterday they were complaining about the fact that 30 per cent of those people were actually ending up in a job. That's why we have the Transition to Work program, which helps people who drop out of the system to get back into the system. I was talking to some of those young people just this morning to assist them to get them back into the program when they'd fallen through the system.

                              They have a damn sight better prospect of getting a job under the economy the way that we're managing it rather than having an economy that had the imposition of $387 billion of additional taxes. They have a much better chance of getting a job under this government than they did under them. The youth unemployment rate now is one per cent lower than it was when they left office. That's due to the programs that we're putting in place to assist young people to get into jobs and to get employment. By maintaining our strong economic settings we will continue to provide the opportunities. By opening up new trade markets, which we're doing through free trade agreements, we'll provide new opportunities for industry and business to grow jobs, particularly in regional Australia. It would be nice if the Labor Party indicated their support, or otherwise, of those free trade agreements, because it's been one of the things that's assisted this country to grow its economy since we came into government.
