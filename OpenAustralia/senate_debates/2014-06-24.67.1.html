           I thank Senator Brown for her question. It is lovely to hear from Senator Brown. We are making some very important changes in these education reforms, as the chamber would be aware. I have spoken about them before in terms of making Australia internationally competitive—in fact, a world leader in higher education—making sure that we open up the sector to competition and to quality providers, making sure that students who are perhaps challenged in entering bachelor degrees have a pathway into tertiary education, maybe through a sub-bachelor degree or a diploma or something like that. All of those positions, for the first time ever, will be funded by the Commonwealth government, as I have said before.
          </p>
          <p>
           In relation to
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HECS" rel="nofollow">
            HECS
           </a>
           and the loans scheme, a number of targeted decisions have been taken by the government to secure the scheme into the future, both through the budget process and the identification by the Commission of Audit of the need to reduce the cost to the Commonwealth of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HELP" rel="nofollow">
            HELP
           </a>
           through changes to the interest rate and the repayment thresholds applying to HELP loans. This will be particularly important given this budget's historic extension of funding to all higher education students for the first time ever. I referred to that earlier.
          </p>
          <p>
           There are two important changes which will make a HELP more financially sustainable. There will be a fair interest rate on HECS. The interest rate applied to a HELP loans will be, as we know, the 10-year bond rate. This rate reflects the costs to government of borrowing to fund the loan and is less than for a loan that anyone is able to obtain from a banking institution, of course. The new interest rate will apply to all HELP debts from 1 June 2016. A fair repayment—

            , I ask a supplementary question. I refer again to Professor Chapman's comments that outstanding student debt under a deregulated fee system would substantially exceed the budget estimate. Why has the government understated the amount of student debt arising from its extreme higher education changes?

             What Senator Brown does not acknowledge in both of her questions is that we believe that, in opening up the system in the way in which these reforms are cast, the higher education institutions, not governments, will be the best judges of how to run their own business and also of how we are able to maintain and promote a world-class higher education system.

                      , I ask a further supplementary question. Can the minister confirm that university degrees would cost up to three times as much under a deregulated fee system and leave graduates with debts of more than $120,000? Why is the government mortgaging the future of young Australians?

                        I thank Senator Brown for the supplementary. The problem with the approach that is being taken by those on the other side to this question is that they can only deal in hyperbole and exaggeration. They have no facts with which to deal. We have Australian universities dropping in world rankings, we have limited choice, and we have every student not being funded by the Commonwealth. What we want to do,

So I do not agree with the question; therefore, that is my answer to that part of the question.

                            I advise the chamber that we are giving higher education institutions and students in Australia the capacity to be internationally competitive and to engage in thousands and thousands more courses which should see 80,000 more students in our institutions by 2018.
