        asked the Minister representing the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, upon notice, on 16 February 2012:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        With reference to the Radiocommunications Class Licence for wireless audio devices:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1)   Once a decision has been made in respect to changes to the class licence, how would typical users of wireless audio equipment, such as a teacher, priest, aerobics instructor, guitarist or small businessperson, find out exactly what spectrum the device they own uses.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2)   Based on the department's current modelling, how many wireless audio devices will become:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a)   non-compliant with the class licence; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b)   unusable due to digital restack.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3)   Does the department have any advice as to whether there will be sufficient new stock of compliant wireless audio devices in Australia to replace all of the non-compliant devices prior to the switchover date.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4)   What is the expected economic impact on Australia if the current fleet of wireless audio devices is not replaced.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (5)   What will the typical user's options be if their wireless audio device is no longer compliant.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (6)   What kind of compliance action would typical users of wireless audio equipment be open to if they fail to replace their non-compliant equipment prior to the amendment of the class licence.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (7)   Has the department increased its budget for compliance enforcement in respect to wireless audio devices for the period following the changeover date.

         The Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1)   Information about the frequency or frequencies used by a given device is typically listed in the product specifications on product packaging, or in a product's instruction manual. Details and technical specifications for many devices are also available online, including on manufacturers' websites, or by contacting the manufacturer(s) directly.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The Australian Communications and Media Authority (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACMA" rel="nofollow">
          ACMA
         </a>
         ) has developed a website, available at www.acma.gov.au/

         _312475, specifically designed to assist wireless audio device users in understanding the frequencies their devices currently operate within, and those they will be required to operate within the future. It is updated regularly, and wireless audio device users are encouraged to visit the website. Contact details for further assistance are also available on the website.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2)   (a) and (b) The usability and compliance of wireless audio devices will be dependent on the frequencies in which they operate post-restack. The restack planning process is underway. The frequencies that will be used following restack have not been finalised, and the amount of change that will occur cannot be quantified.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3)   It is the ACMA's usual practice to communicate upcoming changes to licensing arrangements well in advance of anticipated variations, so that manufacturers are able to provide equipment in good time for new arrangements to come into effect.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Once the restack planning process is complete, the Department of Broadband, Communications and the

          Digital Economy
         </a>
         will meet with equipment manufacturers to discuss the availability of wireless audio devices compliant with anticipated variations to the Radiocommunications Class Licence (Low Interference Potential Devices) 2000 (the '
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIPD" rel="nofollow">
          LIPD
         </a>
         class licence').
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4)   As noted in the answer to Question 2 (above), the frequencies that will be used following restack have not been finalised, and the amount of change that will occur as a result of this decision cannot be quantified.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (5)   The ACMA advises that when anticipated variations to the LIPD class licence come into effect, users of existing wireless microphone systems will be required to retune their devices to operate within the new frequency range(s), replace their existing equipment with devices compatible with the new frequency range(s), or cease transmission.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (6)   Prior to amendments to the LIPD class licence, users of existing wireless microphone devices may choose to retune or replace their existing equipment, in anticipation of changes to the LIPD class licence coming into effect.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Should non-compliant wireless devices remain in operation after amendments to the LIPD class licence take effect, compliance enforcement action is handled by the ACMA in accordance with a 'complaints based' approach, initiated upon ACMA receipt of a formal complaint. In response to a complaint, the ACMA can take a number of actions including issuing a request to cease transmission.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (7)   The ACMA is the agency responsible for radiofrequency spectrum compliance and enforcement activities, and will maintain this capability going forward. The Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy is not funded to undertake this activity.
