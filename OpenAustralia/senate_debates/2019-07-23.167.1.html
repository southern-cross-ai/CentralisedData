       <p>
        This is not my first speech. I rise tonight to pay tribute to a former colleague and friend, Wilhelm Bernard Darrel Schumacher, who sadly passed away in the early hours of Wednesday, 3 July, just a few weeks ago. I wish to put on the record my gratitude for his friendship and support. Darrel was a caring, compassionate and giving person. He was also someone who was respected and acknowledged by all who knew him. For 18 years Darrel was a dedicated staff member of the Victorian branch of the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association, where we worked together for many years. He was a warm and friendly presence in the office and I know all his colleagues and friends, like myself, are deeply saddened and shocked by his passing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Darrel, as a dedicated unionist, understood that, when workers use their collective voice to bargain with employers, they have more power and can win far better pay and conditions and that without that collective voice, workers suffer. At the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SDA" rel="nofollow">
         SDA
        </a>
        Darrel supported and advocated for retail workers, for warehouse employees and for staff in fast-food chains. During his time at the union, Darrel helped many members to fight for better pay and conditions. He advocated for them in workplace disputes and stood up for them when they needed support in their workplace.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course, the union was just one part of his life. What was always very clear to us at the union was that Darrel was a proud husband, father and grandfather as well as a passionate

        supporter. This was shown again at his funeral earlier this month where Darrel's son, Hans, spoke about his father very warmly and shared his dedication to his wife, Sandy, and his children and grandchildren. In the days before his death, Darrel dictated a note to be shared with family and friends at the SDA. He said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … the time has come to say goodbye and I want to be able to thank you all for all the pleasant and happy times that we have achieved along the way.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        You guys have been really lovely to me personally and to my family.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I want you to treasure the great times so that what we are left with are fantastic memories.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        May God bless each and every one of you for contributing to these memories.
       </p>
       <p>
        Darrel's final thoughts were for his friends and family, that they remember the happy times—a testament to his kindness and generosity. For him, being a unionist was a calling—to help people in need and promote equity and fairness in the workplace.
       </p>
       <p>
        We celebrate a great man who made an impact on our lives and the lives of many workers. I'll always remember many of his stories and I'll always hold a special place in my heart for these memories. I send my deepest sympathies to Sandy, Hans, Rochelle, Natasha, Elise, Tayla, Ethan, Jaxon and Harvey. Darrel, may you rest in eternal peace, mate. You'll be greatly missed and you are definitely in my prayers.
