        My question is directed to Senator Evans, representing the Prime Minister. I refer to the leak to the
        <i>
         Australian
        </i>
        of the conversation between the Prime Minister and the President of the United States. I note that, if the conversation was leaked by a public servant without the authority of the Prime Minister, this would constitute a crime under section 70 of the Commonwealth Crimes Act; if by a ministerial staffer, a crime under section 79 of the Commonwealth Crimes Act. Why have the

         I thank the senator for his question. I am not sure what the focus of the opposition Senate tactics committee is today, when you get the first question on a subject and they follow up with the last question on the subject! I assume that Senator Carr so effectively dealt with them on the cars issue that they were not prepared to go back to that again. While Senator Brandis—

           . While Senator Brandis’s forensic legal question is obviously of great interest, it is based on the premise that there was a leak. Both the

            US
           </a>
           government, the US ambassador and the Prime Minister have denied that the press report is correct. They have made it clear that the reported comment was never made and is inaccurate and that the matter, as far as they are concerned, is closed. Therefore, as the premise of the senator’s question is inaccurate, I cannot help him with the line of questioning he wishes to pursue. Clearly, if the report is inaccurate, there is no question about staff members’ activities or the
