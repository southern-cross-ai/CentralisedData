        Co. go through … a daily assessment about how their partners are going. They are in constant contact seeking information from their construction partners. I am seeking to gain information from the NBN Co. to find out where that process is up to.
       </p>
       <p>
        Minister, having indicated to the Senate yesterday that NBN Co. get daily updates and you are seeking information from them, can you now inform the Senate whether NBN Co. still expect their fibre network to be operational for 286,000 premises by 30 June this year?

         In particular, Mr Quigley highlighted that workforce mobilisation issues were being faced … by Syntheo in

         .
        </p>
        <p>
         We are determined to overcome these challenges with workforce mobilisation. NBN Co. is already taking measures. Today Service Stream announced that Syntheo has reached agreement with the NBN Co. to hand back the remainder of its design and construction activities in the Northern Territory. This will enable NBN Co. to take direct control of the rollout in the Northern Territory, allowing Syntheo to concentrate its resources on the rollout in Western Australia and South Australia to bring high-speed broadband to Australians in these states sooner. By June 2021 all Australians will have access to high-speed, universal, affordable broadband.

I know Senator Birmingham wants to make a political point, but the minister is being very helpful to the senator by providing him with details about how the government and the

When it comes to activations, which is a different question and which is what you are now referring to, I can tell you that NBN Co. is now I think well past 40,000 people in Australia—40,000 Australians are using the

Given that recent NBN Co. data indicates that just 47,511 premises had been passed as at March 2012, does the minister acknowledge that his $50 billion white elephant never has and never will meet any of the targets that he sets for it?

                    I have learned from hard experience in the Senate that one should never necessarily believe all of the statistics quoted by those opposite. I am not sure if the statistics that you are claiming are absolutely correct, but I am happy to check for the senator whether those were accurate figures or whether he is playing games with splitting up different sets of figures to try and create the impression that he is seeking. But I am happy to come back to you on that issue, Senator Birmingham—very happy. As I said, I am happy. I have not seen the updated graph at this point, Senator Birmingham; I have not seen it. I am sure it will be part of the information that I am seeking at the moment.

So, Senator Birmingham, the information will be available shortly and, when I have had a moment to actually have a look at it when it arrives in its completion, we will be able to have a discussion about why we are delivering fast broadband—
