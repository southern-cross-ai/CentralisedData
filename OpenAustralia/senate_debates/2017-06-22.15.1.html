          report and, in particular, the referral of the Australian Citizenship Legislation Amendment (Strengthening the Requirements for Australian Citizenship and Other Measures) Bill 2017 to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for inquiry. We support the referral to the committee, but the opposition would like to put on the record our concerns that were raised at the selection of bills meeting last night about the conduct of that inquiry. The Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee is an important and powerful committee of the Senate. Its job is to scrutinise important legislation and report to the Senate, and it is critical for the Senate to be able to perform its responsibilities as a house of review.
         </p>
         <p>
          Labor has informally raised concerns before that we had about the conduct of previous inquiries, whether it be specific legislation or through the estimates process. Specifically, our concerns are about the ability of the chair to conduct hearings which are respectful both of senators and of witnesses and professional in their approach at all times. The Australian Citizenship Legislation Amendment (Strengthening the Requirements for Australian Citizenship and Other Measures) Bill is an important piece of legislation. It is vital that the inquiry is professional, that witnesses are respected and that senators are able to perform their duties as provided for by the relevant standing orders without obstruction or harassment. Whilst it is regrettable to raise these issues in the chamber, in this instance Labor believes it is important to bring our concerns to the attention of the Senate.

               In that case, what I will say is this: the conduct of Senator Macdonald as the Chair of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee" rel="nofollow">
                Committee
               </a>
               risks bringing that committee and this Senate as a whole into significant disrepute in the minds of the Australian people. We have seen Senator Macdonald trying to evict me from that committee for doing my job as a senator representing the Tasmanian people and the Australian people, trying to prevent me from asking questions and trying to prevent me from holding the government to account.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Australian people have witnessed the difference in the way he conducts himself with regard to some witnesses that have appeared before that committee and the contrast in that behaviour with the behaviour he engages in with regard to government ministers who are appearing as witnesses before that committee. If you look at the 14th edition of
               <i>
                Odgers
               </i>
               , it says, on page 462, this:

              </p>
              <p>
               We are in danger of not meeting that standard. We are in danger of undermining public confidence in the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee as a result of the way that that committee is chaired.
              </p>
              <p>
               With regard to citizenship legislation, which is part of this report, the bill is nothing other than an attempt to remake Australia in Peter Dutton's narrow-minded and bigoted image. It is aimed at demonising—

                   I withdraw that. But I will make the point here again that the citizenship legislation proposed by Minister Dutton, with the support of the entire cabinet, including Prime Minister Turnbull, is aimed at demonising and ostracising people who are already living, working and raising families in Australia. They are men, women and children who show every day how much they love this country and how hard they are working to contribute to our society and community. They want to make Australia their home. They want to build their lives, or rebuild their lives, in this country. For all their hard work, the government wants to spit in their faces. This legislation is like the policy of a carload of drunk thugs shouting abuse at passers-by. It is the policy of the Cronulla riots.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   This legislation assumes the very worst in people—like high-standard English language tests that, I suspect, members of the cabinet would struggle to pass.

This legislation and this government now want to lecture people about violence against women, despite the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Mr Dutton, trying to prevent a pregnant woman suffering serious health problems from being let out of detention in Nauru and coming to a hospital in Australia.

This government is trying to bend Australia to its will, to force Australia to give in to our fears, to put up the shutters and to build the fences. But I will tell you now that the government will not succeed, and it is the Australian people who will stop them from succeeding, because whether or not this government manages to change the laws to make it harder to become a citizen in this country, they will not change the fundamental character of our country, because the people will not let them.

I have already been in touch with the secretariat to try to work out a schedule for approval by the committee at an urgent meeting, which we have just called, so that we can deal with this before the Senate rises. I have given the committee some suggestions as to when hearings could be held in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Canberra to give everybody the widest opportunity to discuss what is clearly a very important bill, on which there will be lots of different views.

                              espouses one view, which a minority might espouse. This is not the place for it, of course. If my suggestions are adopted, Senator McKim, as a full voting member of that committee, will have at least four occasions in public hearings to question witnesses. But when he questions witnesses he will, while I am chairman, do it respectfully and properly and in accordance with the standing orders.

A senator has raised the same point in this particular chamber, not in the committee, complaining to the President that he cannot hear the President because of the consistent and constant interjections of Senator McKim. I have said many a time in the committees that I chair that I will not stand for that type of behaviour. It is bullying and it is disrespectful, and, as I proved with Lieutenant General Campbell, when senators disrespect witnesses I will insist that those senators either withdraw or remove themselves.

                                        Talk about a glass jaw! What I am repeating are actual facts. There has been a senator stand up in this chamber, not in the committee, and request the President to get Senator
                                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKim" rel="nofollow">

                                        to be quiet so that senator can exercise his right to hear what is happening in the chamber. The same thing happens in my committee. I have a constant and consistent barrage of interjections from Senator McKim that I will not stand for. There is one member of the opposition—again, who I will not name but those on the committee will know to whom I am referring—who does the same thing. These two senators think they are somehow special and that there are special and different rules for them that do not apply to anyone else.

                                       <p>
                                        Senator McKim is also concerned about the fact that, in the committees that I chair, I try to give every senator a fair crack of the time available. It is my consistent position—as all the senators in my committee know—to give each one 15 minutes at a time; no more and no less. They can come back and have another 15 minutes later. That way every senator gets to have their say. That does not suit Senator McKim or the Labor senator I am talking about, who want special privileges. Well, it will not happen. I work on the basis that the questions at estimates should be roughly proportional to the make-up of the Senate. It is my practice, which I will continue, to have one Labor, one Liberal, one Labor, one Liberal and then one crossbencher, because that is roughly the proportions of this chamber. Nothing can be fairer than that. But, of course, it does not suit Senator McKim because he is a member of a very minor party, which is becoming more minor, and he does not get the same say as a member of the Labor Party, who have two or three times as many senators as he has in this chamber.

                                        I can understand why Senator McKim is going around the chamber trying to get some support to get me taken off chairmanship of the committee. I treat that as a badge of honour. He would not want to get rid of me if I was not an effective and fair chairman, and I will continue to be an effective and fair chairman. I will not be bullied by the likes of Senator McKim and one other senator.
