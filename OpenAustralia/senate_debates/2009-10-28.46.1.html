        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for

        , Senator Ludwig. I refer to an article in the
        <i>
         Age
        </i>
        on 22 August 2009 which revealed that an increasing number of unsuspecting Australians are having their mouths filled with cheap dental prosthetics from overseas laboratories which contain toxic heavy metals. Is the minister aware of these serious allegations and what is being done by the government to protect Australians from this dangerous practice?

         for the question. Part of the answer relates to that which is delivered through the various state and private health industry sectors. When you depack the question—and I may have to see if I can get some assistance when the supplementary question is asked—is it about the government’s responsibility in terms of the provision of the amalgam or the types of fillings that various dentists may use, and that I am sure many use on a commercial basis, and whether those particular metals are permissible in terms of importation, which then is more likely to be a customs issue? Alternatively, is the question about whether or not there is a requirement for certain fillings to be used with certain types of matters, which then comes within a dental area?
        </p>
        <p>
         Unlike the previous government, which took a view that dental matters should be implemented as I understand it by the states themselves, this government has looked at how we can use
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
          COAG
         </a>
         to ensure that we can provide commitments in this area. We committed $290 million to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDHP" rel="nofollow">
          CDHP
         </a>
         during the election. The government also committed to shutting down the poorly targeted Medicare chronic disease scheme. Further, the Medicare Teen Dental Plan, an election commitment of some $490.7 million over five years to improve the oral health of teenagers, has delivered 565,399 check-ups. That is what this government has done in this area.

          , I have a supplementary question. Isn’t it true that the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_Goods_Administration" rel="nofollow">
           Therapeutic Goods Administration
          </a>
          has banned the use of heavy metals such as lead and nickel in the manufacture of dental prosthetics made in Australia but it is still perfectly legal to import cheap products from overseas that contain these dangerous metals? And don’t these imported dental products end up in the same place as Australian made products—that is, in the patient’s mouth? What is the government going to do to close this dangerous and dodgy loophole?

           for the question. I know that Senator Fielding does have a significant interest in this area. What I can say in relation to this—now that I have got a better idea from the supplementary question as to the nature the nature of the question, and I thank Senator Fielding for that—is that it is clear now that this sits within the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_Goods_Administration" rel="nofollow">

           </a>
           area, particularly around the importation of particular types of material by dentists for use within fillings. I will take that part of the question on notice to see if I can provide a more fulsome response from the Minister for
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_and_Ageing" rel="nofollow">
            Health and Ageing
           </a>
           in relation to that issue. I understand that Senator Fielding does have a significant interest in this, as I have indicated. I also want to say that, unlike the previous government, this government has directed its attention to dental issues. I think Senator Fielding would agree with me that these issues have been neglected for a very long time.

            , I have a further supplementary question. Given that there is no law to stop dentists using dangerous toxic dental prosthetics from overseas, such as crowns, bridges and dentures, how can it be said that a patient is giving their informed consent when agreeing to have a prosthetic put in their mouth if they do not know what it is made out of or where it was manufactured? Will the government tighten disclosure requirements so that unsuspecting Australians are made aware that their prosthetic may contain dangerous, toxic materials?

             for his question. Similar to my response to the first supplementary question, where I indicated that I would take on notice that part which related to importation under the
