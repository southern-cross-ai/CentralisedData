                     By contrast, Signature Care—a developer, not an aged-care provider—was allocated 640 licences. This is handing them an estimated market value of around $41.6 million on top of their profit, based on a per-bed value of $65,000. Why are developers with no track record of aged-care provision allowed to compete in a process which provides a significant financial benefit, to the detriment of aged-care operators?

                         The Aged Care Act and the aged-care principles set out the process for the places for allocation under the ACAR round. It consists of three clear steps: (1) the creation of a number of places in each jurisdiction by the minister, using the government's targeted aged-care planning ratios; (2) the targeting of places to special needs; and (3) key issue groups in each state and territory, determined by the secretary and the secretary's allocation of those places to specific providers after a competitive selection process is conducted.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         In the 2016-17 ACAR round, over 45,000 residential places were sought, and so 10,000 new residential places were allocated. That means that, for every 4.5 applications that were put in, there was one place, so it's a very competitive process. The year before, there were 3.6 applications for every place allocated, so we have increased it. Therefore, this year, we allocated places worth $649 million and nearly 500 restorative care beds, worth $34 million, and we have recently provided $64 million in capital grants.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         The act provides for this process, and this ensures that a large amount of the funding it provides is allocated, and it's allocated in a rigorous, fair and impartial manner. The minister, the minister's office or any other parliamentarian do not have a role in the assessment of the allocation process. The act establishes this as a function of the department. The ACAR—

                           Minister, we're talking about a developer that got 640 licences, and there were 45,000 applications. But the developer is not in the aged-care business. And, in the previous allocation round, they also received about the same amount of places. So, what provisions are in place to stop developers who are not genuine aged-care providers from profiteering when they are able to sell the investment within a day of completion of construction?

                            Senator Hanson, the process is open to all applicants who are or who will become an approved provider under the act. So you have to be an approved provider. You have to go through a process under the act to be able to apply for places in an ACAR round. What sometimes happens is that they apply for places, they bring them into operation and then they on-sell those places to other people. I am instructed that of the approved provider entities that are known by the department to engage—in effect, property developers—14 per cent of residential places were allocated to them. The practice of applying for the places and bringing them into operation is actually provided for under the act. Therefore, first of all, to get a place, you have to go through a competitive process—

                              Minister, we're actually talking about a developer that can make $41.6 million on the 640 beds that they are getting, plus the development profits. The program is intended to operate for the benefit of those needing aged care, not developers. Has the government considered limiting eligibility under the scheme to registered operators who have an established track record of at least three years?

                               Senator Hanson, the competitive process under ACAR is open to all applicants, as I've indicated. Under the act, all providers must demonstrate their capacity to deliver aged care. They have to be in a residential, in a home or in a flexible setting. Under the act, the department must ensure that the ACAR process delivers diversity of choice in the care options available to consumers. This is available and this is done by opening the ACAR round to both new and existing aged-care providers. Limiting the eligibility to applicants with a set number of years of operating residential aged-care services would effectively block any new entrant from entering the sector. It would, in turn, dilute the care options available to consumers. As I've indicated, it is a competitive process, but it is one where the providers themselves, in effect, trade their places.
