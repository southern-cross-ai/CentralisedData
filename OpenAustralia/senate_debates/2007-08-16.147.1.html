         The Committee

        It is not practicable to undertake broader community consultation in advance of the listing of terrorist organisations.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        has undertaken a number of steps to ensure awareness of the terrorist organisation offences.

 Following the listing of an organisation as a terrorist organisation, the Attorney-General issues a media release attaching the Statement of Reasons for the organisation.

 This information is disseminated to all major media outlets.

 The Attorney-General’s Department’s
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security" rel="nofollow">
         National Security
        </a>
        website has been improved to give greater access to information and provides a list of all organisations listed as terrorist organisations in Australia, along with the Statement of Reasons for each of those organisations.

       <p class="italic">
        The Attorney-General’s Department has produced a ‘

        </a>
        ’ pamphlet providing information on recent counter-terrorism legislation.

 This pamphlet is printed in eight different languages and is distributed by officers of the Attorney-General’s Department at forums and seminars they are invited to attend.

 A pamphlet providing information on the terrorist organisation offences including the financing of terrorism offences is currently being developed by the Government.

         The Resolution
        </a>
        of Appointment is the source of authority for the establishment and operations of the Committee.

 The current Resolution was passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate on 18 November 2004 and provides that the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Local Government
        </a>
        , Territories and Roads (the Minister) may refer draft amendments to the National Capital Plan to the Committee for its consideration.

 While it has generally been the government’s practice to refer draft amendments to the National Capital Plan to the Committee, the government considers that the Minister should retain the discretion to do so.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Currently, as part of the approval process for draft amendments, the Minister provides a copy of draft amendments to the Committee giving them the opportunity to indicate if they wish to conduct an inquiry into the amendments.

 In addition to this, the Committee is also given the opportunity to be briefed on draft amendments.

         The committee recommends that before 29 March 2007 the Minister for Local Government, Territories and Roads moves to disallow Amendments 56, 59, 60 and 61 so that the National Capital Authority has the opportunity to further refine the amendments taking into account issues raised in the committee’s report.
