We had flying foxes falling out of the sky because of the heat. This is the new normal, yet we have a government and an opposition which remain wedded to coal and wedded to climate pollution. Minister, what do you say to the people of Batman, who in a few weeks time will have a chance to tell you and the Labor Party what they think of your policies that are driving up pollution, destroying jobs, inflating energy prices and killing the

           Di Natale
          </a>
          's word for his weather report. But what I can say to Senator Di Natale is that jacking up taxes or jacking up the cost of energy for Australian families and Australian businesses and just sending emissions and jobs overseas does nothing to address climate change or reduce temperatures in Australia or indeed in other parts of the world. In fact, I remember sitting on that side of the chamber when Labor and the Greens came up with this incredibly ingenious plan that would actually increase overall global emissions, because you were just going to shift economic activity and jobs to other parts of the world. For the same level of economic output, emissions were going to be higher than they would have been if that particular task was performed in Australia.
         </p>
         <p>
          I look forward to the regular weather report from Senator Di Natale, but I can also reassure him that, on this side of the chamber, we will not be punishing the Australian people and doing something that doesn't make any difference at all. We'll continue to pursue our policy agenda to address climate change in a responsible, economically sensible and environmentally effective fashion.

               is only half right. It is certainly true to say that coalition senators, those of us on this side of the chamber, strongly support the Adani project as a job-creating multibillion-dollar investment which will deliver very important jobs, in particular, to the people of Central and
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">

              <p>
               On the coalition side of the Senate, we do support it. I'm not so sure about the Labor Party. The Batman by-election might have something to do with it. Whenever there's an election—and I've said this in this chamber before—we get the Shorten wibble-wobble or the Palaszczuk wibble-wobble. The Labor Party is in favour but they're against. We've got an election coming up in Batman, so now they're likely to be against. That is at least what the Labor candidate appears to have said. Let me tell you unequivocally: there is no wibble-wobble on the Liberal-National Party side of this chamber. We are in favour of this $16 billion-plus investment. We are in favour of the in excess of 11,000 jobs that it will create. We want to see it proceed and we'd like to think that the Labor Party—

                 Minister, there is no wibble-wobble about your plans, or the Labor Party's plans, to expand coalmining in Australia. Adani is just one of many. How are our commitments under the Paris climate agreement compatible with your plans to keep building and expanding coalmines and remain the world's largest coal exporter?
