        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol" rel="nofollow">
         Kyoto Protocol
        </a>
        , which states that Australia:

       <p class="italic">
        … has consistently maintained that a second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol must be balanced by an agreement with legally binding mitigation commitments by all major economies.
       </p>
       <p>
        I ask the minister whether such an agreement with legally binding mitigation commitments by all major economies has been reached and ratified by all such major economies.

           He may have backflipped. A recent report published by the Climate Commission dispels once and for all the myth pushed by those opposite that Australia is acting alone with the carbon price and that our policies will make no difference to greenhouse gas emissions. The commission concluded, and I think this is very important to consider, that every major economy is tackling climate change, including Australia. It finds that 90 countries, representing 90 per cent of the global economy, have committed to reduce their carbon pollution and have policies in place to achieve those reductions. Many of these countries are relying on market-based mechanisms such as Australia's. The commission's report concluded that a carbon price is the most cost-effective way to reduce emissions and is more efficient than other direct subsidy policies. That is why next year 1.1 billion people will be living in a country, state or city with an emissions trading scheme in place. They include countries like the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Sweden, Norway,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
            New Zealand
           </a>
           and Switzerland. Carbon trading is also operating at the subnational level in the United States, Canada and Brazil. Of course, the momentum is growing. Japan just introduced a carbon tax last month. California commenced its emissions trading schemes last week. China is developing pilot emissions trading schemes in seven cities and provinces and in Korea an emissions trading scheme will commence in 2015. If you look all across the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
            OECD
           </a>
           , 94 per cent of members have, or are implementing, emissions trading at the national or sub-national level. That is the commitment that is happening on the ground as we speak.

            ditched this requirement for binding action, which was restated as recently as May this year, and instead declared Australia ready to join a second commitment under Kyoto as soon as the end of this month?

               Thank you very much. It is clear when you look at the coalition themselves that the carbon price did not have the impact that they suggested. Senator Barnaby Joyce I think continues to support the proposition that a lamb roast will cost $100 due to the carbon price. On

We have got through all two minutes of the first answer and 53 seconds of the answer to the supplementary, and not once has the minister actually mentioned the

                   , I ask a further supplementary question. Given that the government introduced a carbon tax despite promising not to do so, axed its floor price of that carbon tax despite saying that a floor price was central to certainty and signed on to a second commitment period under Kyoto despite putting in previous submissions that doing so was conditional upon legally binding action by all major economies, how can anything this government says about climate change policies actually be believed?

                     What is unbelievable from those opposite, if we want to talk about believability, is that they opposed income tax cuts and family tax cuts for business. Tripling the tax-free threshold, tax cuts for more than seven million people, was opposed by those opposite, unbelievable if you are a family; and a company tax cut—unbelievable if you are a company. Increasing the Medicare levy surcharge threshold—

                      , I raise a point of order, again on the matter of direct relevance. For the last 30 to 40 seconds of the minister's answer he has talked about anything but climate change policies or the second commitment period under Kyoto and is traversing a range of completely unrelated policy areas. I ask you to draw the minister's attention to the question.
