         I thank Senator Carol Brown for her question. I can inform the Senate that yesterday a jury in Melbourne returned guilty verdicts against six defendants in a major counterterrorism trial. I will not comment on the specifics of the case as the jury is still deliberating in relation to two accused, and certain court orders remain in place and, of course, there are outstanding charges against a number of the accused. However, more broadly, in relation to the matters that are settled, the government welcomes the guilty verdicts.
        </p>
        <p>
         By way of providing the Senate with a brief summary, there have been six individuals convicted of membership of a terrorist organisation, three individuals convicted of providing support to a terrorist organisation and one individual convicted of directing the activities of a terrorist organisation. It has been a lengthy and complicated case. The Melbourne trial commenced in February this year and comprised over 50 witnesses and in the order of 6,000 pages of evidence. The jury has, as it is entitled to do, reached various verdicts on the evidence before it, and four individuals have been acquitted of the charges brought against them. Yesterday’s verdict followed the guilty verdict returned last week on one count in the case of Belal Khazaal, which was another successful counterterrorism prosecution.
        </p>
        <p>
         I commend all those involved in the case. It is important to recognise that yesterday’s verdicts are an example of effective cooperation between the

          : I wonder if you might caution the minister as to the Senate’s practice in relation to commenting on pending judicial proceedings. The minister did qualify himself at the start of his answer, quite properly, when he said that there are matters still before the jury. But as he expanded upon his answer he did seem to me to trespass on issues which are still currently before the court in the proceedings he describes. I do not think, Mr President, that there is a standing order that governs the matter. There certainly is the practice of the Senate, and I wonder if you might counsel the minister accordingly.

           On the point of order, I hear the point that you are making, Senator Brandis. Again I will say I cannot instruct the minister as to how to answer the question. I draw the minister’s attention to his opening statement and the need to confine his remarks very carefully to what he said.

            , on counterterrorism matters more broadly, and the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Director_of_Public_Prosecutions" rel="nofollow">
             Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions

            . To ensure better coordination and ultimately successful prosecution of terrorism cases, cooperation between these agencies is crucial. This cooperation is central to the implementation of the recommendations recently made by the Street review on the need for coordination of operations in national security.

            It should also be noted that the Muslim community has been integral to the success of investigations, particularly this one, and that strong and positive links have been forged between police and the Muslim community through ongoing efforts of the Australian Federal Police’s community engagement teams. Recognition should also be given to the court, including the judge and court staff and jury, who have dedicated themselves over many months to this very demanding responsibility.
           </p>

            The Rudd government is committed to protecting all Australians. We take a hard line against terrorism, and we make no apology for that. Successful prosecutions are important in sending a clear message to those who may be influenced by violent extremism. The real prospect of conviction and imprisonment will hopefully open their eyes to what terrorism really is. It is criminal behaviour at its most base. The government stands with the community against those who would threaten and harm innocent civilians. The seriousness of the offences involved in this case highlights why we must do all we can to ensure that public security is at the utmost top of our minds. Clearly, a terrorist event would not only cause loss of life, injury and destruction to property, it would also do significant damage to our social fabric. We are proud to live in a tolerant, multicultural society and it is important that we do everything we can to defend this way of life. I commend all those involved in the successful prosecutions.
