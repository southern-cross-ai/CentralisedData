        My question is to the Minister representing the Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the Nationals, Senator McKenzie. I refer to the Nationals subcommittee consisting of Senator McKenzie, Mr Littleproud, Mr Pitt and Mr Hogan settling the Nationals' election wish list for Mr Morrison in return for support of net zero by 2050. How much taxpayer money have the Nationals demanded Mr Morrison spend to gain their support for net zero by 2050?

         Thank you, Senator Sheldon, for your question. As we've been very, very clear, as the second party of government we are taking our time to carefully consider the proposition put forward by the Prime Minister that Australia will be committing to net zero by 2050 in Glasgow. That is actually what rural and regional Australians sent us here to do, and we don't apologise for that.

         —and I was privileged to serve with Doug Cameron in this chamber for many years—when he made note of how your party processes operate, said that you'd all had lobotomies and you basically just do what your leader says and you're a bunch of zombies, as I recall—direct quote, in rabbit ears.

           . This question was very straight about the amount of money that the Nationals have demanded. The minister is veering off into exactly the kind of political attack that you said was not permitted.

            There were two parts of my presentation to the Senate. I think you've selectively quoted one of them. But I will bring the minister back to the question.

             So the process that our political party has determined to undertake is to consult our colleagues to understand and appreciate their needs and concerns for the next 30 years, not for the next six months towards the election, and to then put forward a document that is based on the principles that will underpin the negotiations between the Deputy Prime Minister and the Prime Minister.

            <p>
             We've been very, very clear: this is not about 30 pieces of silver. This is not about some beads and some mirrors. This is actually about how we secure and protect rural and regional Australians and our industries in a decarbonised future. This is about doing our jobs. So I am very proud to be part of a political party and a subcommittee that are actually focused on securing the regions in this proposed future that the Prime Minister and the government are seeking to deliver. If that actually can't come—

                    A lot of Liberal Party colleagues have been concerned about what a move towards net zero by 2050 may mean for rural and regional communities. You've quoted those concerns back to me in the chamber this week. It should not be a surprise to you at all.

                       I won't be guaranteeing you, Senator Sheldon, that I will disclose what the National Party party room discusses, but what I will be able to guarantee you is that our party will never resile from standing up for the people that sent us here. It is very, very sad to watch the party that used to stand up for the working class in this country fall over in the face of the threat of the Greens in their inner-city urban seats. Member after member, other than Senator Ciccone from Victoria, has been silent on water policy. You are silent on forestry and on standing up for forestry workers. You are silent on food processors and food manufacturing. What a joke you've become to the people that you actually represent. Out in Barcaldine, in regional Queensland—
