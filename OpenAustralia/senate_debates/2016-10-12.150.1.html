           Energy Council, the government, working with the states and territories, has developed a substantial work program to facilitate the rollout of distributor generation and storage. This includes the development of standards, training and accreditation for battery installation, putting in place appropriate consumer protections for new technologies and ensuring standalone power systems, such as microgrids, are effectively incorporated into the wider regulatory framework. Further, at the meeting on 7 October the council established an independent inquiry to develop a national reform blueprint to maintain energy security and reliability in the national electricity markets.
