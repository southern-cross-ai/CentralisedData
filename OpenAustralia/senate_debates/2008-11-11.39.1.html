         I thank Senator Sterle for that important question.

         are indeed two of Australia’s most important public institutions. Their radio, television and online services entertain, educate and inform millions of Australians every day. They are among the most trusted and beloved organisations in the nation.
        </p>
        <p>
         To move confidently into the future, the ABC and SBS must have a clear direction and strong leadership. On 16 October this year, the government announced new measures to build the strength and independence of our national broadcasters, including a new merit-based board appointments process and, in keeping with our election commitments, the reinstatement of the ABC staff-elected director. It is crucial that the ABC and SBS boards are able to respond to the challenges and opportunities of the emerging digital and online media environments. To this end, both organisations must have transparent and accountable governance processes.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government’s new board appointment process will ensure that all future appointments to the ABC and SBS boards are conducted in a manner that fosters transparency, accountability and public confidence. Under the new board appointment selection process, board members will be appointed on the basis of merit. They will not be appointed on the basis of where they are on the former Prime Minister’s Christmas card list. This will be a radical departure from the previous government’s method of appointing board members. These long-overdue reforms to the national broadcasters’ board appointments process will restore public confidence in these important cultural institutions.
        </p>
        <p>
         This new process is already underway. Applications for four positions on the boards of the national broadcasters closed on 7 November and are now being assessed against publicly available selection criteria by a nominations panel. The four eminent Australians that make up the nominations panel will assess each application on merit and provide the government with a shortlist of not less than three candidates per vacancy. If the government appoints an individual not shortlisted by the panel, a statement explaining why must be tabled in parliament. This requirement will further enhance the transparency of the process.
        </p>
        <p>
         Where the appointment to be made is that of the Chairman of the ABC, candidates will be subject to the same merit based process I have just outlined. In addition, the Prime Minister will consult the Leader of the Opposition before the government’s preferred candidate for ABC chair is recommended to the Governor-General. This is important because the new tasks faced by the ABC are of such importance that we are at a critical stage in the development of digital technology and the digital platforms that are being created. That is why it is so important to restore the integrity and the processes of the ABC. The future challenges of the ABC in the digital technology world are extremely complex, and they will require careful consideration.

          <p>
           Thank you again, Senator Sterle. Senator Sterle’s question goes right to the heart of why it is so important to get the board processes right. We do not need Australians to witness an unseemly slanging match about the board and the integrity of the ABC. We need Australians to have confidence that the charter is being implemented. We need Australians to have confidence because, as will be announced in the near future, the ABC are participating in the Freeview box project. Those who have experienced the Freeview box in the United Kingdom know that this is going to be one of the most exciting developments for
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">
            TV

           viewers in many years. This will be akin to moving from black and white to digital. I know that many on the other side still prefer their black and white sets, but we are moving into the 21st century. This new box will deliver new channels, new content, new opportunities—
