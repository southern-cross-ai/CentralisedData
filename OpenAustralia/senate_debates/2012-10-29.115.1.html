        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Bob Carr. The minister would have seen recent reporting about the fact that sections of the Asian white paper were rewritten by Professor Allan Gyngell, formerly of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ONA" rel="nofollow">
         ONA
        </a>
        , partly in order to amplify sections of the report on the continuing role of the United States in the region as it expands its military presence. Can the minister confirm that the white paper was redrafted in this fashion and, if so, why?

         I am not able to confirm that, but it is clear that in the production of a white paper many people are consulted. I can confirm that consultation was widespread, and there would be nothing untoward about a white paper of this importance dealing with the Asian region and Australia's relationship with it acknowledging the continuing role in the Asia-Pacific of the United States. It is a factor: the United States is there, and all the nation states of Asia would have a view on that. There is a widespread view, for example, among the 10 nations of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN" rel="nofollow">
          ASEAN
         </a>
         that they emphatically want the United States to continue to have a role in the Asia-Pacific.

           I am elaborating on the question. The consultation was widespread, and it was Senator Ludlam himself who raised the question of the role of the United States in the Asia-Pacific. I am saying that any white paper that charts Australia's future in Asia would have to acknowledge the presence there of the United States and that, overwhelmingly, the nations of the region want a United States presence. This is particularly marked when you consider the views of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN" rel="nofollow">
            ASEAN
           </a>
           . In recent weeks we have had visits here from Singapore's defence, foreign and trade ministers, from Myanmar's foreign minister, from the President of the Philippines and the foreign ministerâ€”

            , I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for his evasive answer, and I will take from it a tentative yes. Does the minister acknowledge that the fact that this happened at all undermines the effectiveness of the very welcome strategy of engaging with our Asian neighbours if we are seen simply as the regional deputy sheriff of the United States?

                   , I ask a further supplementary question. I will try to draw us back to the topic of the question. Has the government assessed the impact on Australia's perceived place in the region of basing United States marine corps as well as naval and air force elements on Australian soil?

                    I mentioned earlier Singapore's engagement with us, and the recent visit by the three ministers in the Singapore government. They have a US naval deployment in Singapore. I know of no governments in the Asian region, apart from China, which have expressed concern about a rotating marine presence in

                    . As regards China, just as we do not object to China's military modernisation while at the same time asking the Chinese to be explicit about its purpose, scale and direction, no-one could raise an objection to Australia attending to its security concerns by nurturing a treaty relationship that goes back a very long timeâ€”not just 50 years to the

                      I thank Senator Polley for her continued interest not only in agriculture but also in where the future for agricultural products can be. Yesterday the Prime Minister released the Australia in the

                      white paper. It is a roadmap showing how Australia can play a significant part in the Asian century. It is an ambitious plan for decades ahead, because in Australia there are many opportunities for Australian agriculture and our farmers. Asia is where the middle class is growing. The numbers are very large, but in the next two decades Asia is projected to grow significantly to 3.2 billion people.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Asia is where by 2025 half of the world's economic growth will be concentrated. Asia is where the population has a changing preference, seeking higher-protein foods such as beef, wheat and dairyâ€”high-value products that are produced by our agricultural sector. Australia is in the right place at the right time. But it is not enough to rely on this. Our future will be determined by the choices we make. The food plan coupled with the Asian century white paper will drive government and industry action to position Australia as a food leader in the region. That is why the Gillard government is developing Australia's first-ever national food plan to support the work that is being done. Australia has a natural advantage. Asia wants a significant amount of produce from this country, and we need to be well placed to provide those preferences.

                      In the past decade we have seen a shift in the export share from Europe to Asia. Asian now receives between 55 and 60 per cent of Australia's agrifood exports. Based on the value of agricultural exports, Asia accounts for over 70 per cent of our beef exports, sugar exports and dairy exports. The past decade has seen a shift in the export share.

Much of the work is underway. The national food plan will elevate food policy within government and across the supply chain.

The minister-counsellor (agriculture) will be responsible for managing the department's food, agriculture, fisheries and forestry interests in Indonesia.

                          The Gillard Labor government is showing the leadership required to ensure Australia is ready for the Asian century. We are acting now to set Australia up for the future. The next steps we take will ensure an increasing participation in Asian markets. Future policies and programs will be Asian focused. We will also ensure agriculture growth is sustainable by making efficient use of our soil, water and energy. We will tap into the opportunities in northern Australia and in Tasmania. We will engage even more with our closest neighbours in Indonesia and work with emerging markets such as Thailand and Vietnam.

                          We know we have to invest in science and innovation to boost productivity right across Australia. We need to continue to improve farming techniques. As well as producing higher yields, we need to improve our irrigation system and plan better logistics and infrastructure. The white paper showcases the opportunities for Australia to benefit in the Asian century.
