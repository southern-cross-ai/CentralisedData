        My question is for the Minister representing the Attorney-General. Apparently nearly 2,400 people have direct access to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        with a sponsored security pass. Getting one of these so-called orange passes is a huge win for lobbyists. It lets them wander around the halls of Parliament House without an escort. It gives them a chance to 'bump into' ministers at Aussie's cafe or drop in to see MPs or senators in their offices. But Australians, much to their dismay, are in the dark about who the orange passes' holders are, whose interests they represent and what they're actually doing here. Why can't the people of Australia know the details of who they are? Why is there no transparency over who has direct access to federal politicians inside Parliament House?

         Senator Lambie, thank you very much for your question. My understanding is that such matters as access to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
          Parliament House
         </a>
         and the issuing of passes are for the Department of Parliamentary Services, which is of course administered by the President and the Speaker. If the President wishes to provide a response via me taking this on notice, or wishes to provide a response now, then I would defer entirely to the President, Senator Lambie.

          I won't take up time in question time by adding anything now. It has been covered in estimates. There is an estimates spillover hearing where I could be quizzed later this week, Senator Lambie, or you're also at liberty to quiz me in the chamber at any point. I won't take up any more of question time by adding to what I have said on the record. There are opportunities for you to ask me about that on behalf of the parliamentary services department in the future. But I call you to ask a supplementary question if you wish.

           I have to be honest,

            Mr President

           : it shouldn't be that difficult. We have just on 600 people on the lobbyists register, and I'm sure you've noticed that. That means there are 800 lobbyists slipping under the radar. Does

           or yourself intend to do something about this in the future and actually change the regulation so they're up to scratch? Even New Zealand has nothing to fear, and they're doing it. So, if the Kiwis can do it, I would like to know why we can't be honest with the Australian people and show them who's on the list?

            If the Senate's happy, I can take this as a supplementary question to myself. Is leave granted? By leave, Senator Lambie, I'm happy to forward to your office lengthy discussions in
            <i>
             Hansard
            </i>
            on this to provide the context. But, in the end, the lobbyists register is not the same as the register for sponsored passes. There is some crossover. The lobbyists register, which is administered by the government not by the Department of Parliamentary Services, as has been the subject of debate, refers to lobbyists who lobby on behalf of paid clients. The sponsored passes include people who are representing community groups and other
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGO" rel="nofollow">
             NGO
            </a>
            s, people who are not paid lobbyists, nor are they necessarily lobbyists in the employ of a single firm as government affairs managers and the like. I am happy to provide you with the
            <i>
             Hansard
            </i>
            of the previous discussion, before Thursday, so you have an opportunity to quiz me at the estimates spillover, if you wish, or to raise it again in the chamber. Senator Payne?

               I think everyone needs to realise here that Australians know there's pretty shady stuff going on, up here, when it comes to lobbyists and these passes. It is about time, in the name of democracy in this country, we were open and honest about who was getting these passes and exactly what they were doing up here. Honestly, the only people—and what bothers Australians, more than anything, is how many of the lobbyists are coming in and giving out political donations at the same time. That's where the problem is.
