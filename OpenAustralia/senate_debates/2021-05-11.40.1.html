        , Senator Cash. Within weeks of being appointed to the new portfolios of Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations, the minister appointed Ms Alana Matheson, a former Liberal Party deputy mayor of Campbelltown, to a 26-year long, $10 million post to the Fair Work Commission. Can the minister confirm that Ms Matheson is one of 13 former Liberal MPs and political staffers who have been appointed to the plum federal government jobs since the start of this year?

         I thank Senator Keneally for the question. Senator Keneally, what I can confirm is this: all appointments made by the Morrison government—in fact, all appointments made by the coalition government since we were elected in 2013—have been based on merit, so I completely, totally and utterly reject the accusations that you are making. Whether it is a Federal Court appointment, whether it is a Fair Work Commission appointment, whether it is an
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAT" rel="nofollow">
          AAT

         appointment or any other appointment, we carefully and methodically look through candidates to ensure that the most suitable candidate is actually appointed to the role.
        </p>
        <p>
         Colleagues, you see, this is where the Labor Party want to have their cake and eat it as well. What I am now saying is this: at times we have appointed those from a different political persuasion because our government believed, clearly unlike Labor, that they were the best people for the role. For example, let's hear the comments they have on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Burke" rel="nofollow">
          Anna Burke
         </a>

                  , I possibly should have jumped when you gave as wide a ruling as you did in response to my colleague, where you said, 'I think that anything related to the appointment is relevant to the supplementary.' With respect, I ask you to reconsider that. I don't believe that's consistent with the standing orders nor your previous rulings. This question relates to Ms Matheson's views on domestic violence leave, and I ask that the minister respond and be directly relevant to that point.

                   I take the point, Senator Wong. I could have worded what I said more carefully. However, I will say that the final part of the question, my notes reflect, is: 'Was this position one of the reasons that referred to the appointment?' I think, in answering that question, the minister is allowed to talk about the specific appointment without necessarily specifically outlining a particular issue. That may be debated after question time. Senator Cash.

                       I completely reject what Senator Keneally has said, and Senator Keneally would know that that is not what is certainly outlined in the evidence. Again, what I would say is this: in relation to the appointments that this government makes, appointments are made on merit. As I've said, we have also appointed, over a period of time, a number of persons of a different political persuasion—in other words, from the Labor Party—because we believed they were the best person for the role. In particular, I go back to Mr

                       . He was an outstanding member for Brand back in

                       </a>
                       . When he left the parliament, I think those from Western Australia would say we worked incredibly well with Mr Gray in relation to representing our great state. And, as a result of that, the government appointed him as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland. I confirm he was not a member of the Liberal Party.
