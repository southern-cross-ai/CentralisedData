          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaclav_Havel" rel="nofollow">
           Vaclav Havel
          </a>
          , the first president of post-communist Czechoslovakia, was one of the most remarkable freedom fighters of the 20th century. He was a playwright; he was a writer; he was a poet; and he was an intellectual. He was imprisoned, beaten and brutalised by the communist dictatorship. Unlike far too many in the West, he never romanticised or made excuses for commu­nism. I hope all senators, including the Greens, understand that. Havel understood from painful personal experience commu­nism's horror, degradation and the cancer it is to the human spirit.
         </p>
         <p>
          I had the good fortune to meet President Havel in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" rel="nofollow">
           New York
          </a>
          in 2006. I handed him a copy of a book he wrote called
          <i>
           Living in Truth
          </i>
          . He was good enough to sign it for me using a green pen. Then he took out a red pen and he drew a little red heart underneath it. He winked at me and he said one word: 'Love'. I thought we had made some connection. What struck me was his apparent innocence, an innocence that even communism could not belt out of him. But his innocence was truly luminous. It lit his face, his smile, his native Czechoslovakia and all of central Europe and all those who love and yearn for freedom.

             I very much support this motion. I was invited by a number of news organisations to respond to the president's death and did so nationally. I agree with the senator moving this motion that Havel is another example of a great soul who can inspire all of us. But he would not have wanted his death used for political or petty pointscoring in the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Senate" rel="nofollow">
              Australian Senate
             </a>
             . I thought the mover of this motion, a good motion and a good point of view to be put, demeaned this occasion by his comment on the Greens. It was very unworthy of him and he should have done better than that. Havel would have blown the whistle on that.
