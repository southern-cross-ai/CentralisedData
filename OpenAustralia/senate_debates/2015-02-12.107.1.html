        , my question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate and the Minister representing the Prime Minister. Given the critical role and interest that the Prime Minister's office has in the Future Submarine project, is the Prime Minister's office aware that while on a tour of European and Japanese submarine manufacturers in late 2014—in particular, in November and December 2014—the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Materiel_Organisation" rel="nofollow">

        , the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMO" rel="nofollow">
         DMO
        </a>
        , expressed to one or more of the submarine manufacturers a clear view that actually questioned Australia's capacity to build the future submarines in Australia? Will the minister unequivocally repudiate any such view that Australia does not have the capacity to build its future submarines?

            I think it would be fair to say that the minister has commenced his answer and is directly answering your question. He has one minute and 46 seconds left to go. It was fairly early to take a point of order of that nature.

            <p>
             With respect to Senator Xenophon, his question did have a very long preamble, and I am dealing with the preamble in relation to the suggestions made. In relation to the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Materiel_Organisation" rel="nofollow">
              Defence Materiel Organisation
             </a>
             , I have no advice as to whether that was said or not said or whether that is their view. However, I can share with Senator Xenophon that the Prime Minister's, and the government's, view is that any Australian company that can credibly meet the requirements will be considered on merit—as will potential international partners—in this very important task of creating a defence capability of submarines. Irrespective of how that occurs, there will be huge job opportunities in the shipbuilding sector and the ship maintenance sector of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
              South Australia
             </a>
             n economy. Something that should never be overlooked as we go about this very important and, if I might say, very expensive acquisition is that we do the right thing by the nation's defence needs and also by taxpayers' dollars and, of course, that we do everything that we can to ensure jobs in South Australia.

               did. From the government's point of view, we are looking for a competitive evaluation process which will include—and I repeat—that any Australian company that can credibly meet these requirements will be considered on merit, as will international partners. Therefore, Australian companies will have an opportunity to be part of this process. Given that is the Prime Minister's view, one assumes that it is believed that Australian companies may well be able—
