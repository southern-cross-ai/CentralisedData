         I thank Senator Scarr for that question, and I'd also like to acknowledge your engagement and support for Queensland industry—thank you. Australia's burgeoning defence industry is essential to ADF operations and it's also critical to generating the capability we need here to protect Australia and our nation's interests. Because of the Morrison government's strong economy, we are able to invest a record $200 billion in completely transforming the ADF and to take our defence expenditure up to two per cent of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
          GDP
         </a>
         —something that those opposite completely failed to do. Not only are we completely re-equipping the ADF; we are also the first government to fully engage and support Australian industrial capability through programs such as the $90 billion Naval Shipbuilding Plan, the $20 billion to modernise the Australian Army's fighting vehicles and the $18 billion to deliver the next generation of strike and air combat aircraft systems.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is an opportunity not only for primes but also for small to medium business, which are the engine room of the Australian economy. In fact, in the last financial year alone, over $8 billion of defence contracts were awarded to Australian
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SME" rel="nofollow">
          SME
         </a>
         s, which equates to thousands and thousands of new high-tech jobs right here in Australia. A great example of this growth is that, since the inclusion of the Local Industry Capability Plans in major construction contracts, 80 per cent of all subcontracts are going to local companies right across this nation, which directly benefits local businesses and injects over $3 billion into local economies right across our nation. In addition, the government is investing about $1.5 billion across the Next Generation Technologies Fund and also the Defence Innovation Hub. We are supporting defence industry and we are backing them in and we're backing—

            I thank Senator Scarr again for that question. This government is investing over $20 billion in modernising Army's fighting vehicles and a further $5 billion in Land 121 for logistics vehicles, which are now ready to commence exercises and training. But, under the $5 billion Boxer combat reconnaissance program, 211 vehicles will be delivered to create an estimated 1,450 jobs across the country—in particular, nearly 350 jobs in Queensland. Over the 30-year life of the Boxer, Australian industry is expected to secure $10.2 billion of work to build and to maintain the fleet. That, again, is thousands of jobs throughout the supply chain over that time. The majority of these vehicles will be built in Australia by Australians using Australian steel at Queensland's Rheinmetall Australian facility in Redbank. Local businesses, including Frontline Manufacturing and Rockpress—
