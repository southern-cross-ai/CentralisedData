        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Brandis. I refer to the Prime Minister's recent statement on the banking industry that 'there have been too many troubling incidents over recent times for them simply to be dismissed'. Will the Turnbull government now join with Labor and support a royal commission into our banking and financial services industry?

         No, we will not; and I will explain to you why we will not. Either Mr Shorten does not understand the purpose of a royal commission or, if he does, he is irresponsibly and recklessly calling for a royal commission well knowing that it is not the appropriate way to deal with identified problems. Last week, Mr Turnbull gave a speech at the Westpac 199th anniversary luncheon and, during the course of that speech, he did make a number of chastising remarks about the banking industry. So the suggestion that the government is somehow being indifferent to a problem, or averting its eyes from a problem, is entirely wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
         Unlike the Heydon royal commission into the trade union movement—where there was widespread systemic and documented illegality, criminality and corruption—no-one, not even someone as reckless as Mr Shorten, has gone so far as to suggest that there is widespread illegality, criminality and corruption in the Australian banking sector. The Australian banking sector is one of the strongest financial industries in the world—and, Senator Dastyari, that is the achievement of your side of politics as well as my side of politics—because the institutional structure that undergirds and polices and regulates the Australian financial system is a very strong set of safeguards.

           As I was saying, we have one of the best regulated, best governed financial systems in the world. And you do not have to take that from me, Senator Dastyari. As recently as 2012, this is what
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Shorten" rel="nofollow">
            Bill Shorten
           </a>
           said: 'Australia has some of the best banks in the world. It is partly because of our excellent regulatory system and prudential management.' Mr Shorten also said, 'Australia's strong performance through the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GFC" rel="nofollow">
            GFC
           </a>
           was in large part due to the strength of its regulatory framework.' Senator Dastyari, it passes strange that you, of all people in the Senate, should be asking this question—because, as you will remember, when, in the middle of last year, the Greens proposed a motion to establish a royal commission into the banking industry, it was you who memorably interjected, 'This is a stunt.' Well, the stunt lies with you now, Senator Dastyari.

            , I ask a further supplementary question. Can the minister confirm that eight coalition senators and MPs are prepared to support a royal commission into the banking and financial services industry, including my dear friend Senator Williams, who has welcomed Labor's proposal? Minister, why is the government ignoring its own backbench and the interests of Australian consumers by continuing to reject a royal commission?

             It just goes to show how desperate and reckless you have become that what you, 10 months ago, condemned as a stunt is now the centrepiece of your policy. What you condemned as a stunt, you have now embraced as the centrepiece of your policy. We are a responsible government. We know that there is no system so good that it cannot be improved. But the way in which to do it, Senator Dastyari, is to take the institutions that we have—institutions which you and your leader and your shadow Treasurer have acknowledged are among the best regulators in the world—and make sure they can be as good as they possibly can be.
