        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Water, Senator
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McAllister" rel="nofollow">
         McAllister

        . I refer the minister to plans for a new billion-dollar gold and silver mine, which proponents Regis Resources say now is not viable because of an 11th-hour decision to block the project, despite the project having all state and federal environmental approvals in place. Given this massive hit to our regional economy will cost over 800 jobs, does the minister agree with Regis
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        Jim Beyer, who said:

       <p class="italic">
        Regis considers this … shatters any confidence that development proponents Australia-wide (both private and public) can have in project approval timelines and outcomes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Beyer goes on to say that this will affect any project, of any type, anywhere, and ends by finally saying that this decision highlights the increasing sovereign risk of investing in Australia. When will your government stop scaring off investment and killing off jobs?

          I am aware that the Minister for the Environment and Water has placed a protection order on a site near Regis Resources' McPhillamy gold project in

            I understand that Regis Resources has assessed around four sites and 30 potential options for the tailings dam. I hope that the company can find an alternative site for its tailings and waste dam.

            people is essential for the Australian mining sector to reach its full potential, and the Australian government is committed to that goal. The government has been unequivocal in its support for mining, which employs 300,000 Australians, announcing very significant measures for resources in the budget.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will make the observation that there are striking similarities between this decision and a decision made by the former minister for the environment, Ms Susan Ley, who is now the deputy Liberal leader. Back in 2021, she made a very similar decision just down the road from this same site. She made that decision after listening to the views of the same local traditional owner group, the Wiradjuri Traditional Owners Central West Aboriginal Corporation and she said at the time she was protecting it because of its cultural significance.

              Given this project had already secured all state and federal environmental approvals required and was blocked after many years of assessment and consultation supported by local traditional owners, will the minister seek to amend the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act to remove this serious sovereign risk and uncertainty, killing off jobs and investment in this country?

               Perhaps you do wish to describe it in this way, but sovereign risk is not the same as being asked to comply with existing laws for the Australian government. These are not the same things. It is of course the case that the government has embarked on a broader process of reform for our cultural heritage arrangements. Indeed, we had understood that this had been embarked upon as part of a bipartisan process, because everyone in this chamber, I think, recalls what happened at the Juukan Gorge. I think everybody remembers the national level of concern that was articulated at that time, and everybody remembers that there was bipartisan agreement that heritage laws needed to be reformed. If you have changed that position, you might inform the chamber.

                 Nice way to try and conflate issues here, but given the government seems happy to kill off projects that generate jobs and economic activity along with their funding of the Environmental Defenders Office—millions of dollars every year—does the minister agree with the concerns of the Minerals Council of Australia

                  Once again we have the opposition asserting that environmental laws, which have been in place for a very long period of time, including under the government that you were part of, Senator Duniam, are in some way hostile to the interest of Australia's economy. It is actually not our approach. We believe firmly that our economy can prosper and indeed flourish through an approach which not only respects the role of business in our economy but also respects and acknowledges our shared commitment to protecting our cultural heritage and protecting our environment. It's on that basis, of course, that we've commenced reform processes, both in relation to the
