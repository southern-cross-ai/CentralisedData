        My question is to Senator Abetz, the Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation, representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage. Is the minister aware that, as the humpback whale populations passing down the west coast of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        gradually increase, the incidence of whale entanglements in the ropes connecting rock lobster pots to surface marker floats used by the western rock lobster industry has also increased? What action is the minister taking to address this ongoing unresolved issue of humpback whale and endangered leatherback turtle entanglements in these ropes?

         Having had a quick look through the briefs of Minister Campbell, there does not seem to be a brief on this particular matter. In relation to any marine life being caught up in ropes, be it associated with the rock lobster industry or any other industry, that is a concern, especially if they are a protected species. With the two that you mentioned—humpback whales and turtles, if I recall correctly—that is a matter of concern. In relation to rock lobsters, I am not sure, but possibly Senator Scullion might be able to assist me on this. With respect to the rock lobster industry, I understand that a lot of that occurs within the state fishing zone. I am not sure if it is necessarily out in the Commonwealth fishing zone. It could well be mixed. I think I am getting a nod from Senator Scullion—who, I think most of us would accept, is an expert in these matters. As a result, it may be better for the honourable senator to direct her question to the state minister for fisheries—

           Silly Senator Brown keeps poking the air, putting holes in it, trying to defend the indefensible. What I am suggesting to Senator Siewert is that she should take it up with the state minister,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Ford" rel="nofollow">
            Jon Ford
           </a>
           . As minister for fisheries—albeit you did not ask me in that capacity—I will be meeting with the minister for fisheries in the state of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            Western Australia
           </a>
           , Jon Ford, on 11 July. I am sure that Minister Campbell would be delighted if I were to take up that issue with him, because there is a fair chance that, with the rock lobster industry, it is a combined responsibility of both state and federal governments. I will see what I can do.

              I honestly believe that Senator Siewert has asked this question because she is genuinely concerned about the issue, and therefore she does not need the inane interjections of the likes of Senator Brown. I will see what can be done, at both a state and Commonwealth level, and see where the exact responsibility lies. I would not have thought that a state government, a Commonwealth government or, indeed, any Australian citizen, would want to see the unnecessary entanglement of whales or turtles in rock lobster fishing exercises.

When you are taking it up, could you please inform us—if you do not know already—as to any estimates of the numbers of humpback whales and turtles killed in these entanglements. Given that the Minister for the Environment and Heritage exempted the western rock lobster fishery from export controls under part 13 of the
