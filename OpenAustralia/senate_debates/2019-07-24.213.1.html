        I present the Delegated Legislation Monitor 3 of 2019 of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, and move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the Senate take note of the document.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the recently elected Chair of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I rise to speak to the tabling of the committee's Delegated Legislation Monitor 3 of 2019.
       </p>
       <p>
        This committee is one of the Senate's oldest and most respected standing committees. It performs the important role of examining all disallowable legislative instruments made under the authority of acts of the parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee engages in the technical scrutiny of delegated legislation in accordance with the scrutiny principles set out in Senate standing order 23. It does not assess the policy merits of delegated legislation. Due to this approach, the committee has a strong and longstanding commitment to non-partisanship.
       </p>
       <p>
        In June this year, the committee tabled the report of its inquiry into parliamentary scrutiny of delegated legislation. In that report, the committee emphasised the need to ensure that senators understand the committee's role, and the value of parliamentary scrutiny of delegated legislation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee has made a number of changes to its work practices to promote these objectives.
       </p>
       <p>
        For example, the committee has resolved that the chair will make a statement in this chamber to accompany the tabling of the Delegated Legislation Monitor, to further highlight the committee's most significant scrutiny concerns to the Senate.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee has also resolved to place 'protective' notices of motions to disallow the instruments discussed in chapter 1 of the Delegated Legislation Monitor. Chapter 1 details the committee's most significant and unresolved scrutiny concerns.
       </p>
       <p>
        The protective notices of motions to disallow will give the Senate additional time to properly consider the committee's outstanding concerns.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee hopes that these initiatives, and others, will enhance senators' understanding and appreciation of the importance of parliamentary oversight and control of delegated legislation.
       </p>
       <p>
        With these comments, I commend the committee's Delegated Legislation Monitor 3 of 2019 to the Senate.
