        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Cormann. I refer to former Prime Minister Turnbull, who, this morning, tweeted from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" rel="nofollow">

         I thank Senator Farrell for that question. There is no uncertainty and, indeed, the House of Representatives was asked to vote on the matter and the former Prime Minister voted against such a referral.

            Age

           newspaper, it's reported that former Prime Minister Turnbull has, and I quote: 'told his former colleagues, they should cross the floor of the House and vote with Labor to force a referral'. How many of his party room members does Prime Minister Morrison fear will follow the lead of the Prime Minister in exile?

            Firstly, I refer the honourable senator to my answer to his first question. I would also again remind Senator Farrell that the former Prime Minister voted against Labor's motion seeking to secure this sort of referral. It's, of course, up to the Labor Party in the House of Representatives to do whatever they want to do. It's up to the Labor Party. This was and would be an entirely partisan political attack. There's no legal basis on which to pursue this. There's no legal basis on which to pursue it. There's no uncertainty. The legal advice is very clear, and I refer you in particular to the Solicitor-General's advice, which states: 'Section 44(v) … applies only where there is an "agreement with the Public Service of the Commonwealth".' And in his opinion there is 'no agreement in which Mr Dutton could have an indirect pecuniary interest by virtue of his status as a beneficiary of the

              I do have a further supplementary question. This morning, former Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party,
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Bishop" rel="nofollow">
               Julie Bishop
              </a>
              , declared, and I quote: 'If there's a vote … I'll make my mind up at that time'. When will Prime Minister Morrison accept the advice of the Prime Minister in exile and refer Minister Dutton to the High Court to remove any doubt about his eligibility and the validity of decisions he is making?

               Again, the position of the government is very clear. What Senator Farrell is pointing to here is one of the great differences between the Liberal and National parties and the Labor Party. In the Labor Party, if somebody pulls out of line they get kicked out. But, of course, in the Liberal and National parties, we have freedom. We have a conscience. Backbenchers have got freedom—
