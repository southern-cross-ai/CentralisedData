         The government has a very clear position in relation to penalty rates. Penalty rates are to be determined by the Fair Work Commission. That is it. The government does not have a role in determining penalty rates. Anybody who says otherwise is misleading the Australian people or misleading the Senate. But I can tell you who does like to cut penalty rates, and that is, of course, the current Leader of the Opposition,

             , on the same point of order, Minister Cash could not have been more directly relevant to the question. The reason that Senator Wong got up is that Senator Cash was being too relevant to the question.

               Order! The minister, in answering her question, indicated the government's position and that is what a minister is to do, and the minister indicated the government's position in relation to penalty rates. All ministers are allowed to enhance their answers provided they stay relevant to the topic and Senator Cash has been relevant.

                Thank you. Again, I reiterate the government's position in relation to penalty rates. It has been clearly and consistently stated by government members that penalty rates are a matter for the Fair Work Commission to determine, but as I was saying, if you want to look to someone who is currently a member of parliament, who puts himself out as being the future leader of this country, who has a record in relation to what I personally would call 'slashing' penalty rates—I would not call it 'cutting'—that is, of course, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr

                  I think there is a body of evidence in Australia that would suggest that penalty rates were put in place some time ago when the work situation in Australia was fundamentally different. In fact, the
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
                   Productivity Commission
                  </a>
                  itself has recommended that the Fair Work Commission take into consideration a wider body of evidence when it is setting penalty rates. What we will never resile from on this side of the chamber is having a good debate, allowing the Australian people to put their views. If that means there are some small business people out there who cannot open on a Sunday because their wages bill exceeds their takings bill, maybe we should listen to them. If there are people out there who cannot open on a Sunday but who say, 'I could open on a Sunday if …', maybe we should listen, but it does not change our position. Penalty rates are set by the Fair Work Commission.
