                  Recognising that standing orders 193 and 203 already regulate conduct in this chamber, as we've seen this week, the opposition supports referring the proposed code of conduct back to the

                  for further deliberation. As Senator Wong said yesterday, the approach Labor takes is very clear. We will not tolerate sexist and abusive behaviour. We will not tolerate it in the Senate and we will not tolerate it anywhere. We also believe that parliament cannot function without respect for the presiding officers and the rules the parliament has agreed to regarding appropriate behaviour, but the Senate itself will not be respected if the behaviours exhibited here demean it. That goes not only to rules but also to standards and expectations. We fully support the comments of the President in his statements to the chamber yesterday and in August this year and welcome the response from the

                     I refer to section 2(b):

                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I take offence to that. I was born here. This is my country as much as anyone else's, and I do not regard myself as a migrant. Also I'm asking for clarification on section 4(c), where it states 'Female and elected representatives from
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBTIQ" rel="nofollow">
                      LGBTIQ
                     </a>
                     -plus communities'. I need a 'please explain' on 'Q-plus', because I have no understanding of what that is about, to make a decision in the parliament with regard to 'Q-plus'. And I'd like to know why the men of this parliament are not included in this. It is sexist in itself to refer to females only. So, I will not be supporting this. I also refer to section 1(b), about the behaviour and language in the parliament. I draw attention to the fact that Senator Di Natale was the first one to be thrown out of this parliament for his behaviour.

                        The less said about the most recent contribution the better. I'll just give a bit of history on this code of conduct motion. We introduced a code of conduct motion back in 2017 when a senator wore a burqa into the Senate. That code of conduct was referred to the
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_Committee" rel="nofollow">
                         Procedure Committee
                        </a>
                        in December 2017, and the recommendation back from the Procedure Committee was that voluntary codes should be adopted by each party. We reject that. The
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
                         Australian Greens
                        </a>
                        believe there should be a compulsory code of conduct for all of us to support. I introduced a code of conduct motion back in 2018 in response to a previous senator talking about the 'final solution'. The reality is that the status quo is not working. We're continuing to see statements that are sexist and racist. We are continuing the see statements that are anti-Semitic. This is a workplace for many people. The current situation is not working. To defer this to the Procedure Committee is to say no to a compulsory code of conduct. We believe the parliament needs one.

                           have accused me of making sexist and derogatory remarks. In the year that I've been here, I've never denigrated anyone in this place; nor will I.
