           I thank Senator Ludlam for his question, and I thank him for providing advance notice. It is quite clear that the Greens are asking serious questions on these matters, and are seeking serious answers—unlike those opposite. Let me say, straight up, that the government will honour the promise it gave in September last year. Minister Ferguson has advised that we will repeal the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Act 2005. We will base future decisions about waste management on solid, agreed science and we will not be making decisions without proper consultations with state and territory governments and local communities. The government will not be taking piecemeal steps or making ad hoc decisions on radioactive waste management. We want a total package to solve this problem once and for all.
          </p>
          <p>
           That is what Minister Ferguson is working on. The need for a national radioactive waste repository is clear, and it has been since another colleague of mine, Mr Crean, started working on this project in the early 1990s. Radioactive waste is already stored at over 100 different locations around Australia: in government stores, in universities, in hospitals and in factories.

                 Australian National University
                </a>
                . It includes everything from contaminated rubber gloves and discarded smoke detectors to by-products of nuclear medicine. This is Australia’s waste and it is up to us to actually do something about it. Just about everyone in this chamber seems to agree on that principle. I remind the Senate that it was the shadow minister for resources and energy, Senator Johnston, who recently pointed out: ‘I’m not going to make a political issue out of it.’ He said, ‘I think it’s in the national interest to have a repository for this, these low-level radioactive isotopes,’ and he said, ‘Let’s get on with it.’ He made that point as recently as 9 June.
               </p>
               <p>
                Senator Ludlam himself has written on his GreensBlog:
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                What is urgently needed is a properly deliberative process about what to do with this material …
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                …            …            …
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                Perhaps in the light of reasoned debate we will find that the best option is long-distance shipping to a remote site. But Australia needs to have that conversation.
               </p>
               <p>
                The government do agree that deliberation is essential and that consultation is essential, and we believe that a detailed scientific analysis is essential. We do not believe in imposing solutions by ministerial dictate. The government have to finalise our own legislation before we can repeal the existing act. The legislation will acknowledge Australia’s responsibility for its own radioactive waste. It will provide for the storage of waste under proper supervision and with appropriate safeguards. It will deliver a practical, long-term solution to a problem that has been with us for decades. I hope—I trust—that all senators will support that legislation when it comes before the chamber.
