        'Oh and it's Christmas!' I won't sing in here. It's okay; I'll save you all from that. But I've been making a list and checking it twice. I already know who's been naughty and nice in this chamber, I can assure you. All you've got to decide is which side you are on. But it's Christmas, so I am going to concentrate.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the top of my list would have to be the new senator up here, Senator Pocock, and his elves in his office. I tell you, it's been a great pleasure to work alongside them for the last 18 months up here, and I wanted to thank them greatly. Thank you, once again. Next on my list are the veterans who've had the guts to go and tell their stories to the royal commission, and I can assure you I will keep pushing for Defence and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVA" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        to hand over those documents. Wouldn't it be really nice if DVA and Defence could actually get off Jacqui Lambie's naughty list by 2024? Like I say, there's always hope. And do you know who is really great and nice? It's all those Tasmanians who put up events and volunteer to help families who are struggling to keep their heads above water. I'm sure that Santa has something really special for you and your kids.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to thank all my staff, who have worked tirelessly for years for me—God forbid! Thank you so much. I'd also like to thank all those Tasmanians who give me and my office advice and feedback on a regular basis on a whole heap of issues—even when I don't want it. My nicest times of the year, every time, are when I travel around Tassie, from the Unconformity festival on the wild west coast to the fabulous market in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Norfolk" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Obviously, that's where I love to get my last lot of Christmas presents. A big shout out to my family and friends for their support, and of course to my sons, who also like to give me advice when it's probably not wanted. To all of the staff in here, and that includes the guys who work in here, the guys down at Aussies, the guys in 'the trough', the cleaners—all of you—I wish you and your families a really merry Christmas and a safe and happy new year.
