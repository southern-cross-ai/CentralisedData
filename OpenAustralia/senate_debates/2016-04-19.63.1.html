         I thank Senator Smith for his question and also acknowledge his expertise in this area. He is someone who, from his former professional experience, understands that the line is ever blurred between carriage providers, content providers and media organisations.

         As all colleagues should know, media reform is important because it is part of managing the transitioning economy. One of the issues with the media laws that we currently have is that those that govern what are sometimes called 'traditional media platforms'—or, as those media organisations prefer to be known, 'media organisations of long standing'—were crafted in the year 1987, which, as Senator Smith, Senator Payne and, I think, Senator Conroy would know, was the year that

         released their landmark album

         on both vinyl and CD. To be fair, it is not actually an album that formed part of the genre of tastes of the Attorney. That is recognised. But I think that cultural reference indicates just how out of date our media laws are.
        </p>
        <p>
         The media laws that we have and that this government is looking to remove our sensational in many respects, apart from the fact that they do not recognise the fact that the internet exists. That is a small problem. They cater for newspapers, commercial radio and commercial

           I can indeed cite some responses from media organisations about our proposed media reforms, which had, as the Prime Minister has referenced on a number of occasions, been kicked into the long grass for too long. For example, Ian Audsley, the

           , told a Senate inquiry recently:

           This bill is a very positive first step in media reform, which is needed in a rapidly changing media environment.

           Without the ability to unleash ourselves from the regulations and to organise ourselves in a more efficient manner—that is, consolidate—our future will be one of struggle.

             As I indicated, the two-out-of-three rule is one element that we are looking to remove from Australia's media rule. Principally, the issue here, as I referenced before, is that it does not recognise that the internet exists. We have to enable media organisations to configure themselves in the way that best suits them. We also are keen to get rid of the 75-per-cent-audience-reach rule, which I know those opposite support, but it would be tremendous if the parliament could see its way to removing both of those rules and see them as a package. I again acknowledge Senator Smith, who is someone who is not just looking at this reform; he is someone who is always looking over the horizon at the next reforms that need to be undertaken in Australia's media law.
