          <p>
           Thank you. The government is opposing the motion. There has been a great deal of misinformation in relation to the insurance position adopted by the Queensland government. It is not true to suggest that if Queensland had taken out reinsurance the Commonwealth would have been able to avoid any payments under the NDRRA. The scale of this disaster was significantly larger than any state insurance policy could cover. It is misleading to suggest, as we have heard time and time again from some people in the media, that Victoria,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
            New South Wales

            Western Australia
           </a>
           and the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
            ACT
           </a>
           all have comprehensive disaster coverage. This is wrong. The states take out a range of positions when it comes to reinsurance. Victoria insures both roads and bridges. New South Wales insures bridges but not all roads. Queensland and WA insure neither bridges nor roads. So the motion is based on factual errors.
          </p>
          <p>
           These different positions reflect the fact that the premiums faced by each state will tend to vary based on the nature of the assets being covered and the risks being faced. Currently, each state looks at whether to take out reinsurance based on whether it represents value for money. Queensland assessed reinsurance and found it was better for the taxpayers of Queensland for the government to build up a pool of funds rather than pay reinsurance premiums.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commonwealth" rel="nofollow">
            The Commonwealth
           </a>
           , when it reviewed its insurance arrangements under the previous government, decided to self-insure through Comcover. So, clearly, reinsurance does not always represent value for money for taxpayers. This is a decision that each government needs to take on a case-by-case basis. We acknowledge that insurance is an area where reform is necessary. The government is working with the insurance industry and consumer groups on reforms in the interests of taxpayers and consumers. We will have more to say on this in coming days and weeks.
