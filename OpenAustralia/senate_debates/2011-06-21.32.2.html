         I do not think this sort of low-level politics does Senator Abetz any good. The churlish comments about Senator Ludwig pursuing Australia's national interests are, I think, petty. Senator Abetz has asked me this question at least once before, if not two or three times. The Gillard government have made it clear that climate change poses a very significant challenge to our environment and the Australian economy. We, like
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
          John Howard
         </a>
         in 2007, argue the need for a comprehensive government response. This government has set about trying to build a consensus in this parliament for putting a price on carbon. As you would be aware, we sought in the previous parliament to introduce a
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPRS" rel="nofollow">
          CPRS
         </a>
         , which was not able to gain the support of the parliament.
        </p>
        <p>
         The opposition, after originally supporting that proposition, rolled their leader and determined to oppose any action on climate change. In fact, the opposition now deny that climate change is a problem; I think the deniers have the numbers. I do not know whether, when Senator Minchin goes, the numbers will turn again. I think you are losing a couple of deniers, and it will be interesting to see how the balance goes.

Will the minister confirm that the carbon tax that the Prime Minister promised not to have is now the price Australians will pay for the government's deal with the Greens so she could cling to power after she lost Labor's majority at the last election?

               It seems that Senator Abetz, like his leader, has trouble accepting the results of the last election, but I am afraid that that is where we are at and he ought to try to accept the result. All these rhetorical flourishes, which may well go down at the Hobart Liberal Party council, are not the same as having a proper policy debate. I would encourage the opposition to engage in a proper policy debate—not making three-word slogans and accusations about lying et cetera but actually debating the policies. Does the opposition believe climate change is occurring? Do they believe humans contribute to that? Do they believe we need to take serious action to address those concerns? The reality is that everyone who accepts the logic of those propositions accepts that we need to put a price on carbon, and that is what this government is going to do.

                We on this side accept the result of the last election, which returned 98 per cent of parliamentarians on the promise of no carbon tax. So what mandate does the government claim to have from the Australian people to impose a carbon tax which destroys jobs, raises the cost of living and will do nothing for the environment?

                 I would be happy to debate the question of a mandate with Senator Abetz at any time. It is one of those theories that people like when it suits them and abandon when it does not. The reality is that this government is going to put a proposition before the parliament that the elected members of parliament, including those opposite, will get to vote on. They will get to vote on legislation to put a price on carbon. Then they can decide whether they are going to support the legislation or not. That will depend on how the numbers in the party are going, whether the loss of a few of the old right-wing warriors means the numbers swing back again. But that is what we will see. Decisions about a price on carbon will be made in the Australian parliament by all of us. All of the elected representatives of the people will get a chance to vote on carbon legislation later this year.

                  Senator Evans, please stop. I would remind senators it is disorderly to shout across the chamber. If you wish to participate in debating the issue there is time at the end of question time.
