        My question is to the Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Senator Cash. I ask whether the minister will inform the Senate of the key elements of Australia's strong and consistent border protection policies.

         I thank Senator Back for his question and for what I know is a keen interest in this important policy area. When it comes to border protection—but, in particular, to doing it properly—there are three things that you need to do as a government. The first thing you need to do is to know and acknowledge the policies that actually work. The second thing you need to do is to have the backbone—the spine and the resolve—to implement those policies despite the barrage of opposition that you receive from others. The third thing that you need to do is to have the competence to implement those policies, and that is exactly what we on this side of the chamber have done when it comes to border protection.
        </p>

         Let us look at what we have achieved with the coalition's policies. In the last 312 days we have had but one single, solitary venture that came to our shores. Contrast that to a similar period under the former government, where we had in excess of 20,000 people arrive illegally by boat—one single, solitary venture, compared to in excess of 20,000 people arriving here illegally by boat. What do we see, however, from the other side? In the last 48 hours we saw but a mere flirtation with those policies that actually work. In a 'Marles moment', to quote Senator Smith, the shadow minister, in relation to the government's turn-back policy, admitted openly, on record, 'It has had an impact.' I personally think that is an understatement, but at least the shadow minister admitted that the government's turn-back policies had had an impact. He then indicated that Labor may consider taking it to the next election. And we all know what happened then.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Is the minister aware of any ongoing commentary about the effectiveness of turn-backs, and will the minister advise the Senate on how the coalition government's policy of turn-backs contrasts with previous approaches?

           As I was saying, the member for Corio, the shadow minister for immigration, is on the record as admitting that turn-backs have had an effect. But, unfortunately for the shadow minister, it was but a very brief moment of clarity before other Labor figures pulled him aside and said, 'That is not our policy—you need to correct the record.' I have in front of me—and Tasmanian senators will be familiar with this publication—

           , which reports: 'Senators don't support the policy,' and quotes Senator Singh as saying: 'Turn-backs endanger the lives of those at sea.' Senator Singh, I have to say—through you,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
            Mr President
           </a>
           —that it was your failed policies that endangered the lives of in excess of 1,200 people who died at sea. We also have the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten himself, coming out today and confirming: 'Turn-backs are not part of the opposition's policies.' No turn-backs, no border security—people smuggling will become rife if those opposite are re-elected to govern.

            , I ask a further supplementary question. Will the minister inform the Senate of why it is important to maintain the government's resolve and consistency when it comes to protecting our nation's borders?

             (—) (): Quite simply, because it is resolve and consistency that actually stops the boats. In relation to the statistics, they bear witness to that fact. The Australian people know that; we know that. The only people who do not know that, and who refuse to admit it, are those on the other side. This is what resolve and consistency has done in relation to Australia's borders. We have effectively stopped the flow of boats. People are no longer dying at sea. In excess of 1,200 people died at sea under the former government's policies. Thousands of children were placed in detention. What are our policies doing? Our policies are ensuring that those children are now released from detention and into the community. In relation to the cost saving to the Australian taxpayer, we have saved them approximately $2½ billion over the forward estimates in the budget.
