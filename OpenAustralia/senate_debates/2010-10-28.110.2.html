        In my speech in the second reading debate I spoke about the issue of how someone can hide their criminal history by changing their name by deed poll. It is an issue I have been working on for quite a few years, and I did note that the government is undertaking various actions to resolve this issue. I would like to ensure those actions are followed through by making sure that these amendments that I have put forward force the government to report back to the Senate and hold them more accountable. Amendment (3) also deals with making sure that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Privacy Act
        </a>
        does not stand in the way of further action being taken. I commend the amendments to the Senate.
