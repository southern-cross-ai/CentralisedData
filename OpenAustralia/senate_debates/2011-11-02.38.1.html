             I thank Senator Cash for her question. I must say that it has been quite a while since we have enjoyed the sort of question that she presents. In fact it has been quite a while, obviously, since you have been given a question, Senator Cash. I can say to you, Senator Cash, that the government will update our budgetary forecasts in the usual way. We discussed this question in estimates—

               Of course, there is a need to review the budget forecasts simply because of the opposition's policy, which has sought to deny the government's policy arrangements. The opposition has put a position. As a result of that position, we now see that there are increased costs that have to be borne by this country—increased costs for the Navy and increased costs in the operation of the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Immigration_and_Citizenship" rel="nofollow">
                Department of Immigration and Citizenship
               </a>
               .
              </p>
              <p>
               Also, we know that the opposition would waste $980 million over four years in operational expenses alone on the Nauru option—nearly a billion dollars down the drain. That is their policy. So it is only reasonable that, given the extraordinary, wasteful attitude that the Liberal Party have, particularly in the context where they are looking for a $70 billion gap in their funding arrangements for other things, we should bear in mind what the costs are of the opposition's policy as well. So, when the review is undertaken, we can also have a good look at what the opposition are costing this country.

                budget statements, which confirms that the government will spend just under $1.3 billion this financial year to deal with illegal boat arrivals. Isn't it the case that this figure is based on just 750 arrivals this financial year? Given that just in the first four months of the financial year over 1,340 asylum seekers have arrived, how many more billions of dollars will this government waste on its failed border protection policies?

                  The government will update its budgetary estimates in the usual way. This is necessary because of the policies that the opposition have pursued. I find it a particular irony that we now have a unity ticket between the most extreme right-wing opposition this country has seen, probably in its history, and of course the Greens. At least I can say this about the Greens: the Greens are at least fair dinkum about their policy position. You are an opposition bound by one thing only: political opportunism. The political opportunism is leading to people being drowned at sea.

                    , I raise a point of order in relation to relevance. I have to say that, whilst I am enjoying the minister's entertainment this afternoon, my question was quite specific: how many more billions of dollars will the government waste on its failed border protection policies?

                      , the position is very clear. The government has a firm policy position which is being frustrated by those in the opposition, working in collaboration with the Greens. We have a situation here where the most extreme elements of the coalition are now in league with the Greens. The difference is that at least the Greens are working on the basis of principle as they see it.

Why did the Gillard Labor government dismantle the proven border protection policies of the former Howard government which stopped the boats and cost taxpayers less than $100 million per year? When will this government adopt the coalition's amendment to the Migration Act which would restore offshore processing to Nauru and to

                            There was advice coming across the table that we hide behind advice. That is in sharp contrast to the actions of those on the opposite side.
