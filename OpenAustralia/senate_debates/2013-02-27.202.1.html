         The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) There are currently 6 full time and 18 part time staff visiting
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Defence Force
         </a>
         (ADF) bases with a number of backup staff available depending on demand. As the Department of Veterans' Affairs (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVA" rel="nofollow">
          DVA
         </a>
         ) is focused on providing the appropriate support to ADF members and to ensure that they have timely access to services and benefits, there are a total of 50 staff trained nationally to support OBAS activities.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) There are currently 16.3 full-time equivalent (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTE" rel="nofollow">
          FTE
         </a>
         ) staff. As noted above, there are overall 50 trained staff capable of undertaking OBAS duties nationally as required.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) Due to a high demand for OBAS services, there are two On Base Advisors located full time on ADF bases: one located at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavarack_Barracks" rel="nofollow">
          Lavarack Barracks
         </a>
         (Nth

          QLD
         </a>
         ) and the other at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enoggera_Barracks" rel="nofollow">
          Enoggera Barracks
         </a>
         (Sth QLD). The remaining On Base Advisors are located within the DVA State/Territory offices and visit over 35 ADF bases as scheduled. The On Base Advisors are generally located within Defence Health Centres (or within the health precinct). This allows all ADF members easy access to On Base Advisors. DVA continues to monitor the visiting schedule and adjust services as required.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) The following is a breakdown of the current FTE in each State/Territory:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (5) DVA does not record the number of visits to each OBAS location. OBAS advisors record all of their OBAS-related activities, which is then collated. These statistics assist DVA in monitoring the demand for OBAS and the flow-on impact to DVA business areas. Individual client feedback and feedback from the base also assist in measuring the success of the initiative.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (6) Primary claims are not lodged through the OBAS system. OBAS provides advice and support relating to the provision of DVA services and benefits.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         In particular, OBAS provides the following:

        <ul>
        </ul>
        <p class="italic">
         (7) The ADF is responsible for determining ex-service organisation (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESO" rel="nofollow">
          ESO
         </a>

        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (8) Yes, On Base Advisors do refer OBAS clients to ESOs. In 2012, there were 1,220 enquiries to OBAS that were referred to ESOs.
