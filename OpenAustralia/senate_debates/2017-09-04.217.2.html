        The Tasmanian Headstone Project is one of those genuinely motivated, community initiated organisations for which my home state of Tasmania is well-known. Established by Mrs Andrea Gerrard and a determined committee, it has made a difference within our community for lots of families and in particular for the memory of the many who served our country in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">
         World War I
        </a>
        and came home only to be left forgotten in unmarked graves. Thanks to the Tasmanian Headstone Project they are no longer forgotten. Their service to our nation is now recognised and their resting places appropriately marked.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Tasmanian Headstone Project grew from the Families and Friends of the First
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIF" rel="nofollow">
         AIF
        </a>
        Inc., which discovered several years ago that there were many World War I veterans lying in unmarked graves at Cornelian Bay Cemetery in Hobart as well as in many other cemeteries around Tasmania. It is estimated that there are between 500 and 600 men who returned—from the 13,000 Tasmanians that embarked to assist the efforts in World War I—who lie in unmarked graves within Tasmania. As of today, about 300 gravesites have been marked with an appropriate headstone and plaque. All this has required painstaking research by Mrs Gerrard and her committee.
       </p>
       <p>
        The research, identifying and locating of particular gravesites is one thing. The next part is to provide the appropriate headstone. This has been achieved by the generosity of many within the community, including businesses that have shown exemplary corporate citizenry. The organisations that have been instrumental in allowing these markers to double as markers of respect and gratitude, facilitated by the Families and Friends of the

        , are the

        's Greater Hobart Sub Branch; Clennett's Mitre 10; Cement Australia; Sika Australia; Ricoh Business Centre; the Tasmanian government; the RSL's Dunalley Sub Branch; the Hobart City, Glenorchy City, Clarence City and Kingborough councils. As well, there have been donations from families and friends. Millingtons' cemeteries have waived their fees and provided the committee with maps, as well as helping with the plaques.

        As a number of gravestones are completed, there is an appropriate unveiling ceremony which is so ably and movingly supported by the Australian Army Band Tasmania and the 12th/40th Battalion,

        </a>
        , and its association of past members. Community involvement goes even further, with students from various schools in the Greater Hobart area, such as

        , involved in the conduct of the services and the research of each individual soldier whose name has been commemorated. Another aspect of the project has been the very successful involvement of two Work for the Dole projects. They have been of enormous benefit to the project.

        Different dignitaries have presided over particular ceremonies, including the

        I would encourage others to harness their volunteer sector to engage in a similar program in their various states and territories. It is a matter of regret that, as a community, we have neglected the thousands of Australians who went off to defend our freedoms and who now lie in unmarked graves. As the chair of the Tasmanian Headstone Project has said: 'On Anzac Day and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Remembrance Day
        </a>
        , as we say, "lest we forget" those words really mean not to forget these men. This is the thing about the project for me: that we are not forgetting these men and we are remembering them every day.' These poignant words from Mrs Gerrard provide an insight into the motivation for this wonderful project, which has meant so much to the community at large and to individual families. I salute Ms Gerrard and her committee, who have ensured the Tasmanian Headstone Project has made such significant progress. I wish them ongoing success and assure them of my ongoing personal support. I wish them well, salute their endeavours and thank them for their service to our community. We are all enriched by this display of dedication and expression of thankfulness to those who are willing to defend our freedoms—freedoms that we still enjoy today. The least we can do is to say thank you with this mark of respect.
