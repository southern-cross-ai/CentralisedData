         The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:

          DEEWR

         ) has produced various materials that promote flexible workplace relations policies and practices and workplace productivity. In addition, DEEWR has contributed to material developed by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Work_Ombudsman" rel="nofollow">
          Fair Work Ombudsman
         </a>

         ) and developed material used during the Fair Work Education and Information Program (FWEIP) in 2009.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         As part of the 2009-10 National Work Life Balance Awards, DEEWR published a variety of documents including a finalists booklet, application form, guidelines for applicants and selection criteria and a general information fact sheet. These documents were distributed both in hard copy and via the public DEEWR website which contains information on DEEWR programs including the National Work-Life Balance Awards. A copy of the National Work-Life Balance Toolkit is provided at Attachment A, available from the Senate Table Office
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The DEEWR website also promotes other programs regarding the Department's work on flexibility in the workplace including the Fresh Ideas for Work and Family program which ran from 2009-2011. The DEEWR website also contains a number of fact sheets on the Fair Work System including the Fair Work Act 2009 â€“ an overview, which provides information on how the Fair Work Act 2009 provides a balance between work and family life. Further, the DEEWR website contains information on the Government's current workplace relations flexibility policies such as Paid Parental Leave and assistance to employees experiencing domestic violence. Please refer to the DEEWR website at:

        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         While DEEWR has overarching responsibility for workplace flexibility policy, the Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO) has responsibility for educational and promotional activities regarding the Australian Government's Fair Work system including flexible working arrangements, however DEEWR does provide assistance to the FWO on the development of these materials as necessary.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         As part of the Government's commitment to providing support to employees with family responsibilities, the FWO has developed a number relevant factsheets and Best Practice Guides to assist small to medium-sized businesses in implementing best practice initiatives. These include best practice guides on use of individual flexibility arrangements, work and family and parental leave. The guides highlight key aspects of the federal workplace relations system, provide information on best practice concepts, strategies on how these concepts can be implemented and the benefits for the business in doing so. These guides are accessible at:

        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The FWO has also produced a best practice guide on "Improving Workplace Productivity Through Bargaining." This guide is available on the FWO's website at:

        <p class="italic">
         Fact sheets were also produced by the Department based on material provided to FWEIP providers in 2009. A number of these fact sheets included references to flexible working arrangements, including details about the right to request flexible working arrangements and the requirements that enterprise agreements must include a flexibility term. Extracts from relevant FWEIP fact sheets are provided at Attachment B.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         It is not possible for the Department to readily identify how many copies of the various materials referred to above were produced and printed for public distribution. Any estimate would require considerable departmental resources to determine.

        <p class="italic">
         Question (2)(a) and (b)
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         In terms of labour market research relating to workplace relations policy development, advocacy and implementation, the Department is providing funding for an Australian Research Council Linkage Project relating to flexible work in Australia. The study is focused on identifying flexibilities that enable workforce participation and skill development and use, and their implications for work-life outcomes in Australia. The total amount of funding to be provided is $255,000, supplemented by an in-kind contribution of $30,000 (

         Agreements are required to include a flexibility term. The "flexibility term" must enable an employee and his or her employer to agree to an individual flexibility arrangement. This arrangement would allow the employee and the employer to vary the effect of the agreement in relation to the individual employee and the employer in order to meet the genuine needs of both parties.

         The flexibility term must set out the particular terms of the agreement which may be varied by an individual flexibility arrangement. The terms that are selected will be a matter for bargaining.
