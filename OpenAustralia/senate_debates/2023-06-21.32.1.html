        These amendments address an unintended consequence regarding the transitional provisions for existing overseas aid organisations. The amendments ensure that overseas aid funds continue to be endorsed or remain eligible for endorsement as deductible gift recipients under the new requirements.

          For the sake of the chamber, the opposition will be opposing these amendments. The coalition won't be supporting them because, while we support appropriate transparency and reporting measures for public agencies and entities, it's not clear at this time that the impact or the broader public benefit of these amendments would deliver the outcomes you are seeking.

           I indicate that the government will be supporting these amendments. The amendments relate to periodic investment reporting by the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Fund" rel="nofollow">
            Future Fund
           </a>
           . These amendments are identical to one that the previous government introduced into the last parliament but never implemented. So we will be supporting the amendments.

            Just very quickly in response to Senator Hume's comments, as Senator Brown has just pointed out, this is exactly an amendment that was introduced in the previous parliament by the previous government. So this is a backflip by the opposition away from the position they held in government. They put that in place because they were seeking to offset the backlash they were getting from their moves to exempt the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Fund" rel="nofollow">
             Future Fund
            </a>
            from the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_Information_Act" rel="nofollow">
             Freedom of Information Act
            </a>
            . I just need to be clear. I could go into detail about what these amendments will do, but I think it is more of a philosophical objection from the opposition than an objection to the detail and so I don't propose to do that. I just need the Senate and people who are listening or perhaps reading this debate later to understand that this is an amendment that was introduced in the previous parliament by the previous government.
