         Merci, Monsieur President. Vive la France! I thank the senator for her question and for her interest in broadband policy. Countries all around the world recognise the economic importance of broadband infrastructure, but progress on delivering high-speed broadband is slow. It is slow in countries that are relying upon their incumbent telcos to deliver on these ambitions.
        </p>
        <p>
         When Telstra had the monopoly on fixed-line infrastructure, they were slow to embrace broadband as well. Incumbent telcos favour fibre to the node—not because it is efficient or effective but because it is cheap and preserves their market power. Five years ago, Alcatel-Lucent published a technology white paper that compared the cost of building fibre to the node versus going all the way to the home. The member for Wentworth misuses this report and his discussions with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BT" rel="nofollow">
          BT
         </a>
         to claim that his
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTTN" rel="nofollow">
          FTTN
         </a>
         costs one-third of fibre to the home. That claim can be made only when an incumbent is building the node network. But that is not Mr Turnbull's plan.
        </p>
        <p>
         Last night on
         <i>

         , Mr Turnbull confirmed that he proposes that the government-owned
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
          NBN
         </a>
         Co. will acquire the ageing, corroding copper network from Telstra with its $1 billion a year maintenance cost. They are going to buy back the copper! Mr Turnbull should stop misleading.

           The member for Wentworth said in an address to the Broadband World Forum in Paris—what a coincidence; he must have been checking out some shares—in September last year:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           We will seek to achieve an outcome where facilities based competition is restored and enabled, not prohibited and where the provision of network services is undertaken by the private sector, not the government
          </p>
          <p>
           The Leader of the Opposition joined him in this criticism, telling the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIG" rel="nofollow">
            AIG
           </a>
           national forum in November:

            National Broadband Network
           </a>
           is a great leap backwards to the 1960s; a government controlled telecommunications infrastructure monopoly …
          </p>
          <p>
           But last night, Mr Turnbull confirmed his plan for
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
            NBN
           </a>
           to acquire Telstra's copper to build its network. So let there be no misunderstanding: NBN Co. under Mr Turnbull will be a government-owned monopoly.

             this week that he has a fully costed policy ready to go. You might ask why on earth wouldn't Mr Turnbull release it now. Why is he saying that it is going to be released closer to the election? Is it because it is taking him that long to explain it to Mr Abbott? Is it because he is having to explain to Mr Abbott—the self-confessed 'I'm not
