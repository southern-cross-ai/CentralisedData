        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHO" rel="nofollow">
         WHO
        </a>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FGM" rel="nofollow">
         FGM
        </a>
        ), including:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) FGM is defined by the WHO as ‘all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons’,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) it is estimated that FGM is practiced in 28 countries in western, eastern and north-eastern Africa, in parts of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
         Middle East

         North America
        </a>
        and Australasia, and that 100 to 140 million women and girls around the world have experienced the procedure, including 92 million in Africa,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii) that, in seven of the countries where FGM is practised, the national prevalence rate among women aged 15 to 49 is almost universal – more than 85 per cent,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iv) FGM has no known health benefits and is known to be harmful to girls and women in many different ways; it is painful and traumatic and the removal of, or damage to, healthy genital tissue interferes with the body’s natural functioning and causes immediate and long-term health consequences,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (v) in terms of impact on health:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) immediate consequences of FGM can include severe pain, shock, haemorrhage, tetanus or sepsis, urine retention, open sores in the genital region and injury to nearby genital tissue, and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) long-term consequences include recurrent bladder and urinary tract infections, cysts, infertility, an increased risk of childbirth complications and newborn deaths and the need for later surgeries; for example, the FGM procedure that seals or narrows a vaginal opening needs to be cut open later to allow for sexual intercourse and childbirth, and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (vi) FGM is a manifestation of deeply entrenched gender inequality and is recognised as a human rights abuse, and it constitutes an extreme form of discrimination against women, a violation of the rights of the child, the rights to health, life, security, physical integrity and the right to be free from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) acknowledges that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) several international and regional treaties have specifically identified FGM as being both a violation of the rights of women and girls and a form of discrimination, including the
