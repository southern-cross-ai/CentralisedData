         <i>
          The incorporated speech read as follows—
         </i>
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         It’s a disgrace that the precious time of the Parliament should be wasted on legislation such as this.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         In fact, I have to ask why such provisions in Acts are such that they require such amendment in the first place.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I would’ve thought that in this day and age, once a scheme had been legislated, sunset clauses on such routine matters would have been done away with long ago.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         There are simply better ways of doing things.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         This bill extends—yet again—the provisions of the Act for the operation of the Defence Home Owner Scheme.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         What’s more, this is the second such extension.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         And again we have the same reason.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The government is constipated and can’t get its act together.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Mr Acting Deputy President, this is not rocket science.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         It’s a simple program for ADF personnel.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         It’s been in operation for 16 years.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         But as we noted at the last time this matter was debated, it’s now quite inadequate.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         It’s also very unfair.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The review has also been years in gestation.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         That’s now apparently finished ... yet it seems to be shrouded in secrecy, like everything else.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The Minister, though, has indicated in the recent budget that a new scheme Is coming.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         If the indications are right, it looks promising.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The proposed increase in subsidy benefit levels is overdue, but will be welcome.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The ability to shop around between lenders is also a promising change.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Whether this removes the anomaly in benefits between those who purchase their own house and those who rent, is an equation we’ve not seen.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I will curtail my remarks in the interests of time, but let me make two points.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         First, the delay in getting this new scheme drawn-up and legislated is unforgivable.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         It seems to be like everything else ... way over time.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         When materiel is the issue, it affects capability.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         But here it affects people.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Our sense is that the concern for people-values in Defence and the ADF is improving. Slowly.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         That’s good.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         But wouldn’t it have been nice to have seen some swifter action here?
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Second, we know that the biggest bugbear for ADF families is the constant postings across Australia.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         So I wonder at schemes such as this and how they can be tailored to match that phenomenon.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         If we’d had access to the review we might have been enlightened a little.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         But the attitude seems to be that we in parliament get what we are given.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         No room for discussion or consideration.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I just hope that ADF people were considered a little bit more than we have been.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         We support the Bill.
        </p>
        <p>
         Question agreed to.
        </p>
        <p>
         Bill read a second time.
