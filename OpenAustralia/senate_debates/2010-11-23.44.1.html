          The
          <i>
           Age
          </i>
          on Saturday, through the work of its investigative unit and after some years of revelations related to the Securency subsidiary of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">
           Reserve Bank
          </a>
          of Australia, had the extraordinary front page information that a cache of confidential Securency documents obtained by the
          <i>
           Age
          </i>
          revealed that this
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           Reserve Bank of Australia
          </a>
          firm wired $5.8 million in suspected bribe money to a mysterious company in the Seychelles in early August last year, 10 weeks after a police investigation began into previous allegations against this Reserve Bank subsidiary. Two months later, in September, a further $1.5 million was wired by Securency to the tax haven account. The documents reveal that up to $23 million in suspected kickbacks was paid by Securency to win currency contracts in Nigeria. Further on, the article says:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          The
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RBA" rel="nofollow">
           RBA
          </a>
          has failed to respond to questions from
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age" rel="nofollow">
           The Age
          </a>
          about why it allowed the extraordinarily high-risk business practices - which should have been detected in any routine audit - to continue in the face of a police bribery investigation.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          The way Securency moved its money has been described by a government source as ‘‘a classic money-laundering technique that you expect from a sophisticated criminal syndicate, not a Reserve Bank company’’.
         </p>
         <p>
          These are extraordinary allegations, they are front page and they include comment from a government source. They should be investigated by this Senate, and I expect that the opposition and the government will support the Greens in ensuring that this investigation gets under way. The primary question here is: where is the due diligence of the Reserve Bank? It is missing.
