        In 2019 the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Government
        </a>
        made an election promise to pass religious discrimination legislative protections, in response to the recommendations of the Report of the Religious Freedom Review. The Religious Discrimination legislation will address a gap in the Commonwealth anti-discrimination framework and render it unlawful to discriminate on the basis of a person's religious belief or activity. The Religious Discrimination Bill will ensure that religious belief and activity is protected in the same manner as other existing attributes covered by anti-discrimination law, including race, age, disability and sex. The passage of the religious discrimination legislative package is a key priority for this term of government.
