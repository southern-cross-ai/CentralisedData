        My question is to the Minister for Trade and Tourism, Senator Farrell. Over the last 18 months, the Albanese Labor government has been hard at work repairing our international relationships and standing up for Australian exporters, because we know that free and fair trade is good for jobs and good for business. Yesterday, the minister accompanied the Prime Minister on an official visit to China, the first by an Australian prime minister since 2016. A key purpose of this visit was to showcase the very best of Australia's exports at the world's largest trade show, in Shanghai, while continuing to advocate for removal of outstanding trade impediments. How is the Albanese Labor government stabilising our trading relationship with China, and what benefits has it brought to Australian exporters, workers and communities?

         I thank Senator Sheldon for his question, because I know he knows just how important trade is for the continued growth and prosperity of this country. Of course, the Albanese Labor government is working hard to stabilise our relationship with China, and yesterday we took another important step in the stabilisation process when I accompanied the Prime Minister on an official visit to China. China is by far our largest trading partner, worth last year around $300 billion in two-way trade. That underlines how important this relationship is to Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         We can already see the benefits of stabilisation. We now have our timber, our barley and our hay going back into China. This means more jobs in these industries, including in Senator Sheldon's home state of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         . Last month, the Prime Minister announced we have reached an agreement with China to fast-track the review of the crippling tariffs affecting Australian wine exports. Under our watch, around 95 per cent of trade impediments, by dollar value, have been lifted. During my visit to Shanghai, I continued to advocate for the removal of outstanding trade impediments on Australian lobster and meat exporters. I also attended the world's largest trade show, in Shanghai, to showcase Australia's world-class offering in trade and tourism.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our government believes in free and fair trade. We are helping our exporters get their products back into China, because more trade means more and better-paying jobs for everyday Australian workers.

                Well, I'm about to tell you, Senator Scarr. You obviously haven't been reading the newspapers! I've been to Europe three times to progress a deal that benefits Australia's national interests. My job as Australia's trade minister is to get the best deal that we can for everyday Australians, including for our producers, our businesses, our workers and our consumers. But the deal we had on the table was not good enough, particularly for Australian farmers. Our government will continue to pursue trade agreements in the national interest to deliver benefits for everyday Australians and help our exporters diversify their trade.
