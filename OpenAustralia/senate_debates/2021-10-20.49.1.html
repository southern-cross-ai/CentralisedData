        in Parliament Week. These are incredible young people. They are our future. I have 12-year-old Leila Todd, who wants to send this message to everybody, so I will be backing Leila all the way. Leila says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am Leila Todd and I am 12 years old.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Imagine Australia in 20 years time â€¦
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There is a Treaty agreed by both the Aboriginal Elders and their communities, and the government. Aboriginal people feel respected and connected to their culture and land.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Non-Aboriginal people are learning from Aboriginal knowledge. The Aboriginal flag is owned by Aboriginal people, and they are free to use it as they wish.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia is close to recycling 100% of its waste and using 100% green energy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Whenever a new house is built, it is easier and cheaper to build with solar panels, and other renewable energy sources.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        All money that was invested in coal mining, is now put towards renewable ways to produce energy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Nothing is wasted and there is a sustainable cycle for the things we use.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In schools, students of all year levels are assessed not only on their test results, but all their other skills too. They feel they can show who they are.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There is more student choice and they are learning things that will help throughout life.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australians feel happy, healthy, safe and respected.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This is my vision.
       </p>
       <p>
        I say to Leila: please come and join me in this place, because you have more sense, vision and courage than half of the people in here. Thank you for sharing your vision.
