        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ocean" rel="nofollow">
         Southern Ocean
        </a>
        , in Australian territorial waters, documented evidence shows the Japanese whaling fleet harpooned a mother whale and her calf. It took 30 minutes for both whales to die. They drowned in their own blood. I highlight this happened in our waters and on our watch. We have a purpose-built Southern Ocean patrol vessel, the

         I thank the senator for his question, in particular given that the senator was part of the group of senators from the opposition who last night voted to disallow the temporary protection visas. There is a reason that boats are water taxis, and that is the actions of those opposite. If you had the same resolve this government has in relation to stopping the boats, questions like the one you have asked today would not need to be asked.

           I can advise the Senate as follows: the coalition is well and truly committed to the protection of whales and dolphins. This is demonstrated by the government's commitment to developing and implementing best practice management in Australian waters and strongly advocating for the protection of whales in the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Whaling_Commission" rel="nofollow">
            International Whaling Commission
           </a>
           . The coalition government committed to a $2 million whale and dolphin protection plan that includes a whale stranding action plan, a dolphin recovery plan and a national whale trail. These commitments are to be considered as part of the 2014-15 budget process, with implementation to commence in the 2014-15 financial year.
          </p>
          <p>
           In relation to the national whale stranding action plan, we will include a review of recent strandings to identify potential causes, outline best practice techniques—

            , I have a second supplementary question. On 23 August the coalition announced an election commitment that, should the whaling season continue, the coalition would send a Customs vessel to the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ocean" rel="nofollow">
             Southern Ocean
            </a>
            , because it is important that Australia have a Southern Ocean presence given the ongoing risk of confrontation between whalers and protesters. When will the coalition meet this specific election commitment and send the
            <i>
             Ocean Protector
            </i>
            to the Southern Ocean?
