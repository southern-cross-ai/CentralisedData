        I move:
       </p>
       <p>
        That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Human Services (Senator Payne) to a question without notice asked by Senator Wright today relating to comments made by the co-chair of the Review of the Australian Curriculum (Dr Donnelly).

        have always said that Dr Donnelly's radical views have made him completely inappropriate to be reviewing what Australian kids will be taught in modern Australia. Everyone is entitled to their views, but it does not mean you are entitled to be prosecuting those particular views when you are in a position of responsibility and authority and overseeing a curriculum which will be rolled out to children across Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dr Kevin Donnelly was hand-picked by Education Minister Pyne to oversee the review of the Australian curriculum. His lack of independence; his singular and intemperate views on, for instance, the role of 'politically correct' teaching of multiculturalism in the violence at the riots at Cronulla; his disparaging comments about the teaching of sex education and the way that students with same-sex attraction are dealt with in schools and the fact that sex education might acknowledge the humanity and equality of same-sex attracted students; and his suggestion that the current Australian curriculum, compiled after years of work and consultation from experts across Australia, can be described as left-wing, Marxist and 'politically correct' were all on the record before his appointment and pointed to what a completely inappropriate person he is to be independently and dispassionately overseeing the Australian curriculum. That is why the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Senate" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Senate
        </a>
        , in February, agreed to call for Dr Donnelly and his co-reviewer, Mr Ken Wiltshire, to be replaced by independent experts, as has been the practice previously in these kinds of appointments.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now we have Dr Donnelly reflecting, somewhat fondly, on the very effective role of corporal punishment when he was at school. I imagine that he was at school in the years when I was at school, in the 1960s and perhaps the 1970s. In his comments yesterday, he endorsed the use of corporal punishment if a school community is in favour of it and it is done properlyâ€”whatever that means. One wonders if in fact that might mean: so that you do not see the bruises. These comments belong to another century. They are so outdated that they are actually radical. Firstly, I think we need to make it very clear that it is absolutely not okay to assault children in Australian schools. Thank goodness we have moved beyond those values and those ideas. Secondly, there is no evidence that threatening or hurting children will actually work to make them behave better.
       </p>
       <p>
        As much as Minister Pyne may want to distance himself as far as possible from Dr Donnelly's comments, the fact is that the government appointed this man. They carefully hand-picked him for a prominent review and thus have given him legitimacy and an opportunity to broadcast his repugnant views and shape what children will be taught across Australia. They have claimed he is an education expert fit to review what our children learn. They have looked for his opinions on how schools should teach. They cannot make the excuse that they do not accept his views on school discipline.
       </p>
       <p>
        The answers that the Senate has received today from the minister representing the Minister for Education are clearly inadequate. This government has given Dr Donnelly his status, his credibility. They should remove him from his position because there is no place for violence in our schools. Every Australian child has a right to be safe at school. Indeed, as someone commented to me today, any adult in Australia who advocates or endorses violence against children is not only not fit to hold their job but not fit to oversee a review of education practice and the curriculum. Appointing Dr Donnelly shows a serious lack of judgement on the part of Minister Pyne. Right from the start it was clear that it was a partisan ideological appointment, but it is now very clear just what an inappropriate appointment it was. Minister Pyne should take responsibility for this mistake and end Dr Donnelly's contract immediately.
