        That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Finance (Senator Gallagher) to questions without notice I asked today relating to digital identity.

        If people want a taste of the dictatorship digital

         ID
        </a>
        will be used to introduce, look no further than Minister Katy Gallagher's social media posts. On Friday she took to X to announce that she was proud of introducing the digital ID bill, declaring it secure, convenient and not compulsory. Senator Gallagher's post racked up a million views, many of which were from Australians gobsmacked that the minister blocked all comments on her post. So much for this Labor government's promised accountability and transparency. I guess the minister knew that, if she allowed comments, Australians would have easily debunked the misleading claims that a digital ID would be secure and not compulsory. Despite the censorship, Community Notes—the people's fact check—were added to the post, debunking the minister's claims. These Community Notes have mysteriously disappeared and reappeared over the weekend, making us ask whether the government applied any pressure on X to have them removed. We know that the departments of home affairs and health pressured social media to remove COVID related posts. We know that the

        . It's not a stretch to imagine that the government has done the exact same thing here.
       </p>
       <p>
        The idea that the government can keep any data secure is a farce. As I illustrated in my questions, government departments are our country's most frequent perpetrators of data leaks. We know that digital ID will, effectively, be compulsory. The government says people won't be forced to have it, unless of course people want to access government services, get a driver's licence or enter some buildings. Just like the COVID jabs, digital ID won't be compulsory, they tell us, yet the government will make people get one to participate in society—to live.

        will continue fighting the dystopian digital ID and government censorship on every front.
