        <p>
         In relation to the carbon price liability, I can confirm that aluminium would be included amongst the most emissions-intensive trade exposed industries and therefore would receive the maximum amount of free permit assistance under the scheme. The advice I have is that aluminium smelters would only face an average carbon price of $1.30 per tonne of emissions for their core smelting activity. That assistance has been provided to that sector, recognising the trade exposed nature of the industry and the fact that it is emissions intensive.
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to the review, obviously I would suggest the senator look to the statements from the company which have made clear that the high Australian dollar and the low world price of aluminium are the reasons for the review of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_Henry" rel="nofollow">
          Point Henry
         </a>
         's operations. What is disappointing from the opposition, who wanted to link the Fairfax job losses to the carbon price, is that every time there is some concern about any firm in terms of its viability, given the international trading conditions it experiences, you see the opposition jumping on board not to protect jobs, not to support jobs, but to try and make a political point. They try and make a political point with the jobs of Australians. Unlike those on that side, we on this side are serious about jobs.

                 , in the time that has gone by since you ruled on Senator Ronaldson's point of order, the minister has done nothing other than comment on the point of order. That is plainly out of order for two reasons: firstly, the point of order was disposed of by you and, secondly, a critique of a point of order that has been ruled on has nothing to do with answering the question. In the eight seconds remaining, you should require the minister to address the narrow question Senator Ronaldson posed.

                   Order! I had ruled on the point of order and there is no need to debate the outcome of a point of order once the ruling has been made. I draw the minister's attention to the question. There are now eight seconds remaining to answer the question.

                     , I ask a supplementary question. Given that the government's $40 million carbon tax bailout for Alcoa will pay for its $40 million carbon tax bill, can the minister confirm how many other Australian industries could be saved from destruction if the government scrapped its carbon tax?

                      First, I do not accept the proposition in the question. I would again remind the opposition that the Treasury modelling shows that we can continue to grow the number of jobs in this country with the carbon price. The assumption in the question that the carbon price will somehow mean the end of various industries is really a reiteration of the scare campaign that Mr Abbott has been engaged in—which ranged from the carbon price being the death of the coal industry and the death of the mining sector to the town of Whyalla being wiped off the face of the Earth. I anticipate that Whyalla will still be there after 1 July. I would point the opposition to not only the increased investment in coal and mining but also the shares that some of their colleagues have invested in since the carbon price became legislation—because it flies in the face of the scare campaign.

                        Unlike those opposite, we are a government focused on protecting jobs and supporting jobs; and, unlike those opposite, we are not going to try to play politics with industries that are grappling with a high dollar and lower world prices. What is occurring is: those on that side grasp onto any commercial challenge as a result of industry's dealing with a high dollar and world prices being at lower levels, and they try to make political mileage out of it. We are the government that have seen the creation of over 800,000 jobs since we came to government. We will continue to do what we have done, which is to focus on policies which support employment. We are not going to be distracted by the sort of craven politicking around people's jobs that we see have seen from the other side.
