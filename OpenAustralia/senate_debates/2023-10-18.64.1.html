        This has been a tough six months for

        </a>
        mob. Right now, many of us are hurting. We are sad, we are angry and we are heartbroken. I want to assure you that all of these feelings are justified. We all process grief in different ways, and we are in what has been called a period of grieving.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are strong and resilient, and we will bounce back; we always do. This is just another setback in a long list of setbacks that we have endured since colonisation, but we are still here and we always will be here. We all know, too well, that we still have a lot of work to do, both in this place and out in our communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        My message for my mob out there is to take care of yourself. Take the time you need to rest and to heal. Ground yourself in your community and the places where you feel safe. Check in with one another and hold each other, as we gather ourselves together after this campaign. If needed, please call 13YARN for some support.
       </p>
       <p>
        Allies, please wear your colours; show your support. Right now, we need you to show us that you are safe and you will continue to stand with us in solidarity.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know that, for many First Nations people, this was not just a debate on constitutional recognition; it was a debate about our lives, and that is why this result has been devastating for so many of us. We will come back together, as we always do, to continue the fight for our rights, our culture and our country.
