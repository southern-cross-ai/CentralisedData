          <p class="italic">
           Less volatile market conditions, improved generation availability and higher renewable output put downward pressure on wholesale electricity prices, increased market share of lower marginal cost renewables, helped push down the wholesale electricity cost from Q2 2022, despite the quarter having the highest Q2 underlying demand recorded since 2016.

                 tor HANSON (—) (): I remind you that your state runs on solar, wind and gas. You blew up your power station in 2016. That's why your prices have actually gone up and the rest of the states have coal.

                    I've asked about what Ms Savage said, and I have a quote from her, from March of this year:
                   </p>
                   <p class="italic">
                    We have seen unprecedented volatility in our wholesale electricity markets over the last couple of years, we've had very high coal and gas prices as a result of the war in Ukraine and the recovery from the pandemic. We've also seen a number of outages in particularly old coal plants.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    She's making the point that there are a number of reasons that electricity prices are being driven up. The reality is, all of the advice to government and the data from the market as well, so not only—

                      The advice to government, very clearly, is that renewables are the cheapest form of new installed power. I would also make this point. I've looked at the electricity prices across the states, and I have to say I don't necessarily agree with the premise of your primary question.

                        This is solar, gas and coal from Australia, so stop blaming the Ukraine war for this. Under the National Electricity Rules, wind and solar operators get the same price as gas operators. They are cheaper to produce, as you declare, but are charged at a higher rate. When are you going to stop this rorting and bring electricity prices down for families and businesses?

                         , you would know that the government has already put in place measures to seek to take the edge off the electricity price increases that Australians are facing. I would make the point that, obviously, those opposite chose to vote against it. We know that that was, in effect, a vote for higher electricity prices. In relation to your point about Ukraine and Russia, we work in an international market. The price of coal and gas, even if produced in Australia, is not disconnected from the international market and the fact that supply is constrained. You may shake your head, Senator Hanson. It is not disconnected. We may be an island continent, but we work in a global market, and we are not insulated from international movements in coal and gas prices. I make the point again—the evidence shows that renewables are cheaper, and that is what the government is focused on.
