        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Sherry. Can the minister please update the Senate on how the government is helping farmers to prepare for climate change? Are there alternative approaches to this important issue?

         I welcome the question about agriculture from Labor Senator Hutchins. It is interesting to note that the Deputy Leader of the National Party, Senator Scullion, sits in this chamber. He is in fact—I do not think senators would realise—the shadow minister for agriculture. We have not had one question from the shadow minister for agriculture in six months. It has been six months and he has failed to ask a question. As we have heard from the Minister for

          Climate Change
         </a>
         and Water today, there are few bigger issues facing Australia, whether being faced by individuals, by businesses or by the whole community. But there is another important part of our nation that will face the reality of climate change perhaps harder than most, and that is Australian farmers. Let us have a look at some of the key impacts if we fail to act in this area.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Research Economics,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABARE" rel="nofollow">
          ABARE
         </a>
         , predicts Australian production of key agricultural commodities could decline by an estimated $4.2 billion in value by 2030. By 2050 that figure could double to a more than $8 billion decline in production. Australian agricultural exports of key commodities are projected to be decimated by 2030 by around $2.8 billion in today’s dollar terms. By 2050 that figure could rise to around $4 billion in export reduction.
        </p>
        <p>
         Five of our major agricultural commodities will be particularly hard hit. Wheat production could decline by about nine per cent by 2030. We have heard a lot about wheat export arrangements from the National Party, but they have not said boo about the reality facing the wheat sector: there may not be anything to export by 2030. That is how much the National Party care about this very important issue. Beef could decline by 9.6 per cent by 2030 and 19 per cent by 2050. Sheep meat exports could decline by 8.5 per cent by 2030 and 14 per cent by 2050. Dairy could decline by 18 per cent by 2050 and sugar by 14 per cent by 2050.
        </p>
        <p>
         This ABARE modelling was prepared a year ago. ABARE had no choice but to use a modelling assumption that the then Australian government, the Liberal-National coalition, would do nothing. They used a modelling assumption that the then Australian government would do nothing because that was the position of the then Liberal-National coalition government: do nothing on climate change. I have outlined the projections, the consequences of doing nothing on climate change. They ignored the facts. It is cheaper to take action on climate change than it is to do nothing. They flatly ignored the plight of our farmers. The National Party in particular have been totally silent on this issue.
        </p>
        <p>
         But we in the government are determined to honour our election commitment. We will establish a comprehensive emissions-trading scheme. We will establish that because it is important to look after and protect Australian farmers. The

         believes climate change to be possibly the biggest risk facing Australian farmers in the coming century.
        </p>
        <p>
         There has been not one question from the National Party on anything to do with agriculture in this chamber in the last six months—not one statement on the importance of tackling the issue of climate change. I have referred to the National Party as doormats, but on this issue they are literally under the doormat. You never see them; you never hear from them. They have nothing to say. They are totally irrelevant to this important future issue facing farmers in this country.
