        The Universities Accord report and the National School Reform Agreement make it clear that more needs to be done to help students from our regions finish school and consider studying at university or

         TAFE
        </a>
        . All students, regardless of whether they live in our cities, regional centres or remote communities, deserve an equal opportunity to attain a quality education.

        Last week I had the privilege of attending Biddeston State School's leadership badge ceremony. Biddeston is a small town about half an hour past Toowoomba. It has a population of around 260 people and, as is often the case in small towns like this, the local school is the vibrant centre of the community. I'd like to thank Principal Doogan for inviting me to present some of the students with their leadership badges, and I'd like to offer my congratulations again to Olivia, Denvah, Chloe, Harrison, Tenzyn, Nate and Stella, who I'm confident will make excellent school leaders. I also congratulate Ian and Mel, who received lifetime membership to the schools
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNF" rel="nofollow">

        for their contributions to the school.
       </p>
       <p>
        Following the assembly I spoke with parents and staff about how much they value their school and the role it plays in boosting community spirit in Biddeston. But many of the parents also spoke about the issues their families face when their children reach high-school age and the tough choices parents face about where their children should attend high school. Today almost half of young people in their 20s and 30s in our cities have a uni degree, but not in regional towns like Biddeston. Our plan is to bridge the educational divide. We need to reach agreements with the states about reaching full and fair funding for our schools. We've already seen, as part of the Universities Accord report, 20 extra regional university study hubs that will make a difference to access to higher education. Meaningful change will take time, but we're committed to ensuring that every Australian student has the best possible education.
