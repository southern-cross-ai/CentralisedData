        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. I refer to the code of conduct for ministers, section 1.3 part (iii), published in June 2022, personally signed by the Prime Minister, which states: 'Ministers must accept that they are accountable for the exercise of the powers and functions of their office—that is, ensure that their conduct, representations and decisions … are open to public scrutiny.' Why is the Prime Minister failing to enforce this principle, deliberately withholding draft legislation from public scrutiny and requiring nondisclosure agreements be signed before stakeholders can scrutinise these proposed laws?

         In relation to the first part of the question, yes, I acknowledge the ministerial code. I don't think the question actually went to any aspect of that other than the second part of the question, which related to draft legislation. Senator, you didn't say which draft legislation you were referring to, so I am not sure what—

             If it is the religious discrimination act—and I assume, given previous discussions, it is—the advice I have is this. Obviously there's been a long discussion on religious discrimination. Since 2016, there have been 10 inquiries, over 260 hearings and consultations, and 70,000 submissions. I understand that there have been targeted and confidential consultations, which is not an unusual process. The advice I have in the brief that I've been provided with is that no stakeholder has been asked to sign an
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDA" rel="nofollow">
              NDA
             </a>
             in relation to the religious discrimination bill. No stakeholder has been asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement. If I'm incorrect on that and on the advice I've received, I'll certainly come back to the chamber.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is a difficult bill. As you know, it has had a long period of discussion. These matters were raised by Prime Minister Turnbull, I think, originally and then by Prime Minister Morrison as well. We are conscious of the importance, on something such as religious discrimination, of trying to engage in this discussion in a way which is respectful and in which we seek to bring Australians together.
