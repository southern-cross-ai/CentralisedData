        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence. Last night I had the privilege to go and see the Australian Industry &amp; Defence Network Sovereign Capability Showcase. This event is a great opportunity for industry companies to show parliament why Australian defence technology capabilities are world-leading. The Australian Bushmaster is world-famous, but there's so much more going on. From drones all the way up to Hawkeis, we make all kinds of kit used by ADF here and overseas.
       </p>
       <p>
        I spoke to the vendors there, and, at stall after stall, I got the same message: that the Australian government is making it harder and harder for them to sell what they make. 'And why would that be?' I asked. 'Well, the government prefers to buy from foreign-owned manufacturers.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Minister, why is the Australian government making it harder for Australian defence companies to sell to the Australian government?

         Thank you, Senator Lambie, and you are right; we do need a sovereign capability in this country. The decisions we have to make are in areas we have that sovereign capability. I regret that we've seen nine years of a lot of announcements under the previous government with very little capability actually delivered. We remember there were two submarine plans that were junked over the nine-year period.

We can focus on those things that we can do well and that we must do well—those areas where you have to have the sovereign capability onshore—and that's what the government is doing. I don't know what technologies you were referring to when those companies make an assessment that they've had to go offshore because the

                        was announced the money dried up. This appears especially true of those selling to the Army. The few items that they were selling were suddenly not required. Tenders were cancelled. Our own Australian suppliers were left high and dry, often after huge amounts of money had been spent on research and development. Minister, why can't this government see that blocking innovation in the Australian defence industry is weakening our sovereign capabilities and making us less secure?

Those hard decisions in relation to some capability are made in the context of increasing allocation to other capabilities, including submarines, for the strategic reasons that the Deputy Prime Minister has outlined.
