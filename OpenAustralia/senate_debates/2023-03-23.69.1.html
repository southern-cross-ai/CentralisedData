        Protest is the language of the marginalised and those ignored by the political establishment. Protest is a tactic used by those who can't buy a political party or the decisions that they want, and by those who don't control the media.

        doesn't need to protest, but the traditional owners of lands that are slated for destruction by their open-cut mines so often do.

        doesn't need to march on the streets, but those demanding climate action from backward governments do, and are. When climate protesters take to the streets and engage in peaceful marches and blockades, it's often because they feel they have no other choice. The science is in and the world is in desperate peril. To have a safe future for themselves and for the people on the planet, they are on the streets and taking urgent action. And all too frequently they're met with violence and arrest by the police forces.

        in aid of the future of the planet that we all share, she was met with police who fabricated evidence in court in an attempt to get her a harsher sentence. But when

        and Hollywood did it, there wasn't even a peep. Climate protesters are often arrested violently, charged and refused bail. And, if they're released, they have onerous bail conditions that mean there are whole parts of our cities and states which they can't even visit.
       </p>
       <p>
        But no such conditions are imposed on violent right-wing extremists following what they may call 'protests' but which are too often direct violence and threats at marginalised communities. It isn't a protest to have hundreds of men threaten and assault a small handful of activists and allies from Community Action for Rainbow Rights. It sounds utterly terrifying. My thoughts are with those brave people who are standing up with young trans people and against hate and division. I stand with my party, the Greens, with all those in the trans community here and around Australia, and with their supporters: we have your backs.
