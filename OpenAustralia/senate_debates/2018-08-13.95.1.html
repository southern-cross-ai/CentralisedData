        , Senator Fierravanti-Wells. Could the minister please inform the Senate how the Turnbull government is addressing intergenerational welfare dependency? What measures is the government putting in place to help people get off welfare and into a job?

        <p>
         I thank Senator Colbeck for his question. The Turnbull government has a strong record in working to reduce intergenerational welfare dependency. With the proportion of working-age Australians now dependent on welfare at the lowest level in more than 25 years and strong jobs growth in the economy, we have an opportunity to make a real difference for Australians' lives and help more Australians break out of the welfare dependency mould.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Turnbull government has taken action with a number of measures, including the government's $96.1 million Try, Test and Learn Fund. Senators on this side of the chamber know that the best form of welfare is a job, and our tax cuts are designed to benefit all taxpayers, including those who move off welfare and into a job. The Try, Test and Learn Fund allows government to trial new and innovative approaches to assist some of the most vulnerable in our society into stable, sustainable employment. Tranche 1 saw 14 initiatives aimed at helping young carers, young parents and students at risk of long-term unemployment. Tranche 2 is open for application until 28 September and will build on the successes of the first tranche by investing $50 million in policy responses to support new priority groups with innovative ideas to help them become self-reliant.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government believes that all Australian taxpayers deserve tax relief. There are more jobs in our economy today than there were before. Since we came to government there have been over one million jobs created. We know that our Try, Test and Learn Fund is helping ensure that more people come off welfare.

            We are determined to continue our work to address barriers to unemployment right across Australia, including in those areas where unemployment levels are too high. As we on this side of the chamber know, supporting jobseekers to overcome substance abuse will improve their chances of finding a job and reduce the risk of ongoing welfare dependency. This is not a measure about punishing people or ripping away payments; it's about helping them to address their substance abuse and put them in a better position to come off welfare.
           </p>
           <p>
            We are also assisting with drug and alcohol treatment and ensuring that it becomes an approved activity in the job plans of jobseekers from 1 January this year. We've also introduced a bill to establish drug-testing trials. Our social security system will help the government target funding towards programs and policies that help people into education.

               The government takes efforts to reduce intergenerational welfare very seriously. We have created the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committee" rel="nofollow">
                Select Committee
               </a>
               on Intergenerational Welfare Dependence, which will inquire into these important issues and recommend options for breaking cycles of disadvantage, measuring the effectiveness of evidence based interventions, the improvement of the financial capacity and security of families, and better coordinating services between tiers of government to support families. We are determined to help Australians live a better quality of life. That is why this government is focused on providing a welfare system that supports people who are most in need of help while also focusing on the economic conditions that create more jobs in our economy and encourage people off welfare and into work. Our tax plan will benefit workers who enter the workforce.
