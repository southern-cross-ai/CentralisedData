        I'd like to speak this afternoon on the salmon industry in Tasmania and how important it is to our community and to our economy. Tasmania supplies over 90 per cent of salmon to the rest of Australia and is the largest exporter of salmon in the country. The annual total gross catch is worth over $1.075 billion, and the processed and packaged value is $1.408 billion. Furthermore, according to the salmon industry, it is due to grow to be worth more than a billion dollars annually by 2030.
       </p>
       <p>
        The salmon industry in Tasmania is such an important part of our state, and it's part of our people. It supports over 5,000 direct and indirect jobs in mostly regional Tasmania, which is good for our communities and good for our economy. Generations have worked in this proud industry, which is why I stand shoulder to shoulder with everyone who works in the salmon industry. Every Labor senator in this place, particularly my colleagues from Tasmania, believes in a sustainable salmon industry, and we do this because we know how important it is to the people of Tasmania and for the Tasmanian economy.
       </p>
       <p>
        I acknowledge the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Workers_Union" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Workers Union
        </a>
        for jumping to the defence of the Tasmanian salmon industry after it faced relentless misinformation being spread by Tasmanian conservation group Environment Tasmania and other organisations which seek to do nothing other than destroy this proud, booming industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        The salmon industry in Tasmania, as I said, is great for jobs and it's great for local economies. It's providing jobs and strengthening local economies in regional Tasmania. We will stand with the salmon industry every single day and combat the mistruths from those opposite.
