        Senators, before we move to the next matter, I indicated to the chamber earlier today that I would make a statement on events. As senators would be aware, yesterday the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_President" rel="nofollow">
         Deputy President
        </a>
        referred to me comments made by Senator Thorpe containing serious allegations about another senator. After being made aware of those comments, I contacted Senator Thorpe and, in accordance with standing order 193(3), asked her to withdraw, which I thank her for doing so swiftly last night. I contacted both senators involved and extended the opportunity to make a personal statement. I encouraged both Senator Van and Senator Thorpe to access the services of the Parliamentary Workforce Support Service, and I would urge any other senator or staff member to avail yourself of the PWSS services if you feel there are issues for you. The PWSS provides independent and confidential support to all those who work in parliament and to all parliamentary workplaces. Their specialised staff are well placed to provide trauma informed counselling, support and advice.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have heard the request from Senator Thorpe regarding additional
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCTV" rel="nofollow">
         CCTV
        </a>
        and security presence in the building. I will raise the proposal with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_House" rel="nofollow">
         Speaker of the House
        </a>
        , as we have joint responsibility for the building. At the request of Senator Van, I have also reviewed the statement given by Senator Thorpe and confirmed that it meets the requirements of the Senate standing orders.
