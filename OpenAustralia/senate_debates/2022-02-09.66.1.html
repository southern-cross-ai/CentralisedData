        My question is to the Minister for Women's Safety, Senator Ruston. Can the minister update the Senate on how the Liberal and Nationals government is ensuring support is available to victims of domestic, family and sexual violence through 1800RESPECT into the future?

        <p>
         I thank Senator Hughes for her question on this really important subject. 1800RESPECT is the national gateway for all Australians who are affected by family, domestic and sexual violence and are seeking help or assistance. It is an absolute priority of this government to ensure that this national telephone and online counselling service is of the absolute highest quality so that people who rely on it can rely on it.
        </p>
        <p>
         That's why we conducted an open and competitive procurement process to secure the next provider to deliver 1800RESPECT into the future. On 24 January this year I was pleased to announce that Telstra Health had been the successful provider. That followed a very extensive process that enabled us to come up with the strongest service solution with the capability to provide a really high quality response that was trauma informed and fit for purpose. So Telstra Health will deliver 1800RESPECT for the next five years, with the possibility of an extension. This is the first time we've put in place a five-year contract for the service so that we can make sure we have continuity and stability in the service we provide, because we know it is so important to so many Australians. Through this process, we've overhauled the funding model. It is no longer a cost-per-contact model; it's one based on the time that's needed to help the person, to make sure that 1800RESPECT is funded on the basis of user need.
        </p>
        <p>
         As our understanding of trauma and the pervasive nature of gender based violence continues to evolve, we are also ensuring that this service evolves to meet the diverse and complex needs of the people that rely on it. A staged transition will occur to make sure there is no impact on the delivery when Telstra Health take up the service provision in July.

         take this opportunity to acknowledge the work of Medibank Health Solutions and their subcontractors, who have been delivering this important commitment since 2010.

            A number of enhancements will be available into the future to ensure that 1800RESPECT meets the diverse and complex needs of the people who rely on the service. New technology is one of the key things that are going to be built into the new platform, including additional options for users so that they can use text messages or video calls. Most importantly, there is a new mechanism which means that they can transfer between devices and platforms without needing to disconnect.
           </p>
           <p>
            Follow-up on referrals, which we'll do when it is safe to do so, is also very important in ensuring that the needs that the person has sought to meet have been met in the appropriate way. The new service offering will also include supported referrals by counsellors to other appropriate supports within the broader service system. Importantly, we're acting on the advice from the sector to make sure that these technological enhancements support a tell-it-once model that minimises the need for users to continually repeat their story.

              <p>
               We all have a role in stopping sexual harassment and creating safe workplaces, and that's why we've ensured 1800RESPECT expands its service offering to provide psychological support and referrals to people affected by workplace sexual harassment. Importantly, this particular enhancement responds to recommendation 54 of the
               <i>
                Respect@Work
               </i>
               report. Our own government has agreed to or noted all 55 recommendations in the report, and our response is about creating a new culture of respectful behaviour in workplaces across the whole of Australia.
              </p>
              <p>
               It's also our priority to ensure that 1800RESPECT provides high-quality and responsive support to people who need help and information, and it's important that this includes victims of workplace sexual harassment. I'd like to take the opportunity to encourage anybody who has been impacted, or knows someone who's been impacted, by sexual assault or family violence to call 1800RESPECT, on 1800737732, or go to our website.
