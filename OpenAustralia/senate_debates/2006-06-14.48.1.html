        My question is to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Ian Campbell. I refer to the proposed

        today that the minister is refusing to release his advice to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Can the minister confirm that he has provided advice to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services? Can the minister outline the general nature of his advice to the minister? Can he inform the Senate why he will not release his advice to the public?

         The point we make is that that is in fact advice to the minister for transport, who will make a decision about the proposal. I believe that that process should be allowed to run. The point I want to make about the process for the analysis and investigation of the proposal is that it is an incredibly thorough one. It has the most detailed public consultation of any statute in the land. It is in stark contrast to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         n Labor government’s failure to do any sort of investigation into the approval of two kilns less than a kilometre away. The state Labor government approved the expansion of two kilns at an existing brickworks with no approval process whatsoever.
        </p>
        <p>
         These are brickworks with emissions that are probably five, six or seven times bigger than those in the proposal that is before Mr Truss at the moment. As I said, expansions were approved with no public consultation. That is very embarrassing for the Labor Party members here. We have subjected the proposal by the WA Airports Corporation to a thorough environmental examination. That examination has been provided to Mr Truss, and I have made it quite clear to anyone who has asked that when Mr Truss makes his decision—and that is due in the next couple of months—I expect that the report that I have provided to him will be made public. But it would be a breach of process—

I note that in fact, according to the brickworks environmental review into existing brickworks carried out by the WA Department of Environment in 2003, emissions of hydrogen fluoride, hydrochloric acid and particulates repeatedly exceeded national health and safety guidelines and that, on at least one occasion, particulates emissions were 10 times the national safe level.

                , do not enforce their own rules. They do not allow public consultation and they do not enforce their own rules. I suggest that the senator awaits Mr Truss’s decision. I am quite sure that that will be made well within the statutory time frames. I will be very happy—as long as Mr Truss is happy, and I am sure he will be—to ensure that my full report is released to the public.
