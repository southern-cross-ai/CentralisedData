              Thank you, President. I come to the Senate today to seek your support to be elected to the position of
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_President" rel="nofollow">
               Deputy President
              </a>
              of the Senate. If you were to elect me to this role, a person who identifies openly as a disabled person, it would be a historic moment.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Deputy President of the Senate is a leadership role in this place. Appointing a disabled person to this position would send a very clear message to disabled people across the country. It would send a message that disabled people belong in politics and that disabled people are able and are trusted to lead. It would send a message that this government, the opposition and the newly appointed crossbench are committed to centring disabled people and, from day one, will waste no time in breaking down the structural ableism that disabled people experience each and every day as a result of the decisions made in this place.
             </p>
             <p>
              I am proud to have the support of my Greens colleagues to put myself forward for this position today.

                I did note this morning, following the election of President, the longstanding convention as to the government of the day nominating the President and the opposition of the day nominating the Deputy President and Chair of Committees. I want to make a comment about that, because there were a couple of interjections. It's a reflection of the Westminster system. It's a reflection that, under our system, a party forms government and a party forms opposition. A party forms opposition. If somebody else formed a government or an opposition one day, the same convention presumably would apply. It reflects—

                  The Tasmanians have got the whips sewn up though! He's also served as president of the legislative council for a couple of years. I think that role, his experience in presiding in that role, has been evident in his work in this chamber. I look forward to working with you. We hope you and the President will form a very good team in the way that we've seen under previous presidents and deputy presidents, a very collegiate approach to the management of the chamber, and I look forward to your fair and inclusive chairing continuing. The government congratulates you, Senator McLachlan, and we wish you all the best in your role.
