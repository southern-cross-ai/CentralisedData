        My question is to the Minister for Finance, Senator Cormann. With the Treasurer's declaration that the age of entitlement is over, that corporate welfare is to be stopped and that auto manufacturers,

          The Commission

         of Audit is doing some very important work for the government as we set out to repair the budget mess that we have inherited from the previous government. It is important to remember that we inherited a budget situation with $123 billion worth of cumulative deficits over the forward estimates—$123 billion worth of deficits. The previous government inherited a budget in very good shape—no government net debt, a budget surplus of $20 billion, cash in the bank—and in six short years they turned that into a situation where debt is now heading for $667 billion without corrective action. The previous minister for finance presided over $107 billion worth of budget blow-outs in just the three years that she was minister. I will outline what we have done so far. We took $42 billion worth of—

              Senator Di Natale asked me about the work being undertaken by the Commission of Audit, and I was providing a very direct answer to exactly what is happening there. We did inherit a budget in a mess after six years of bad Labor government. We do have to turn a very serious situation around. What we have already done so far is implement the savings that we took to the last election. The work of the Commission of Audit will build on that. We have asked the Commission of Audit to look right across government for opportunities to improve the efficiencies of the government's operation.

                   The commitment that I can give Senator Di Natale and the chamber today is that the government is working very hard to build a stronger economy, to create more jobs and to repair the budget mess that we have inherited from the previous government. I am not going to announce here today our next budget, and no doubt Senator Di Natale would not expect us to do so. Our commitment is a stronger economy, more jobs and repairing the budget mess that we have inherited from the Labor Party with the support of the Greens. Of course, the budget will be released, in the usual course of events, on the second Tuesday in May. I commend Senator Di Natale to it.

                    seems set to proceed, will the government commit to reinvesting the proceeds of that sale into the public health system so that ordinary people's access to a doctor is protected? If not, does that mean that, with $200,000 going to a

                    firm to spruik the sale, the government cares more about spin doctors than it cares about real doctors?

                     The government cares about achieving the best possible outcomes for people across Australia. That is what we are focused on. The coalition has been committed to the sale of

                     for a very long time. It is a commercial business operating in a competitive, highly regulated environment. There is no good reason why the government should continue to own a private health fund in those circumstances. I refer Senator Di Natale also to the findings of the esteemed

                     , which indicated very clearly that the sale of Medibank Private would not lead to increases in private health insurance premiums. A highly competitive private health insurance market without the involvement of the government as a market participant will be good news for people across Australia that are privately insured. This is all part of the work that we are currently doing—
