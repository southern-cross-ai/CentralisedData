         This is only my first week, so you can imagine, Senator McGauran, that I have not yet made that many representations at all. In terms of the

         , though, the whole-of-government response and our approach to the CPRS has been about protecting jobs. That is our whole approach to it. That is why we are making a transition to a CPRS.

           At the same time as that, the government has been working with industry and with the environmental movement to get the balance right. It is not an easy thing to get the balance right because, when you talk to business, the one thing they do want in terms of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPRS" rel="nofollow">
            CPRS
           </a>
           is certainty. That is what they want. They want certainty. That is what the government is working to provide them. The current plan—and this might surprise some of the senators on the other side—actually has the support of the Business Council of Australia and the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Industry_Group" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Industry Group
           </a>
           on the one side and, on the environmental side, the

            WWF

           . So we have struck the right balance to project jobs.
          </p>
          <p>
           At the same time, this is not just about the CPRS. We are also working to create green jobs—new jobs in environmentally sustainable areas. That is the future. They are the jobs of the future. The sort of stuff you are seeing over in the United States with

            President Obama
           </a>
           is what we are working on. In my own area, the stimulus package and the energy efficiency package in relation to pink batts and gold batts will also create jobs.

                 We are obviously providing a great deal of industry assistance to ensure that companies in those exposed areas can make the transition, and that is why we are not starting this for another 12 months. It is all about jobs—that is what the government is all about; that is what our changes are about: protecting the environment, fighting climate change and at the same time making a huge reform into the future. The green jobs we talk about are something that you on the other side have no idea about.

Really they do not want to talk about fighting climate change, and there is a good reason why they do not want to talk about fighting climate change: because they do not actually believe in it. They do not believe in climate change. They do not think it has been caused by man-made effects. When you listen to some of the senators on the other side you hear them say, ‘Climate change is a natural phenomena.’
