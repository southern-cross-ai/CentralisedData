         I thank Senator Sterle for his question. The Gillard Labor government has made education and skilling of our workforce its major priority since coming to government. We have invested in education and skills right across the board, from early learning right through to postgraduate study. What that is about is making sure that every person in Australia has the chance to maximise their potential and maximise their attributes to be able to get a quality education that allows them to fulfil those talents, but also to contribute to the economy by maximising their capacity to contribute to the nation. We know that those people with higher levels of skills and education have higher incomes, better health and better life outcomes more generally. This government is investing in tertiary education and skills right across the country.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are some who would want to argue that our expansion of access to higher education is somehow lowering quality when, in fact, what we are doing is increasing access. What we are seeing in regions of Australia where young people never got the chance to go to university is that those with the capability have been allowed access. They are getting support and regional institutions are being supported to allow young people who have been discriminated against for many years because of where they live, to have access to higher education. There are 16,000 more students in regional tertiary education as a result of this government. We have also seen a 56 per cent increase in funding under this government for those regional institutions. This week I announced further investment in four regional universities to make sure that young people from across the country are getting the opportunity to gain higher skills and higher education.

          , I have a supplementary question. Is the minister aware of any community support for the government's record investments in education for Australia's future economic prosperity, unlike what we saw in the 12 years of the Howard Liberal government?

           There is broad based support for this government's investments in education and it is not just about those involved in education; it is from business, from trade unions, from local governments. People understand what the investment in education means for their communities. That is why the programs and the investment this government is making are being supported throughout the community. People know the differences they are making in people's lives. You can meet young Indigenous people, young people from lower socioeconomic areas and young people from rural and regional areas who are getting opportunities they never would have got before. More than 150,000 more students are at university and record numbers are in training because they are getting access.

               While the Commonwealth government is investing heavily at record levels in higher education and skills, unfortunately, we have seen a reduction in commitment to training and skills development in three states, Queensland, Victoria and

                New South Wales

                South Australian

               government are keeping up their level of effortâ€”what we are seeing in Victoria and New South Wales and Queensland is conservative governments closing facilities, closing courses, sacking staff and reducing opportunities for young Australians to get skills that will lead them into better jobs. The failure to maintain investment in those states is undermining the opportunities for those young people. It is undermining their capacity to go on to further tertiary education, and those states have to be held accountable for the damage the cuts are doing to the skilling and education of young Australians.
