         Bill
        </a>
        2017 will help in our fight to manage biosecurity risks and further strengthen Australia's biosecurity system.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A strong biosecurity system contributes to a strong economy. Our agricultural industries are forecast to earn $60 billion in 2016-17.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Today threats to our biosecurity can emerge faster than ever before. The recent global outbreak of Zika virus, spread by mosquitoes, has shown us how important control of disease-carrying pests is.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill will provide additional powers to control exotic mosquitoes and other disease carriers at Australia's airports and seaports, including on incoming aircraft and vessels.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This includes spraying insecticide to kill mosquitoes capable of carrying Zika virus as well as other disease-carrying vectors so they don't establish populations in Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill gives us the ability to direct airports and seaports to control such incursions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill will strengthen Australia's ability to manage ballast water in ships. It will provide additional protection for fisheries and coastal environments from the risk of marine pest incursions by fostering new, more effective, ballast water treatment technologies, and phasing out ballast water exchange.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill will position us to ratify the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Convention was adopted in 2004 and signed by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Howard Government
        </a>
        in 2005. It is a key international measure for protecting marine environments. It aims to stop the global spread of potentially invasive and harmful aquatic organisms that can cause havoc to marine ecosystems. These organisms can be transported in the ballast water of ships travelling around the world and can effect biodiversity and lead to substantial economic loss to our maritime industries.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Convention" rel="nofollow">
         The Convention
        </a>
        is an important global initiative involving over fifty countries. It will come into force internationally on 8 September 2017 and we hope to ratify it this year.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For Australians more broadly, these amendments mean there is much less risk of infection with viruses such as Zika. It also means we can continue to enjoy the sea and all the joy that it brings us.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Strengthening Australia's biosecurity system through these legislative amendments means we can continue to enjoy our unique environment, and way of life.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ordered that the resumption of the debate be made an order of the day for a later hour.
