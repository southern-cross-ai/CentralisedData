        My question is to the Minister for Trade and Tourism, Senator Farrell. Tourism is vital to communities across Australia, particularly in regional economies, where hundreds of thousands across the country are employed in that industry, including in my home state of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        . Workers in the industry who keep the industry going are often on lower and middle incomes. Can the minister outline to the Senate how Labor's cost-of-living tax cuts will help workers in Australia's tourism and hospitality industry?

         I thank Senator Sheldon both for the great work he does in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         , as a New South Wales Senator, and for the particular interest that he takes in the tourism industry. I can answer this question. Under Labor's tax cuts, every Australian taxpayer gets a cut. That's 13.6 million Australians from 1 July with more money in their pockets. In fact, in Senator Sheldon's home state of New South Wales, 83 per cent of taxpayers will receive an even bigger tax cut.
        </p>
        <p>
         Many of those getting bigger tax cuts will be the hundreds of thousands of Australians who work in the tourism industry. The tourism sector supports Australian jobs in a range of industries, from accommodation and food services to the arts, recreation, aviation and events. That includes the cleaners in hotels in Sydney, waiters at restaurants in Melbourne, tour guides in national parks like Kakadu, boat crews on our
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef" rel="nofollow">
          Great Barrier Reef
         </a>
         , and cellar door staff at fantastic wineries in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         . Many young Australians work in the tourism industry, and Labor's tax cuts are good news for them, with 1.5 million Australians aged 18 to 24 benefiting from an average tax cut of $1,007. More than half, 55 per cent, of workers in tourism jobs are women, who, under the Labor tax cuts, are going to be an average of $1,649 a year better off.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Australian tourism industry and its workers have done it tough in recent years.

          <p>
           Thank you, Minister, for your answer. I think the fact that 83 per cent of taxpayers will be better off is going to make a real difference to cost-of-living pressures. Can the minister update the Senate on what other work the Albanese Labor government is doing to support the tourism industry, including to grow and strengthen the industry's workforce?

We have delivered the Choose Tourism Grant Program to attract more workers to the sector. They will now get a bigger tax cut thanks to this government. We have also funded

Eligible operators can now apply to the $10 million Tourism Exceptional Assistance Grants Program, aimed at businesses suffering exceptional impacts due to flooding caused by

                 . We're also supporting discounted flights, vouchers and a major campaign, launched on Saturday, to market Tropical North Queensland holidays. These are just some of the support measures that we are delivering to help tourism businesses in Tropical North Queensland to get through the tough times.
