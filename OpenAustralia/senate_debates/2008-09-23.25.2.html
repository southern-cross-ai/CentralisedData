         I thank Senator McGauran for that question, which he got to belatedly. Senators in this chamber would be aware, because we have mentioned this occasionally in the last six months, not in the last few days, that this is a very difficult period for global financial markets. I know that it catches those opposite by surprise, because each day there is a movement they get caught on the different side of the argument. We have seen the fourth largest investment bank in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
          US
         </a>
         go bankrupt and the third largest bought out by the Bank of America. We have seen the world’s largest insurer requiring an $85 million lifeline from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Federal_Reserve" rel="nofollow">
          US Federal Reserve
         </a>
         . We saw share markets last week fall significantly, although we have seen some recovery. So each day as things go up and down the opposition keeps getting caught on the wrong side of the argument. They do not have any economic policy that is responsible. They are engaging in cheap shots on a daily basis and it does not matter if they become contradictory.

         Earlier I heard an interjection about how well qualified the member for Wentworth is to make commentary on these issues. The member for Wentworth helped bring us the

          , I rise on a point of order in relation to relevance. The question was very specific: how does cutting $6 million a year out of the budget for ASIC assist it to properly do its job at this time of global financial crisis? Well may Senator Conroy talk about the member for Wentworth and other people, but it is absolutely and utterly irrelevant to the question that was asked. I remind you of the powers that you do have under standing order 196 to sit down a senator for repeated irrelevance.

            Mr President

           : what we now have the opposition doing is providing their question again, attaching the word ‘relevance’ to it in the hope that it gets heard for a second time, then adding commentary to it. It is impermissible to do that. They should state whether it is relevant or not and their argument for that without raising the question again. I humbly submit that there is no point of order that has been raised by Senator Abetz because he has, again, just simply reiterated the question and attached the word ‘specific’ to it. Senator Conroy can provide a broad answer in respect of this question and he is relevant to the question and on point, I would humbly submit.

            There is no point of order and, as I have said before, in keeping with precedence in this place I cannot instruct a minister how to answer the question. I draw the minister’s attention to the question and I draw the minister’s attention to the fact that there are still two minutes and six seconds to remain relevant to the question.

             . I did note that the question specifically referred to the global financial turmoil and Australia’s responses to it, so I think that I am perfectly entitled to discuss all of the question, not just the one bit that those opposite choose to try to put an emphasis on. I thank you for your ruling because what I was discussing before this spurious point of order was the role of the merchant banking industry. There is now a new Leader of the Opposition who proudly claims his economic credentials as a merchant banker. It is the very merchant banking industry which has brought the world’s global financial sector to its knees. Even today, the last two remnants,

              , on a point of order: the point about the question and the point about relevance is that Senator Conroy was asked to address himself to the resourcing capacity of ASIC. He has not, so far, brought himself to that, and he was also, I think—and I may have needed to raise this a little earlier—getting very close in his earlier comments to a personal reflection on the integrity of the member for Wentworth. He may not have intended that, but it is certainly appropriate—

                My point was that in his earlier remarks Senator Conroy, if I heard him correctly, did say that the member for Wentworth had brought the insurance industry to its knees and was involved in litigation to that end. That is getting very close to reflecting on the member, and that is certainly not permissible within the rules. But my particular point of order is: would you,

                  have abandoned the merchant banking industry today. They have disowned merchant banking. So, as those opposite are proudly making claims about the qualifications to run the economy of the member for Wentworth, his own industry has abandoned ship, and those opposite are interested in nothing more than cheap point-scoring. They criticised the Prime Minister—

If they want to take relevant points of order, they can take those, but what we now have demonstrated for us is that the Liberals are choosing to use language that is bordering on unparliamentary in this place. I would ask you, Mr President, to reflect upon the point of order that has just been taken. It should be maintained, at least, what the relevance is of the issue being raised, but unfortunately we now have the Liberals degenerating into a farcical position. I would ask you to rule accordingly.
