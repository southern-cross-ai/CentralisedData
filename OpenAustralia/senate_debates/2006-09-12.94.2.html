        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That the Senate take note of the document.
       </p>
       <p>
        Because of the size of this report and the fact that it has only been tabled today, I will speak further on it later, but, given the recent increase in the amount of public debate about housing affordability, I think it is worth drawing attention to it. I very much welcome the fact that there is some wider public debate about the problem with housing affordability in Australia. It is very timely to have this report on the Housing Assistance Act and the annual report for the last financial year. It has appeared more quickly than previous reports—although it is still more than a year past the relevant financial period—and that slight increase in speed should be noted.
       </p>
       <p>
        When we are having these debates—and I hope that we continue to have debates about how to make housing more affordable and more secure in Australia—it should also be emphasised that it is not just a matter of interest rates. It is fine to recognise the role that interest rates can play—and we all make our political points about who has the best or worst record on interest rates—but interest rates are just one component of the housing market and the different types of housing available in Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        This report goes to the operation of the Commonwealth-state housing agreement, which basically deals with public and community housing. The level of political attention to this area of housing is, sadly, very much diminished at state level as well as at federal level in recent years. It is now seen almost as a subsidiary welfare housing approach and as playing a residual role. I believe that is a great shame, because it has shifted from an era when it played a much more central role—although not sufficient in its own right, as no specific model is sufficient in its own right—in ensuring that Australians have the opportunity to afford a roof over their heads and, without chewing up the vast majority of their incomes, just keeping themselves in a home. We must continue to remember that, first and foremost, housing, as a policy issue, should be about ensuring that all Australians have access to secure, safe and appropriate housing.
       </p>
       <p>
        As housing also is an investment for many, it is appropriate to have a debate on the wider issues of people’s rights and opportunities but the value and the direction of the property market should not take priority over the core issue of affordable housing. The property market itself, of course, particularly inasmuch it relates to the private rental sector, also has a role to play. So, not having had time to study the report in detail, I simply welcome the fact that it shows the important role that public and community housing does still play and that that should be a part of any proper systematic debate about affordable housing in Australia.
       </p>

        We saw the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Productivity Commission
        </a>
        bring down recommendations following our inquiry into the affordability of housing for first home owners a year or two back. We have seen the Treasurer repeatedly complain in recent times that the states did not pick up any of the recommendations of that report. He was perhaps right to point to that failure but, as he conveniently neglected to mention, nor did the federal government pick up any of the recommendations of that report that affected the federal sphere. It is time we moved past this selective blame-shifting and buck-passing approach to affordable housing and looked at all aspects of housing provision. That should include more attention being given to the very efficient role that public and community housing can play in ensuring affordable housing. I seek leave to continue my remarks.
       </p>

        Leave granted; debate adjourned.
