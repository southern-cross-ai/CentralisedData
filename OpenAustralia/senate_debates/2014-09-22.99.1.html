         I thank the senator for the question. I thank him for his continued interest in Aboriginal and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">

         affairs.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is a quiet revolution going on in my portfolio. Senators will recall that the government had consolidated 150 separate policies and services into five program areas within a new Indigenous advancement strategyâ€”the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAS" rel="nofollow">
          IAS
         </a>
         . The five programs are: jobs, land and economy; children and schooling; safety and wellbeing; culture and capability; and remote Australia strategies.
        </p>
        <p>
         The IAS provides $4.8 billion in funding over four years for organisations delivering services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It was announced in the budget that organisations which had a reasonable expectation of funding continuing into this financial year would have their funding extended either six or 12 months. And that happened. The next major step is an open funding round, which opened on 8 September and continues until 17 October. This funding round will fund activities from 1 January 2015 and, in some cases, over the next three years.
        </p>
        <p>
         Priority will be given to applications which can demonstrate tangible outcomes on the ground. Particular priority will be given to those applications for funding which can demonstrate the support of government's key objectives in Indigenous affairs: getting children to school, getting adults into work, and ensuring communities are safer. My department is now out in communities, talking with service providers and stakeholders, explaining the new arrangements, and working with them to ensure that applications for funding reflect the needs of communities and that local solutions are tailored and funded to provide for local problems.

           Those opposite should be interested in this because it is in stark comparison with what they have provided. One simple application for funding activities across five program streams I outlined earlier is part of this government's determination to reduce red tape, cut duplication and inefficiency, and ease the administrative burden on organisations delivering services on the ground. There has been, in the past, too much bureaucracy in those opposite's old system. For example, 820 Indigenous organisations funded under just one department's grant system were required to submit 20,671 performance, financial and acquittal reports in 2010-11. Organisations funded to deliver a better outcome on the ground should be able to get on with the job of improving the circumstances of our first Australians. They should not be required to fill out endless reports against multiple contracts.

             I am happy to inform the Senate that this government is determined to help these organisations focus on good governance. It is important to ensure that the funds that are earmarked to drive outcomes on the ground actually deliver results.

            <p>
             Under the Indigenous Advancement Strategy, any organisation receiving more than half a million dollars in funding through my portfolio is required to be incorporated under Commonwealth legislation. For Indigenous organisations, that generally means incorporation under the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporations_Act" rel="nofollow">
              Corporations Act
             </a>
             or under the Aboriginal and
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
              Torres Strait Islander
             </a>
             Act. Other organisations will be required to be incorporated under the Corporations Act. Whilst some exemptions may apply, I am determined to ensure that every dollar of funding through the Indigenous portfolio meets the objective it is intended to. Our focus is on delivering real outcomes to improve the circumstances of our first Australians, particularly in getting kids to school, adults into work and making sure that communities are safe.
