        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Evans. I refer the minister to the fact that the Prime Minister has not visited Queensland in more than four months, notwithstanding the occurrence of severe natural disasters including major flooding in south-west Queensland and the small matter of an upcoming state election. Can the minister confirm when the Prime Minister next plans to visit Queensland? Will she be attending the Labor Party state campaign launch in coming days, or has she been asked by the Premier, Ms Bligh, to stay away for the damage that her presence may do to Labor's already toxic reputation?

             All I can say is that it is clearly a stupid question. I am advised that the Prime Minister was in the company of Senator
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnaby_Joyce" rel="nofollow">
              Barnaby Joyce
             </a>
             , the Nationals leader, within the last couple of weeks discussing the flood situation at a meeting in St George. I certainly remember seeing some coverage of that.
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_I" rel="nofollow">
              If I
             </a>
             am wrong, I will correct the record. But it seems to me, Senator Brandis, that your question is misplaced and perhaps you ought to take the opportunity to ask Senator Joyce whether or not that is correct. And if you have misled the Senate in your question, obviously you will be correcting the record as well.

                    The federal government has forwarded the latest instalment of its $5.6 billion funding package to Queensland, as flood recovery efforts continue …
                   </p>
                   <p class="italic">
                    Speaking in the Queensland town of St George, Prime Minister Julia Gillard said the government had been making sure that money was continuously available to flood-hit areas of Queensland.

                    That was a report of 11 February. So the slur contained in the primary question, it seems, is wrong, and I remind those opposite that they refused to support the funding package designed to give relief to Queensland residents following the floods last year. That is how concerned they were.

Is she doing her friend a favour by staying away from the Queensland Labor campaign launch, or does she plan to do her friend a favour by keeping her profile at the Labor campaign launch as low as possible and leaving as quickly as possible?

                       opposition had the option today of asking an accurate question focused on the concerns of those affected by the floods, or they had the option of trying to smear the Prime Minister and take no interest in those people who have been affected by the floods. They chose the second path. It is embarrassing to see the lack of interest in the people of Queensland, the lack of interest in the impact of the floods on those people and the attempt to try and slur the Prime Minister inaccurately, when she was in Queensland with Senator

                       focused on the needs of those people. I would remind those opposite that when it came to helping the Queensland people, when it came to passing the levy to support investment in Queensland to rebuild, they opposed it. That is how interested they were. Their answer was, 'Add it to the $70 billion black hole we have already got.' We refuse that. We are interested in the people of Queensland.
