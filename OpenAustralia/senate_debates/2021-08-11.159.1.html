        This Bill makes a number of changes to tax laws to implement reforms to the administration and oversight of organisations with deductible gift recipient (

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmful_Tax_Practices" rel="nofollow">
         Harmful Tax Practices
        </a>
        in 2018.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Schedule 1 to the Bill amends the
        <i>
         Income Tax Assessment Act 1997
        </i>
        (1997 tax law) to require non-government entities seeking endorsement as a DGR to be a charity registered with the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission or be operated by a registered charity. Ancillary funds and specifically listed entities will be exempt from this requirement.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The requirement to be a charity already applies to the majority of the general DGR categories in Subdivision 30-B of the 1997 tax law. This measure will amend the special conditions applying to the remaining general DGR categories, requiring non-government entities to maintain charity registration in order to retain their eligibility for DGR endorsement.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The amendments include a 12 month transition period which will provide non-charity DGRs with the time to meet the requirements for charity registration without losing DGR status. Eligible DGRs may also have access to an additional three year transition period.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This measure will improve the consistency of regulation, governance and oversight of DGRs, in turn helping to support continued confidence in the sector and public support for DGR entities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Schedule 2 to the Bill contains amendments to the
        <i>
         Income Tax Assessment Act 1936
        </i>
        that remove the preferential tax treatment provided for Offshore Banking Units (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBU" rel="nofollow">
         OBU
        </a>
        s) and provide transitional arrangements for existing OBUs.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The OBU regime is a concessional tax regime that can be used by the Australian financial services sector to provide banking services to offshore customers. The regime provides a concessional 10 per cent tax rate and an exemption from interest withholding tax for OBU activity.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In October 2018, the OECD's Forum on Harmful Tax Practices found that Australia's OBU regime contains harmful features. As a result, the Treasurer announced on 26 October 2018 that the Government would seek to address these concerns. The OBU regime has been closed to new entrants since the Treasurer's announcement.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Existing participants operating within the OBU regime will continue to access the concessional tax rate for a period of two years - up to the end of the 2022-23 income year.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        will use this time to consult with industry on alternative measures to support the industry and ensure activity remains in Australia once the two year grandfathering period ends.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Timely passage of this Bill will allow the OECD to confirm that Australia has amended the OBU regime to ensure that it is not a harmful tax practice.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Full details of the measure are contained in the Explanatory Memorandum.
