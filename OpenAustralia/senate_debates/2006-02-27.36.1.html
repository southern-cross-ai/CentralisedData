        My question is to Senator Minchin, the Minister representing the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister and Treasurer say that immigrants and dual citizenship holders should abide by Australian values or be kicked out. What specifically are those Australian values?

         I thank Senator Allison for her question. I think that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer and other government spokesmen have merely said what is the consensus view of all Australians: that when migrants come to this country and seek to become, and do become, Australian citizens they should abide by the general rules that govern this great country. Those general rules essentially are: a commitment to our liberal democracy, a commitment to pluralism and a commitment to abiding by the general rule of law. It is a fact that in Australia, as a long part of the Western tradition, there is a separation of church and state and, while as a proud pluralist country we respect the rights of everyone to honour their faiths, we do seek to ensure that we eliminate extremism in Australia and that we do ensure that everybody, no matter what their faith, their background or their originating culture, does abide by the fundamentals that make this one of the great democratic nations of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is one of the freest, most democratic and most successful nations ever crafted by humankind. We are all proud of that. That is why this nation is such a magnet for migrants from all over the world. There are many more people wishing to come to Australia than it is possible for us to accept in any given year. Under our government, we have substantially increased the migration program. We have unashamedly changed the emphasis from simply family reunion to skills, because we do believe that, given the extraordinary worldwide demand to become an Australian, we are in a position where we can say to prospective migrants, ‘We welcome you, but we do put a premium on you bringing to this country those skills which this country needs and which will ensure that you can make a positive and strong contribution to the success of this nation.’
        </p>
        <p>
         I think that ordinary Australians understand what it is that makes this country strong and what unites us, and that is the sorts of freedoms and tolerance and respect for the rule of law which are the Australian values that the Prime Minister and Treasurer were referring to. Part of that mosaic is tolerance of difference and, as a government, we want to ensure that we maintain that tolerance. But we are quite unashamedly saying that extremism is not part of the normally regarded view of what it is to be Australian and that leaders in all communities should do their utmost to eliminate extremism from their communities.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Minister, as the government already deports immigrants who go to prison for offences against the law, and this is decided by the courts, will there be a new set of values laws just for immigrants and, if so, who will decide that those laws have been breached? Will the government also abide by the new values laws itself or will they only apply to the 42 members of parliament in Australia who have been born overseas? Isn’t this just another example of the government dog whistling and an ongoing cynical attempt to divide Australians, this time with Muslim people the victims?

           There are no new values laws. I do not know what Senator Allison is talking about. We unashamedly say that Australian citizenship is one of the most prized possessions anyone on this planet can have. To become an Australian citizen is a magnificent thing and something that all recipients should value and respect. They should uphold the pledge they make when they become Australian citizens and not act contrary to the laws of this country and the values that it represents.
