        (3) The committee shall scrutinise each instrument as to whether:

       <p>
        (a) it is in accordance with its enabling Act and otherwise complies with all legislative requirements;
       </p>
       <p>
        (b) it appears to be supported by a constitutional head of legislative power and is otherwise constitutionally valid;

        (h) it trespasses unduly on personal rights and liberties;

        (j) it contains matters more appropriate for parliamentary enactment; and

       </p>
       <p>

       </p>
       <p>
        (5) The committee may, for the purpose of reporting on its terms of reference, consider any proposed or draft legislative instrument, including an exposure draft of such an instrument.

           I'd like to make clear what the Labor Party's position is on this matter. The
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Committee" rel="nofollow">
            Standing Committee
           </a>
           on Regulations and Ordinances is one of the Senate's oldest and most respected committees. It has always operated as a technical, nonpartisan scrutiny committee, responsible for scrutinising delegated legislation made by the executive branch of the government. The committee ensures, on the Senate's behalf, that executive-made laws comply with the fundamental principles of parliamentary supremacy and the rule of law. This notice of motion proposes amendments to the standing orders in accordance with these principles and the unanimous recommendations of the committee's 2019 inquiry report. On 31 July 2019 the committee agreed to lodge this notice of motion while providing for it to be considered this month to allow the Senate time to consider the proposed changes in detail before it was considered on the floor of the chamber. It's unprecedented that the chair of this committee be denied leave by the government in the way which has occurred today, so, on behalf of Senator Fierravanti-Wellsâ€”
