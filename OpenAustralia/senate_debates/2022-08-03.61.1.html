       <p>
        Earlier this week, I spoke about the retirement of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flinders_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Flinders Council
        </a>
        mayor, and today I'd like to acknowledge the mayor of another idyllic Tasmanian island, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Island" rel="nofollow">
         King Island
        </a>
        , Mrs Julie Arnold. Mrs Arnold recently announced that she would not recontest her position as mayor and councillor in the October council elections. Julie and her husband, Charles, have sold their property on the island and plan to build a new home on King Island in the near future. But, first, they'll spend an extended period travelling Australia and researching alternative construction options, like pods or containers for their new home.
       </p>
       <p>
        Elected to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Island_Council" rel="nofollow">
         King Island Council
        </a>
        in 2018, Mrs Arnold was initially appointed as deputy mayor. She took on the role of mayor in 2019 after being elected unopposed, and she was the first woman to serve as King Island's mayor. Mrs Arnold's term as mayor was punctuated by COVID-19 and the impact of this pandemic on the small island community, but she is confident she leaves the council with processes in place for King Island to successfully live with the virus.
       </p>
       <p>
        The aspect Mrs Arnold considers her main achievement is restructuring the committee work of councillors to match their individual strengths. This work was matched to the key issues councillors championed, like shipping, youth, sport or tourism, and she hopes the framework will continue in successive councils.
       </p>
       <p>
        I met with Mrs Arnold in May, and she spoke about her desire to see a shipping solution develop for King Island's future which includes a wharf for roll-on roll-off ships, a direct route to Victoria and a plan for small cruise ships that extend beyond day trips. She's also hopeful of positive results from the reopening of the King Island Scheelite tungsten mine and the council's $830,000 telecommunications investment to improve connection on the island.
       </p>
       <p>
        Enjoy your well deserved break and travel, Julie. We look forward to welcoming you back to Tasmania to build your new King Island home soon.
