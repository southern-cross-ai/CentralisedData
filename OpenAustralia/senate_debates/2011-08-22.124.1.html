      <p class="italic">
       To the Honourable President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       This petition by formulated by the nascent Australian Doctors Union representing it membership.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       That we are aware that hundred of doctors have been seriously penalized, medical practices closed, and consulting hours seriously reduced by the apparently arbitrary use of the audit and investigative powers of Medicare Australia and its associated entities Professional Services Review (PSR), the Determining Authority (DA) and the Medicare Participation Review Committee (MPRC) in the absence of meaningful medical accountability of the PSR instrument and in real and present peril of denial of natural justice under its jurisdiction. The PSR determination may be so misconstrued as to fly in the face of all relevant specialist and expert opinion, substantially due to over-reliance on non-evidenced based medicine and on uninformed statistical analysis resulting in significant damage to the individual doctor, the medical profession and the delivery of quality medical services to the Australian public:
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       We the undersigned would therefore respectfully request that the Senate takes urgent steps to:
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       (1) Conduct a Full Senate Enquiry into all operating procedures relating to Medicare / PSR / DA / MPRC audit processes for evidence of nett value to our community with all due speed;
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       (2) Halt prosecutions currently underway at whatever stage of development by such bodies to be curtailed immediately pending the outcomes and findings of such enquiries.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       We the undersigned support this petition:
      </p>
      <p>
       by Senator Back (from 1,986 citizens).
      </p>
      <p>
       Petition received.
