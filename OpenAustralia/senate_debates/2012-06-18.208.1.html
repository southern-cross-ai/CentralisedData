        () (): On behalf of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Joint_Committee_on_Intelligence_and_Security" rel="nofollow">
         Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security
        </a>
        , I present the report entitled
        <i>
         Review of the re-listing of Ansar al-Islam,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Movement" rel="nofollow">
          Islamic Movement
         </a>
         of Uzbekistan, Jaish-e-Mohammad and Lashkar-e-Jhangvi as terrorist organisations.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p>
        Ordered that the report be printed.
       </p>
       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the Senate take note of the report.
       </p>
       <p>
        I can inform the Senate that the current regulations were signed by the Governor-General on 8 March 2012. They were tabled in the House of Representatives and the Senate on 13 March 2012. The disallowance period of 15 sitting days for the committee's review of the listing began from the date of the tabling. Therefore, the committee was required to report to the parliament by today. In fact, it was perhaps by earlier than today. When one starts to do the mathematics, it may well have been 29 May 2012. Nevertheless, I am speaking today.
       </p>
       <p>
        For the benefit of the Senate, I take this opportunity to outline some information very briefly on each of these organisations. I will also report to the Senate on the findings of the committee in relation to the four organisations.
       </p>
       <p>
        In relation to Ansar al-Islam, or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAI" rel="nofollow">
         AAI
        </a>
        , as it is known, it plans and conducts attacks against foreign forces, Shia, Kurdish and Iraqi government interests. AAI's attacks most commonly target
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        and Iraqi security forces in Iraq using improvised explosive devices, or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IED" rel="nofollow">
         IED
        </a>
        s as we know them in the Senate, and indirect fire attacks.
       </p>
       <p>
        The statement of reasons lists over 50 attacks for which AAI has indicated responsibility by posting a video or media statement in the period since the last review. Their methods have included assassinations, the use of small arms, thermal grenades and IED and mortar attacks against Iraqi police and military personnel and also against US military patrols bases and vehicles.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee does not recommend disallowance of the regulation in relation to Ansar al-Islam.
       </p>
       <p>
        The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Movement_of_Uzbekistan" rel="nofollow">
         Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan
        </a>
        , or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMU" rel="nofollow">
         IMU
        </a>
        , is a militant Islamic group based and operating in Central and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia" rel="nofollow">
         South Asia
        </a>
        . The group established relations with the Taliban and al-Qaeda and allegedly became extensively involved in narcotics trafficking. One of its founders, Namangani, was killed during the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, and the remnants of the IMU fled across the border to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federally_Administered_Tribal_Areas" rel="nofollow">
         Federally Administered Tribal Areas
        </a>
        of Pakistan. Although its capabilities were severely degraded, the following years saw the IMU regroup in the south of Waziristan area of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, where it established close links to a number of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistani_Taliban" rel="nofollow">
         Pakistani Taliban
        </a>
        groups and reportedly participated in cross-border attacks on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Security_Assistance_Force" rel="nofollow">
         International Security Assistance Force
        </a>
        in Afghanistan.
       </p>
       <p>
        Notwithstanding increased pressure from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISAF" rel="nofollow">
         ISAF
        </a>
        and Pakistani security forces, reports throughout 2010 indicated that the IMU had re-established an operational presence in northern Afghanistan, and the group also claimed responsibility for a series of attacks in Tajikistan. The committee again does not recommend disallowance of the regulation in relation to the IMU.
       </p>
       <p>
        In relation to Jaish-e-Mohammad, the statement of reasons indicates that that organisation is based in Pakistan and operates primarily in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Administered_Kashmir" rel="nofollow">
         Indian Administered Kashmir
        </a>
        . Jaish-e-Mohammad operatives have been involved in attacks against civilian and military targets in Afghanistan, India and Pakistan. The organisation's attacks have included suicide bombings in 2001 and 2003, with most attacks since that time involving grenades and firearms. Jaish-e-Mohammad continues to concentrate its efforts against Indian security forces, both military and police, and also against government installations and civilians in the disputed territory of Indian Administered Kashmir. In addition, Jaish-e-Mohammad has broadened its operational focus to join the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_Taliban" rel="nofollow">
         Afghan Taliban
        </a>
        in attacks against government and coalition forces in Afghanistan. Again, the committee does not recommend disallowance of the regulation in relation to Jaish-e-Mohammad.
       </p>
       <p>
        With Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, Jane's Terrorism and Insurgency Centre states that its activities have been curbed following the arrest of key leaders and the particular focus of the military and police authorities on the group, resulting in the arrest of hundreds of activists. Following the killing of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in May of last year, the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi vowed to conduct a series of retaliatory attacks. To this end, a spokesman for the organisation, identifying himself as Ali Sher Haidri, released a statement in mid-May 2011 threatening to avenge bin Laden's death by targeting not only government ministers and security force personnel but also
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Muslims" rel="nofollow">
         Shia Muslims
        </a>
        from the ethnic Hazara community in Pakistan. The Lashkar-e-Jhangvi followed through with these threats with a series of significant attacks in and around Quetta between May and July 2011. The statement of reasons lists 12 acts of terrorism attributed to or suspected of being perpetrated by the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi. Again the committee does not recommend disallowance of the regulation in relation to Lashkar-e-Jhangvi.
       </p>
       <p>
        I take, as we always do, the opportunity of speaking to these matters briefly to thank the chair, deputy chair and members of the committee for their work in reviewing these and other terrorist organisations. And as is traditionally the case, I thank the committee secretariat, the secretary of the committee and the staff of the committee, for their work. Finally, I commend this report to the Senate.

        Question agreed to.
