        I rise today to talk about the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Adelaide" rel="nofollow">
         Port Adelaide
        </a>
        Football Club, a club that is so much more than a football club; it is a core part of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         South Australian
        </a>
        community and is a rich contributor to that community. They have a proud history of supporting community by investing in development and education programs that use the power of elite football to promote meaningful social change. Their programs are designed to empower communities in need and address a series of social issues through working with community and investing in community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am very, very proud to stand here today to talk about the fact that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Adelaide_Football_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Port Adelaide Football Club
        </a>
        has come out with a statement to wholeheartedly support the recognition of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations
        </a>
        people in the Constitution. It is great to see a football club like Port Adelaide who do walk the talk, who do spend their time investing in the young people of our community, in the First Nations people in our community and in addressing some of the deep scarring issues in our society. I will read a little of their statement:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The club has deliberately undertaken an approach of listening and learning around the matters outlined in the upcoming referendum including establishing a First Nations Advisory Committee, comprising of past and current First Nations staff and players as well as community leaders.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We are proud of our ongoing role in advocating and facilitating meaningful and ongoing change for First Nations people and communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        They go on to recognise everyone's 'right to make their own decision'. I stand here today being so terribly proud of their standing up for this important issue.
