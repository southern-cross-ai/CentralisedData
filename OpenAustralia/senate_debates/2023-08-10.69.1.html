        I rise to make a contribution on the Export Control Amendment (Streamlining Administrative Processes) Bill 2022 on behalf of the shadow agriculture minister and as a very proud National and someone who wants to see a sustainable and prosperous agriculture industry in this country, because it's not just the backbone of our country but the backbone of the regions.
       </p>
       <p>
        But before I go to the most substantive contribution and as our chemists here leave the Senate chamber, we're having to watch a Labor Party who have been willing to turn their backs on health provisions in rural and regional Australia on the back of their 60-day dispensing legislation. They got it wrong. We have tried to say: 'Go back to the drawing board. Consult with local pharmacists. Understand how we can get the cost-of-living pressure increase relief through the dispensing arrangements but also not see a diminishing of healthcare professional services in our local regional communities.' What they are telling us is, as a result of the government's regulation in regard to this, they are going to have to lay off staff. They are going to have to minimise their hours. Webster-paks to our aged-care facilities in rural and regional communities are on the line. I could go through other things like immunisation programs, which are currently run in all local chemists right across the country. That might not seem like a big thing if you live in Canberra, Melbourne, Sydney or Brisbane, but where I live and the people I represent live the chemist is often your only healthcare professional in town. They don't just dispense medicine. They offer a free counselling service.

          <p>
           I thank you for your indulgence, Chair. As someone that also cares about the regions, you want them to have not just great export controls, as this bill outlines, but also fabulous healthcare delivery. On that, I'll return to the bill and look forward to debating this in the chamber more broadly when we return.
          </p>
          <p>
           I rise to speak on the Export Control Amendment (Streamlining Administrative Processes) Bill 2022 on behalf of the coalition. A healthy, strong agriculture sector is absolutely crucial to the health and strength of our nation. With around 70 per cent of Australia's agricultural produce exported, we need to ensure these industries are adequately supported, fit for purpose and operating as efficiently as possible. This is something the federal coalition takes extremely seriously. In our nation, the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export_Control_Act" rel="nofollow">
            Export Control Act
           </a>
           provides the regulatory framework for the export of goods, including a range of agricultural commodities. This legislation before the chamber will amend this act to allow better information management, cut administrative red tape and clarify the intent of the act.
          </p>
          <p>
           The bill will allow for the introduction of both civil and criminal penalties, along with the use of infringement notices for any breaches of information sharing. Based on these sensible provisions, the federal coalition will be supporting the passage of this bill. Australia's export sector relies on the efficient collection and sharing of information and the amendments in this bill will deliver an enhanced process for this, while also protecting data confidentiality. This is important because currently all information obtained or generated by people performing their duty, or exercising powers under this act, is classified as protected, regardless of whether it's actually commercially sensitive or not. This means that when information needs to be shared it goes through a complex approval process. The provisions in this bill aim to make this process more timely, responsive and efficient, with less red tape, which is a commonsense outcome and something the coalition will always support.
          </p>
          <p>
           It's so important in a fiercely competitive international marketplace that vital information in this sector can be appropriately shared with our regulatory partners, exporters and key stakeholders, while preserving safeguards for any information that is potentially sensitive. Examples highlighting the significance of this include: providing information quickly to a foreign country on an Australian consignment of grain that's awaiting quarantine clearance—and a big-shout out to
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBH" rel="nofollow">
            CBH
           </a>
           , who are in the building this week. You don't just make great beer from barley; I highly recommend soju—providing export data to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" rel="nofollow">
            Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
           </a>
           to assist with trade negotiations; using the information to develop improved operating procedures; and harnessing relevant data to support the simplified trade system, which is making exports and imports easier through the digital single window system, something the previous government invested heavily in and is glad to see this government continuing.
          </p>
          <p>
           Significantly, there will be offence provisions introduced which would apply to any instances where protected information is disclosed in an unauthorised way. It is also worth pointing out that the information-sharing provisions contained in this bill will help bring our agricultural exports into line with the world-leading benchmarks that underpin our biosecurity system, which is so critical to our clean, green product being accepted, celebrated and desired right across the world. Other amendments in this legislation will streamline administration processes in relation to various approval arrangements, accredited properties, registered establishments and export licences as well as consideration of certain information for the purposes of the fit-and-proper-person test, along with some minor technical amendments.
          </p>
          <p>
           Overall, this bill consists of practical measures that will have a positive impact on Australia's agricultural export sector. I recognise the work of the many officials of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Agriculture" rel="nofollow">
            Department of Agriculture
           </a>
           , Fisheries and Forestry, who I was privileged to be minister for—I even had my little office down in the building—and who I know have diligently, over several years, been working so hard with our export industry stakeholders to identify opportunities to improve these administrative processes, which has resulted in the bill before the Senate today. So thank you to those public officials for your incredibly hard work and the way you've engaged with our export stakeholders. The federal coalition also notes that the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Farmers_Federation" rel="nofollow">
            National Farmers Federation
           </a>
           has also expressed support for the bill.
          </p>
          <p>
           On this side of the chamber, we are always going to back Australian agricultural exports as they underpin not only our local rural economies but also, more broadly, our national economy. Under the previous coalition government, our comprehensive plan ensured that this industry remained strong and resilient as a crucial part of helping the agriculture sector to achieve its goal of reaching $100 billion of farm gate—
