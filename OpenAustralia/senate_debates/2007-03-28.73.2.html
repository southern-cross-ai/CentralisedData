            the referendum was passed with an unprecedented level of support from more than 90 per cent of Australians, and is a great example of Indigenous and non-Indigenous people working together in support of equal rights for Indigenous people;

          notes that a truly representative structure, established in consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people which will ensure they have a voice in all decisions which affect their communities Indigenous representation is sadly lacking and that there is still no national structure;

         <dt>
          (f)
         </dt>
         <dd>
          commits to giving greater priority to addressing the needs of Indigenous Australians and to paying greater heed to the diverse views, abilities and achievements of Indigenous Australians from all parts of our nation;
