        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Bob Carr. Is the minister aware that Australia is a party to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
         OECD
        </a>
        Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions? Given the government announced last year as part of its commitment to develop and implement Australia's national anticorruption plan to amend the Commonwealth Criminal Code on foreign bribery offences, is it fair to say that the government is seeking to set a good international example on corrupt practices? Does the minister support the principles of the convention? Has he in his public life always insisted upon compliance with those principles?

          , in particular during the period of his premiership, is compliant with good international practice? Does the scandal and corruption revealed to have been engaged in by Labor politicians to whom he gave patronage, such as Messrs Obeid, Macdonald and Roozendaal, compromise the minister's credibility as an advocate in his capacity as foreign minister of honest government?

             , I rise on a point of order. The minister did not take a point of order. He did not object to answering the question. He merely said, 'I'm not sure that it does relate to the portfolio.' Given that the final part of the question said, 'Is the minister satisfied that, given the corruption and scandal revealed to have been engaged in by Labor politicians to whom he gave patronage, such as Messrs Obeid, Macdonald and Roozendaal, his credibility as an advocate has not been compromised in his capacity as foreign minister of honest government?' I would ask you to direct the minister to address the question.
