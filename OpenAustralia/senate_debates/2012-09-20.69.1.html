        My question is to Senator Evans, the Minister representing the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. Can the minister update the Senate on the progress towards constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and

         I thank Senator Brown for the question. The Labor government is committed to constitutional change to recognise the unique and special place of Aboriginal and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
          Torres Strait Islander
         </a>
         people. We believe that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Constitution" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Constitution
         </a>
         should recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and their unique history, culture and connection to this land; reflect our country's fundamental belief in the importance of equality, through the removal from it of all references to race; and acknowledge that additional effort is needed to close the gap on Indigenous disadvantage in this country.
        </p>
        <p>
         Great progress has been made towards constitutional recognition. In December 2010, the government appointed an expert panel to identify how to recognise
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
          Indigenous Australians
         </a>
         in the Constitution. We have been working with local organisations to build a momentum for change. But we do know that change can only happen when there is majority support for any referendum put to the people. We think some positive work has been done, but a progress report from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconciliation_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Reconciliation Australia
         </a>
         makes it clear that the level of support we need for a successful referendum is not yet there.

           I had to go and do some study before I could help. The record of referendums reminded me how poor the success rate in referendums has been. We know that the prospects at the moment would not be good, given the level of understanding and awareness about these issues in the Australian community. The government,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconciliation_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            Reconciliation Australia
           </a>
           and Indigenous leaders agree that more time is needed to build support for the changes we would like to see. It is important we get this right, that we are able to build that support, before we put a referendum to the people for this important change to our Constitution.

             The Gillard government is absolutely committed to working with local communities to build that broader support for a referendum. That is why, in the Prime Minister's Closing the Gap statement to parliament in February, she announced a $10 million funding commitment for
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconciliation_Australia" rel="nofollow">
              Reconciliation Australia
             </a>
             's You Me Unity campaign. The You Me Unity campaign is a two-year campaign which provides funding for community organisations to undertake awareness-raising activities about the case for constitutional recognition of
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
              Indigenous Australians
             </a>
             . So far, over 100,000 people have registered on the You Me Unity website as supporters of constitutional recognition of Indigenous Australians. So the activity and the recruitment of support is ongoing. But it is clear that we will have to continue that campaign and build support with the help of community organisations.

               The government believes that the passage of an act of recognition would be an important step on the path towards constitutional recognition of
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
                Indigenous Australians
               </a>
               . We intend to introduce an act before the end of the year. It will not bind any future parliaments and it will not trigger a referendum. It will be worded as closely as possible to the recommendations of the expert panel which developed options for constitutional change. A sunset clause within the act will give a future parliament the opportunity to re-assess the timing of any referendum and continue to work towards constitutional change.
              </p>
              <p>
               The act will indicate parliament's commitment to reconciliation and give senators the opportunity to show their personal support for this important issue. The Gillard government has worked hard towards reconciliation with Indigenous Australians and the passage of such an act will be an important step towards a successful referendum which will give Indigenous Australians their rightful place in our nation's Constitution.
