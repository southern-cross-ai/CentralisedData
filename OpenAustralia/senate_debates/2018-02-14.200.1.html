          We have listened carefully to the minister responding to several questions asked by the opposition this week on the future funding for remote housing. Some of the minister's answers have unfortunately been scrambled. We need the record to be cleared on this important matter. Housing is fundamental to closing the gap, and Labor wants to help the minister clarify the situation by giving him an opportunity to provide us with all correspondence between himself and the states and territories on this issue.
         </p>
         <p>
          The states and territories, we believe, will assist the minister and clear the correspondence promptly. I inform the Senate that the motion has been amended to specify that a time period of no more than two hours will be made available to debate the minister's response. I thank Senator Griff for his contribution in relation to that matter.

             The government has been clear that it is in negotiations with state and territory governments regarding future investment in remote and Indigenous housing. While the government maintains that states and territory governments must take up the responsibility, we have been clear that Commonwealth funding is on the table as part of these negotiations. The government does not support this motion, as it will be more appropriate for these negotiations to be conducted through normal processes, rather than through public and political debate.
