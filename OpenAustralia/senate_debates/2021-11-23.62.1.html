        , Senator Ruston. Yesterday, Woodside got the green light for the Scarborough gas project, which will generate 1.6 billion tonnes of emissions—equivalent to 15 coal-fired power stations every year. Scarborough will be the most polluting gas project in all of Australia. Minister, how could the Morrison government approve the most fossil-fuel-polluting project ever proposed in Australia?

         I thank the senator for her question. The one thing that the Morrison-Joyce government will do is to ensure that the resources which are the wealth of Australia are able to be prosecuted to ensure that all Australians benefit from the wealth that sits under our ground. And we will do so in a responsible way—a way that's responsible when it comes to our emissions targets and a way that's responsible when it comes to making sure that we have reliable and affordable power. That's because we're not going to make the Australian public or Australian businesses pay for the future that we know we can achieve through our technology led recovery.
        </p>
        <p>
         I always wonder, when we get questions from the Greens, what they hate about regional Australia? What do they hate about jobs? What do they hate about businesses? This government has made an absolute commitment towards net zero by 2050, but we're going to do it in a way that is responsible, a way that doesn't tax Australians, Australian families, Australian households and Australian businesses. We are absolutely committed to that. We are technology and source agnostic; we just believe that technology is the answer and not taxes.
        </p>
        <p>
         I really don't understand why you are so against rural and regional Australia being able to benefit from the opportunity of jobs and the development of businesses, or why you are denying the Australian public the opportunity to realise the wealth that exists under our ground. As you may not realise, in rural and regional Australia, we have two great industries: we have our resources sector and we have our agricultural sector. These two sectors have been the backbone of the Australian economy for a very long time. They are two of the most environmentally responsible industries, and we on this side of the chamber will back them in for the benefit of all Australians.

            Well, I'm really pleased to let Senator Cox know that it's the government that sets policy in Australia, and not just energy policy but all national policy is set by the government. You may not like it because you want to protest about everything that happens in this country, but we on this side of the chamber are very happy to have the privilege and the honour to set policy to support Australians.

                I would disagree with the premise of the accusations that Senator Cox has just made. In the development of our resource sector, of course we must always remain very, very alive to the issues of Indigenous culture in Australia. I can absolutely assure this chamber and anybody listening that that is always one of the absolute key considerations when we develop this sector.
               </p>
               <p>
                But the resource sector is a very important element of the Australian economy. It benefits all Australians, including

                Australians benefit from our resources sector, and we will continue to work in a process of co-design, consulting with First Nations Australians to make sure that we are developing all of our sectors across the whole of Australia in the best interests of all Australians; Senator Cox, that includes First Nations.
