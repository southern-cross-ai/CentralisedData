        My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Wong. Does the minister recall in March this year the Treasurer, Mr Swan, said that refunding mining companies for increases in state royalties would not change any of the mining tax revenue forecast in the first two years. Given the Treasurer has now written to state governments threatening that the Commonwealth will implement measures to protect the revenue from recently announced or future royalty increases, can the minister confirm that the $13.4 billion expected revenue over the forward estimates from the mining resource rent tax to the Commonwealth is under threat?

               It is the case, as has been reported, that the Treasurer has written to the state treasurers on the issue of royalties to remind them of the government's position in relation to increases in royalties. As the Senate may or may not be aware, the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
                New South Wales
               </a>
               government has announced it will increase rates and the Queensland government is also indicating a royalty increase is in the spotlight in its September budget.
              </p>
              <p>
               I make this point: it would be interesting to see if the Queensland Liberal senators advocate as strongly against that tax as they have against the minerals tax—

                  Her Majesty

                 , but a Commonwealth profits based tax that delivers to Australians? That's bad! This is an extraordinary proposition.

                <p>
                 Anyway, I return to the question from Senator Milne. I have previously indicated to Senator Milne in relation to the minerals tax a number of points. The first is that it is a volatile tax. Obviously, as a profits based tax, movements in volumes and prices obviously affect the tax take. The government is of the view that we do need to seek to resolve these issue with the states, which is why the government has written, through the Treasurer—

                      That just makes my point. Maybe Senator Joyce cannot hear the nature of some of the interjections up this end, but for him to be making that point absent what we all hear coming across the chamber from the other side is, I think, ridiculous.

                         , I ask a supplementary question. I take from the minister's answer that revenue over the forward estimates from this tax are under threat. Will the minister now admit that the government made a mistake in its deal with the multinational mining companies in agreeing to credit unlimited royalties and that the government should have supported the Greens amendment to limit the credit of royalties to those that were in place before 1 July 2011.

                          . I think the arguments for and against that amendment were traversed in that debate and I am sure the senator is aware of them. The government's position is as the Treasurer has articulated in this letter to the states, and I would point out that the independent

                          review, which is looking at a range of issues, including this issue, noted in its interim report that it was:

                           , I ask a further supplementary question. I thank the minister; but, given the obvious need for increased government revenue to fund reforms such as Gonski education, the National Disability Insurance Scheme and Denticare, will the government now agree that Australia needs the original Henry recommended resource superprofits tax to bring in the increased revenue of $100 billion in the next 10 years? Will the government now revisit the superprofits tax?

                            I am sure Senator Milne will not be surprised that my answer is no. The government has made its position in relation to this very clear. The government, as the Treasurer has indicated, does have a view about resolving this issue with the states. The issue that the independent review referred to in its interim report is obviously an issue that does need to be resolved, and that is why the Treasurer has written, but government is not proposing to agree with Senator Milne's proposition as put to me in that question.
