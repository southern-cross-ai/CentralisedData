        On Saturday, 16 September this year, I spent the afternoon with some wonderful Tasmanians, the men and women of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risdon_Vale" rel="nofollow">
         Risdon Vale
        </a>
        Volunteer Fire Brigade. Risdon Vale is a small community with a population of around 3,000 located on the eastern shore of Hobart—as you would know,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
         Mr President
        </a>
        . Much of the area is surrounded by scrub and bush. The occasion was a commemoration of the valuable service provided to the community of Risdon Vale by its volunteer fire brigade, whose volunteers have put themselves between the community and harm’s way for the past 25 years. All members of the community, young and old, were invited to celebrate in a typically Australian way, sharing a barbecue and refreshments and enjoying a range of entertainment culminating in fireworks at around 6 pm, to the delight of all.
       </p>
       <p>
        Present to acknowledge the work of these dedicated volunteers was the Hon. Lara Giddings

        for Pembroke, Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer; and the Mayor of Clarence, Mr Jock Campbell. Ms Giddings presented a commemorative shield celebrating the Risdon Vale Volunteer Fire Brigade’s 25 years of service to the community. The individual members of the brigade were honoured with commemorative medals celebrating the 25 years of service—presented by Ms Ritchie, Mr Campbell and me. The recipients of the community’s honour were Glenn Doherty, Leanne Doherty, Anne Harrison, Mark Stocks, Wade Stewart, Michael Petterwood, Tanya Clifford,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Devine" rel="nofollow">
         Peter Devine
        </a>
        , Graham Facy, Robyn Leyhy, Chris McInerney, Steven Rossow and Melanie Upton, current members of the brigade, and also Annette May, a retired life member.
       </p>
       <p>
        These civic-minded individuals are no strangers to receiving recognition for their community service. The 15-year national service medal has been awarded to Third Officer Wade Stewart, the first in the brigade to receive this honour. The second member to receive this honour was First Officer Glenn Doherty. The Volunteer Fire-Fighters Award medal has also been bestowed on First Officer Glenn Doherty, who was the first in the brigade and 10th in the state to receive this award. Also receiving this award was Third Officer Wade Stewart. In 2005 four of the female members received the Tasmania

        </a>
        10-year service badge. Another significant brigade first was the election of Leanne Doherty to the position of Fourth Officer, the first female to become an officer of the Risdon Vale Volunteer Brigade.
       </p>
       <p>
        The brigade has a community oriented ethos that sees them involved with initiatives like Project Wake Up, a government project to supply and fit smoke alarms for the elderly and healthcare recipients free of charge. They have fitted around 80 alarms to date. Members are involved in many aspects of community life that generally go unnoticed, so it was fitting that they were able to be honoured by the community.
       </p>

        Tasmanian firefighters have served the Tasmanian community since the early 1800s and have had a legislated responsibility since 1883. The Fire Service Act 1979 established the current
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmania_Fire_Service" rel="nofollow">
         Tasmania Fire Service
        </a>
        , which today is an innovative and efficient state-wide service that takes pride in its long and proud history. The service has over 230 fire brigades across Tasmania, consisting of about 250 career firefighters and about 4,800 volunteer firefighters. Volunteers and career staff work as an integrated team.
       </p>
       <p>
        Locally, Risdon Vale and the surrounding area have a history of bushfires, and the area is seen as having a high fire risk. This risk was acknowledged by the Fire Commission, and approval for a volunteer fire brigade was quickly given. The first brigade was formed in September 1981. Following an approach to the then Clarence Council, an area of land on Sugarloaf Road was made available for a fire station, free of all charges. A 30-foot by 12-foot Colorbond fire shed was built and a Toyota bushfire tanker was provided. The new station was opened on 14 May 1982. In the following year, the Fire Commission endorsed training in structural firefighting for the new brigade, thus making the brigade a dual-purpose one. In October 1984, a new fire station was completed and it was officially opened by the then minister, the Hon.

        , in April 1985.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today’s brigade has two of the latest firefighting assets at its disposal—a Toyota light tanker and a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsubishi_Canter" rel="nofollow">
         Mitsubishi Canter
        </a>
        , both of which have been manufactured at the Fire Service prefab division in Cambridge, Tasmania. The brigade trains extensively to get the best results possible with this equipment—an average of eight hours a month at the local level. This does not include courses that individual members undertake with the Tasmania Fire Service, which normally are of three hours duration, though weekend courses are up to 16 hours depending on the training course being carried out.
       </p>
       <p>
        The brigade’s current membership numbers 14, most of whom have served with the brigade for 10 years or more. I am pleased to inform the Senate that in 2005 four of the Risdon Vale brigade’s female officers received the Tasmania Fire Service 10-year service badge. I am sure that this level of service throughout the rural fire service will be well recognised by senators. Australians have a strong history of volunteering, and the rural fire services of Tasmania and across Australia represent some of the very best.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rural firefighters turn out at short notice, giving their time, energy and, sometimes, tragically, their lives. These wonderful men and women do a dangerous job without thought of glory or personal recognition, doing what needs doing because they care. Australians care about their homes and their communities. They care sufficiently to risk both life and limb. No amount of thanks is too much for the work done by rural fire brigades across Tasmania and across Australia. I commend to the Senate the work done by the wonderful people of the Risdon Vale Volunteer Fire Brigade.
       </p>

        That caution should always be the byword of those of us who live near to or in the bush has never been truer than this year. The fire season has come early to south-eastern Australia. We have seen major fires across the region weeks, if not months, earlier than usual. In my home state of Tasmania, the dry conditions have created some of the worst potential fire conditions seen in many years. Fire permits are now required in 15 of the state’s 29 municipalities. Permits are required from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Town" rel="nofollow">
         George Town
        </a>
        , in the state’s north, to Kingborough, in the state’s south. Tasmania’s east coast is tinder dry after a long, dry winter and fire permits are required in all east coast municipalities. This is in comparison to last year, when permits were not required until January.
       </p>
       <p>
        As early as 4 October fire conditions in the far south of Tasmania were extreme, while the east coast and Hobart had a high fire danger on that day. By day’s end there were seven fires of significance burning around Tasmania. Luckily, 5 October brought some rain to the south of the state, allowing northern fires to be fought by the Fire Service. When taken with the lower than average predicted rainfall, the coming summer is shaping up to be one of extreme fire danger. Indeed, tomorrow, 11 October, sees a total fire ban in southern Tasmania. The summer of 2006-07 is predicted to see higher than average temperatures. This means that the conditions of 4 October will be replicated throughout the summer right across Tasmania and, no doubt, across eastern Australia. The same grim forecast for the coming months is shared by the fire risk assessors of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
         CSIRO
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        So, while praising the work done by the men and women of the Tasmania Fire Service, I say it is necessary for all Tasmanians to face up to the very real dangers that fire brings to the beautiful state that I have the honour to serve. I therefore urge all Tasmanians to think about fire, think about fire prevention and think now about preparing for the worst. Clear your gutters, mow fire breaks around your homes, protect your shacks and do not leave combustible materials stacked against your house or fence.
       </p>
       <p>
        The losses that people suffer due to fire can be incalculable: lives, homes, the treasured possessions and memories of several lifetimes gone in a matter of minutes, all too often lost because of a lack of preparation and planning. I urge all Australians who live in or near the bush to seek advice from their local fire brigade now. As I know from talking to the wonderful volunteers of Tasmania’s Risdon Vale brigade, they would rather provide help and advice now than fight a desperate battle later or provide consolation after the event. I am certain the Senate will agree with me when I say we want all Australians to enjoy the coming summer months. What we do not want to see is more Australians becoming fire statistics. Again, Mr President, I congratulate the Risdon Vale Volunteer Fire Brigade on their 25 years of fine service to their community.
