        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Wong. Do you agree with the Minister for Trade and Tourism, Senator Farrell, that the United States is not Australia's most trusted ally? If not, will you call on Senator Farrell to withdraw his controversial remark?

         I welcome the question from the Acting Leader of the Opposition. I would note that it demonstrates, yet again, why those opposite are not fit for government. They are not interested in the major geostrategic challenges of the day, they're not interested in the cost of living—

            and they want to continue to focus on an issue which Senator Farrell has responded to. I think we all know that the Kiwis are family. We all know that. Everyone also knows that the United States is our closest ally and our principal strategic partner—

               I have been in this portfolio and in the shadow trade portfolio previously, and I have seen, on both sides of politics, bipartisan support for the US alliance and a contribution from both sides of politics to ensuring that it continues to be deep and strong and modern, and that Australians continue to gain the benefit of that relationship with our principal strategic partner. But, on a range of fronts this week, what we have seen is the opposition seeking to play partisan politics with the US alliance, which I think demonstrates, yet again, that under the wrecking ball that is Mr Dutton they are prepared recklessly to politicise anything, recklessly to fight about anything, regardless of whether or not it's good for the country. They're not fit for government.

                     US, you put AUKUS on the table, and then you get annoyed when I defend it. It's extraordinary. We are doing the work on this side of the chamber and in Washington and in the United Kingdom in order to ensure that we assure a capability and a relationship, in the context of a relationship which is so important for Australia's security. And what we have across the chamber is a party led by a wrecking ball—I'm speaking of Mr Dutton; not you, Senator Cash—who's prepared to politicise anything.

                        The shadow minister might want to recall those famous words, 'I don't think; I know,' when she reminds us about diplomacy. What I would say to the senator is that we know you are confecting an argument where there is none. We know that for the third day now you are confecting an argument. You know that the Kiwis are our family, and you know that the commitment to the US alliance is unshakable—unshakable on this side.
