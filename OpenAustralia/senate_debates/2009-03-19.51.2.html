         I will take this opportunity in the debate—the start of quite a long debate in relation to the Fair Work Bill—to deal with a couple of matters. One of the matters that came up in the contribution I made in the second reading debate was that the bill has an onerous transfer of business requirements. The government recognises the importance of balancing employee protections with the need to encourage businesses to take on employees of the old employer and to operate in an efficient and productive manner. The transfer of business provisions in the bill are drafted so that they are easy to understand and to give business and employees certainties. What we are trying to do is dispel the view that some would have that there are onerous transfer of business requirements. They do preserve employee enterprise agreement and award rights where a business is sold or work is outsourced or moved between related companies, but only where employees move to the new employer. The bill also allows for a business that is deciding whether or not to take over another business or to take on the staff of that business to apply in advance to Fair Work Australia to obtain an order for the old agreement not to transfer at all.

         So with those short introductory words it appears we are able to commence. The alternative is that we use the time available to go through some of the amendments on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PA" rel="nofollow">
          PA
         </a>
         442, which we do not think there is much controversy about. I can provide a short summary to the amendments. There are about 10 or so amendments—two pages worth. We can identify them in order and then I can say something about them. I will not read them out seriatim, but there are about 10. If we deal with those amendments, at least we might be able to clear them. As I understand it, there is very little controversy in respect of them. I seek leave to move government amendments (1) to (7) on sheet PA 442.

         Amendments (1) and (2) would make clear that each of the named state and territory antidiscrimination acts continue to apply to employers and employees covered by the bill. State and territory laws dealing with antidiscrimination and equal opportunity are contained in state industrial laws which are otherwise generally overridden. Amendments (3) and (4) are technical amendments to ensure that state or territory laws dealing with the regulation of employer and employee associations are properly preserved and that modern awards and enterprise agreements operate subject to all of the non-excluded state or territory laws. Amendment (5) deals with extra territoriality of the application of the bill. It corrects a typographical error by inserting the word ‘and’ at the end of clause 34(3)(a). Amendment (6) ensures that, if regulations are made to extend the bill’s application beyond the

         The government proposes a series of amendments that ensures that the Fair Work Ombudsman is the primary source of information, assistance and advice within the institutional framework established by the Fair Work Bill. The amendments to clause 682 will enable the Fair Work Ombudsman to produce best practice guides in relation to workplace relations and workplace practices generally—for example, workplace privacy, work and family, use of  individual flexibility agreements and improved workplace productivity and bargaining. The amendments to clause 124(1) will have the effect of making the Fair Work Ombudsman rather than Fair Work Australia responsible for publishing the fair work information statement. The list of matters which must be included in the statement has been expanded to reflect recommendations made in the Senate committee report on the Fair Work Bill.

            This group of amendments would ensure that Fair Work Australia, in satisfying itself that each employee is better off overall under a proposed enterprise agreement than under the relevant modern award, may apply the test to classes of employees—amendment (1); amend clause 207 of the bill to enable agreements that do not pass the better off overall test but which are approved by FWA in the public interest to be varied later on, subject to the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BOOT" rel="nofollow">
             BOOT
            </a>
            amendment (2); omit paragraphs that currently require FWA to take into account the views of the union covered by the agreement and replace it with a provision requiring FWA to approve a variation unless there are serious public interest grounds for not doing so—amendments (3) and (4); make technical amendments to the variation provisions in clause 211 of the bill to make it clear that FWA is required to decide whether the agreement as varied passes the better off overall test and does not contravene the National Employment Standards, not whether the variation alone passes the BOOT and

            , which is amendment (7). Amendments (5) and (6) are consequential upon the changes proposed in amendment (7). Amendment (8) enables the FWA to conciliate or mediate disputes about a proposed variation to an enterprise agreement. Lastly, amendment (9) makes a technical amendment to make it clear that the enterprise agreements provisions of the bill do not require employees to be individually named in relevant documents and instruments.
