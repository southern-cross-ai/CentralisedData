        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Health, Senator Nash. I refer to the Prime Minister's pre-election promise of 'no cuts to health' and 'no new taxes'. Will the minister restate that commitment on the floor of the chamber today?

         I can indicate to the Senate that we will be honouring our election commitment. We will also be honouring our commitment to the Australian people, to fix the economic mess that the previous Labor government has left this nation. We have facing us a serious economic mess and the commitment we made to the Australian people was to fix the budget mess.
        </p>
        <p>
         When we look at what the previous Labor government has done, when we look at the waste and mismanagement from the previous Labor government, it is absolutely imperative that we honour that commitment to the Australian people. We will do that in a measured way, we will do that in a sensible way and we will have a fair budget that makes the right decisions for future sustainability for the Australian people. We on this side of the chamber understand the importance of economic responsibility. We understand that to have sustainable portfolios across the government into the future—

Does the minister back the assertion by the Prime Minister's handpicked adviser Tony Shepherd that Australians visit the doctor 11 times a year and, as he said, 'I just don't think we're that crook'?

                     It is this government that has a much greater focus on the ability of families to be able to attend medical practitioners, to get proper health services, unlike the previous government that was so focused on bureaucracy and duplication. We are focused on delivering health care in a sustainable way—

                          , I ask a further supplementary question. I refer to the Prime Minister's pre-election promise that this government 'will do what we have said we will do'. Why is this government breaking this promise and introducing a tax that means that Medicare will be for people who can afford it rather than people who need it? How can the Australian people trust anything that this Prime Minister says?

This government will deliver a budget that ensures sustainability into the future, particularly in my area of health. On this side of the chamber this government understands that we need to make hard decisions, and those people out in the community elected us last year to ensure that we fix the economic mess that was left to us by those opposite. We did not create this economic mess—

                              My question without notice is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Abetz. I refer to Treasurer Mr Hockey's statement that the budget will shape the destiny of the nation. I ask what destiny does the government envisage for Australia in terms of energy infrastructure, in particular given the intention to scrap carbon pricing, the Renewable Energy Agency and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and to undermine the renewable energy target?

                               for allowing me to outline the vision that we as a government have for this great nation. When she was in cahoots with the former Labor government in this place there was no future. Indeed, the light at the end of the tunnel was the debt train rattling at us at 100 miles an hour. After tonight the light at the end of the tunnel will in fact be daylight where the future generations of Australians will be able to be satisfied that the government in 2014 took the right decisions to guarantee their future.

                               In relation to our vision for energy, one of the great advantages Australia has had over many generations has been our cheap energy, one of the great benefits we have had. We went to the Australian people on the very firm policy of abolishing the carbon tax, a tax we were promised we would never have, especially by the current Leader of the Opposition in this place and the Leader of the Opposition in the other place. So we have a vision to ensure the energy security for our country and a vision to reduce the cost of that energy so that the manufacturing sector, the agricultural sector and the tourism sector can be viable players in a very tough world environment. Why we want them to be viable players is because we know that they are the ones that create the jobs for our fellow Australians that allow them to run sustainable households in a manner where they control their destiny rather than the government controlling their destiny.

In terms of energy infrastructure, since renewable energy is going to go down in price and fossil fuel energy is going to increase in price, how are you going to guarantee cheap energy in the future by abolishing the very processes and renewable energy agencies and climate corporations that support the infrastructure of the future?

This government does in fact believe in renewable energy but we say take it in steps in a manner that does not mug the economy, as the carbon tax did, continues to do and will continue to do until the Senate agrees to abolish it—something which the Australian people overwhelmingly voted for on 7 September. You can shake your head, Senator Milne, but I think a lot of people on 7 September were motivated by a desire to get rid of the Labor-Green government that was ruining this country and their cost of living and their desire to rid the nation of a carbon tax which they saw as being emblematic of increasing their cost of living and ruining—

The simple fact is that you will have to wait another 5¼ hours, and the Treasurer will get onto his hind feet and deliver an excellent budget which will guarantee the future of our country. You will then see that we have a vision for this country, unlike that which the Labor-Green governments were able to deliver.

The Australian people overwhelmingly elected the Liberal and National parties to government on 7 September to fix the budget, not just for this generation but also for the generations to come.

                                         economies. As a result of Labor's fiscal vandalism, Australia is facing the single largest increase in national debt outside Europe. This is simply not sustainable. Indeed, each and every month, as we speak, the government of Australia, courtesy of the Labor-Green legacy, is borrowing $1,000 million per month from overseas just to pay the interest bill—not to pay down the capital; just to pay the interest bill. We are having to borrow to pay for the interest. It is like using your credit card to pay for the house mortgage. At the end of the day, the credit card is going to run out and then the whole house has to be sold off.

                                           The conclusion of Senator Williams' question absolutely hits the nail on the head. This is all about getting the economy back on track so that we can create the jobs necessary to sustain the Australian population. That is what they want—they want jobs—and that is why it is so imperative that we fix the economic disaster left to us by those opposite.
                                          </p>

                                           Our strategy was very clear. We said that we would have five pillars to our economic policy: cutting the carbon tax, cutting the regulatory burden, boosting trade, building the infrastructure of the 21st century and getting the budget back on track. Having created the mess, you would think that the Labor-Green senators in this place would at least get out of the way to enable us to fix it. They remind me of the arsonist complaining about the water damage being occasioned by the fire brigade.

                                             One thing that you have to understand—and Senator Williams understands this, even if the Labor-Green senators do not—is that by paying down the debt, by getting rid of the debt and interest burden, we will free up taxpayers' money for the possibility of growing the much-needed infrastructure in this country. What we are seeking to do, and will seek to do in tonight's budget, is deliver a budget that is both tough and fair, a budget that will get us back on track. It will anchor the government's legislative reform package that is designed to free up the economy so that workers can get jobs and that businesses can grow and prosper.

                                             Already we have introduced legislation that will abolish the carbon tax, scrap the mining tax, unshackle Qantas and re-establish the Australian Building and Construction Commission. These bills form part of our program that the Labor and Green senators in this place, refusing to acknowledge the decision of the Australian people, refuse to pass.
