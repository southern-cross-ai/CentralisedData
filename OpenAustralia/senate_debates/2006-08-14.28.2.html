        </a>
        ’s withdrawal of the migration bill today completely undermine the minister’s authority in her portfolio? Given the various policy positions adopted by the government in the last six months, the latest of which the minister herself had earlier characterised as ridiculous, what should we understand now to be the government’s position in relation to migration matters? Is it the case that the government is in total disarray on migration policy and that the minister’s authority in the portfolio has again been totally undermined? What is the standing of the promises made to Liberal Party backbenchers some months ago regarding the incarceration of children and other matters? Are those promises still current or have they been reneged on?

         I thank the senator for the question. The answer to your first question is no. The answers to the second series of questions in relation to migration matters are no and no. In relation to the third question that you asked, which was what happens to the range of matters that were negotiated to be included in the bill: they are in the bill. There was an opportunity to support them in the bill. Your colleagues, Senator Evans, indicated that they were not prepared to support the bill. Therefore, I presume that you are not concerned about those things which go down with the bill.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I note that it was not just the Labor Party but also the minister’s own colleagues who were not prepared to support her bill. Perhaps it was on the advice that she provided earlier, where she characterised the measures in the bill as ridiculous.
         </p>
         <p>
          My supplementary question is this: what authority does the minister have in her portfolio, given the scandal and continuing malaise around the administration of her department, the complete backflip on the unauthorised arrivals bill and the shambles that is the section 457 work visas issue? Isn’t it the case that the whole administration of migration in this country is a complete shambles? Shouldn’t the minister take authority for that and consider her position?

           The senator asked me about scandals in the immigration department. I presume he is referring to two very high-profile cases and the consequences thereof. It is very clear what I have done as a consequence of that, with the government’s support. We now have a tremendous reform program across the immigration department.
          </p>
          <p>
           The senator then describes today’s decision to withdraw a bill as a backflip. Clearly, the senator was not listening to the Prime Minister’s press conference. There is no backflip. There was a decision not to proceed with the bill because the Labor Party does not support the bill and some of our own colleagues are not prepared to support it. But there is no backflip. The vast majority of this party is very strongly in favour of that bill and of border protection. The last issue raised was the 457 issue. The only people who think that is a shambles are the senators opposite.
