       <p>
        Today, thousands of shifts in aged care are going unfilled every week. Vulnerable residents are suffering appalling conditions and aged-care workers are at breaking point. This is the Morrison government's aged-care system at work in Australia today. And now, after nine years of Morrison government neglect, we're resorting to sending the troops into aged care.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Prime Minister should have listened to the experts years ago. He should have acted on the royal commission's urgent call for more aged-care workers and for proper pay to keep the dedicated aged-care workers we have. But, in the middle of this crisis, instead of delivering a real plan to properly value these workers, the Prime Minister decided to insult them with a last-minute pre-election $400 bonus pay-off. I asked three aged-care workers what they thought about it. Julie told me, 'This bonus is just meant as a bribe.' Jude called it 'a desperate bid for votes'. Elizabeth said, 'It is insulting.' She also said: 'The Prime Minister should spend a week in a facility, first as a resident, then another in our shoes. If he is not heartbroken and exhausted after that, then he has no soul.'
       </p>
       <p>
        The Prime Minister has had nine years to listen to the experts and to respect aged-care workers like Julie, Elizabeth and Jude by coming up with a real planâ€”a long-term plan to value our aged-care workers and residents. The Prime Minister has dismally failed aged-care workers, has tragically failed aged-care residents and has failed all Australians who expect their government to pass the most basic of tests: protecting our elderly.
