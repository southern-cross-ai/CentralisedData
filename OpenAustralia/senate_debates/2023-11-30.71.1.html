        , read a list of 60 names in the other place. These were the names of 60 women and children who have been murdered so far this year at the hands of people they knewâ€”often, intimate partners. This sobering list shows how urgent and how serious it is that we step up our efforts to combat violence against women and children here in this country. I'd like to acknowledge the work and advocacy being led by the co-chairs of the Parliamentary Friends of Ending Violence Against Women: the member for Bass, Bridget Archer, the member for Canberra, Alicia Payne, and Senator Waters. But it shouldn't, and it can't, always be women speaking up. Men need to stand up and do more. Men need to stand up and be part of this conversation.

        who are having to keep women in hospital beyond what is medically necessary, or discharge them into homelessness. We have the great fortune of living in one of the wealthiest country in the world, and so that is unacceptable. We have to do better; we have to treat this crisis with the urgency that it deserves.
