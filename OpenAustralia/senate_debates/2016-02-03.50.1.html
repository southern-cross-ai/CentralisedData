        Prime Minister Turnbull has said, 'There's never been a more exciting time to be an Australian,' but, when it comes to most Australian families, it could be argued—and in fact I will argue—that that only applies in this country under this government when you are well off. How big a credit card you have will dictate what sort of education your children will have and what sort of health care you will have.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have a local paper in Launceston known as
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Examiner" rel="nofollow">
          The Examiner
         </a>
        </i>
        . It is a fantastic local newspaper. It has a warning today for the local member for Bass. The headline reads 'Nikolic's thin skin may hurt at polling booths', but actually the article itself is about the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
         GST
        </a>
        and previous Liberal governments and members losing their seats as consequences. There is a warning here for Mr Nikolic that the GST will not be tolerated by his electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        But we know because we have heard time and time again those opposite carping on about the GST being firmly on the table because, if it were not, the Prime Minister would say so. We know it is there. I am speaking as a Tasmanian senator because my home state has disproportionately more lower-income families and we will be hit much harder, but those on the other side do not want to listen to anyone else's point of view. It is quite clear. You could come into this chamber. The Prime Minister could very clearly resolve this issue and say there will be no increase to the GST. We on this side know as the Australian community knows that a 15 per cent GST on everything is going to hurt every Australian family.
       </p>
       <p>
        Why should Australian pensioners have to pay more for the services that they need? Why should older Australians who are looking for support to be able to stay in their homes have to pay an extra 15 per cent? Why should Australian families have to pay 15 per cent on health care or education? We will never support an increase to the GST. Never ever will we support any change to the GST. It is lazy policy development. It is lazy and unacceptable to the Australian people. If there is going to be an increase to the GST, as I have already said, the local newspaper—which is not a friend to this side of the chamber—has warned its local member. I am quite happy to table this, because there is some interesting reading here about Mr Nikolic and his thin skin.

         , I rise on a point of order. I am loath to interrupt, but the use of props is inappropriate in the chamber, and Senator Polley, having been here for a long time, would know that, I am sure.

           Tasmanian families are all going to be expected to pay in excess of $6,200 more on essential things like fresh food, schools, health, education. This is unacceptable, and we will not support it.
