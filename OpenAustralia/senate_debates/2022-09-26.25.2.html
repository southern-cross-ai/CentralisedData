        I noticed that Senator Canavan was running in, so I thought I would stand and he can go next.

Alex came to Mountain Heights School from right here in Canberra in 2019 on a two-year placement through the Teach for Australia Leadership Development Program. She's now in her fourth year at the school, teaching humanities, social science and English.

        Teaching is so fulfilling for such a diverse range of reasons.

        It's the relationships with the students, the creativity in preparing lessons, connecting the school with the wider community, opportunities to learn, the fast-paced environment—you're always on your toes—and the professional collaboration with other teachers.

       <p class="italic">
        And of course the students, who are so resilient and have taught me so much.

        Alex's previous career was in environmental science, and she decided to make the switch for teaching via Teaching for Australia. For that, I say thank you. What a great switch.

        I've had many visits to Mountain Heights School over the years, and what never ceases to amaze me is the drive and commitment from the teachers towards ensuring that the students get the best out of their schooling to ensure that they get the best out of their lives. Congratulations to Alex, and I hope that she decides to stay at Mountain Heights School for many, many years to come.
