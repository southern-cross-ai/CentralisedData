         Hansard source

       <p>
        This week sees the retirement of a highly valued and very well respected member of Hansard, Mr Trevor Fowler, and Trevor has joined us in the chamber today. Over an uninterrupted and distinguished career spanning more than 30 years, Mr Fowler has provided non-partisan and impartial advice and service to both houses of parliament and to parliamentary committees.
       </p>
       <p>
        Trevor moved to Canberra from Melbourne in February 1979 to become a Hansard reporter in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Old Parliament House
        </a>
        . He was one of the parliament’s first stenographic machine shorthand writers. Since then, with the exception of the day his son was born, Trevor has been in attendance for every scheduled sitting day.
       </p>
       <p>
        Trevor progressed through the ranks to become a Senior Editor, Principal Editor and ultimately Director of Hansard Operations.
       </p>
       <p>
        He has been instrumental over the years in training many shorthand writers and editors and has been a regular lecturer for foreign and local parliamentary study groups and delegations. Trevor has been an admirable representative of the Department of Parliamentary Services and Hansard—always going out of his way to ensure visitors have a positive experience and leave with a good understanding of Hansard operations in the Commonwealth jurisdiction.
       </p>
       <p>
        In his long and successful career, Trevor has seen many changes in the way the
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        is produced, but, no matter how the service has been delivered to the parliament, Trevor has always been highly professional and courteous.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am sure all senators would join me in wishing Trevor Fowler all the best for his well-deserved retirement.
