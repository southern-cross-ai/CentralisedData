        (a) notes that:

       <p class="italic">
        (i) on 12 February 2019, the Senate made an order for the production of documents relating to the Universal Service Obligation (

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii) the documents were sought in the context of critical reports on the USO and the reduction in the number of pay phones nationally, and the annual payments made to Telstra to maintain services under the current USO arrangements, and

        (i) on 14 February 2019, the Minister for Communications and the Arts (the Minister) advanced a public interest immunity claim on the grounds that releasing the cost modelling could significantly compromise potential negotiations with industry in future,

       <p class="italic">
        (ii) the Minister refused to release NBN Co's advice on the basis that it could prejudice it in future commercial dealings, and

        (iii) no documents have been tabled;

       <p class="italic">
        (d) does not accept that public interest immunity has been appropriately advanced, and calls on the Minister to review the nature of the documents ordered on 12 February 2019 and apply a higher test of 'real risk' rather than hypothesised risk; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) orders that there be laid on the table by the Minister for Communications and the Arts, by midday on 5 April 2019, the documents requested on 12 February 2019 which do not impinge on commercial sensitivities.

           The government has decided that the Universal Service Guarantee will retain the current universal service obligation arrangements until more cost-effective arrangements that are not in any way a detriment to services are identified. This requires careful work to build upon the government commissioned report of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
            Productivity Commission
           </a>
           . The current arrangements for voice services and payphones will be retained because they are important to regional and rural communities. There is scope to carefully examine payphone locations, particularly given the strong uptake of mobile services, and the government will undertake further work in this area. Releasing the high-level cost modelling of the universal service obligation reform options and the cost impacts on
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
            NBN

           costs could significantly compromise any future negotiations with industry over the future delivery of the voice, payphone and broadband services covered by the

            USG

           . This is seen as a real, not hypothetical, risk. Undermining the Commonwealth's future negotiating position would have an effect contrary to the motion's intent of advancing
