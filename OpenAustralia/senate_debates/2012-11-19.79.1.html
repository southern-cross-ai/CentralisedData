        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Emergency Management, Senator Ludwig. It is pretty ironic that I ask this question given that yesterday afternoon he, I and others were stuck in the Brisbane airport because of severe thunderstorms. Flights were delayed. I ask this question on that basis. Can the minister advise the Senate how the Gillard government is supporting communities across Australia to prepare and be more resilient this summer as we head into what is traditionally a summer of natural disasters? Hopefully, we will not experience natural disasters like we have in Queensland in previous years when we had to look at putting in place incentives and arrangements to assist Queenslanders who were affected by those terrible disasters over the last several years.

         I thank Senator Furner for his continued interest in emergency management matters, particularly those in Queensland. Over the past few summers we have been reminded how devastating natural disasters can be—the Queensland floods and cyclones in 2010-11, the Victorian and

         bushfires of 2009. The Gillard government is investing a total of $6 billion in Queensland to recover and rebuild.

         we have allocated $3 billion this financial year in post-disaster support to help families get back on their feet.

        <p>
         The recent natural disasters show how important it is for households and communities to be prepared. They have highlighted to Australians how important our committed volunteers are as well. For the government it is important we invest in preparation. Disaster management is a shared responsibility between both the Commonwealth and the states and territories. Clearly, the states and territories do take the brunt. They are the first responders in emergencies.

We are investing $110 million to support communities in disaster mitigation to deliver a range of projects so communities are better prepared. The Gillard government is investing in a range of measures that will help communities prepare and potentially save lives and properties. These include projects in Victoria to improve bushfire predictions, funding for flood mapping in Gippsland and support for education and safety. In Tasmania funding is being provided for improved state-wide emergency management planning. In

           I thank Senator Furner for his first supplementary question. I have outlined some of the big ongoing investments the Gillard government is making in natural disaster mitigation and resilience. There are also specific projects that make a big difference in rural communities. The Gillard government has invested in world-first technology which will allow emergency services to send text messages. The emergency alert system is rolling out across Australia. So far 7.5 million warning messages have been delivered during more than 500 emergencies across Australia. The $60 million investment to establish and upgrade the emergency alert system will ensure that more voice messages can be delivered to landline phones as well. Getting the message out early in an emergency is essential in ensuring the safety of lives and property. These alerts will complement the existing warnings on websites, radio and television. Hopefully, they will make a difference.

            , I ask a further supplementary question. I thank the minister once again for providing answers on this subject. Can the minister outline to the Senate any issues impacting on communities preparing themselves for possible natural disasters this summer? Once again I have a specific interest in what is occurring in Queensland. I would like information on that if that is possible as well, thank you.

             Week and all of us thank those volunteers for the hard work that they do. The volunteers who fight fires and help us during floods and those people who support them are invaluable.
