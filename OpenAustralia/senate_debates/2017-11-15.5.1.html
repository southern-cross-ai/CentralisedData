         The opposition will be supporting this motion as amended by the government, but we would also like to indicate that, because of the changes that are required for the May budget estimates sittings—pushing them to Tuesday to Thursday, because of a public holiday—the spillover day would be lost under that arrangement, so we've had some last-minute discussions with the Manager of Government Business in the Senate about ensuring there is an agreed day. Our recommendation, subject to government consideration, is for 22 June to be specifically designated as the spillover day that would be lost under this motion as drafted.

          I indicate that the two managers have had a discussion just before question time, recognising the loss of the spillover day because of the particular situation with public holidays and how estimates is scheduled. We are happy to look at Friday, 22 June, and to have a subsequent motion to address the spillover day, recognising that there may be reasons—I'm not predicting that there will be—why it couldn't be that particular day. I'm not aware of any, but we'll have those discussions, and our objective is to aim for Friday, 22 June.

          Question agreed to.
