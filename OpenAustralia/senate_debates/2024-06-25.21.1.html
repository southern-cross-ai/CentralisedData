        Within my duty electorate of Braddon is the picturesque town of Forth. Forth has a population of just 738 residents, and in the heart of the town stands the Bridge Hotel. The Bridge Hotel was built in 1872 and is one of the longest continually running establishments in Tasmania. Over the years 33 publicans have run the establishment, with the current owners, Trent and Tim, turning the Forth pub into a spot where all Australia's biggest artists want to come to perform. In a year we have seen some of the biggest festivals, like Splendour in the Grass and Grovin the Moo, are taking a break, and some capital cities are also taking a hit. Forth is busting the trend by selling out shows within a few hours of tickets being released. People are coming from all over Australia for the gigs at the Forth pub.

        , and just over the river, on the banks, is the footy ground where they have free camping. There aren't too many places in Australia where you can see some of the biggest names, such as the Whitlams, Peking Duk and the Jungle Giants, and camp right across the road for free. I want to take this time to congratulate Trent and Tim for hosting some of the biggest names in Australian music and for keeping the live music industry alive, which we do really well in Tasmania, particularly in the north-west, where we also have other venues that promote live music. Again, I congratulate Trent and Tim for hosting some of the biggest names in Australian music and keeping the industry alive.
