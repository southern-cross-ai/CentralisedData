         Firstly, I congratulate you,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
          Mr President
         </a>
         , on your appointment. Thank you very much, Senator Smith, for the question, and thank you also for your passion for and commitment to the people of the Kimberley.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since becoming Minister for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
          NDIS
         </a>
         six months ago, I've been listening and consulting widely on all aspects of the scheme. Recently I spent a week travelling across the Kimberley region to hear and see firsthand the impact of thin markets on how the NDIS is able to support people with disability in regional and remote communities. This included many meetings, such as the ones with staff, volunteers and organisers at the Yura Yungi Aboriginal Medical Service in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halls_Creek" rel="nofollow">
          Halls Creek
         </a>
         , the women's resource centre in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitzroy_Crossing" rel="nofollow">
          Fitzroy Crossing
         </a>
         , the Lions Outback Vision institute in Broome and the East Kimberley All Abilities Sports and Recreation program in Kununurra. I thank them all for their hospitality, their time and their openness. This allowed me to hear and see firsthand how the NDIS is transforming lives. However, it also allowed me to see firsthand the challenges in providing care and support in remote and regional communities.
        </p>
        <p>
         The negative impact on thin markets is very clear. The workforce shortages further exacerbate service availability. Average plan budgets in the Kimberley are actually around $10,000 higher than the national average, while utilisation is 20 per cent lower, at 51 per cent. Quite clearly, this needs to change nationally. I hope to bring forward legislation this year to start addressing these problems of thin markets by providing the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIA" rel="nofollow">
          NDIA
         </a>
         with more flexible commissioning models. The level and the quality of support received by any Australian on the NDIS should never ever be determined by where they live, but today, sadly, with thin markets, that is still the case.

           Minister, your visit to the Kimberley was indeed very, very well received and welcomed. What are the challenges for the National Disability Insurance Scheme in regional and rural communities across our country?

            Thank you very much, Senator Smith, for that question. The
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
             NDIS
            </a>
            fourth-quarter report shows that planned utilisation in the Kimberley region is 20 per cent lower than the national average, which, sadly, is not uncommon in remote communities in particular across Australia. That is the case not just for disability services but for the provision of all care and support services in remote communities.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are so many experiences from this trip that I will always remember. But, sadly, one is where my heart literally brokeâ€”meeting a quadriplegic participant in her 40s in a remote aged-care facility. She knows exactly how she wants to live her life: with her children. But, sadly, living so remotely, the life she wants to live is not yet possible. She has nowhere else to live to stay near community or get the supports that she needs so badly and that she's actually funded for in her NDIS packages. The upcoming changes to legislation will help us all address this.

               Thank you again, Senator Smith. To tackle the endemic issue of thin markets, we have to enable providers to operate effectively nationwide, no matter where they are delivering services. To do this, we have to build local workforces across regional and remote Australia for all types of care and support services, and this is a responsibility shared between the federal government and the state government. I'm delighted to be working with
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Turner" rel="nofollow">
                Pat Turner
               </a>
               and the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation to develop a model to deliver in new and different ways a wide range of care and support services in remote communities, including for
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
                NDIS
               </a>
               participants. Together we are developing a regional community based workforce model informed by the needs of locals to provide long-term employment opportunities and better support for people living in remote communities and also remote towns.
