         I thank Senator Paterson for his question and his strong interest, like all on this side of the chamber, in quality outcomes for Australian schoolchildren. Unfortunately, though, we have some challenges in literacy levels in Australian schools. If you look at the data over recent years, the Australian
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PISA" rel="nofollow">
          PISA
         </a>
         results, the international benchmark for assessment in these areas, have shown that reading standards between 2020 and 2012 have declined by some 16 points. Where once we were the fourth best performing country amongst those assessed, we are now coming 14th. That shows a decline in our relative performance, but that decline by some 16 points is also a decline in our real performance in outcomes for Australian students. Our
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPLAN" rel="nofollow">
          NAPLAN
         </a>
         results similarly showed that approximately 196,000 Australian school students are either at or below the bare minimum standard in their reading skills. Around 66,000 are in fact below. Of course reading skills are the foundation stone for so much other learning that occurs in a school. When we have these poor results in reading skills in the early stages that is a particular challenge for us.
        </p>
        <p>
         That is why our government, over the last few years, has sought to implement the review of the Australian curriculum; strengthen the focus on literacy; increase the presence of phonics and phonetic awareness in the Australian curriculum; implement the report of TEMAG, the Teacher Education Ministerial Advisory Group; and ensure that prospective teachers in future are equipped with a thorough understanding of the teaching of literacy and numeracy, including phonetic skills.
        </p>
        <p>
         All of this seeks to make sure that our record investment in Australian schools is actually being used on quality outcomes, to address real problems in our school systems.

            In the budget this year, the government released our commitment to further grow Australian school funding to record levels. But, at the same time, we outlined how we want to see and demonstrate that that investment is directed into areas in which it will make a real difference.

            statement identified a range of reforms, particularly the establishment of a national skills check for all children in year 1 across literacy and numeracy standards, including a phonics check. Such a check has been used in
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
             UK
            </a>
            schools since 2012, and evaluations demonstrate that the proportion of students now reaching the required standard in literacy has increased from 58 per cent in 2012 to 81 per cent most recently.
           </p>
           <p>
            That is a real demonstration that such measures can make a positive impact, with similar improvements shown for most disadvantaged students. This demonstrates that it is actually making a difference where it is most important. It is a simple check. It takes only a few minutes, but it can make a real difference.

               document. We have circulated it to key stakeholders, particularly principals and school leadership groups. We have formally presented it to state and territory ministers, seeking their feedback in terms of the implementation of these measures. We have had positive feedback from organisations such as dyslexia representatives and speech pathologist associations, and from experts such as Associate Professor Kay Margetts, from the Melbourne Graduate School of Education.
              </p>
              <p>
               We are working to make sure we get this measure right because it can make a real difference to learning outcomes for Australian schoolchildren. It can help to ensure that our record investments in Australian schools are used to make the best possible difference. It can build reading skills—and I trust that everybody in this chamber would agree that little can be more important than ensuring Australian schoolchildren learn to read effectively in their earliest years, providing an effective foundation stone for all of their educational experience.
