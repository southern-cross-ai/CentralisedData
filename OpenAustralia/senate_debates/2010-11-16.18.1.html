         I want to congratulate Senator Bernardi for asking this question. I am sure that he has had a discussion with Senator Joyce, sitting beside him. Senator Joyce’s views on the

               , on the point of order, that is just absolutely not true. What Senator Conroy is doing is replying to Senator Bernardi’s question about why the Labor government refuses to refer the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
                NBN

As I have said repeatedly, the complex task involved in switching your analog phone from the copper network across onto the new fibre network is as complicated as unplugging it from one socket and plugging it into a different socket. So let us be clear: the science involved is that simple. As I have said repeatedly, the pricing plans of the National Broadband Network—
