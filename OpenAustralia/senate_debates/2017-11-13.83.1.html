        , as one Victorian senator to another, may I offer my congratulations to you. I too have a question for Senator Cash, but in her ill-held portfolio of employment. On 25 October the minister told the Senate Education and Employment Committee at least five times that her office was not responsible for leaking the raids on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Workers_Union" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Workers Union
        </a>
        offices by the Registered Organisations Commission to the media. Given the minister's staff had the opportunity to correct her alleged ignorance of the facts during the morning tea break, the lunch break, the afternoon tea break, at her meeting with the Prime Minister or at any other stage through the day, does the minister really expect the Senate to believe she first became aware that her office tipped off the media during the dinner break?

           The point of order is on direct relevance. This minister has misled this chamber on five separate occasions and now wishes to engage in a personal attack on another senator in order to distract attention from her own failings. The principle of ministerial responsibility matters in our democracy, and she ought to answer the question.

             In answer to Senator Kitching's question, I answered the questions that were put to me based on the knowledge I had at the time. At the earliest opportunity, I came to the Senate estimates committee and I corrected the record—unlike you, Senator Kitching; you have never corrected the record. What did the Fair Work Commission find in relation to you, Senator Kitching? This what is the Fair Work Commission found:

            <p class="italic">
             On the totality of the evidence I find that Ms Kitching performed these tests.

            <p>
             In other words, she sat someone else's right-of-entry test. The commission went on:

The question was a very simple one: does the minister really expect the Senate to believe she first became aware that her office tipped off the media during the dinner break?

                         There has been a lot of noise at this end of the chamber. I did hear Senator Cash address that particular part of the question with respect to correcting evidence at the hearing. I think that in that sense the minister was directly relevant to the question that was asked. I might also say that when there are colourful and personal interjections, of the volume that they are, across the chamber, a minister is also entitled to address them in an answer.

                                 I thank senators for their contribution. My understanding of the practice in this chamber has been that ministers are allowed to address all or parts of a preamble or a question and expand on their answers with other material. However, Senator Wong, if I'm incorrect in the application of that in this case, I will again come back to the chamber and make a correction from the chair and do so quite humbly. I will happily look at the exact questions and the words that have been recorded in

That was clearly a personal reflection. This minister should actually answer the questions. She has not answered the question.

I believe those statements qualify as being directly relevant. I will review the question and the answer. I will also review past practice and ensure that any correction I come back to the chamber with, or what I just said, is entirely consistent with past practice of people in this chair. Senator Cash.
