        My question is to the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Government Service Delivery, Senator Arbib. Further to the question taken by the minister yesterday from Senator Marshall, can the minister explain why Mulgildie State School west of Bundaberg in my home state of Queensland received $250,000 under
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_the_Education_Revolution" rel="nofollow">

        specifically to build a basic 60-square-metre shed, having previously received a $29,000 quote from a local builder for a similar structure?

         Thank you for your question, Senator Mason. Before I answer the question, I am sure that Senator Mason would be happy to know that under the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_the_Education_Revolution" rel="nofollow">
          Building the Education Revolution
         </a>
         the federal government is spending $2.1 billion on 1,722 schools and 5,360 projects in Queensland. I am sure he would be happy to know that. I am happy to look into the issue that Senator Mason has raised. I also want to check the accuracy of the issue because I have been following the debate in the other place and a number of the issues that have been raised in there by the shadow minister for education have been proven outside question time to be 100 per cent incorrect. So, Senator Mason, I am very happy to have a look at the instance for you and come back to you with that, but I just want to make sure. We do want to get it right.

             The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate can shake his head but it is true—there is between $50,000 and $200,000 for every school across the country. It is funding that will fix their pipes and that will fix carpet. I was in Wodonga and I caught up with one of the local school principals there—I think it was Wodonga West. The floor of the kinder classroom had been eaten by—

There is direct employment and there is also indirect employment that is coming out of this stimulus. On the direct side, there are 35,000 individual projects across the country. What is this going to mean? It is going to mean work for tradespeople, work for contractors, work for carpenters and work for electricians. That is the action that the government is taking during the global recession. What are the indirect consequences? Suppliers will get a benefit out of this. Department stores—

                           They do not want to hear this. Under the previous government, guess what? Funding to education went backwards by five per cent. They cut funding in education.

The government is undertaking this funding because of the neglect of the previous government.
