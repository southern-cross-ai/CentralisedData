        <p>
         The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1)   As at 30 April 2011,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEEWR" rel="nofollow">
          DEEWR
         </a>
         employed 5472 staff.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2)   As at 30 April 2011, 147 who disclosed a disability.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3)   DEEWR's existing recruitment programs have been effective in attracting employees with disabilities. For example, the department's annual graduate intake has been successful in attracting graduates with disability from local universities. In addition the department has continued to participate in the 'Stepping Into Program" facilitated by the Australian Network on Disability (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AND" rel="nofollow">
          AND
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The department is also developing a pilot traineeship program for people with disability. Participants will be engaged under the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APS" rel="nofollow">
          APS
         </a>
         Special Measures Circular utilising Disability Employment Service providers.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4)   DEEWR has a range of supports in place for employees with a disability. Through our reasonable adjustment policy, DEEWR ensures that all new employees and existing employees who return to work after injury or illness receive the equipment (including assistive technology) they need to support them in the workplace. This also extends to modifying their physical environment to suit their individual circumstances.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         More generally, DEEWR promotes a supportive environment for employees with disability. For example the department has a Disability Employee Network supported by DEEWR's Disability Champion, Mr John Kovacic, Deputy Secretary, Workplace Relations.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         To increase disability confidence and awareness in the department, disability awareness sessions have been delivered for managers. Future additional sessions will focus on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_Health" rel="nofollow">
          Mental Health
         </a>
         and Workforce Wellbeing.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         DEEWR also raises awareness by celebrating significant events focusing on disability. For example DEEWR celebrated the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day" rel="nofollow">
          International Day
         </a>
         for People with Disability by inviting some prominent people with disability to share their inspiring stories with employees, and hosting an awareness forum together with disability support agencies such as
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Vision Australia
         </a>
         , Better Hearing Australia and members of the Disability Employment Network.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (5)   By successfully removing barriers for people with disability, DEEWR ensures that people with disability can fully participate in the workplace. This includes working with their managers to develop individual performance and development plans to access training and other development opportunities to achieve their career aspirations.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (6)   DEEWR's Disability Employment Plan 2009 – 2012 includes a target of 10% average annual growth in the number of employees with disability as a proportion of total employees.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (7)   DEEWR has the following specific policies to support staff with a disability:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         a. Reasonable Adjustment Policy
