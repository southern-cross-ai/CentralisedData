         I thank the opposition for their question in respect of this. In terms of the specifics of the question, I am happy to take it on notice and provide a response as the repping minister for this area. I can also say, in terms of providing information on where the funding goes, we—that is, the government—are building the health services after 11 years of neglect so that money can be utilised in a $10 billion health and hospital fund, which is one of the single biggest investments in health infrastructure ever; $3.2 billion in health and hospital reform, including $600 billion to slash elective surgery waiting lists; and $275 million to establish

          , I rise on a point of order. The minister was given a very specific question by Senator Watson. It related to a saving of $37.3 million by not proceeding with the Tasmanian health infrastructure plan, and the minister was asked simply to confirm it. For the minister to tell us about everything else that may or may not be in the health budget is possibly of interest but completely irrelevant to the very specific question as to whether or not the minister can confirm the savings.

            Order, Senator Macdonald! I am trying to respond to the point of order. Senator Ludwig, I did detect at the beginning of your answer that you said you would take the details of the question on notice, and you are now expanding outside of that. I would remind you of the question.

             Thank you. The answer was encompassing a response to a question about funding for Tasmania. The federal government will redirect the money into other health programs in the Tasmanian health system. The $37.3 million included $16 million for the

              Launceston General Hospital
             </a>
             . The government will spend the money on an integrated care centre at the Launceston General Hospital in patient and health related community transport and on an oncology service for the north and north-west. That is where the money will be directed.

              , I ask a supplementary question. Minister, you explain that the money will be spent, but I refer you to page 360 of Budget Paper No. 2, where it states, ‘This measure will provide savings of $37.3 million over five years.’ If it was going to be redirected, were the Tasmanian people notified before the election of this saving or redirection?

               As much as I can answer that, it is usual practice—and I think the opposition did this when they were in government—that matters relating to the budget are announced on budget night; they are not usually advised prior to that. What we did say prior to the election was that we would meet our election commitments but that the detail of those specific matters would be available from 7.30 on Tuesday night for people to read and examine.
              </p>
              <p>
               I am pleased to see Senator Watson has read Budget Paper No. 2. I am sure he has also looked at all the other commitments in the health portfolio that will assist Tasmanians more broadly. As I was saying, those health issues go to bringing total investment in health and ageing to over $50 billion for the first time, unlike the opposition when they were in government—
