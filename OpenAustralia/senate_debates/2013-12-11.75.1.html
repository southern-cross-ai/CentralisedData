                <p>
                 When he was the minister for industry and I was the shadow minister for industry, the Mitsubishi motor company left Australia, and it no longer manufactures here. I took the point of view that politics should not be played with the issue, and I did not seek to lay blame at the feet of the Labor government. It is a pity that Senator Carr cannot bring the same maturity and statesman-like approach to this issue.

                 </a>
                 's statement, I would invite the shadow minister to have a look at the second paragraph, which included, tragically and avoidably, the comment that one of the reasons was the 'high cost of production'. I wonder if energy costs might have had something to do with that? I wonder whether the carbon tax might have had something to do with that? I wonder whether the

                 </a>
                 might have had something to do with that? I wonder whether the rate of company tax might have had something to do with that?
                </p>
                <p>
                 And even if none of those had anything to do with that: talk about ripping money out of the car industry—who said this?

                <p>
                 It was said by none other than Senator Kim Carr himself! It was Senator Kim Carr himself voting no confidence in the previous Labor government in which he served as industry minister.

                      We actually listened to Senator Kim Carr, because when he was condemning the government of which he was a senior cabinet minister, and said that it was important to get a consistent government policy commitment, we thought it might be a good idea to get that consistency via a proper inquiry courtesy of the

                      </a>
                      —something that the former minister himself had six years to do, to get the sort of consistency that he acknowledges did not exist under his stewardship of the ministry.

                     <p>
                      And so we believed that it was an appropriate thing to do. Little did we realise that

                      was at the cusp of making its decision, which it has now announced. And can I simply say to the honourable senator that the Australian people will not believe that GM made this decision after 2½ months of coalition government, without any impact from the factor of six years of Labor government.

The reality is this is a devastating blow to thousands of Australian workers.
