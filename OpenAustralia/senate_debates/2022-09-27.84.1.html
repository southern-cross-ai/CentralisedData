        My question is to the Minister for Trade and Tourism, Senator Farrell. The tourism and travel industry has had a few challenging years. Given that today is

        , can the minister please provide an update on how the industry is faring?

         I thank Senator Sterle for his excellent question on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Tourism_Day" rel="nofollow">
          World Tourism Day
         </a>
         . It is, in fact, World Tourism Day today, and I'd like to say thank you to the dedicated people who work in our tourism and travel industry. Without you, we wouldn't have such a robust and vibrant tourism industry.
        </p>
        <p>
         The survival of tourism businesses and the growth that we've seen in the domestic tourism market is a testament to the hard work and dedication of those people who work in this industry. It has been a very tough few years for many travel and tourism businesses. Managing through the pandemic was no small feat, but Australians are back out enjoying some of our iconic regions, ticking things off their bucket lists and supporting local travel and tourism businesses.
        </p>
        <p>
         Tourism Research Australia's data shows that domestic tourism is actually booming. Many regions have surpassed where they were pre pandemic, and others are close to pre-pandemic levels. The previous government had all the wrong priorities. They had to be dragged kicking and screaming to introduce JobKeeper, and then they removed it from tourism businesses far too early, knowing that many were still struggling immensely.
        </p>
        <p>
         The growth seen in our domestic industry is a testament to the hard work of those who work in the visitor economy and their determination to keep the doors open and the tours operating. Again, I say thank you to every person who works in our tourism and travel sector.

            I once again thank Senator Sterle for his very important question. This government, unlike the previous government, understands the importance of the travel and tourism industry. That's why we've decided that, in the upcoming budget, we are going to invest in the recovery of this sector. Pre COVID, the visitor economy was worth about $166 billion annually, and it was growing faster than
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
             GDP
            </a>
            . It supported one in 12 Australians in work. Our $48 million tourism package aims to attract and train workers, upgrade caravan and camping infrastructure, increase the focus on business events and workâ€”

               That's an excellent question, Senator Sterle. Pre the pandemic, tourism employed almost one million Australians across every state and territory. It's a truly national industry which every jurisdiction has an interest in maintaining and growing, which is why I'm looking forward to meeting with my fellow tourism ministers at the upcoming ministerial meeting in Adelaide next week. We will be discussing ways that all governments can work together to support our tourism industry in all of the regions. There will be a focus on addressing the workforce and skills shortages, as well as issues facing aviation in our country. These are some of the largest problems facing the sector and unfortunately no region has been immune. They are not new issues, just ones that the last government simplyâ€”
