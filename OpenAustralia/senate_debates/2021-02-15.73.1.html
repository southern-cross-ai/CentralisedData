        My question is also to Senator Payne, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Will the minister update the Senate on the World Health Organization's recent mission to Wuhan and the Australian government's support to international efforts to prevent and, where necessary, respond to future pandemics such as COVID-19?

         I thank Senator Fawcett particularly for this important question, because, throughout COVID-19, the Australian government's sole focus has been on protecting the health and the wellbeing of all Australians. Our domestic response has been guided by expert health advice, and it has been amongst the most successful in the world.

         We believe that transparent scientific investigation of how this virus emerged is essential to preventing future global pandemics. Last week, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHO" rel="nofollow">
          WHO
         </a>
         -convened scientific team studying the origins of COVID-19 concluded its mission to Wuhan. Those investigations are, of course, critical. I particularly want to acknowledge and recognise the contribution of Australia's Professor Dominic Dwyer, a renowned microbiologist from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westmead_Hospital" rel="nofollow">

          Western Sydney

         . Australia has consistently advocated for the expert scientific team visiting China to have access to all data, information and key locations relevant to their inquiries. Australia join our key partners—including

          US
         </a>
         National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan—in reiterating the need for full access to all information relevant to determining how this pandemic emerged. While there was a lengthy press conference at the conclusion of the mission last week, we are yet to see a formal report with findings, analysis and recommendations for future work. We will consider those scientific findings carefully when they are released, and Australia reiterates again the need for transparency and independence throughout this process. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Assembly" rel="nofollow">
          World Health Assembly
         </a>
         resolution of May last year delivered a very clear mandate: to identify the source of the COVID-19 virus and how it was transmitted to humans. Our collective ongoing work is vital, as we all want to establish the origin and spread of this pandemic so that we can learn the lessons and prevent future devastating outbreaks of disease.

             WHO
            </a>
            . As a member of the WHO Executive Board, Australia has consistently advocated for the importance of principled collective action from the international community. I have discussed this work with the Director-General of the WHO, Dr Tedros, on a number of occasions and stated clearly that Australia will remain a constructive and pragmatic contributor to these efforts. Last month Australia joined the G7 and the Republic of Korea in calling for the strengthening and reform of the WHO to ensure that, with the continued strong support and involvement of its member states and the international community, it remains fit for evolving challenges.

               Australia remains closely engaged with the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response, led, of course, by the former Prime Minister of New Zealand Helen Clark and the former President of Liberia Ellen Johnson Surleaf. We've welcomed the independent panel's progress report of 19 January. Australia has advocated for strengthening the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHO" rel="nofollow">
                WHO
               </a>
               's authority to quickly access and investigate an outbreak, and our national submission to the panel focused clearly on building an independent and authoritative WHO, reducing the risk of zoonotic disease transmission and strengthening WHO operations on the ground. The panel's progress report stated that the WHO's power to validate reports of disease outbreaks and deploy resources to affected areas is gravely limited. Following the WHO investigation team's media conference last week, Australia will continue to advocate for a review and a report that is both thorough and credible.
