        Every single child deserves every opportunity to reach their greatest potential, and one of the most foundational aspects of raising healthy children is play. That's why, on 11 June, we celebrated the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day" rel="nofollow">
         International Day
        </a>
        of Play and why the Parliamentary Friends of Early Childhood hosted an event to celebrate it.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government has a crucial role in supporting every child's right to play, from access to playgroups, local community playgrounds and support for families to maternal health and so much more. Play is not optional but essential for healthy human development. It helps build healthy, connected communities, and, as a parent, it is absolutely magic to witness. Giving children free rein to direct their own play and see the curiosity, awe and wonder on their faces as they learn new skills and find their capacity to challenge themselves is one of the greatest joys of parentingâ€”indeed, it's where the magic happens.
       </p>
       <p>
        Encouraging play can help children build strong social relationships and learn fundamental skills like sharing, taking turns, conflict resolution, appreciating different perspectives, leadership, equality, inclusivity, empathy and so much more. The Albanese Labor government has developed the Early Years Strategy, with play listed as one of the eight outcomes. It will continue to work towards an Australia where children are provided with nothing less than every opportunity to reach their full potential, including through play. I'd like to acknowledge and thank the hardworking team at Play Australia for their advocacy in this space.

        Robyn Monro Miller has been a dedicated voice speaking on behalf of Australian children and their fundamental right to self-guided play. Indeed she was critical in expanding my understanding of the importance of self-guided and independent play. I've committed this month to parking my parental anxiety a bit more in the spirit of facilitating free and adventurous play and I encourage all families in the spirit of this day to foster a little more play in their lives.
