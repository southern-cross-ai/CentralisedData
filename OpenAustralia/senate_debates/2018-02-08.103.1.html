         I thank Senator Georgiou for his question and for some notice of the question. As I've said in the chamber before, this is a very complex legacy situation, faced not only by the Commonwealth's
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Defence
         </a>
         . I can confirm that I received Senator Georgiou's original letter, which I believe was dated 21 December, but it wasn't received in my office until 4 January. We have been in the process of investigating the issues which were raised in that letter, and I am finalising a response to the senator now and also to Minister Porter in the other place, who raised the same issues with me.

         As part of the environmental investigation that's been conducted at

         Base Pearce, the particular bore, which is located on the senator's constituent's property, was sampled on 18 October 2016. On 28 October 2016 the constituent was advised that the bore result was below the limit of detection—that is, a 'non-detect'. That means that their bore is also below the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FSANZ" rel="nofollow">

         —base guidance value for drinking water of 0.07 micrograms per litre
        </p>
        <p>
         In July of last year, the Defence department made follow-up contact with the senator's constituent, seeking consent to undertake further sampling of the bore. On 29 August last year, the department was advised that the constituent was seeking legal advice and that Defence should not engage with the constituent in any way. Defence has respected that request from the senator's constituent, and since August 2017 has not been in direct contact with them. I can advise the chamber and the senator that Defence would still like to re-sample the bore that is located on that property to confirm the initial results, if permission were to be given. I'm more than happy to discuss that matter further with Senator Georgiou.

           While affected families are being provided with bottled drinking water by Defence, apparently as a precautionary measure, residents have told me that they have no choice but to wash themselves and their children in water that potentially causes cancer. Why hasn't the department taken further precautionary steps to ensure that Australian children aren't being poisoned at the hands of the Defence department?

            As is the case in a number of investigation areas, I can advise the Senate that bottled water continues to be supplied to Senator Georgiou's constituent as a precautionary measure until the completion of the investigation, when the extent of the contamination will be known. I do note, for the record, that the current
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health" rel="nofollow">
             Department of Health
            </a>
            advice—the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
             Department of Defence
            </a>
            is not a health authority; we work in conjunction with the Department of Health on these matters—is that there is no consistent evidence that
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PFAS" rel="nofollow">
             PFAS
            </a>
            causes any specific illness, including, as the senator has adverted to, cancer. For further information on the Department of Health's response to PFAS contamination, I would direct the senator to the Minister for Health.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the letter there are two possible solutions for drinking water mentioned at the property. While I do note that request, such solutions are usually only provided to properties that have a bore sample that exceeds the health-based guidance values recommended by
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FSANZ" rel="nofollow">
             FSANZ
            </a>
            . There is a human health risk assessment currently underway, which will consider drinking water in the whole of the Bullsbrook community.

               I, of course, continue to have ongoing discussions with my ministerial colleagues across a range of portfolios on this issue, and the Defence department stands ready to assist in whatever capacity it is asked to do by government. As the senator has alluded to, the task force managing the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PFAS" rel="nofollow">
                PFAS

               issue is a

                Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet
               </a>
               task force, which is leading the whole-of-government response to contamination across Commonwealth sites. Its work was adverted to in the response tabled by Senator McGrath earlier this week.
              </p>
              <p>
               I note, as I said in my earlier remarks, that this is a very complex legacy issue. It doesn't just impact Defence sites. In fact, around Australia we know that it is impacting aviation sites, industrial waste facilities, fuel storage facilities, chemical storage facilities, fire authorities—and there have been a number of reports on that. The department works closely with other members of the Commonwealth agencies that form the task force, and we'll support communities as best we can.
