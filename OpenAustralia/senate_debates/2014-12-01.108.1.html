           This proposal would result in a costly and senseless duplication of work already conducted by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties—the specialist committee established to deal exclusively with treaties. Extensive parliamentary inquiries have already been conducted into the treaties process. Key reforms, including the establishment of JSCOT, were implemented by the Howard government. The most recent inquiry took place two years ago. Establishing another inquiry now would be a waste of resources. The proposal is consistent with the previous government's style of operation. It is useful to recall that treaty making is an executive function of government rather than the function of parliament. In spite of this, the parliamentary processes already in place have highlighted the extent of the consultation process with stakeholders. This includes JSCOT's consideration of both the KAFTA and the JAEPA.

              Nearly two years ago, the Greens proposed a similar inquiry to this to look at the treaty process and how we might open it up and improve it. We have had numerous discussions with Labor and various members of the Foreign Affairs Defence and Trade Committee. Earlier today we sat down with Senator Gallacher and agreed to some amendments to support this motion, but I understand those amendments have not been made.

              will not be supporting this until we have had those amendments agreed to by Labor.

               Mr Deputy President, I would seek some advice. The process had been working in consultation with the Greens, and we have agreement on the amendments. We thought we had agreement from the chair of the Foreign Affairs Defence and Trade Legislation Committee and so we were proceeding on the basis that this would not be opposed. But we now find—

                   We were proceeding on the basis that there was consensus in respect of this, including consensus on some amendments from the Greens. I have been dealing with the chair of the legislation committee as late as during question time and so I am a bit bemused about why we now appear to have opposition to what I thought was agreed. Perhaps if Senator Fifield could confirm the government's position.
