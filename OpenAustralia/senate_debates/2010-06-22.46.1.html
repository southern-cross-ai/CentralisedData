         Special Minister of State
        </a>
        , Senator Ludwig. I refer to the minister’s decision to exempt the advertising campaign on the great big new tax on mining from Labor’s own regulations. Given that the department had already drafted the ministerial statement 10 days prior to the announcement, why did the minister claim that it took another four days to draft a statement, the timing of which just happened to coincide with the end of estimates?

         Let’s not lose sight of what this is really about. Some companies and the opposition are running a multimillion dollar scare campaign against this government’s tax reform package. This government makes no apology for standing up for the best interests of Australians. But in order to clear up these myths, I reject the assertion of Senator Ronaldson or the Liberal Party that I or any official in the department misled the Senate or any committee. We did not withhold information from Senate estimates. It is outrageous—

            It is outrageous that Senator Ronaldson seeks to smear my reputation and the reputation of the department, as well as that of the members of the Independent Communications Committee. It is a blatant attempt by those opposite to cover up their own gross incompetence on this. If the senators would like a lesson on how the Senate works and on how Senate estimates work, the opposition gets to ask the questions and we get to answer them. It is not a show-and-tell. But, if you want to, we can turn it into a show-and-tell. The proper process is as simple as that.
           </p>
           <p>
            I do not want to deal with the Liberal’s smear campaign. Let me deal with the facts of this matter. The facts in this case are simple and well documented. I granted the exemption on 24 May 2010, I wrote to the Treasurer setting out my decision and I tabled a statement of reasons on 28 May. At this time the Senate estimates process was not complete. Questions could still be put on notice. There were estimates the following week and, like all of these things, I agreed to hold another estimates so that you could ask the questions again, which you then—

                I note that there is an order for production of documents that comes up tomorrow. But let me deal with the facts of this matter. This government, as I have said, makes no apology for standing up for the interests of working Australians. There is a real hunger out there in the community to know more about the reforms and what they do to strengthen our economy. Our tax plan will ensure that a fairer share of the proceeds of the resources boom is invested in a stronger economy for all Australians.

                       . Of course, the decision to exempt the tax campaign was made in accordance with the guidelines on government advertising, and the government has been completely open in its actions.

                        , I ask a further supplementary question. Given the minister’s failure to answer any questions today, wasn’t the delay in tabling just a cheap political ploy to avoid Senate scrutiny and aren’t you, the Treasurer and the Prime Minister duly exposed for what you are?

                         Last time we were here was at estimates. They had the opportunity of asking questions in relation to it and failed to ask relevant questions. Again, they had the ability to put questions on notice. Let’s see if he has actually put anything on notice or if he just wants to continue to run the smear campaign that he is now running. Under the Liberals there were no checks and balances at all. Under the Liberals in 2007 the Howard government spent $254 million. What the opposition want to do is whinge about our guidelines. They do not have any guidelines. They do not have any policy on this. They cannot walk both sides of the street on this. They have to come clean. Do you have a policy on this at all, or do you just want to continue your smear campaign?
