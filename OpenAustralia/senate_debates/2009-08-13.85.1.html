        My question is to the Minister for

         Climate Change
        </a>
        and Water, Senator Wong. Now that the minister’s flawed and rushed emissions trading scheme has been defeated, will the government give a commitment that this legislation will not be reintroduced before the UN climate change meeting at Copenhagen in December?

        <p>
         I thank Senator Abetz for the opportunity to remind him of the commitment we have given. We will bring this back. We will bring this legislation back because, whilst those on the other side want to continue to deny that climate change is real and continue to be divided on this issue, we are firm in our resolve to do the right thing, to do what we told Australians before the last election we would do and to pass this legislation. I remind those opposite what happened here today. One of the major political parties kept its election commitment. Labor senators voted to reduce Australia’s carbon pollution under a cap-and-trade scheme.

                I remind everyone in the chamber what occurred here today. Those of us on this side of the chamber voted to reduce Australia’s carbon pollution, voted to ensure we reduce our contribution to climate change and voted in accordance with our election commitment. Those opposite voted to ensure that Australia’s emissions continue to rise and to ensure that Australia’s contribution to climate change continues to worsen and contrary to their election commitment. That is what has occurred here today. We know the reason for it is not that they have any sensible policy because not a single amendment on this issue of national importance was put forward by them. Seriously, how extraordinarily weak, how extraordinarily lazy and how extraordinarily arrogant it is to come in here after a year and a half and not even respect the parliamentary process enough to back your position with an amendment—not a single amendment. Australians understand that you are all at sea and completely divided on climate change.

                  congress has already passed a cap-and-trade scheme through its House of Representatives. I can confirm that the leading economies of the world and the declaration at the G8 made clear that cap-and-trade was the way to go—strong endorsement that cap-and-trade was the way to go. It is a little bit like deja vu. I am reminded of the excuses that those opposite, when in government, kept giving the Australian people about why they should not ratify Kyoto.

                       , I ask a further supplementary question. Can the minister advise whether China, Japan and/or the United States are part of the European Union? Further, can I ask: given that none of our top three trading partners—namely, China, Japan and the United States—will have an emissions trading scheme in place before Copenhagen and given that the

                       and the United States have both said that having an emissions trading scheme in place is not necessary in order to achieve a global deal, will the government undertake not to reintroduce the Australian emissions trading legislation before Copenhagen?

                        I will make two very simple points. First, there are a range of factual errors, again, in Senator Abetz’s question. As usual, if the truth does not help, they will make something up. The second point is this: I wonder if Senator Abetz was in the party room when

                          : what Senator Abetz has put forward is a six-part question, if I counted correctly. Senator Wong went to it in the first instance and dealt with one of the points specifically and, also within the ambit of the question, rejected that part of the question, which was in fact spuriously put. I submit that the premise of the question was unsustainable and, on that basis, Senator Wong was within the ambit of the question and her answer was directly relevant to the question. As I understand it, Senator Wong has about 30 seconds left to finish answering the six-part question.
