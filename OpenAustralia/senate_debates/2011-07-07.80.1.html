               : it is clear once again that those opposite, and Senator Brandis, have predetermined what the answer should be, and they seek to get you to enforce the answer they want.

                 I am aware of the question, because the question which I am answering is this—if those opposite have been listening for some time. But they are closed to the answer, because the answer is that the export permits now have a regulatory regime in place. When an exporter requests a permit, comes forward and can demonstrate they meet those requirements, then the permits will be issued and they will be able to use their Indonesian permits, and the trade will recommence. It is a clear process. Those opposite, of course, would want the trade to recommence without the supply chain assurance and without safeguards that animals will not be mistreated as we saw on that video on

                 </i>
                 . What those opposite are arguing for is an immediate resumption of the trade from day one, or a continuation of the trade. What this government has put in place is a supply chain assurance which demonstrates that we have tracking, transparency and independent auditing of that supply chain so that people such as Elders or Wellard, who are near ready as I am informed, can come forward to the department—to the regulator—and have the supply chain assurance conditions met. When they are met, they will then be able to recommence the trade. It is a simple proposition. It is difficult to see why the opposition do not understand that, but it is a simple proposition: as soon as Elders, Wellard or other companies want to seek an export permit—

                  , I ask a supplementary question. Given that the government's blanket ban has caused the loss of up to three of the prime six months for Australia's north to turn off cattle for export to Indonesia, what is this government doing to help industry—cattle producers, transport operators, saleyards, stevedores and everyone in the supply chain—to shorten the lead time to restart our live cattle export industry.

                   There is no doubt that the industry as a whole will be working quickly and diligently to ensure that companies such as Elders—those seeking export permits—will be able to meet the supply chain requirements and recommence the trade as quickly as possible. In doing so, they will then be able to manage the recommencement to ensure that the live animal export industry continues for the longer term—what I have consistently said is the outcome for the industry. The industry has advised me that the best outcome for them is for this trade to recommence—

                    , objection—relevance. My question is clearly not about the industry. It is clearly about what the government is doing to shorten the lead time to get this industry off its knees and back into operation.

                      . What those opposite fail to really appreciate in this is that it is now for industry to come forward and demonstrate that they meet those conditions within the export control licence and meet the supply chain assurance for this supply to open as quickly as it can, because the best form of assistance for this industry is for this trade to recommence for the longer term.

                       , I have a further supplementary question for the minister. Given that the minister was sidelined in negotiations by the foreign minister,

                        (Queensland—) (): May I reject the question outright. What has been occurring is that the Minister for Trade, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I have been working diligently to recommence this trade as quickly as possible. The Prime Minister and I have consistently said that we would not wait one moment, when we did not have to, to recommence the trade. As soon as the industry working group had finalised the draft standards, Indonesia had indicated that it was ready to meet the

                        guidelines, the standards were in place, the export control permits were in place—when all of those had come together late yesterday afternoon, I was not going to wait one moment to let the trade recommence as quickly as it can. Those opposite would want us to delay. Those opposite would want us to continue without starting the trade. I reject their suggestion completely.
