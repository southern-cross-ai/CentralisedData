               . I beg your pardon. That's correct. It does already have a significant workload. I will say that many of us who are working on the Medicare levy and
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
                NDIS

               committee are also members of the community affairs committee. There will be a workload regardless of which committee it goes to. I think it's fair enough, given the significance of the bills and the workload that we all have already, that this reporting date be accepted.

                The government sees this as a very important piece of legislation. We recognise the desire of the Senate to have this referred to a committee for inquiry, but we seek, obviously, a shorter time frame in which that work can happen.
