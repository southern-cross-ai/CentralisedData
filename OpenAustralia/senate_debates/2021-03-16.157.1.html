        Response:

       <p class="italic">
        The JobKeeper Payment has provided unprecedented support to millions of Australians. However, JobKeeper was always intended to be emergency temporary support and is just one part of the Government's economic response to support Australians during the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis. JobKeeper was designed to deliver support quickly and at scale and it has achieved its objective of keeping business in business and Australians in jobs. The next phase of the recovery is to create incentives for businesses to hire. The Treasury closely monitors the labour market' as a matter of course, and employment outcomes have been stronger than expected in the months since the most recent forecasts were published. This includes a steady reduction in the number of people working reduced hours for economic reasons. Analysis of the labour market to-date shows a very large proportion of employees who rolled off JobKeeper support in September have remained employed. In the region of Cairns, specifically, the most recent data shows that the number of people relying on JobKeeper has fallen by 55 per cent.
