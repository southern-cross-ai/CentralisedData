         I thank Senator Stewart for her question. I welcome the report tabled last week from the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee. The inquiry has shone a light on a harrowing set of stories experienced by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          First Nations
         </a>
         women and children. I know the Senate inquiry held a large number of hearings across the nation, and I take the time to acknowledge the Chair, Senator Scarr, and the Deputy Chair, Senator Green, and, in particular, the passion and determination of Senator Cox.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to thank the many families and organisations who gave evidence at the hearings and to acknowledge the unspeakable pain behind every story shared as part of the inquiry—to acknowledge the real and significant grief experienced by families and entire communities. To those who have come forward to share their experiences with the committee: I want to assure you that we see you and we hear you; we hear your stories and we certainly see your pain. It takes bravery to share these stories and it takes great strength. We know that families have been seeking answers for a very long time, some for many decades—over 50 years. We thank you for sharing your experiences with the committee. I also thank the committee members for your dedication to listening to these stories and for delivering a set of recommendations for the government to consider.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are many recommendations, spanning a number of critical areas, that need to be addressed. Our government is committed to carefully working through the recommendations in this inquiry.

            Our government will carefully work through the recommendations put forward. I will certainly work closely with my colleagues across the government, with the Attorney-General and with the Minister for
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
             Social Services
            </a>
            as a starting point. We will take the time to consider the recommendations put forward.
           </p>
           <p>
            The report makes clear the scale of the problem experienced by
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
             First Nations
            </a>
            women—experiences of violence, compounded by racism and the very institutions that are meant to help. We know First Nations women continue to experience disproportionately high levels of violence and First Nations women are 34 times more likely to be hospitalised and six times more likely to die from family and domestic violence than non-Indigenous women across the country—horrific figures.
           </p>
           <p>
            We are working, and determined, to turn these figures around. Strong and safe First Nations families are a key focus of the National Agreement on Closing the Gap.

The action plan is supported by $194 million to fund specific actions and support the safety of First Nations women and children, like funding the family violence prevention legal services and increasing prevention services, programs and campaigns for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children.
