              <p class="italic">
               In scrutinising this instrument against established principles of personal rights and parliamentary propriety, the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances (the committee) noted that it replaced, in similar terms, a previous instrument that expired at the end of January 2011. Given the period in which it appeared that no exemption was in operation, the committee sought advice from the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport (the minister) as to whether any person had been disadvantaged during that period. The minister subsequently advised that CASA was not aware of the extent to which persons were affected.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               The committee was not able to determine on the basis of this response whether or to what extent persons may have been disadvantaged by the gap between exemptions, and has written to the minister seeking further clarification of this matter.
