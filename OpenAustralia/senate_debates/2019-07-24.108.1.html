        showed the heartbreaking stories of families torn apart by China's mass incarceration of Uygurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang. More than one million people have been put in massive internment camps, including those who call Australia home and those with relatives in Australia. Minister, I welcome your intervention to request that Sadam Abudusalamu's wife and baby son be allowed to travel to Australia. As far as the government is aware, how many Australian citizens are currently in Xinjiang, and what is your government doing to secure the release of other Australians and their families, like fast-tracking visa processes?

         I thank Senator Di Natale for his question. In relation to the numbers of Australian citizens or permanent residents of Australia who may be in Xinjiang, we are aware of a number of cases where people have travelled to the region. Some of those have Australian connections, such as spouse visas or associations like that. If Australian family members have requested us to, we have made inquiries with Chinese authorities regarding the whereabouts of those individuals. I won't go into further specifics, because there are of course privacy obligations attached to these matters.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is also important to note that, where we're talking about noncitizens—those who have Australian connections or are permanent residents but are not citizens—there are limits as to what Australia is able to do in terms of the level of consular assistance that we are able to provide to those individuals.

             Perhaps the minister could clarify the question of just how many citizens there are? I think you mentioned 'several'. If you've got a number, I'd appreciate that.

              I thank Senator Di Natale for his questions. I don't have a confirmed number of individuals, and it does move around because different cases are notified to us at different times, so I would not like to venture an inaccurate number in terms of that. Australia has taken this situation and raised this situation in the most serious of ways. The senator has referred to our statement in the

              Council, of which we are a member. We continue to engage with Chinese authorities, particularly in relation to consular matters—and any support that we also seek for those who are not Australian citizens but are associated with China. In terms of next steps, we seek the support of the government in China—and we have continued to do so—for an opportunity to visit the region and to enable others to visit the region—which they have indicated in the past there is some preparedness to do.

                Thank you, Minister. I would ask that you take the question of the number of Australian citizens currently in Xinjiang on notice. Minister, given the devastating scale of repression, when will the Australian government impose targeted sanctions, like visa bans and asset freezes, against those linked to abuses in Xinjiang? What will it take for the government to take action in the face of these horrific and gross violations?
