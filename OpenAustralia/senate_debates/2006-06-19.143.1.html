        I rise tonight to speak on a matter of some sadness, and that is the passing of Mr
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Farley" rel="nofollow">
         Rick Farley
        </a>
        . Rick Farley died on 13 May in a tragic accident just months after he was severely debilitated by a brain aneurism. I thought it appropriate to take the opportunity to put on record Mr Farley’s achievements and to express, on behalf of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Democrats" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Democrats
        </a>
        , our regret and our sympathy to his family: his partner,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Burney" rel="nofollow">
         Linda Burney
        </a>
        , and his children, Jeremy and Cailin.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rick was a man of immense talents who fought his battles with logic, intelligence, goodwill, justice and a great deal of optimism. He had a diverse and very successful career that will be best remembered for his commitment to conservation and for his compassion and enthusiasm for Indigenous people. He started his working life as a journalist, at some stage he was an actor and he worked as a staffer in the Whitlam government before joining the Cattlemen’s Union.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rick went on to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Farmers_Federation" rel="nofollow">
         National Farmers Federation
        </a>
        , where he was executive director from 1988 to 1995. It was during his time with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFF" rel="nofollow">
         NFF
        </a>
        that Rick Farley, along with NFF president Graham Blight, negotiated with the Keating government on native title legislation that followed the 1992 High Court Mabo decision, which gave
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
         Indigenous Australians
        </a>
        some rights to their land. During his time with the NFF he also skilfully handled the Mudginberri industrial dispute and oversaw the creation of the national farmers fighting fund. After the native title legislation was finalised, Mr Farley continued his dedication to Indigenous causes. In 1991 he became a member of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation and served as a member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Title_Tribunal" rel="nofollow">
         Native Title Tribunal
        </a>
        , speaking out and advocating for Indigenous interests and Indigenous causes even more.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of Rick’s greatest achievements was when, along with Phillip Toyne, he became the architect of the volunteer national Landcare movement, which will live on in his absence. He saw the opportunity for a sustainable Australia well ahead of others and he worked with two great traditional adversaries—the environment movement and the National Farmers Federation—to bring to the government a proposal for a decade of land care. The $320 million that was originally committed to Landcare has grown to over $1 billion, which has gone towards helping farmers and communities manage the land in a responsible and sustainable manner.
       </p>
       <p>
        Throughout his career, Mr Farley was recognised by many as an extraordinary alliance builder who worked hard to build bridges and break down barriers. Through his goodwill, determination and commitment to overcoming what could appear to be irreconcilable differences, he was able to bring together the interests of pastoralists and farmers with those of Indigenous Australians. It is worth repeating the words he used in his 2003
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        address:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Unless the relationships between our citizens are respectable and inclusive, we are a divided and diminished society.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1993, Rick Farley called for an environment levy as part of the tax system, saying that natural resources should be used in a sustainable way. If not, he said, ‘our economic, social and even our spiritual security will inexorably be diminished’. Mr Farley was always willing to listen to all viewpoints and to try and understand people’s positions. He also had a tilt at a formal political career, almost taking the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">

        Senate seat for the Democrats in 1998, with about 16 per cent of the primary vote.
       </p>
       <p>
        We will miss him. It is a tragedy for his partner, Linda, for his children and for all those who knew him that he died at such an extremely young age. It is also a loss for the country. Rick Farley made a difference and he would have continued to make a difference if he had been able to continue his life’s work. His loss will be sorely felt by many.
