        My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Gallagher. On Tuesday, in response to a question from Senator McGrath, you said that in many countries inflation peaked higher than it did in Australia. You went on to say, 'So, it would make sense that our return to inflation to a target range will be later than in those other countries.' Minister, why is inflation staying higher for longer in Australia than in countries where it hit an even higher peak?

         The point I made earlier in the week is the correct point—that the inflation challenge arrived in this country later than it did in similar economies around the world. Obviously when your inflation challenge is going along the trajectory that we have seen in this country it will take time to come down. That's what we've seen in other countries as well. That is what happens. In many of those countries it peaked higher than it peaked here, and it is tapering off now, as it is here in Australia.

           Well, I'm sorry if you don't accept the data, but that is what the data shows. The government has the responsibility to deal with this inflation challenge that we inherited from the failure of your government to make the necessary investments, particularly in the productive side of the economy and also in areas like the energy transition, and others, which you failed to address. We are now addressing it, and we are ensuring that the decisions we take don't add to the inflation challenge in the economy. That has been supported—as much as you don't like to admit it—by the new
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">
            Reserve Bank
           </a>
           governor, by the Treasury secretary and by the ABS in the data that they have provided on the monthly inflation figures, where we've seen that the decisions that this government took to put downward pressure on inflation, despite your opposition to it, have actually taken half a per cent off
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPI" rel="nofollow">
            CPI
           </a>
           . That is the result of the decisions that the government have taken, and we're doing that, we're repairing the budget and we're investing in the productive side of the economy—dealing with housing, skills and the energy transition all at same time.

              Thank you. The language I used—and it seems to have confused those opposite—is language that I've used for some time in this place, and, indeed, for the Treasurer. I would draw your attention to the

                 The government has a plan; you just choose to ignore it. You just choose to ignore it and oppose it at the same time and then criticise us. That's your plan—ignore, oppose and criticise. Meanwhile, we're rolling out cost-of-living relief, getting the budget in much better shape and investing in energy, skills and housing.
