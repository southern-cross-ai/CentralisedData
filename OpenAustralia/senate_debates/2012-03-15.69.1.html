             Given the Prime Minister's announcement yesterday of the coalition's policy of a national small business commissioner, can the minister explain how this new position will fix the problems currently faced by Australian small businesses like the abolition of the entrepreneurs tax offset and new cost burdens associated with the carbon tax—problems that were all created by the Gillard government?

                  As I was saying, through the commissioner, small business owners will be able to access information, advice and referral to services, including business advisory services and dispute resolution services. The commissioner will work with the minister to ensure government agencies take into account the needs of small business, including ways in which we can manage the regulatory burden on them. The commissioner will also work with other jurisdictions to promote effective partnerships to complement services to small businesses. We expect the commissioner will be appointed in the second half of 2012 and will officially begin on 1 January 2013.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The announcement follows the appoint­ment of the first small business minister to cabinet and shows how seriously the Gillard government takes the needs of small business. In contrast to the premise of the question by the senator opposite, this government actually cares about business. They contribute an enormous amount. There are 2.7 million small businesses in Australia and we are obviously doing far more to service their needs than we have ever got from those opposite. Last year, for example, the government consulted with small business people, their peak organisations and state and territory governments on options—for example, the dispute resolution services. The establishment of a commissioner and advocate was well established back then, so this is an example of the Gillard Labor government responding to the needs of small business, not completely ignoring them, like those senators opposite.

                   Given this, does the government understand the concerns of three in four businesses surveyed by the Queensland Chamber of Commerce and Industry who believe the carbon tax will have a negative impact on their business? Does the government understand that 84 per cent of businesses surveyed want the carbon tax scrapped altogether? Will the government listen to those complaints from small business?

                    Those opposite have an absolute hide asking questions about small business as though they have their interests at heart. For example, yesterday the member for

                    We recognise, of course, that the carbon price will impact on some business costs. There has been a lot of exaggeration from one side of the debate, but the fact is that the overall price impact is modest at 0.7 per cent. It is true that there will be some cost increases around 10 per cent, but that is why businesses, we expect, will pass on those costs where they cannot change production, and that is why we are providing $15 billion of household assistance over four years, $15 billion dollars in the pockets of people who spend their money—

                             Given that in 2009-10 there were over 300,000 jobs lost in the small business sector and that today small business start-ups are falling at record rates and small business owners are facing increasingly high operating costs, why is the government placing even more burdens on small business, in particular through the world's biggest carbon tax? Why won't you listen to small business about that complaint?

                              Again, let's not let the facts get in the way of a good scare campaign from those opposite. We have seen today the Shopping Centre Council of Australia making clear that the clause the coalition is alluding to here was included in leases for small businesses once the debate began on the need to combat greenhouse gas emissions. So it was in the leases when the coalition actually supported pricing carbon. What we know is that this contrivance that somehow the carbon price is going to impact on small business is a complete furphy. The Shopping Centre Council of Australia made that very clear today. The coalition has been left with egg all over its face as a result of that coming to light.

                              As I said before, it is the Gillard Labor government that is speaking to small business, listening to small business, responding to their needs, delivering as far as our commitment goes, which is not—
