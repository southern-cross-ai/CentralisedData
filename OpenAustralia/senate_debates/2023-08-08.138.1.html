        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Wong. Given it has been nearly a decade since there was a long-term international development policy to drive the government's development assistance, can the minister outline how the Albanese government is restoring Australia's international leadership and advancing Australia's interests in a peaceful, stable and prosperous region through our new international policy, and how this will ensure we are a partner of choice in our region?

         I thank Senator Bilyk for her question, for her interest in this matter, and I thank all of my colleagues for their support for a development program that serves both our national interest and the interests of our partner countries. We do believe, on this side of the chamber, that we should deploy all elements of our national power to advance Australia's interests, to shape our region and the world for the better. The new international development policy is the first long-term policy in almost a decade. It will deliver a development program that is effective, responsive, transparent and accountable.
        </p>
        <p>
         We've all spoken in this place and beyond about how we face the most challenging strategic circumstances in many generations. That's why we have to deploy all aspects of our national power, all tools of state craft to help shape the region we want, a region that reflects Australia's national interests and the shared interests of the region. That includes our development program because development underpins stability. Minister Conroy and I, in government, have had a clear purpose of revitalising Australia's development policy and funding. Australia will offer genuine partnerships based on respect, listening and learning from each other. We will support local leaders to create local solutions while contributing to our own strengths, our economy, our institutions and the connections and knowledge of Australians.
        </p>
        <p>
         After an unfortunate decade of denial and disrespect from those opposite, we are committed to working respectfully with our regional partners. We are committed to supporting our regional partners address the biggest threat to our region, which is climate change. New targets will also ensure our development assistance tackles climate impacts and improves the lives of women and girls. A new performance and delivery framework will guide the implementation of policy. It is an international development policy fit for the challenges and opportunities of our time.

           Thank you for that answer, Minister. I've noticed that the Albanese government has delivered long-term growth to Australia's official development assistance program over the last two budgets. Can the minister outline how the Albanese government has rebuilt and stabilised Australia's development program?

            What we know is those opposite, for nine long years, played the toxic politics of negative globalism. It is the same sort of strategy we've seen from them on so many issues when the national interest is engaged. On this front, we saw the slashing of our development assistance by $11.8 billion. Despite our region becoming more competitive, those opposite refused to reverse their cuts to development. And do you know what those cuts did? They damaged our credibility. They damaged our national interest. They were a reduction in Australia's influence and national power, and they left a vacuum for others to fill.
           </p>

            Over two budgets, the Albanese government has rebuilt the

            program, an important step towards the goal of making Australia more influential and stronger in the world. We look forward—

              Thank you again, Minister. I understand the Albanese government engaged extensively with stakeholders on the international development policy and development finance review. Can the minister outline some of the responses from the sector who have waited almost a decade for a long-term development policy?
