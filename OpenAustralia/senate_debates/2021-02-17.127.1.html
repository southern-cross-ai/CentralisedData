         The speech read as follows—

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Today I am pleased to introduce the Industry Research and Development Amendment (Industry Innovation and Science Australia) Bill 2021. The amendment will officially change the name of Innovation and Science Australia (known as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISA" rel="nofollow">
         ISA
        </a>
        ) to Industry Innovation and Science Australia (known as IISA).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Since 2016, ISA has provided strategic, whole-of-system advice on the Government's investment in science, research and innovation, with a view to enhance the performance of Australia's innovation system.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As the Government's premier strategic advisory body on industry innovation, the refreshed IISA will play a pivotal role in guiding and advocating for Government policies and programs to drive economic recovery and growth – in particular our $1.5 billion Modern Manufacturing Strategy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The passage of this Bill renaming ISA to IISA therefore marks a simple but significant step in implementing these transformational policies.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The inclusion of industry in IISA's name is an important signal to stakeholders in both the private and public sectors.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It acknowledges the critical role that innovation and science play in enabling competitive Australian industries and driving a productive, resilient and prosperous economy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It highlights our commitment to seeking the best expert advice on these matters; to supporting genuine and practical innovation in Australian priority sectors; and to ensuring sovereign capability and industry resilience – particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for quick and robust economic recovery.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The passage of the Bill will underscore IISA's function as a direct voice for strategic industry input to government on policy development, implementation and evaluation. The name change is backed up by recent appointments to the IISA Board with strong Australian industry experience and networks, and an updated Statement of Expectations for the Board's work going forward.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Finally, the name change also clarifies the role of IISA in relation to our other expert advisory bodies, such as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Science_and_Technology_Council" rel="nofollow">
         National Science and Technology Council
        </a>
        , allowing for more effective and productive collaboration in future.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I commend this Bill to the Chamber.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned to 11 May 2021, in accordance with standing order 111.
