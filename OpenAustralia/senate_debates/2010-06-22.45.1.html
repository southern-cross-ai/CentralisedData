           I thank Senator Moore for that question and for the work she has done and her committee has done across the party divide in terms of Indigenous affairs and Indigenous employment. Last week I outlined to the Senate the changes in the ABS data regarding unemployment and that unemployment had decreased in this country to 5.2 per cent, that we had seen 36,000 full-time jobs created and also a big increase in the number of hours worked. At the same time as that, though, I have a great concern and I know the government has a great concern about the high rates of Indigenous unemployment. We know that the rate of Indigenous unemployment is three times—

             As I was saying, while unemployment has been dropping, at the same time Indigenous unemployment is obviously still concerning. We have seen an increase in Indigenous unemployment, there is no doubt about that, during the global financial crisis. That is why the government has been working so hard with the corporate sector, with

Through the Indigenous Employment Program, the $750 million program that has been reformed, there have been 18,000 training and employment placements since 1 July. The government is also working on the other side to increase the number of Indigenous businesses. That is why we are working with organisations such as the Australian Indigenous Minority Supplier Council, AIMSC, to increase—

                  Thank you for the question. There has been a big improvement in the work that is being undertaken by the private sector, and government needs to do its bit too. Government across the country needs to do its bit to lift its level of Indigenous employment. We have set a target of 2.7 per cent of the public sector being made up of Indigenous employees by 2015. As yet, all governments are far from meeting that target. To reach this target different departments and agencies have been working with the

Minister, can you please provide the Senate with some further information about this program? Who is involved, what will the students be doing when they are visiting us and what sorts of things will they learn while they are with us?

                    Under the Learn Earn Legend! voluntary work experience program, we have a hundred young Indigenous students from across the country working right now in MPs’ and senators’ offices but also in departmental agencies learning about what life is like in the political system and what life is like in government. There are a number of these young work experience students in the gallery right now. I thank them for the work they have done and for the efforts they have taken to get here from across the country. From WA in particular there are 31 trainees. I say to the two work experience students from my office, Dale and Alice: it has been fantastic having you and thank you very much for being here in the Senate today. This is not just about providing a pathway into the public sector—providing access to traineeships, apprenticeships and graduate positions—but also about mentoring and about providing friendships and acquaintances—
