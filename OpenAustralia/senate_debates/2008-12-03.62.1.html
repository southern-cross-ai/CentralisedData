        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, Senator Wong. Will the minister heed the calls of the local community to reconsider the decision to reject an application to release water from

         I thank Senator Colbeck for the question. I am advised that Minister Garrett did, on 18 November, determine that the proposed water release from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Crescent" rel="nofollow">
          Lake Crescent
         </a>
         would have clearly unacceptable impacts on two matters of national environmental significance: the Ramsar site and an endangered fish species that only occurs naturally in Lake Crescent and the connected Lake Sorell. Minister Garrett made this decision in the context of his duties under the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_Protection_and_Biodiversity_Conservation_Act" rel="nofollow">
          Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act
         </a>
         , which obviously require him to have regard to a range of matters and to make a decision as to whether, in this context, the impacts on matters of national environmental significance were acceptable or not. As I said, the decision was made and it was determined that there would be clearly unacceptable impacts on two matters of national environmental significance.
        </p>

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
          Can I

         say that the minister is aware of the hardship being suffered by farmers in the Clyde valley region, who, like many regional and rural communities, have been affected by the ongoing drought, and is aware that these lakes have been a traditional source of water for downstream users in the Clyde valley. However, it is the case that, following an extended period of dry conditions, water levels in both lakes are already below the critical levels defined in Tasmania’s water management plan. In the absence of substantial and sustained rainfall, they are expected to drop further due to evaporation, with potentially severe impacts on the ecosystems of those lakes. A further release of water from Lake Crescent in these circumstances would therefore exacerbate the risk of serious long-term impact on matters of national environmental significance.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I thank Senator Wong for that answer, but I disagree with her with respect to the minister’s understanding of the circumstances of the farmers, since he has refused on two occasions to meet with them and also to visit them, despite their invitation. Was the Tasmanian Labor Minister for Primary Industries and Water,

           I am not sure I can assist the good senator much further. Minister Garrett, as I have indicated in this chamber on a number of occasions, under the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC" rel="nofollow">
            EPBC
           </a>
           Act has a decision-making power that is circumscribed by that statute. He is required to discharge his responsibilities under that law according to law and to his best judgement. For the reasons I have outlined, he has determined under that act that the application that the senator refers to ought not to be accepted, and that is on the basis of the issues that I have referred to in my response. So, whilst I accept that the senator reflects the concern of some members of his constituency on this, the minister obviously, in the context of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC_Act" rel="nofollow">
            EPBC Act
           </a>
           , has to have regard to the matters of national environmental significance.
