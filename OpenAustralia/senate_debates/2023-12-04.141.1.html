         What Australians do have is a government that is working very hard to fight inflation. We have seen some moderation in the most recent inflation figures—obviously, much more is required, but we are committed to fighting inflation because we understand the effect that it has on families, on the cost of living and on how people are struggling as a consequence of higher inflation.

         We're focused on fighting inflation. We know the opposition are fighting anything but inflation. We know that a number of the measures that ensured—

             I'm interested in the proposition that inflation is not relevant to interest rates. That seems to be the point of that point of order—that somehow a discussion of inflation is not relevant to interest rates. As the shadow minister knows, interest rates are set independently by the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">
              Reserve Bank
             </a>
             . What governments can do is to ensure that we engage in the fight against inflation. Unfortunately, when we and the Australian community needed allies in that, instead they've had an opposition determined to oppose the measures that the government is seeking to put in place to fight inflation.
            </p>
            <p>
             I would remind the shadow minister that without our energy plan electricity prices would have risen 18.8 per cent instead of 8.4 per cent. So they're happy for electricity prices to go up nearly 19 per cent. That's the position of the opposition. Energy price relief that you voted against—

                As I recall, this government returned a surplus in 2022-23. I know that is difficult for the coalition to accept, because they trumpeted the 'Back in black'—they got the mugs out; they were quite triumphant—but then, of course, they didn't actually deliver one. I know that's very hard for them to accept. The reality is that this is a government that returned a surplus of $22.1 billion in 2022-23. It was a dramatic improvement from the forecast nearly $78 billion deficit that we inherited. In fact, that is a $100 billion turnaround, the biggest nominal budget improvement in Australian history.
               </p>
               <p>
                We've returned 95 per cent of revenue upgrades to the bottom line in 2022-23. That is more than double the average of the previous government. So I have to say I don't think we'll take a lecture from those opposite, who returned deficit after deficit and did not return revenue upgrades.

                        Unlike those opposite, we're not going to be focused on political fights. We are going to be focused on fighting inflation, which is the key driver behind the cost-of-living challenges that so many Australians have. Unlike those opposite, we are also not going to be running a low-wage economy. We're not going to be holding wages deliberately low, because we understand that also matters when it comes to the cost of living.
