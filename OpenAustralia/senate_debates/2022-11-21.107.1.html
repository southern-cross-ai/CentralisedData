        Meeting the human rights challenge across the world can at times be overwhelming, and sometimes it can be difficult to find progress. But last week we heard the fantastic news that Professor Sean Turnell, an Australian citizen, was released with almost 6,000 other political prisoners in Myanmar. This is the time to harden our resolve against the military regime in Burma. Over a million people have been displaced, thousands of children have been killed, tens of thousands of homes have been destroyed, villages have been burnt to the ground, and it is now time for Australia to do more. Professor Turnell's release is great news, and we should take that as a demonstration that Australia can now do more to support the Burmese people in Myanmar but give life to the aspirations of the Burmese diaspora in this country.

        This is the time for Australia to strengthen its voice with its regional partners. This is the time for Australians to do more in demanding greater international effort. This is the time when Australia can do more to support those people on the ground in Burma, refugees in India, refugees in Thailand, so that they can see in Sean Turnell's release hope for themselves. I call on the Australian government to now act harder. I congratulate them on their efforts and the efforts of our

        neighbours and everyone that was involvedâ€”indeed, the many thousands of Australians who argued for Sean Turnell's release. But now is the time for the Australian government to do more; not my wish but the wish of the Burmese diaspora in our country.
