        I imagine senators would be familiar with these amendments. It is not surprising that the Democrats would move them. They relate to the issue of appointment on merit. I draw the committee’s attention to amendment (3), which actually specifies in relation to representation on the advisory council that one member should be a person who has had or currently has cancer. I will not speak to the rest of the amendments. Some you will be familiar with. Let’s face it, I am the stand-in tonight.

         I indicate that Labor will be supporting these amendments and particularly draw attention to (3). Labor supports that amendment implicitly. We have had some involvement in getting the words to reflect the views of community members who gave evidence, I think, to the committee of inquiry that Senator Moore spoke of this evening. We strongly support these amendments, particularly amendment (3), and I certainly hope the government will be adopting that amendment in particular.

          The government will not be supporting the amendments. I would like to state briefly the reasons for that. In terms of the selection of the

           CEO
          </a>
          and the advisory council, I can inform all honourable senators, including those who have just spoken, that the Australian government is committed to ensuring that the chief executive officer and membership of the advisory council of Cancer Australia are of the highest possible standing and calibre. We regard these amendments as unnecessary, particularly in relation to appointments, which we undertake on the basis of merit.
         </p>
         <p>
          In terms of the specific references to consumer representation on the advisory council, I acknowledge it is a genuine concern of the senators who have spoken or who may not even have spoken. In regard to the proposed amendment that the Cancer Australia advisory council include consumer representation, I am able to advise the Senate that the Hon.

           I and on behalf of Senator Allison move a final amendment, amendment (1) on page 4863:

          <p class="italic">
           (1)    Clause 37, page 14, (line13), at the end of subclause (1), add “, including a summary description of any advice or reports provided by the

               The amendment was circulated on 28 March at 9.47 pm. I am sorry that the government has not seen that amendment. I say in the absence of my leader that it looks like a jolly good amendment to me. The fact that it has the Labor Party’s support speaks volumes too. You know how big we are on accountability in this place, and I think that is just more of it. I commend it to Senator Santoro. Imagine what we are going to be like in about three hours time, people.

                On behalf of whoever I need to apologise for, I do so and say that the government has not had sufficient time to consider this amendment. On that basis I recommend that we do not accept it. But I give you the assurance, Senator Stott Despoja, that upon further consideration over the next couple of days, or certainly before we come back, I will discuss it directly with the minister and his senior advisers. If we have to come back for an amendment to reflect what you put before the Senate, I undertake to do that, and I or the minister will get back to you personally in relation to this matter.
