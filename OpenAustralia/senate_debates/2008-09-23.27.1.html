        My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Conroy. I refer to the minister’s answer yesterday where he asserted in response to my question about the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KAP" rel="nofollow">

        … the Federal Court decision has not had impact on the Commonwealth budget.
       </p>
       <p>
        Is the minister aware that it was the Rudd Labor government who took the decision to include
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
         GST
        </a>
        revenue as Commonwealth revenue in the budget papers? Is the minister further aware that the government’s own budget papers, at page 5-12 in Budget Paper No. 1, confirm that the KAP Motors decision is described as accounting for a decrease in forecast revenue of around $500 million? Will the minister now admit he was wrong yesterday and correct his answer?

         I proudly admit that the Rudd government ended the fraud on the Australian public perpetrated by those opposite when they decided to pretend that the

         was not a Commonwealth tax, just so they could airbrush away the fact that they were the highest taxing government in Australian history. That is exactly what they engaged in for the best part of 10 years—airbrushing away the fact that they were the highest taxing government in Australia’s history. The old ‘Dr Yes’ is over there, the former Minister for Finance and Administration—

           who rolled over every time the Prime Minister demanded more spending and demanded more taxing. Let us be clear: at a time of global economic uncertainty we need a strong budget surplus. We need it to provide a buffer against this global turmoil. We need it to ensure that the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">
            Reserve Bank
           </a>
           has room to move on interest rates and to finance critical national building investments for the future. That is why we have delivered a $22 billion surplus. Even the Leader of the Opposition has conceded that the proposed hole in the surplus is gigantic—his own words.

Despite a new leadership team, the opposition are playing their old opportunistic games to delay the passage of this legislation. It shows how determined those opposite are to vandalise the budget surplus we built as a buffer.

In contrast to the Liberals, the government would like to acknowledge the cooperation of the Greens and Senator Xenophon and

                  , on a point of order on relevance: you have repeatedly drawn Senator Conroy’s attention to the issue of relevance throughout this question time. He has now had nearly four minutes to answer a very specific question as to whether he was right or wrong in saying that the Federal Court decision has no impact on the Commonwealth budget. His attention was drawn to the fact that his government changed the treatment of
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">

                  revenues, and it has been put to him that he was completely wrong in his statement yesterday. I ask you to draw his attention to the question in the remaining minute that he has and to ask him to tell the Senate whether or not he misled the Senate, which we believe he did.

                         Those opposite are obsessed with protecting the Ferrari and Porsche drivers of this country. They just cannot accept that, at a time of global economic and financial crisis, we need a government that will be economically responsible, and this government is up to the task. The opposition’s continued efforts to smash our budget surplus show that they have little economic credibility and those Australians who take the time to listen to them will absolutely understand they are just economic vandals.
