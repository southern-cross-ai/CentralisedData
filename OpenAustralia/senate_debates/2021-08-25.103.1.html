       <p>
        [by video link] Today I pay tribute to someone who made an enormous and lasting contribution to the Senate: Senator Rachel Siewert, who will give her valedictory tonight after an incredible 16 years of service. I particularly acknowledge her service to the Senate community affairs committees since 2008. More than many, she is someone who truly does the work; someone who makes a real and worthy contribution; someone with a burning passion for supporting people, especially those who endure disadvantage; and someone who deploys her incredible breadth of knowledge to raise awareness and very much drive change. Even after years of working together on many inquiries, I am still awed by her. She is absolutely a legend of the Senate.
       </p>
       <p>
        She has set impossibly high standards in everything she does: in committees, as a whip, in the chamber and, of course, in her advocacy and representation. All senators should aspire to meet those same standards. We should all aspire to show the same respect and care that she shows to others no matter who they are. I'm sure every one of us has benefited from her expertise, her experience and her kindness. I am deeply grateful for everything Senator Siewert has given. I wish I could be there later on today to personally thank her for her outstanding service to the Senate and to the Australian community. I sincerely wish Senator Siewert the very best for the future. I know without doubt she will continue to inspire and support those in need.
