           The Minister for Employment has all along called on parties to show each other respect and due consideration. Redundancy is a delicate issue. Even when a workforce anticipates that redundancies are likely, as it appears may have occurred in this case, it is still a difficult time for workers and their families when they are told that they are going to be made redundant. It is regrettable that the method of communicating with workers has not helped this already difficult situation. There is an enterprise agreement that applies at this workplace, and it includes consultation requirements and a dispute resolution clause. I urge all parties to comply with all requirements in the enterprise agreement. This issue has been referred to the independent umpire by both the employer and the union. It is incumbent on all parties to engage with the commission in working through the issues. It is not for industrial parties to pick and choose which of the independent umpire's decisions they will abide by. Such an approach only devalues the institution of the independent Fair Work Commission.

              First of all, could I indicate that the motion that was before the Senate, general business notice of motion No. 783, was in my name and Senator Rhiannon's. I apologise for missing that out.
             </p>
             <p>
              Could I also indicate that it is okay coming here talking about Fair Work Australia and about people needing to get round the table to deal with these issues, but this is the first time I have ever heard of this happening in Australia where workers have received an email or a text message to sack them from a major multinational company. This is outrageous. I thank the Senate for supporting the resolution in my name and Senator Rhiannon's name, and I think it is incumbent upon this company to get round the table with the workers and the

                 I also thank the Senate for passing this. This will give great encouragement to the workers who are being put in the very difficult position of losing their jobs in such an ugly way. By text and email is certainly not the way any workplace should be conducted. The

                 and the workers who Senator Cameron and I were with, on Sunday, said they just want to sit down and negotiate and that they are very committed to making their work productive. There is already a high level of productivity there and they are ready to negotiate to ensure that this is a well-functioning port. The concern that many of them spoke about is that this company, Hutchison, is very centred on setting up a body-hire system. That is something that we see as a tactic coming from this government where they are committed to stripping down penalty rates, and there was a real concern that what will be critical to winning this campaign is defeating the Abbott government.
