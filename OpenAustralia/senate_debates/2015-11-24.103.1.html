         I thank Senator Bernardi for his question. As minister responsible for drug policy, I was recently delighted to be able to attend the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Sports" rel="nofollow">
          Good Sports
         </a>
         Awards down in Victoria—actually at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCG" rel="nofollow">
          MCG
         </a>
         , many would say the home of sport in this country. The Good Sports Awards are much more than just a reflection of the importance of sport; they are a real celebration of community. We see these clubs who are working incredibly hard with local people out in their communities addressing issues like alcohol, obesity, smoking and mental health. It is an absolute testament to those clubs and the great job that they are doing. The job that they are doing is clearly showing that they are reducing harmful drinking cultures. We know this is an issue.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government is absolutely committed to reducing harmful drinking and we know that these clubs play a vital role in addressing that very significant issue. There are around 7,000 clubs now signed up to the Good Sports program, which is an increase of around a third from 2014—a tremendous achievement. The government is working with the Good Sports clubs and the good work that they have done has resulted in us giving the Good Sports program an extra $19 million over four years to support the very good work that they are doing.
        </p>
        <p>
         It really does focus more on participation and less on drinking. We know that there is a culture of drinking in this nation; we also know that it is really important for young people to have role models when it comes to the sporting environment who will show them the way forward and provide opportunities for young people to be involved in sport without that harmful drinking culture surrounding them.

           program, through these clubs, is achieving outstanding results. We have seen that risky drinking has been reduced by 37 per cent as a result of the work that the clubs are doing and that alcohol-related harms have been reduced by 42 per cent as a result of the work that these clubs are doing. The National Drug Strategy Household Survey is indeed showing that fewer 12- to 17-year-olds are drinking alcohol, with those completely abstaining increasing significantly between 2010 and 2013, from 64 per cent to 72 per cent. While people aged 18 to 24 are still more likely to drink at harmful levels, there was a significant decrease in the very high-risk alcohol use at least monthly, from 24 per cent down to 17 per cent, and a lot of this is attributed in part to the work that those clubs are doing.

             note the groans from Labor on the other side. This is actually a really important issue, and I think those people in the community would be devastated to hear about the fact that those on the other side do not even care about the great work that these clubs are doing.

             But I would particularly like to acknowledge the Club of the Year, the Sunshine Heights Cricket Club in Victoria. I particularly want to congratulate two children, 10- and 11-year-old Leo and Nybol. They are the absolute future of those communities of those clubs, and they are so delighted to be working with those clubs in that environment.
