        Last Saturday was the day Australians said no—no to feelings based governance, no to elevating one group within our community over another based only on race, no to a Prime Minister whose chief skill is to cry on cue and no to spending more tax dollars than our taxpayers can afford. Australians are already struggling with a cost-of-living crisis as a result of shoddy governance from successive parliaments. People need to keep more of their own money, not less. On Saturday, Australians realised that the people are the parliament's masters, not its servants. The irony is that the referendum did give Aboriginals a voice, and they used it. The five electorates with the largest Aboriginal population gave the Voice a thrashing. It was a result which clearly shows that Canberra no longer represents the values and beliefs of everyday Australians.

        For those in this place who supported racism and apartheid—and you were the majority—now is the time to ask yourself, 'What the hell was I thinking?' How could you think it was okay to take a system that has failed Aboriginal people for 120 years and embed, enshrine and perpetuate that system in the Constitution? We don't need to preserve a broken system that's failed Aboriginals in the bush; we need to tear it down. It's time to dismantle the Canberra Aboriginal industry and deliver resources directly to those in need in the bush. It's time to stop preventing rural Aboriginals from owning their own homes and running their own affairs. It's time for city grifters in comfortable offices thousands of kilometres from rural communities to stop keeping money meant for the bush—money that's used to fund their own empires and line their own pockets. Enough money goes into the funnel to make things right. A drip comes out the bottom. It's time to turn the damn funnel around.

        Today is a new day for Australia's Aboriginals. Let's not waste the chance to ask ourselves this question: who's best to run

        affairs? Is it Canberra bureaucrats and the Aboriginal industry, or is it best run from local communities and councils right there in the bush, ready to get cracking on housing, roads, power and community facilities?
