        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Health, Senator Cash. Minister, it's reported that 78,442 people are infected with the coronavirus, of which 2,456 have died. Based on those figures, the mortality rate appears to be a little over 3.1 per cent. In comparison to the Spanish flu, where the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization" rel="nofollow">
         World Health Organization
        </a>
        believed two to three per cent of those infected died, the coronavirus appears to be a deadlier pandemic. While I commend the Morrison government on closing the borders to Chinese travellers for the past few weeks, I'm at pains to understand why Australian universities are able to put profits before the health and security of this nation. Will the minister guarantee the health of Australians and put an end to universities circumventing our nation's flu-stopping Chinese travel ban?

         I thank Senator Hanson for the question. Senator Hanson, I am going to have to reject the premise of your question. The government's advice is very, very clear: students who have been outside mainland China for the last 14 days may be able to enter Australia provided that they do not return to China on the way to Australia. The government is not actively suggesting that students travel to a third country for 14 days, because of the changing epidemiology of this disease. The rapidly evolving situation, combined with changes to travel restrictions by other countries, could mean students could get stuck in a third country. Our advice to international students is that they should monitor the advice on the websites of the Department of Health and the Department of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
          Home Affairs
         </a>
         . Students should also check with their airline and education providers before making decisions to travel to Australia, including via a third country. They should also check any current travel restrictions for other countries before travelling.
        </p>
        <p>
         I do acknowledge, Senator Hanson, that you commended the government on the action that we have taken to date. As the Minister for Health and the Prime Minister have stated, Australia is ready and our government is working constantly to keep Australians safe. Australia, as you have acknowledged, was one of the first countries in the world to declare coronavirus as a disease of pandemic potential, on 21 January, and this was more than a week before the

          World Health Organization
         </a>
         . In terms of the decisions that the Australian government takes, as I have reiterated to the Senate, these decisions are underpinned by medical adviceâ€”

In terms of the advice from the Chief Medical Officer, the Chief Medical Officer has confirmed that our arrangements to protect Australians from coronavirus are working. There are no confirmed cases among Australian citizens and residents who have returned to Australia since the introduction of the border measures on 1 February 2020.

               Our health experts have advised that the situation with coronavirus in mainland China has not improved in the past two weeks. As such, you would be aware that we continue to require Australian citizens, permanent residents, and their families who have been in mainland China from 1 February 2020 and who return to Australia to self-isolate for 14 days from the time they left mainland China. I would reiterate that our decisions are underpinned by medical advice and recommendations from theâ€”
