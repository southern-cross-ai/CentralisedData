         I thank Senator Moore for her question. I note that she has a keen interest in health and hospital reform. I am pleased to inform the Senate that the Minister for

          Health and Ageing
         </a>
         and the Prime Minister have announced the next round of applications for the Health and Hospitals Fund, which is now open for rural and regional Australia. As Minister Roxon said today, this round of funding is worth a total of up to $1.8 billion and will accept applications up to 3 December 2010. This new allocation of funding will enable our rural and regional towns to invest in new infrastructure, including for mental and dental health and acute care facilities for regional hospitals, and can potentially fund new facilities to train medical practitioners that work in our regions. The funding will also support the clinical capacity of regional hospitals. This honours the agreement between the government and independent MPs. Minister Roxon has consulted with independent members and the regional development minister to ensure that this next round is targeted directly at regional healthcare needs.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, with this new investment, our regional towns will be able to provide better health services to areas that have gone without for so many years under the Howard government. The investment in health and infrastructure will help support better health outcomes for rural and regional communities. The Gillard government is also committed to delivering superfast broadband to allow the development of e-health initiatives to help get expert advice in real time and, of course, is committed to the introduction of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
          GP
         </a>
         superclinics across the community. It is also to ensure that families can see a GP and get the allied health services they need. The national health and hospital plan is a $7.4 billion commitment by the Gillard Labor government to deliver better services to all Australians.

          <p>
           The Gillard government is taking decisive action to relieve the pressure on our public health and hospital system. Our plan will ensure that patients will no longer have to wait all night in a hospital emergency department, with the introduction of the four-hour rule. Patients will receive their elective surgery within the clinically recommended time, thanks to the national access target. We will open 1,316 new sub-acute beds, helping to take the pressure off hospitals, and this comes on top of the 2008 $64 billion healthcare agreement, which was a 50 per cent increase on the last agreement signed by the Liberal government.
          </p>
          <p>
           We have taken this action in the best interest of Australia, both in our capital cities and throughout regional Australia. These commitments have been completely costed and funded, and will be rolled out to the benefit of the Australian community.

            <p>
             The Gillard governmentâ€™s health and hospital reform package is a crucial step forward in delivering much needed funding to Australiaâ€™s health and hospital system. Those opposite, of course, have opposed this move to deliver increased funding to the Australian hospital system. But this should come as no surprise, of course. As we all know, the record of the Leader of the Oppositionâ€”Mr Tony Abbottâ€”on health and hospital reform as the previous Minister for Health ripped $1 billion out of the health and hospital system.
            </p>
            <p>
             Of course, this was $1 billion that could have been spent on hospital beds and acute care facilities; $1 billion that could have been spent on training doctors and nurses, and funding X-ray machines and cancer clinics. We on this side are acting to deliver much needed health and hospital funding for the benefit of Australians.
