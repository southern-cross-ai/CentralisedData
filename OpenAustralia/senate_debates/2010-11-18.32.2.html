               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network" rel="nofollow">
                National Broadband Network
               </a>
               . The government has in its possession each and every one of the documents requested. It has in its possession the red book with bits blacked out. All that the motion seeks is the production of the red book with the blacked out bits not blacked out so that people can read them and the criteria that the government used for assessing the early roll-out sites for the National Broadband Network, firstly in Tasmania and secondly on the mainland, and the documents showing the application of that criteria to each and all of the first roll-out sites, both in Tasmania and nationally.
              </p>
              <p>
               Finally, the motion seeks a copy of the heads of agreement, apparently signed and agreed by the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACTU" rel="nofollow">
                ACTU
               </a>
               , covering wages for the construction of the National Broadband Network. The ACTU agreed to and signed heads of agreement which the minister cited in his answer to this Senate during question time on Monday. The ACTU heads of agreement, which the minister must have sighted—i.e., seen—given that he relied upon it to reassure the Senate.

                 by leave—I will indicate very briefly why we have sought to have these two parts put separately. I think Senator Fisher is entirely reasonable in seeking the matters listed in (a) and (b), for the reasons she set out, but I think it is curious—that may be too mild a term—for the Senate, based on a line that the minister read in a committee statement, to start going on fishing expeditions, pardon the pun, for agreements being made by the trade unions representing the workers who will be installing the Broadband Network. We will not be supporting part (c).
