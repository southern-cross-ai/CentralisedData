       <p>
        by leaveâ€”I want to report to senators on an incident earlier today in which Mr Marat Aminov attempted self-harm by trying to set fire to himself outside
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        . Security staff intervened and an ambulance, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
         AFP
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        Mental Health have attended. Mr Aminov has been taken to hospital. His mother was on the site at the time and she became quite distressed. She was also taken to hospital. Mr Aminov is the gentlemen who jumped from the public gallery to the floor of the House of Representatives the other day during question time. He was also removed from Parliament House on 22 October after a similar protest attempt.
       </p>
       <p>
        The event is obviously very distressing and we are concerned for Mr Aminov and his family. I understand the incident was designed to highlight the circumstances surrounding the visa applications of his parents, Mr and Mrs Aminov. I just want to make it clear that some of the claims that they make in support of their case are not actually correct. Mr Marat Aminov, the man who is protesting, is actually a permanent resident of Australia and is eligible for citizenship if he wishes to apply. Mr and Mrs Aminov arrived in Australia with their son on temporary business visas back in 1997 and since that time have extended their stay on a number of visas. In 2007 the then minister for immigration, I think it was Mr Andrews, intervened to enable them to make an application for an aged parent visa. This was lodged in June 2007 and they were granted bridging visas with full work rights. They are now queued for the granting of those visas, as is the case with all applicants.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to stress that the family is in Australia lawfully, they are holders of a valid visa, they are not being considered for deportation and this has not been considered since the former minister intervened. The department is working very closely with them. We have offered and have tried to provide counselling and welfare support and we have sought to try to assist Mr Aminov to get medical support. I thought that, given the concern around the building about the incident today, I ought to report that to the chamber.
