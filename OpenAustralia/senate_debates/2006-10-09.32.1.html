        My question is to the Minister for Justice and Customs. All senators would applaud the government’s strong fight against serious and organised crime. I would ask the minister if he could update the Senate on recent achievements in that fight—in particular, the work of the

         I thank Senator Macdonald for his very important question and acknowledge his role as chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the

         , which does a very good job. Last week was indicative of the great work that has been done by the Australian Crime Commission, which the Howard government set up just over three years ago. What we saw in the first instance was a very successful operation in Taskforce Gordian. Working with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

         and Victorian police, we saw the dismantling of what was alleged to be a sophisticated and organised drug trafficking and money laundering syndicate. The

         were involved, but all under the leadership of the Australian Crime Commission.
        </p>
        <p>
         What is important to remember in relation to this operation is that it is alleged that this syndicate was responsible for laundering some $AU93 million overseas in relation to criminal activity, especially drug trafficking. The seizures involved firearms and a quantity of drugs. There were some nine arrests—six in Sydney and three in Melbourne. That is indicative of the great work the Australian Crime Commission is doing in the fight against organised crime.

         Following on from a summit in Canberra on the serious issue of violence and sexual abuse occurring against women and children in Indigenous communities, last week in Alice Springs I opened the headquarters of the National Indigenous Violence and Child Abuse Intelligence Task Force, which is led by the Australian Crime Commission, bringing together the efforts of state and territory police—and we have always acknowledged the great work that state and territory police do in the investigation of these very serious matters touching on the abuse of women and children, sexual violence and serious instances of violence as well. But what we need nationally is leadership and facilitation of our efforts as a nation in the fight against a very serious situation which all senators would roundly condemn. Of course, the Australian Crime Commission is well placed to do this. The reason for that is the excellent personnel within the organisation. As well, it has all state and territory police commissioners,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">

         , the Australian Customs Service and ASIC on its board. It is chaired by Australian Federal Police Commissioner Mick Keelty. It is a truly national representative body involved in the fight against serious crime.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have seen great efforts being made in relation to Operation Wickenby, the biggest operation in this country’s history in relation to tax evasion. It is alleged that some $300 million in tax has been evaded. That again demonstrates the broad work that has been done by the Australian Crime Commission; it demonstrates the changes we have seen in national law enforcement, particularly under the Howard government; and, of course, it demonstrates the great collaboration by men and women working across this country in the fight against serious and organised crime. I want to place on record the government’s appreciation of the work done by the Australian Crime Commission and the great cooperation we get from state and federal police in what are very serious issues for law enforcement in this country. Of course, in that you cannot forget the outstanding efforts of the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Customs Service. It is worthy that Australians reflect on the great work being done by the Australian Crime Commission and it is appropriate that we acknowledge that.
