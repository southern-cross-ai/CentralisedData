        I direct my question to Senator Canavan, representing the Minister for Agriculture and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Resources" rel="nofollow">
         Water Resources
        </a>
        . An overwhelming number of Australians want the cruel live export trade to end. In this period when the exporter Emanuel Exports has had its export licence suspended, will the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources prevent the export licence holder associates of Emanuel Exports from also exporting sheep to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMS" rel="nofollow">
         EMS
        </a>
        Rural Exports Pty Ltd. Given that there are directors common to Emanuel Exports and its two associate companies, will the department issue show cause notices and suspensions to the associated companies so that the cruelty can end and we can build up boxed chilled meat exports in Australia in the responsible way this government should undertake to do?

         I thank Senator Rhiannon for the question. I don't have specific information with me on the directors of those other companies, but the government does support a sustainable live export industry that provides significant numbers of jobs and significant income to Australian farmers. The industry is regulated by an independent regulator, and it's the independent regulator that has made the decisions that Senator Rhiannon has referred to in her question. We support the regulator operating in an independent and arms-length manner from the government. I'll have to take on notice the specific details that Senator Rhiannon has requested and come back to the Senate.

           Minister, how does the department of agriculture distinguish between integrity issues when they are being operated by a common director and when the parent company is currently under suspension and investigation? If you do not suspend the licence of all companies associated with Emmanuel, does that mean the suspension of Emmanuel is a

            I perhaps should point out that the decisions of the independent regulator in regard to this particular exporter have occurred after a review of the conduct of that particular regulator. I can't comment on the specific details of that review. Again, as the decisions the independent regulator may take in the future, I will have to take that on notice because that is a matter for the regulator. As I indicated to the Senate, we very much respect the independence of that regulator to ensure we have a sustainable live export industry in this country.

              abattoirs have capacity to slaughter all sheep exported from those states, and chilled sheep meat is worth 20 times more than live sheep exports. So you should be able to answer this question: is the government working on an assistance package for sheep farmers in these states, including worker training, to manage the transition from the live export trade to local processing? If not, why not?

               As I indicated in answers to the previous questions, we support a trade that is sustainable and respects animal welfare outcomes. That's why it is regulated by an independent regulator to make decisions like the one taken last week to suspend a particular exporter. But the government also supports the development of markets and trade with other countries. The government does not believe we should be directing individual farmers or agricultural producers in how they run their businesses. They are best placed to decide what markets should emerge and what will be the best for their families and households, provided they are consistent with government regulations around animal welfare. We have to get the regulations right and then we need to allow Australian farmers to be able to make a buck in this country. While I respect the opinion of Senator Rhiannon, I don't think the farmers of
