        I rise this evening to speak on this R U
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK" rel="nofollow">
         OK
        </a>
        ? Day. 'Are you okay?' is a very simple question and one which we have been asked to remind Australians about today. It is very important to reach out and connect with family members, friends and colleagues who may find it difficult to talk about their emotional wellbeing. As we know, it is often very difficult for people who are going through rough times to express themselves. Sometimes they feel that the only way to deal with their problems, sadly, is to take their own life. Whilst they do need to learn to speak about their issues, we also need to learn to ask the question when we suspect that something is wrong. Today is all about starting that conversation and taking time out to ask somebody, 'Are you okay?'
       </p>
       <p>
        On average, six people take their lives every day in Australia. That is higher than the national road toll. Suicide is a major health concern in Australia, ranking 15th overall as the cause of death in Australia. Feelings of isolation or hopelessness can contribute to depression and other mental illnesses, which ultimately can result in suicide. Psychological autopsies have found that nearly 90 per cent of people who ended their own lives had been suffering from a mental disorder like depression. Men are three times more likely than women to end their own lives. This is what prompted Gavin Larkin to initiate R U OK? Day in 1995, after the death of his father,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Larkin" rel="nofollow">
         Barry Larkin
        </a>
        . R U OK? Day started in 2009 and has been a fantastic way to raise awareness about preventing suicide across Australia, with nearly one in five Australians participating on this day.
       </p>
       <p>
        Everybody is asked to sit down with somebody, have a cup of tea and ask them, 'Are you okay?' Indeed, this morning I took the initiative outdoors to wheel out the trolley with cups of coffee and tea in those very stunningly strong yellow-coloured R U OK? cups, along with cupcakes and lamingtons, to make the point that it is over a cup of coffee or tea that you can start this conversation. Indeed, it did start a conversation among some of our journalist friends outside. I must say they joined in the spirit of the moment and ate all the cupcakes and the lamingtons. Again, there was the theme of morning tea at the

        OK? morning tea with former Wallabies captain

        attending. It is really important to see our public figures and people like Simon attending such functions. He spoke quite movingly about his friendship with Gavin Larkin and how that had come about. Thirteen million Australians are aware of RU OK? Day and, as I said, one in five participated in some way today.
       </p>
       <p>
        A recent Essential Media poll for RU OK? indicated that more than half of all respondents admitted they would not open up if struggling with a problem. However, 84 per cent of people feel confident or very confident about asking a friend who is troubled whether they are okay. Indeed, Professor Graham Martin,

        Of course we know the spiral of despair and it could be from relationship problems, money worries or bullying. In particular, these days we see such graphic illustrations of what is described as trolling, some absolutely disgusting comments that are put on Twitter and on the internet by people who feel that they can make these comments because they cannot see the person in front of them. Amongst our young people this is causing despair.
       </p>
       <p>
        Earlier this week was
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Suicide_Prevention_Day" rel="nofollow">
         World Suicide Prevention Day
        </a>
        .
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHO" rel="nofollow">
         WHO
        </a>
        figures indicate that on average one million people across the globe end their own lives and one person ends their life every 40 seconds. As the figures show, suicide is the leading cause of death for almost one in four of our young people aged between 15 and 24 years. We have initiatives such as headspace, which was established under the coalition government and now enjoys bipartisan support, and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPIC" rel="nofollow">
         EPIC
        </a>
        s which the coalition would like to see rolled out, but regrettably this government is waiting on the state governments to roll these centres out. That is not actually happening because we understand the states are not willing as yet to come to the party on this.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to take the remaining time to put on the record that at a time when suicide prevention is very important the rollout of important suicide prevention moneys is just not happening. People like Professor Mendoza have been on the record as being very critical of the government for not rolling out those moneys in a timely manner. We also have the Mental Health Nurse Incentive Program which was sold by the minister as a cap, but unfortunately as you talk to people involved in this program at the grassroots level we are actually seeing a cut. Then we have the road map which was much touted as being a 10-year road map. But we have such eminent people as Professor Rosen being critical of it, saying you do not put out a road map if you do not have a destination.
       </p>
       <p>
        Yesterday the Department of Health and Ageing appeared to put out its draft road map for national mental health reform 2012-22. Having received such criticisms from eminent persons about this road map, one would think that the government would say, 'Let's put it out there, but let's give people the opportunity to give some proper feedback in relation to this road map.' But what we have seen is a new benchmark in contempt by this government and total disregard for the opinions of the professionals in this area. Indeed, the Commonwealth has only given the sector until Monday—yes, Monday—to give feedback. It came out on Wednesday and they have until Monday to provide feedback to the Commonwealth. I have been provided with a copy of this draft and we have eminent professionals in this area now having to scramble as they only have two working days to provide feedback to the Commonwealth.
       </p>
       <p>
        That is an absolute and utter disgrace, Minister, particularly in a week in which we have been talking about important things like suicide prevention and RU OK? Day. Yet the government has shown contempt for the sector, after all the criticism you have received about this road map. You put the road map out on Wednesday and expect people to provide feedback to you on what is supposed to be a road map for the next 10 years in such an important area that is the leading cause of death for our young people. It is absolutely and utterly contemptible, Minister, and I would ask you to seriously consider this decision by your office, your department or somebody in your organisation. I have been provided with the road map and some accompanying information that shows clearly: '
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commonwealth" rel="nofollow">
         The Commonwealth
        </a>
        is only giving us until Monday, 17 September to comment and therefore please distribute urgently and provide feedback.'
