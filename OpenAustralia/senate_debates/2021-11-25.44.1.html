        Today I have moved a motion about the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
         UN
        </a>
        International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. This important motion is history-making, because on this day in this place we have the opportunity to refer to the committee an important issue for First Nation women and children who have been missing and murdered. This issue has continued for generations—generations of families and communities that have been affected. Just this morning we heard my colleague Senator Thorpe talk about the personal connections that we have to women who have been murdered in our families.
