         Bill
        </a>
        to provide a standing appropriation to pay any possible future claims made under the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Government
        </a>
        ’s Guarantee of State and Territory Borrowing.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Guarantee will support jobs and protect infrastructure programs from the ravages of the global recession.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It recognises that now is certainly not the time for governments to pull back on infrastructure investment.  Pulling back on infrastructure investment now would mean even slower growth and higher unemployment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        has decided that the quickest and most effective way to implement the Guarantee was to use the Commonwealth’s executive power to establish a contractually-based scheme.  This follows the practice used for putting the wholesale funding guarantee into place.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Although the Guarantee is a contractually-based scheme, an appropriation is needed in the very unlikely event the Government needs to make a payment of a claim under the Guarantee.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In order for the scheme to be effective in allowing the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_Territories" rel="nofollow">
         States and Territories
        </a>
        access to the credit markets, ratings agencies and investors need to be confident claims will be paid quickly if a State or Territory were to default on an obligation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That is why the Government is acting now to put in place this standing appropriation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill has two substantive measures.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A standing appropriation is established by the Bill to enable claims to be paid in a timely manner, in the unlikely event that claims are made under the Guarantee, and to allow borrowings made under the Bill to be repaid.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A borrowing power is also provided to enable timely payment of claims should there be insufficient funds in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_Revenue_Fund" rel="nofollow">
         Consolidated Revenue Fund
        </a>
        when the claims are to be paid.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Quick passage of this Bill will ensure that the Guarantee will be fully effective once the contractual arrangements are in place.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Rudd Government has taken decisive action to stimulate the domestic economy, mostly through direct government investments.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But we know that for this stimulus to be effective, it is essential that states continue to maintain their own investment programs to support the economy, and protect jobs.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There has never been a more important time for governments to support jobs today by building the infrastructure we need for tomorrow.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That’s why we are nation building for recovery.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And it’s why I’m introducing this legislation today.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I commend the bill.
