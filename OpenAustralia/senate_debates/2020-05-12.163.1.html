       <p>
        I've circulated amendments in the chamber today to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Cross-boundary Greenhouse Gas Titles and Other Measures) Bill 2019. These amendments would put a moratorium on oil drilling in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Australian_Bight" rel="nofollow">
         Great Australian Bight
        </a>
        . We all know that the debate over oil drilling in the Great Australian Bight has been hard fought. The majority of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        ns want to protect the Great Australian Bight. They want to protect our beaches and they want to keep our marine wonder world pristine. The last thing they want is to see the Great Australian Bight turned into an oil and gas field.
       </p>
       <p>
        Given Equinor's decision some months ago to withdraw their proposal to drill in the Great Australian Bight, these amendments are now very well timed, because there is no current proposal before government, before the agency NOPSEMA, for drilling in the Bight. So we now have a wonderful opportunity to realise the hopes and dreams of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         South Australian
        </a>
        s and many other Australians right across this country to protect the Great Australian Bight for good, to make sure that we don't allow any big corporation to come in and think that they can trash what is a pristine, internationally important area, a whale sanctuary. Eighty per cent of the species who live in the Great Australian Bight are found nowhere else on earth. This is a very, very special place. People were fearful of what would have happened had Equinor been given the tick of approval and gone ahead with turning the Great Australian Bight into an oilfield. Let's make sure we do what South Australians want—that is, protect the bight for good. Putting in place a moratorium on drilling is a really good way to send a signal to industry, to overseas companies and to the Australian people that the government has listened to the wills and desires of the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Make no mistake: it was the community campaign—particularly out of South Australia, but it spread right across the country—of people wanting to protect this area. They want to protect the Great Australian Bight because it is so unique and so special. But they also know that turning the Great Australian Bight into an oilfield would make it very difficult for us to ever properly tackle climate change in the future. The enormous amount of carbon that would be omitted as a result of these drilling operations and the product coming out would make it near impossible for Australia to keep global warming below two degrees. We know we've got a long way to go to reduce the carbon pollution we already have. Opening up the Great Australian Bight would make the job even harder, because it would put even more pollution out there and into the atmosphere.
       </p>
       <p>
        For two key reasons—the science and the will of the community—it is absolutely essential that this parliament acknowledges today that we need a moratorium on protecting the Great Australian Bight and a moratorium on any type of drilling in that area. To that point, one of the best things we can do is celebrate how good the bight is by giving it
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage" rel="nofollow">
         World Heritage
        </a>
        protection and by making sure that the area that is now protected is given full opportunity to be celebrated as an area that Australians and people from all over the world will want to visit. We know that South Australia's tourism industry has been kicked hard over the last few months. With the bushfires, the devastation on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangaroo_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Kangaroo Island
        </a>
        and in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide_Hills" rel="nofollow">
         Adelaide Hills
        </a>
        , and now with COVID-19, South Australia's tourism has been decimated. Wouldn't it be wonderful if this government made an investment in our state and our state's tourism by protecting the bight and celebrating it as a place to be visited and rejoiced. This is what South Australians want.
       </p>
       <p>
        I implore this government to step in and do what is right. I know it was always going to be difficult to make a change while there was an application on foot, but we don't have that problem anymore. Equinor, the Norwegian company, pulled out; they've gone. Say no to oil and gas drilling in the bight and yes to World Heritage protection. That's what these amendments do, and I encourage my fellow senators to support them.

         I rise to speak on the amendments to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Cross-boundary Greenhouse Gas Titles and Other Measures) Bill 2019. The amendments are moved by Senator Hanson-Young of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Greens
         </a>
         . The amendments are also referred to as 'the moratorium—
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Australian_Bight" rel="nofollow">
          Great Australian Bight
         </a>
         drilling'. That's an accurate summary of what the amendments do. Effectively, the Greens require that this bill only commence if it contains a moratorium on (a) exploring for petroleum in the Commonwealth Great Australian Bight area, (b) recovering petroleum in the Commonwealth Great Australian Bight area and (c) carrying on operations in the Commonwealth Great Australian Bight for those purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
         We oppose this moratorium for several reasons. Firstly, this bill is concerned with greenhouse gas storage. It makes changes to petroleum titles so that the Commonwealth regulator for offshore petroleum activities, NOPSEMA, can have oversight of offshore greenhouse gas storage activities that straddle both state and Commonwealth waters. It means one regulator has oversight of greenhouse gas storage activities in different jurisdictions. This has been done for improved environmental management and improved workplace safety in the greenhouse gas storage industry of the future.
        </p>
        <p>
         The bill is also, according to the explanatory memorandum, concerned with the proposed greenhouse gas storage operations in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_Strait" rel="nofollow">
          Bass Strait
         </a>
         regarding the CarbonNet and hydrogen energy strategy in Victoria. This bill is not concerned with the Great Australian Bight and is not specifically concerned with petroleum exploration recovery or petroleum operations. These amendments from the Greens detract from a bill that is attempting to improve environmental and workplace safety outcomes in greenhouse gas storage—a technology that will help Australia reduce its greenhouse gas emissions into the future. We therefore oppose the amendments.

          The government opposes these amendments. These amendments, in singling out the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Australian_Bight" rel="nofollow">
           Great Australian Bight
          </a>
          , would exclude a significant area of potential for Australia's oil and gas sector from possibly being realised in the future. The government remains committed to encouraging the safe and sustainable development of Australia's offshore petroleum resources, overseen by the world-class regulator—and through regulatory standards—the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority, or NOPSEMA.
         </p>
         <p>
          As senators are well aware, to provide additional assurances around NOPSEMA's processes and their robustness and foundation upon science and evidence, last year the government commissioned an independent audit of NOPSEMA's assessment of exploration activities in the Great Australian Bight. This was conducted by the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Scientist" rel="nofollow">
           Chief Scientist
          </a>
          , Dr Alan Finkel, together with experts in community engagement, geoscience, marine science and offshore exploratory drilling and regulation. The audit found that NOPSEMA is a highly skilled, professional and competent regulator and has appropriate processes and practices to ensure environment plans are assessed against relevant, sufficient and complete scientific and technical information and against the requirements of relevant legislation.
         </p>
         <p>
          Communities around the bight should be assured that oil and gas exploration, where undertaken, is undertaken safely.

         </p>
         <p>
          I note the interjection from Senator Hanson-Young there. I would equally note that, in other parts of Australia, where we have seen oil or gas drilling undertaken for decades, there is successful coexistence of industries like tourism, fisheries and other agricultural industries within those same regions. This amendment is not proposed on the basis of science or rigorous assessment processes but is simply opposition to resource development. Indeed, I think everybody in this chamber, if they were being honest, would acknowledge that, if the Greens thought they could propose an amendment that banned all drilling exploration in any Australian waters, they would cheerily put that forward as well. The bight has strong and appropriate protections, with 14 marine parks covering some 508,371 square kilometres, stretching from
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangaroo_Island" rel="nofollow">
           Kangaroo Island
          </a>
          to the Abrolhos islands in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           Western Australia
          </a>
          , all part of the South-west Marine Parks Network. The bight basin remains one of Australia's frontier basins and any proposals for new oil and gas fields in this area will be assessed fairly and independently by NOPSEMA, whose powers and authorities are expanded as a result of the bill that we are putting forward, in terms of protections provided. For those reasons, the government opposes the amendment.

            I did cover this in my second reading speech, but, just to make the chamber alert to what this is about: this is an amendment that seeks to place a time limit on exploration in the Great Australian Bight, basically saying that you cannot perpetually get extensions upon extensions upon extensions that stifle investment in the tourist industry and, indeed, the fishing industry, particularly on the

           <p>
            I make the point that I know Minister Birmingham did rise and talk about the need for energy. His position would be more palatable if, for example—and I say this with Centre Alliance quite supportive of things like gas as a transitional energy source; we're not seeking to stop things, but, at the same time, we are seeking government direction and leadership in relation to things like electric vehicles, which can reduce our dependencies on oil and gas. Nothing seems to be happening in that space. Not only do electric vehicles assist in terms of reducing reliance on oils but they also improve productivity. Electric vehicles involve less maintenance, they have fewer moving parts than regular vehicles and they don't emit poisonous gases in the same way that internal combustion engine cars do. It is the future, and most countries around the world have adopted electric vehicles. They're encouraging electric vehicles and, indeed, have placed limits upon the time frame in which it will be possible to purchase an internal combustion engine vehicle. As I move this, I just indicate to the government that there are things that they can do where there's a win-win, and unfortunately they're not showing leadership in those sorts of areas.

            <p>
             I rise to speak to the amendment to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Cross-boundary Greenhouse Gas Titles and Other Measures) Bill 2019. This amendment was moved by Senator Rex Patrick from the Centre Alliance. It primarily concerns the duration of petroleum exploration permits and applies only to offshore exploration permits in the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Australian_Bight" rel="nofollow">
              Great Australian Bight
             </a>
             . The amendment would limit the extension of Commonwealth offshore petroleum exploration permits so that no exploration permit in the Great Australian Bight could be granted for more than 10 years. The 10-year limit would also apply to transitional provisions and to permits already in force.
            </p>
            <p>
             There are problems with Senator Patrick's amendment. First, it has little to do with the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Cross-boundary Greenhouse Gas Titles and Other Measures) Bill. The bill ensures that where there are offshore greenhouse gas storage areas that straddle Commonwealth, state and territory titles the Commonwealth's offshore petroleum regulators have authority. The bill is intended to ensure that the strongest safety and environmental protections are in place for offshore greenhouse gas storage operations and that a Commonwealth regulator, such as NOPSEMA, can enforce them. The bill is not concerned with limiting the duration of exploration permits. Second, Senator Patrick's amendment—

             , and there is usually a little bit of leeway given, but I remind senators that it is the requirement that you refrain from heckling during someone else's contribution.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thank you for that protection, Chair. Second, Senator Patrick's amendment limits the duration of offshore exploration permits, but only in the Great Australian Bight. No reasons are given for that. This is the effect of treating one operator differently to others based not on their actions or misdeeds but on where they are exploring. This goes to the third point, which is that there are already established ways to create protected marine areas. To properly protect marine areas we don't have to introduce anomalies to bills that are concerned with quite separate matters. The offshore greenhouse gas storage cross-boundary gas titles bills strengthen environmental and safety regulation of greenhouse gas storage, which is an important technology to help Australia reduce its future carbon emissions. The bill is not concerned with the duration of exploration permits on one part of Australia's coast. For the reasons listed above, we oppose Senator Patrick's amendment.

              The government also opposes this amendment for many of the same reasons that I outlined in relation to the amendment moved earlier by the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
               Australian Greens
              </a>
              , which I won't repeat. This amendment is slightly different in that it seeks to create a new and separate class of petroleum title for the specific geographic area that encompasses the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Australian_Bight" rel="nofollow">
               Great Australian Bight
              </a>
              in Commonwealth offshore waters. Rather than it being a blanket ban, as proposed by the Greens, it would create a new and different title. The government has concerns that this would leave investors questioning the viability of an investment, that it would create considerable additional financial risk in frontier areas like the Great Australian Bight and relative to other parts. It's an area that, as a frontier area, already comes with significant risk, and the proposed amendment would compound those uncertainties, heighten sovereign risk and make investors look elsewhere for safer projects and more-certain regulation.

              I note Senator Patrick's comments in relation to other matters—electric vehicles and the like.
