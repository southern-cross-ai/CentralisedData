        ”.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government amendments are very straightforward. These are two substantive amendments: (1) and (4) are related and (2) and (3) are related. As I have said, amendment (1) is consequential on amendment (4). Amendment (1) amends the commencement clause table in clause 2 of the bill. The amendment relates to item 57A of the schedule to the bill. Amendment (1) will give amendment (4) retrospective commencement from 13 December 2006. I will explain the justification for this retrospective commencement when discussing amendment (4).
       </p>
       <p>
        Amendment (2) is consequential upon amendment (3). Amendment (3) permits disclosure of the AUSTRAC information under a new section 133A of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006. Amendment (2) ensures that disclosure of the AUSTRAC information under the new section 133A is an exemption to the prohibition on disclosure pursuant to the terms of section 127 of the act.
       </p>
       <p>
        Amendment (3) inserts a new item, item 40A, into the amendment bill. Item 40A inserts a new section, section 133A, into the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act, permitting the Director-General of the Australian Security Intelligence Service, ASIS, to communicate AUSTRAC information to a foreign intelligence agency.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
         ASIO
        </a>
        has a similar power and we are simply mirroring that provision. This amendment is to ensure that ASIS, as a designated agency, can use AUSTRAC information to fulfil its functions. As I said, proposed section 133A mirrors section 133, which gives the Director-General of Security power to communicate AUSTRAC information to foreign intelligence agencies.
       </p>
       <p>
        Amendment (4) removes the unintended outcome—and this is almost housekeeping—from the earlier amendment of the definition of ‘non-reportable cash transaction’ by item 56 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 2006. Item 56 of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act narrowed the definition of ‘non-reportable cash transaction’ under the Financial Transactions Reporting Act to a transaction under that act. This was to ensure that there were not two identical provisions running at the same time. The restriction is not necessary, as the provisions of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act were not to commence until December 2008. Accordingly, an error has been made, and we seek to make the provision retrospective for the intervening months between December and now such that those offences will be offences pursuant to the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        Amendment (1) thereby makes the amendment in amendment (4) retrospective. As I said, the reasons for that are set out in the supplementary explanatory memorandum that I have tabled. Retrospective application is justified because the offence of structuring was a pre-existing offence in the Financial Transactions Reporting Act. It was always intended that such conduct remain illegal, notwithstanding the provisions in the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act being proclaimed as not to commence until December 2008. Retrospective application in those circumstances will remove any gap in time in the ability to prosecute such conduct, which was an unintended effect of the original amendment. The period of retrospectivity will only be for the period 13 December last year to the date of commencement of this bill, which we anticipate being not too long after it passes the Senate.

         Thanks for going through that process. Hopefully, we can vote on the amendments separately because the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Greens
         </a>
         do not have any objection to the technical corrections that the minister outlined but, as I raised in my second reading debate speech, we have questions about the power for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIS" rel="nofollow">
          ASIS
         </a>
         to have access to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AUSTRAC" rel="nofollow">
          AUSTRAC
         </a>
         that is proposed in this legislation. So I have questions for the minister about how this has come to be in place. As I said in my second reading debate speech, ASIS was not mentioned at the time that we dealt with the first piece of anti-money-laundering legislation as an organisation to which it was intended to provide access to AUSTRAC.
        </p>
        <p>
         My questions relate to when it became apparent that ASIS needed that access. There was no discussion at that time that ASIS needed that access. Now we have this proposal, but we have not had any explanation as to why there is this need for ASIS to have that access. Perhaps the minister is able to explain how this came about. Was it something that ASIS asked for? Was it something that the government identified?
        </p>
        <p>
         As the minister also indicated—and as I mentioned in my second reading debate speech—
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
          ASIO
         </a>
         and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
          AFP
         </a>
         already have access to AUSTRAC. I do not understand why, therefore, it is necessary for ASIS to have access to AUSTRAC as well. In all of the information that is available about ASIS—which is quite limited in the public realm—it is clearly indicated that their job is to be Australia’s overseas spy agency rather than spying on Australians. This has been the history of ASIS for a long time. The government’s reports on what the various different intelligence organisations do quite clearly indicate that ASIS is not a law enforcement organisation. With respect to the financing of terrorism, which we want to crack down on, the AFP is able to do that. So if the minister is able to indicate how it came to be that the government thought there was a need to add ASIS, that would be appreciated.

          The situation is that
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AUSTRAC" rel="nofollow">
           AUSTRAC
          </a>
          is not a law enforcer; it is an intelligence-gathering agency and a regulator. In the circumstances of having
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
           ASIO
          </a>
          have the information, there is a lot of synergy between ASIO and
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIS" rel="nofollow">
           ASIS
          </a>
          . ASIS carries out a number of similar functions. It was always intended that there would be a capacity to provide the sort of intelligence gathered by AUSTRAC through its monitoring and anti-money-laundering capability to foreign governments. In some circumstances, it is the case that ASIS has a better capacity to provide that intelligence and to utilise that intelligence. We are simply expanding the capacity and capability to disseminate the information to the benefit of fighting money laundering.

           My question is not just about amendments (2) and (3) on the government sheet about communications to foreign intelligence agencies. In relation to that specifically, why is it necessary, given that under the present act
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
            ASIO
           </a>
           ,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
            AFP
           </a>
           and the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Crime_Commission" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Crime Commission
           </a>
           have access to
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AUSTRAC" rel="nofollow">
            AUSTRAC
           </a>
           and the capacity to provide such information to a foreign intelligence agency? That is my understanding. Perhaps the minister can correct that. I understand that AFP, ASIO and the Australian Crime Commission, who already have access to AUSTRAC, can communicate that to foreign intelligence agencies. Perhaps the minister can check for me whether that is correct. If that is correct then why the need for
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIS" rel="nofollow">
            ASIS
           </a>
           to have access?
          </p>
          <p>
           But my questions are more general than that because, whilst we are dealing at the moment with just these government amendments, a substantial part of the actual legislation that we are dealing with is about the granting to ASIS of access to AUSTRAC. That is a more general question that is not specific to these amendments. Why is that the case, effectively? How did this come into play?

            has a function to perform and has relationships with sovereign governments and the intelligence services of sovereign governments. The genesis of money laundering which would affect Australia occurs inside these sovereign nations. We have no capacity to carry out enforcement et cetera in such countries. ASIS simply provides the intelligence, and in order to provide the intelligence it has to have the same level of access as set out in 133. So we have given ASIS that power such that it may pass on the information necessary to enable that sovereign power to arrest—and I use that word generally—money laundering or the beginnings of money laundering using the information we provide.

              AUSTRAC
             </a>

             —or, indeed, by any of the agencies—to foreign intelligence services will not be used by such foreign intelligence agencies in the abuse of human rights? This is a question I have asked in a number of other realms. What systems are in place to ensure that any information from AUSTRAC, which goes to whichever of the intelligence organisations that then passes it on to foreign intelligence agencies, will not be used in the abuse of human rights overseas? I accept what the minister is saying. Your answer was, ‘We have no control over what they do.’ What about the information that we pass on about the finances of Australians or Australian businesses? How can we make sure that that is not used in human rights abuses overseas?

              If we tailored all of the legislative framework that we seek to enact such that we can monitor and assist sovereign nations upon the basis that they will not exercise their sovereign power, rightly or wrongly, we will receive no benefit from these enactments. Whether they will choose to use the information in the abuse of human rights—which I think, with great respect to Senator Nettle, is extraordinarily remote, given that this is about money accounts and flows of money to the protection of Australia—I think is a question which is extraordinarily moot and obscure. If the senator would like to give me an example, I am sure I can take you through it. But the point of the exercise is that this intelligence agency is going to receive information from
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AUSTRAC" rel="nofollow">
               AUSTRAC
              </a>
              pursuant to the terms of the act and provide it in the intent of protecting Australia from money laundering. I am not sure that the purview of human rights comes into that question at all, and I would be interested to hear an example of how you anticipate that would apply.

               I will explain it. I understand what the government is proposing in terms of passing over information around financial transactions of Australians or Australian businesses. The question is about when that information is handed over to foreign intelligence agencies; it is about how they use it. I am not making a claim about how Australians may use that information; I am talking about when it is handed over. As we know, there are a whole range of different types of foreign intelligence agencies of varying degrees which Australia would support or raise questions about, so it is about that. I suppose it is in a number of defence arrangements with other countries—for example, we might put in provisions to say we are going to export this equipment but it will not be used in the abuse of human rights. The government has sought to do that in a range of circumstances, and this question is about whether there is anything in place to ensure that could occur with the information that is handed over. I am not questioning the Australian authorities; I am talking about when a foreign intelligence agency has been provided with information from Australia. Are there any guidelines in place about how that information is used? Maybe the answer is no. I am just asking and trying to understand because we have that capacity in other arenas—such as with defence. Can we do it in this arena?

                I am obliged to the departmental officers who have provided me with two basic explanations for that. As an intelligence service,
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIS" rel="nofollow">
                 ASIS
                </a>
                is controlled by the Intelligence Services Act 2001—and I am sure Senator Nettle is well aware of the provisions as to how that intelligence service conducts its operations, as to how the privacy of Australians is protected and as to how it uses the information that it obtains in the nature of doing its business. The second aspect is that the Intelligence Services Act also controls and prescribes obligations on the agencies with whom ASIS does business. Under section 13, the approval of the foreign affairs minister is required before ASIS can cooperate with authorities of other countries—you will have to forgive me; my knowledge of that act is not as good as it should be. It seems to me it is very unlikely that the foreign minister is going to empower ASIS to hand information over in circumstances where there is likely to be some abuse. Again, I would be interested to hear some examples. I think your defence example, with respect, is not entirely relevant to information or intelligence relating to the movement of moneys.

                 Thank you to the minister for raising the issue of the Intelligence Services Act because it was an issue that I addressed in my second reading debate speech and I have some questions on it. Section 11(1) of the intelligence act talks about the functions of
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIS" rel="nofollow">
                  ASIS
                 </a>
                 —and this is what I talked about in my second reading debate speech. It says they are:
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 ... to be performed only in the interests of Australia’s national security, Australia’s foreign relations or Australia’s national economic well-being and only to the extent that those matters are affected by the capabilities, intentions or activities of people or organisations outside Australia.
                </p>
                <p>
                 My question is: will the foreign minister have to amend, or make any new rules regarding ASIS’s use of information about Australians through their financial transactions as proposed in this legislation, this section of the Intelligence Services Act? Perhaps I can flag the two sections for the officials and the minister: section 11(1) of the Intelligence Services Act and section 15, which I mentioned in my second reading debate speech and which I have got questions about now. The first question is about section 11(1) of the Intelligence Services Act. Will the foreign minister need to make any new rules regarding ASIS’s use of the information that is being proposed in this legislation under the Intelligence Services Act?

                   AUSTRAC
                  </a>
                  information to overseas agencies, the Director-General of
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIS" rel="nofollow">
                   ASIS
                  </a>
                  —and this is within the legislation itself—would need to be satisfied that the foreign intelligence agency has given appropriate undertakings for protecting the confidentiality of the information, controlling the use that will be made of it and ensuring that it is only used for the purpose for which it is communicated. In addition, the director-general would need to be satisfied that the communication of the information is appropriate in all of the circumstances of the case.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Further to this, there is oversight by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, IGIS. As you well know, Senator Nettle, this is an important accountability mechanism which operates independently of government and has extensive investigative mandatory powers. Further to that, the
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Joint_Committee_on_Intelligence_and_Security" rel="nofollow">
                   Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security
                  </a>
                  is another oversight body and accountability mechanism for ASIS.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I note that you have suggested in the past that the IGIS is underresourced and understaffed. In recent years the government has considerably enhanced the appropriations for those bodies, particularly ASIS and the IGIS. There has been a substantial boost in the resources of the office of the inspector-general in line with its increasing function and the operational intensity of the agencies it oversights.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  It is quite untrue to suggest that the inspector-general has to wait for complaints in order to be an effective oversight and accountability mechanism. My understanding is that the inspector-general is very proactive in this area. He is an independent person who is completely separate from the agencies and, as I said, from government. He takes his role seriously and provides independent assurance to the Australian government, the parliament and the community that the security intelligence agencies conduct their activities according to the law, behave with propriety, obey ministerial guidelines and directives, and respect human rights. In the scheme of what I have asked you to explain—the mischief—I feel very comfortable that there is no problem with respect to this aspect of your complaint.

                   I will move on to the Intelligence Services Act, which the minister raised. The question that I asked was: under that act, will the foreign minister have to make any amendments or new rules regarding
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIS" rel="nofollow">
                    ASIS
                   </a>
                   ’s use of information under this legislation? You raise the issue of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, IGIS. My understanding is that the access to
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AUSTRAC" rel="nofollow">
                    AUSTRAC
                   </a>
                   information by not only ASIS, under this legislation, but also
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
                    ASIO
                   </a>
                   , under the previous legislation, is not something that a person knows is occurring. If those agencies have access to information, through AUSTRAC, about somebody’s financial transactions, it is secret in the sense that that person or that business does not know that it is occurring. The way I understand the role of IGIS is that people can make complaints to IGIS about the activities of ASIO. If they do not know that ASIO or ASIS is accessing information about their financial transactions then how can they make a complaint to IGIS? If the minister could address that, that would be appreciated.

                    With respect to the foreign minister, I think the answer to your question is that there is no need for any legislative amendment that would enable him to further carry out those powers. He is able to do that on the basis of the legislative framework as it now stands. If, Senator Nettle, you think that notice should be provided prior to accessing accounts, I suggest that your opposition to the bill is so fundamental as to mean that you do not agree that we should be pursuing anti-money laundering at all.

                     I could give my speech from the second reading debate again if the minister wants to hear what the concerns of the
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
                      Australian Greens
                     </a>
                     are. I note that in the minister’s contribution to the second reading debate he did not address any of the issues that I raised. In my speech I said that the Greens do not have a concern. Obviously we do not—and I have said this many times before. Everyone wants to ensure that we do not have the financing of terrorism going on, but we want to ensure that any legislation that we bring in to implement that proposal is designed to deal with the financing of terrorism.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     We have raised concerns before about the definition of terrorism that is used, because we think it is too broad. Our concern in relation to this legislation is something that I dealt with in the debate on the first round of the anti-money-laundering legislation, which was that it allows the banks to set up a system of risk management. It is their responsibility to make sure that they are not involved in the financing of terrorism. It outsources that responsibility to the banks. Then the banks are exempt from antidiscrimination legislation, which means that they can set up a system whereby anybody who has an unusual or ethnic sounding name can legitimately be caught up in the banks’ risk management assessment and the assumption can be made that they are financing terrorism.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I have raised examples of this before. One was the Iranian woman who was running a restaurant. The banks assumed, because she had regular payments going to Iran—to get dates for her restaurant that she runs here—that she was financing terrorism. The assumption was that she was financing terrorism. The other example that I raised was the record store in Melbourne which is called the
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shining_Path" rel="nofollow">
                      Shining Path
                     </a>
                     —the same name as the Peruvian organisation. The owner’s finances were shut down and frozen for months. It was only when he went to the media that he could get any action from the government to unfreeze those resources. Nobody is saying that we do not want to ensure that we stop the financing of terrorism, but we want to have laws that are designed specifically for that purpose. Our concern has been that these laws are not narrow enough. That is the general concern that I have had about both this piece of legislation and, most importantly, the earlier anti-money-laundering legislation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     My concern about this legislation, which I addressed in my speech in the second reading debate, was why
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIS" rel="nofollow">
                      ASIS
                     </a>
                     should now have access to
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AUSTRAC" rel="nofollow">
                      AUSTRAC
                     </a>
                     . There are 30 other organisations that have access to AUSTRAC. That happened under the previous legislation. This piece of legislation has been billed by the government as being technical amendments. Apart from this issue, they are technical amendments, and the Greens are happy to support them. We think that the changes to do with liability are an improvement, but our question is: why does ASIS have access to AUSTRAC? This is a technical amendment bill. Were they forgotten? Was it intended that they would have access or has it been requested subsequently? Given the information that is available in the public realm and given the fact that—as you have said yourself, Minister—they are an organisation for spying overseas, not for spying on Australians, how does that responsibility link in with having access to the financial records of Australians? It is not obvious, and that is why I am asking the questions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     In answer to the question on IGIS, in these circumstances the government’s response is often that we can ensure that things are operating properly because of IGIS. I accept what the minister says about the capacity for IGIS to initiate an inquiry. If the minister were able to elaborate on that at all, that would be appreciated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     One of the other rationales that is often put up is that people can complain to IGIS. But if you do not know that you are being treated in this way then you are not able to complain. So this is my question: how can IGIS provide that genuine oversight if people cannot make complaints to them because they do not know? I am not saying that they should not be able to; I am questioning the government’s logic around saying that IGIS is a safeguard. How can IGIS be the safeguard if people do not know that they are the subject of intelligence organisations’ scrutiny and therefore able to make a complaint to IGIS? That is the way IGIS has been proposed: as a complaints forum. How can that operate if you do not know and therefore are unable to make a complaint?

                      </a>
                      to do the same thing already and that we are simply completing the circle of intelligence services that can utilise AUSTRAC information and provide it to other sovereign powers to our benefit. If the senator cannot come to terms with those matters, I respectfully suggest that she is opposed to the fundamentals of the collection of data in the fight against money laundering. I am still waiting to hear of an example in which the human rights issue has occurred or there has been some abuse. The senator can attend committee meetings and the senator can ask questions at question time on these matters. I note that I do not think any of that has occurred. I suspect, with respect, that we are taking a point here that is so obscure as to really suggest, Senator Nettle, that you are simply opposed to the direction and object of the bill.

                       As I have indicated, there were two examples that I gave in my speech in the second reading debate on the first tranche of the anti-money-laundering legislation. I will briefly, off the top of my head, outline what they were. There is a record store in Melbourne which is called the
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shining_Path" rel="nofollow">
                        Shining Path
                       </a>
                       . They have the same name as a Peruvian group. The store had all of their finances frozen and they were not able to access those finances for many months when they were going through a process of trying to get government agencies to unfreeze them. They were a record store, and I suspect that with some investigation it would become reasonably obvious how they had come about. They had all of their finances frozen, and there was no process for going to government agencies to get them to reopen and unfreeze the finances of the record store so that the small business operator could continue on with his business.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       In that instance, it was months later and only when he went to the media that he managed to get the government agencies that he had been dealing with to unfreeze his small business finances so that he could continue on with his record store. That is one example that I am interested in. What are the safeguards, what are the mechanisms in place, for people with legitimate business activities who get caught up in this legislation? As I have raised before, we have concerns about the net being thrown too wide. I want to make sure that there are safeguards for those people with legitimate businesses.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       The other example that I gave was in the media. It was in the Sydney

                       </i>
                       at the time of the discussion around the first tranche of legislation. It was of a woman who was from Iran and who ran a number of restaurants. She was importing food from Iran, so she had regular payments going to Iran. She went through a similar circumstance with her bank. It is understandable that her bank made the assumption, because the way the legislation is designed is that the risk is put on to the bank so they need to prove that their customers are not financing terrorism. The whole system is designed so that the banks need to make sure that they are covered. They are exempt from antidiscrimination legislation, they can make an assumption and then it is up to the person to prove that it is not the case.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       They are two examples of people with legitimate business activities who have been caught up by this legislation because, as the Greens say, the net has been thrown too wide. We are very happy to be involved in stopping the financing of terrorism; everyone is. But if you throw the net too wide and you catch legitimate people, where are the safeguards for them? How do they get through the maze to get their finances unfrozen so that they can continue with their operations?

So, under this or other legislation, their activities may see people having their bank accounts frozen, because the assumption is that they are financing terrorism. What safeguards are in place through this legislation around anti-money laundering for legitimate people who get caught up—not through the intelligence but through the criminal investigation, or it could have an element of intelligence in it as well—and have their bank accounts frozen because the assumption is that they are financing terrorism? If they are a legitimate business, what do they do?

The Minister for Foreign Affairs must approve it and the director-general of the agency must be satisfied that it is reasonable. Your question is about the next step beyond this legislation. This is simply about the raising of intelligence and its dissemination.

                               information and said that the idea behind this is to include

                               . I think ‘complete the circle’ was the language that he used in including ASIS in this. Maybe the minister can explain something for me. My understanding is that ASIO and ASIS are different. ASIO’s purview is to spy on Australians and ASIS’s job is overseas activities.

                                 I am going on the public guidelines. We do not have very much information about what
                                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIS" rel="nofollow">

                                 do. But if you look on the website, you see that it says, ‘ASIS is Australia’s overseas human intelligence collection agency.’ The legislation that defines what ASIS do talks about ASIS operating outside of Australian territory. So they are different. So, on what we have in the legislation about
                                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">

                                 already having access to that information, it is their job to spy on Australians. I am using simple language because I think it helps us understand what we are talking about. If ASIS’s job is to spy outside Australia, why do they need this access? I see them as different and I would like an explanation as to why ASIS, given what I understand to be their different role, need this access.

                                  is an intelligence agency offshore, as you have described. It is not about onshore spies and offshore spies; it is simply about intelligence. The good senator would be aware that the movement of money nowadays is done electronically across sovereign borders. Where intelligence indicates that sums such as would trigger the thresholds as set out in the legislation are moved offshore into a sovereign nation, obviously the jurisdiction with respect to intelligence changes from ASIO onshore to ASIS offshore. In those circumstances, in order to have any value to Australia, we must have an agency offshore that can utilise that intelligence and use its good officers and rapport with sovereign nations such that they can endeavour to respond to the threat of money laundering in that sovereign country. That is the explanation as to why we have ASIS involved in the legislation. In a nutshell, the reason is that there is an awful lot of intelligence relating to money being moved offshore.

                                     I am going to what is currently there, which is about ASIO’s existing access to AUSTRAC, whereby ASIO can disclose information that they got from AUSTRAC to other people for the purpose of their work. If what is currently there allows ASIO to disclose information they got from AUSTRAC to ASIS officers, then why do we need, in this next piece of legislation, to specifically give ASIS access to AUSTRAC information? That is what I am trying to understand. What I read in the existing legislation is that they can already do that. Perhaps I am wrong. If they can already do that, why do we need to give ASIS specific access to the AUSTRAC information? They can already get it, when they need it, through ASIO.

                                      I might be able to help with some of this. If you think about it in a broad sense,
                                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIS" rel="nofollow">
                                       ASIS

                                      looks after the external—in other words, not Australian citizens. They effectively look after intelligence offshore.
                                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
                                       ASIO

                                      looks after intelligence onshore. Therefore, the remit of ASIS is for offshore intelligence gathering, and the remit of ASIO is for onshore intelligence gathering. It would then be inappropriate if you had ASIO, dealing with onshore intelligence, supplying intelligence to an offshore intelligence-gathering organisation. So you could understand why ASIS would want access to

                                      and its intelligence about transactions that are going offshore. It would then make sense. It would be, in my view, inappropriate for ASIO to be the conduit for offshore. You would then have ASIO effectively operating outside their remit, because they would then be dealing with offshore intelligence gathering, which they are not entitled to do. Therefore, the need for this amendment is clear. ASIS does require access to AUSTRAC and the various money information and financial intelligence that AUSTRAC has.

                                      The other point that was not raised is that there is independent oversight by the inspector-general. They do not have to act on complaint; therefore, they do have the ability to go in and look at the procedures, the safeguards and all those matters that ensure that they both are operating within their respective remits in that area.

                                      and Counter-Terrorism Financing Amendment Bill 2007, which Labor supports. They are clearly matters that need to be addressed, as is the amendment dealing with ASIS. Clearly, it is necessary for ASIS to have access to AUSTRAC and the information that AUSTRAC has, but I will be following that up, perhaps a little later this evening—but not in the vein of what we have been pursuing to date.

                                      ; I think that has been dealt with. It is not within this. The minister did make the point that AUSTRAC looks after intelligence. Under this act it also has a wider remit, as we know. It now has both an intelligence remit and an enforcement remit, but that is obviously under another act as well. AUSTRAC is not only a body that gathers financial intelligence; it also has an enforcement role under another act. I hope that helps.

                                       doing the work here. Senator Ludwig said that ASIS are not spying on Australians, which has been an issue of contention before, but it was actually out of the royal commission when

                                       said, ‘But they do keep records and files on Australians,’ and that is an issue of concern for Australians.

                                       records so that they can be involved in overseas activities rather than going through ASIO, you could extrapolate from that argument that this amendment we are dealing with right now is about giving foreign intelligence agencies access to information through ASIS. If the argument is that it should not go from ASIO through to ASIS, you could mount an argument to say the foreign intelligence agencies should have that direct access rather than going through ASIS, as is proposed.

                                       Minister, in the explanations that have been given in the chamber to date, would it be appropriate to limit ASIS’s access to AUSTRAC to that information which relates to overseas financial transactions? If the idea is that we have ASIO and

                                       doing the domestic transactions, with oversight under the existing legislation, and ASIS is for overseas, why then not just limit ASIS’s access to AUSTRAC information to overseas transactions?

                                        would receive information relating to money that originates in or has come into Australia but has a nexus to a foreign sovereign power, she can understand that is why the information goes to ASIS. ASIS is not told of onshore Australian-to-Australian transactions. ASIS is never advised of Sydney-to-Melbourne transactions unless there is some nexus, because it would be a completely vestigial and futile exercise to disseminate intelligence that was not relevant to an ASIS agency in any particular country. There has to be a nexus. To some extent, Senator, it is a matter of common sense and logic.

                                            The information must fall within—we have heard the word ‘remit’ used by the learned opposition spokesperson; I would use the word ‘jurisdiction’—the jurisdiction of
                                            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIS" rel="nofollow">

                                            . In order for it to fall within the jurisdiction of ASIS, you need to understand the objects, powers and duties of ASIS, as described in its enacting and enabling legislation. If there were a foreign element that would trigger those thresholds in a Sydney-Melbourne piece of information, that piece of information would lawfully fit within the remit or jurisdiction of ASIS. Subject to what my learned friend on the other side has said with respect to section 133A,
                                            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AUSTRAC" rel="nofollow">

                                            would then appropriately be able to provide information to a foreign intelligence agency and then authorise it as an authorised communication to such agency from AUSTRAC via ASIS.

It just seems weird that the AUSTRAC CEO will make that decision. Presumably, they would then need to be given an understanding of all the activities of ASIS in order to make those kinds of decisions. Is that the way that it would work? Would the AUSTRAC CEO make the decision about whether it fits within the purview of ASIS? How would that work in a practical sense? What information would they be given access to? I imagine that, if the AUSTRAC CEO is the person who is deciding this, they are not going to know the bounds of the investigation. Does the AUSTRAC CEO decide whether it fits within the jurisdiction of ASIS? How does the handing-over of information work in a practical sense? Do they hand over all the information? I cannot imagine that they would be able to have access only to what relates to their investigation, because the AUSTRAC CEO is not going to know what the ASIS investigation involves.

Each of those officers from the requesting agency is himself bound to ensure that the information is properly used by them in the performance of the functions of that agency. So there is a duality of responsibility here. The requesting agency has to ensure that the information is relevant to its functions and powers, and obviously that would convert to a current investigation. The providing CEO of

So each of the officials in the interaction that Senator Nettle has discussed has to be satisfied that they are acting within their powers.

What is in place to ensure that they have all the information that they need to make an assessment about whether or not an ASIS request is legitimate and within their powers? ASIS people can argue the powers of ASIS in determining that; it is probably something that someone like the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security also knows quite well. What is in place to ensure that the AUSTRAC CEO is in a position to have that information and to make the decision about whether the request from ASIS is an appropriate one within the powers of ASIS?

There is a scrutiny process. Information that is outside or irrelevant to that specific designation of information cannot be provided.

                                                     or other intelligence agency request is within the purview. What information do they have to assist them in making the assessment about whether the request from ASIS is appropriate?

                                                     I accept the answer you have given about how it would work in a practical sense, but it is a big job to have them do. What information and expertise does the AUSTRAC CEO have in order to make the assessment about whether or not the ASIS request is appropriate to the purview of ASIS?

                                                      asks AUSTRAC to take the name ‘Australian Wheat Board Ltd’ and run it through the AUSTRAC database, or use a data-mining software to query the various databases that they may have and see what matches come out the other end.

                                                      Had it been in place at that time, the match might have come out the other end to show that there was a figure of $300 million being transferred. That is the practical application of it and that is how you can use it for financial intelligence information. It holds financial intelligence. Why they want to run a particular company, financial institution or person through the system will sometimes be unknown to the AUSTRAC
                                                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">

                                                      . They put those things in place to ensure that they know that there is a relationship and the AUSTRAC CEO has an entrusted official in place. You can see how they could use the information advantageously. It would have been very helpful if that had been run back then, but it was not, as far as we are aware—or as far as we are told. That is the practical way these things work.

                                                      It does not necessarily mean that ASIS might be swimming around in AUSTRAC’s database unguided. But in this instance—if we can use the example—ASIS would be conducting an investigation into those overseas transactions and then use the names and various information it has in place to create a picture by searching the database in a variety of ways using a variety of analytical tools to come up with answers. Those answers then fit into a bigger picture of the money trail—where the money has gone, how the money has gone, who the money has gone with, and who the entities are that it might be associated with. That is the purpose of it. That might help.
