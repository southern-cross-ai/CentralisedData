        In the couple of minutes left before question time, I want to reflect upon the contribution that my good friend Dr Andrew Southcott has made in the House of Representatives. Dr Southcott has been a member of parliament for 20 years and he has been a very good friend over that time. I had the great fortune the other day to spend some time with the Liberal candidate for Boothby, Nicolle Flint. Nicolle Flint is perhaps one of the most accomplished young women to put her hand up for politics—certainly in

         South Australia
        </a>
        in recent times. I am absolutely delighted to say that Ms Flint has been preselected as the candidate for Boothby and she is working tirelessly to represent the interests of the people of Boothby, following in the footsteps of Dr Southcott.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ms Flint has been a noted journalist. She has never been afraid to put forward a point of view which has stood in the way of the juggernaut of the Labor Party. Of course, they have tried to demonise her for it because some of the misogynists on that side do not like an opinionated young woman putting her hand up for parliament. But Nicolle is not only a young woman with a great history of sticking up for what she believes in; she is also going to make an excellent representative for the people of Boothby when it comes to the election and they are given that choice. Already she has conducted 100 or more interviews and meetings with the community at large. She has been very well received. She is absolutely advocating for reform of the playing fields in Boothby—which also commemorate a significant event during World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">

        . This is truly a person of substance—a person who is committed to making a massive difference in this place and in representing the people of Boothby.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have an extraordinary opportunity to see one of the most well-credentialed young people to come into this place and to represent an excellent electorate, following in the great footsteps of Dr Andrew Southcott. Ms Flint is also going to be a doctor, because she is just concluding her PhD studies. Not only is she an advocate, not only is she educated, not only is she a fierce performer—
