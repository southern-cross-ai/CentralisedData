          recognises the limitations of this model, as evidenced by the fact that 51 per cent of non-government schools receive more money than they are entitled to on the basis of their socioeconomic status (SES) score and that many issues affect the resourcing needs of schools, aside from socioeconomic status; and

         Reasons for Urgency
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The amendments are required urgently so that comprehensive implementation of the special measures in the Northern Territory may continue.  Notably, the amendments relating to the permit system are required as soon as possible after 17 February 2008, when the framework for major changes to the permit system, as introduced by the previous government, commences.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        While part of the previous government’s changes providing public access to communities can be limited by not making a Ministerial determination required to make most roads to communities permit free, the public will be able to access communities by air or sea from 17 February 2008.  Passage of the permit measures in this bill is required as soon as possible after 17 February 2008 to repeal the previous government’s changes, thereby removing the ability of the public to access communities by air or sea without a permit.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There has been little communication of the detail and nature of the previous government’s changes to Aboriginal people and the general community in the Northern Territory and there are reports of considerable confusion in this regard.  Any delay in implementing the repeal of the previous government’s changes will increase this confusion, especially as communities will be accessible without a permit by air or sea but not by road.

        The Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill amends the Interstate Road Transport Charge Act 1985 to apply the 2007 Heavy Vehicle Charges Determination to vehicles and trailers registered under the Federal Interstate Registration Scheme (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRS" rel="nofollow">

        In conjunction with the implementation of the charges the Road Transport Charges (Australian Capital Territory) Act 1993 (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTC" rel="nofollow">
         RTC
        </a>
        Act) will need to be repealed by 1 July 2008.  Implementation of the new 2007 Heavy Vehicle Charges Determination for a number of jurisdictions is dependent on the RTC Act being repealed.  In relation to the Australian Capital Territory, this is because it is the host jurisdiction for the template legislation.  Several jurisdictions reference the Act for the purposes of national heavy vehicle registration charges or automatic annual adjustments to charges.

        It is essential that the Australian Government has the legislative authority to apply this determination to vehicles and trailers registered under the FIRS at the same time as all other jurisdictions.  This will achieve nationally consistent heavy vehicle registration charges.

       <p class="italic">
        While most States and Territories currently provide for heavy vehicle registration charges in their own legislation, others are linked to Australian Government legislation.  To enable jurisdictions such as the Australian Capital Territory to implement the new determination, the RTC Act must be repealed to enable their State legislation to prevail.  The new national heavy vehicle (registration) charges model legislation will effectively replace the repealed RTC Act. If approved, the model legislation will be scheduled in regulations, under the National Transport Commission Act 2003.  Under the terms of the Intergovernmental Agreement for Regulatory and Operational Reform in Road, Rail and Inter-modal Transport the Commonwealth has agreed to “repeal any road transport legislation that has been enacted by the Commonwealth for the

        Plans to streamline the Tradex Scheme, including through the de-linking of the scheme from duty Drawback regulations, have been in place since January 2006.  Those plans became more urgent on 19 October 2006, when amendments were made to the Customs Regulations to modify administrative aspects of duty Drawback.  Those modifications included changes to the eligibility criteria for duty drawback that raised doubts about the eligibility of many importers for the Tradex Scheme.  Since that time, the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, and many of its clients, have had to follow additional procedures required only because of the current legislative framework.
