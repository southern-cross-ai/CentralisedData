         I thank Senator Back for his question, noting his particular interest in the topic as Chair of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee. As Senator Back has alluded to, Australia has had a near continuous maritime presence in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
          Middle East
         </a>
         for over two decades now. Our frigate
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS" rel="nofollow">

         is currently located in the Middle East, having succeeded HMAS

         , and
         <i>

         is in fact the 62nd rotation of a

          Gulf War
         </a>
         in 1990.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since 1 July 2014, our contributions to maritime operations have been under the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMF" rel="nofollow">
          CMF
         </a>
         , or Combined Maritime Forces, in the Middle East region and in counter-piracy operations in the western
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean" rel="nofollow">
          Indian Ocean
         </a>
         . These are waters that continue to be strategically very important to our economic and trade interests. By patrolling those known smuggling routes and conducting boarding operations, Australia and our coalition partners are able to degrade the efforts of terrorist organisations and insurgent forces that are particularly funded by smuggling. Piracy has to some degree declined but, without a continued security presence, there is always a very high risk that it could in fact return.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia is committed to the maritime security of the Middle East, as we have long-term vested interests there. The sea lanes through that area are absolutely vital to international trade, and the volume of traffic through that area will only continue to increase on an international basis. As a responsible nation and as part of those Combined Maritime Forces we will continue to do our part to promote stability and promote prosperity through our naval vessels and our personnel who operate in this particular region.

           It is very important to emphasise that this is, indeed, an international effort. The Combined Maritime Forces that I referred to in my first answer is a 31-nation naval partnership that ensures security, stability and prosperity across more than 3.2 million square miles of international waters.

             Over the past 12 months what Australian naval vessels have achieved in this region is particularly impressive. They have seized around 2.4 tonnes of illegal narcotics with a street value of around $800 million.

             patrolled more than 37,000 nautical miles. She conducted more than 50 boarding operations and seized almost a tonne of heroin. Her largest seizure alone was 427 kilograms. In fact, over the past 12 months there have also been no successful pirate attacks reported in the region.

             is on her way home for a well-earned rest, and I want to thank her commander and crew for their tireless efforts. They are very close now; they are, in fact, expected in Sydney on Sunday morning. I know that there will be many very happy family reunions, but also a very sincere acknowledgement from the people of Australia for their achievements on their operation.
