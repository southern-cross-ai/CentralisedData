         The Government
        </a>
        welcomes the Committee's report.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         The Committee
        </a>
        makes two recommendations about Key Performance Indicators (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPI" rel="nofollow">
         KPI
        </a>
        s) used to assess the Australian Crime Commission's (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACC" rel="nofollow">
         ACC
        </a>
        ) performance against the targets set out in its annual Portfolio Budget Statements. The Government is pleased to accept both recommendations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 1
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        3.18: The Committee recommends that the Australian Crime Commission review and re-examine its KPI concerning the Australian Criminal Intelligence Database [
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID" rel="nofollow">
         ACID
        </a>
        ] and the Australian Law Enforcement Intelligence Network [ALEIN].
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government accepts the Committee's recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The relevant KPI assessed the performance of ACID and ALEIN on the basis of their availability to users, with a target availability rate of 98 per cent. While the availability rate for 2011-12 exceeded this target, the overall number of searches made using ACID dropped significantly over the same period. This continued a three-year trend of decreasing use of the system.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government recognises the Committee's concern that the KPI may no longer provide an accurate measure of the value of ACID and ALEIN.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_ACC" rel="nofollow">
         The ACC
        </a>
        is currently undertaking a scoping study to determine business requirements for an information technology system to replace ACID and improve ALEIN. The ACID/ALEIN scoping study will assess opportunities to harness technological advances to support the ACC's management of its criminal intelligence holdings.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The ACC has amended its KPI for ACID and ALEIN for the 2013–14 Portfolio Budget Statement. The performance of ACID and ALEIN will now be measured against the following:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        provision of a national criminal intelligence database and analytical tools, which facilitate the sharing and analysis of criminal intelligence across jurisdictions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This new KPI more accurately reflects the ACC's role in maintaining a national database of criminal intelligence, and its efforts to investigate options to further enhance the ACC's criminal intelligence holdings and systems.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 2:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        3.37 The committee recommends that the Australian Crime Commission work towards establishing a balance of qualitative and quantitative Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) which can be measured over time.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        3.38 The committee recommends that the 2012–13 Annual Report of the Australian Crime Commission provide information on progress made towards establishing a balance of qualitative and quantitative KPIs.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government accepts the Committee's recommendations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The ACC has recently developed a revised performance management framework to support the ACC's new
        <i>
         Strategic Plan 2013-18.
        </i>
        The revised framework informed the development of the ACC's Portfolio Budget Statement for 2013-14 and corresponding KPIs.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The new KPIs aim to convey the full scope of the ACC's role in combating serious and organised crime in Australia by including both quantitative and qualitative performance measures.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The new performance management framework is designed to show traditional law enforcement outcomes through measures such as arrests, charges and seizures of illicit commodities. However, it will also provide a basis for qualitative assessment of the value of the ACC's contribution to broader law enforcement outcomes through activities such as those aimed at developing criminal intelligence holdings, informing policy and legislative approaches to key serious and organised crime issues and enhancing partnerships with a range of law enforcement, government and industry partners.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The revised performance management framework will require the ACC to develop new systems for collecting performance data, which will be implemented over the five year operation of the Strategic Plan. The ACC reported on its progress in establishing the new KPIs in the

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee delivered its report on 23 May 2013.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government thanks the Committee for its examination of these important matters and the recommendations it has presented for consideration.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia ' s Aviation Safety System
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Aviation plays a key economic and social role in Australia facilitating economic and productivity growth.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        With strong international and domestic aviation passenger growth forecast to continue over the next decade, and with the Asia-Pacific being the fastest growing aviation market in the world, the Government has emphasised in its aviation policy the need to create a regulatory environment in Australia which facilitates this growth.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        However in the context of this forecast growth, the Australian Government's highest aviation priority is to maintain and further improve our high aviation safety standards.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The strength of Australia's aviation safety framework depends upon our governance arrangements and clearly setting out the roles and responsibilities, processes and procedures to be consistently followed by our Government aviation agencies and industry.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government welcomes the Committee's report as an important contribution to further improve these arrangements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Since the report was released there have been a number of important initiatives announced which address many of the Committee's recommendations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In August 2013 an independent peer review was established by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATSB" rel="nofollow">
         ATSB
        </a>
        ) to examine the ATSB's methodologies and processes, concerns over which were raised in the Committee's report. The peer review report is scheduled to be completed by May 2014.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Also in August 2013 the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Aviation_Safety_Authority" rel="nofollow">
         Civil Aviation Safety Authority
        </a>
        (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CASA" rel="nofollow">
         CASA
        </a>
        ) released a Notice of Proposed Rule Making (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPRM" rel="nofollow">
         NPRM
        </a>
        ) for public and industry comment proposing better safety standards for air ambulance flights. At the request of industry, the comment period for the NPRM was extended until October 2013.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Finally, consistent with this Government's Aviation Policy we have announced the establishment of an Aviation Safety Regulation Review to investigate the structures and processes of all aviation agencies involved in aviation safety.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The review is being conducted by a panel of international aviation experts.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Having regard to these significant developments, the Government's responses to the Committee's 26 recommendations, and the supplementary recommendation of a participating member of the Committee, are attached.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This is the Government's initial response to the Committee pending the completion of the above significant reviews.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 1
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee recommends that the ATSB retrieve VH-NGA flight data recorders without further delay.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government notes this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        However advice from our independent aviation safety agencies, the ATSB and CASA, does not support retrieval of the recorders.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The ATSB has given detailed consideration to the Committee's recommendation. The ATSB has reached its position on the basis that:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Therefore with respect to the ditching of aircraft VH-NGA, the ATSB advises that data to be obtained from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CVR" rel="nofollow">
         CVR
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FDR" rel="nofollow">
         FDR
        </a>
        would offer little information directly relevant to the key safety issues in the investigation not already available from other sources.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The ATSB has also advised that any information obtained would not likely lead to any commensurately significant safety learning or improvement to transport safety. Retrieval of the recorders would also not represent a proper use of limited public resources, consistent with the provisions of the
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Management" rel="nofollow">

          Accountability Act

        and the
        <i>
         Public Service Act 1999,
        </i>
        with which the

         Chief Commissioner
        </a>
        is obliged to comply. It is considered unlikely to lead to a better understanding of any significant lessons learned for the aviation industry.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The current international position, which is what applies to the Committee's recommendation, is that the relevant
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Civil_Aviation_Organization" rel="nofollow">
         International Civil Aviation Organization
        </a>
        (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAO" rel="nofollow">
         ICAO
        </a>
        ) Annexe 13 provides that effective use shall be made of flight recorders in accident or incident investigations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Determining effective use involves weighing up the likely safety benefits to be derived from the information obtained, alongside the cost of the recovery action and having regard to where a crash site is difficult to access.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government is however cognisant of the Committee's concerns over the carrying out of the investigation and therefore supports the current Canadian Transportation Safety Board peer review of the ATSB investigation methodologies and processes having regard to Australia's obligations under ICAO Annex 13. The peer review report is scheduled to be completed by May 2014.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 2
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the Minister, in issuing a new Statement of Expectations to the ATSB, valid from 1 July 2013, make it clear that safety in aviation operations involving passengers (fare paying or those with no control over the flight they are on, e.g. air ambulance) is to be accorded equal priority irrespective of flight classification.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government supports this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government notes that the updated Statement of Expectations (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOE" rel="nofollow">
         SOE
        </a>
        ) provided to the ATSB in April 2013 continued to give priority to transport safety investigations that have the potential to deliver the best safety outcomes for the travelling public.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The ATSB has also committed, acknowledging a finite level of resources, to investigate all fatal accidents involving powered aircraft with a civil registration (VH), regardless of the nature of the operation, including aeromedical flights.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government will consider any further changes to the ATSB SOE arising out of the recommendations of the independent Aviation Safety Regulation Review.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 3
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the ATSB move away from its current approach of forecasting the probability of future events and focus on the analysis of factors which allowed the accident under investigation to occur. This would enable the industry to identify, assess and implement lessons relevant to their own operations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government supports this recommendation in-principle.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        However it is important to note that the current ATSB investigation approach is not just focussed on future events but involves establishing the facts pertaining to an occurrence, conducting the associated analysis of those facts to identify safety factors and issues contributing to, or arising from, the occurrence, and then considering the risk to future safety associated with those factors and issues.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The ATSB's investigation policies and procedures are currently being reviewed with a view to considering how the visibility of safety factors, identified as part of the investigation, can be enhanced and other improvements to its risk analysis processes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Canadian Transportation Safety Board peer review of the ATSB's methodologies and processes will consider investigation management and governance; reporting processes; external communication strategies; and will have regard to obligations under ICAO Annex 13 and issues raised in the Committee's report.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 4
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the ATSB be required to document investigative avenues that were explored and then discarded, providing detailed explanations as to why.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government supports this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The ATSB's investigation policies and procedures currently require investigators to document investigative avenues that were explored and discarded. However ATSB policies and procedures are being reviewed with the objective of ensuring that information is published more explicitly in investigation reports.
       </p>

        Response
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government notes this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Consistent with undertakings given to the Committee, the ATSB will be amending the Pel-Air investigation report to correct administrative errors which have been brought to its attention, including at the inquiry hearings.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        However the re-opening of investigations is ultimately a matter for our independent aviation safety investigatory body, the ATSB.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In this regard, in accordance with ICAO Annex 13, the reopening of an investigation should be considered by the investigating agency where significant new evidence comes to light.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The ATSB's Commission has closely monitored the proceedings of, and submissions to, the inquiry and has advised the Government that it does not consider that any significant new evidence has arisen on issues that have already been considered which are likely to have contributed to the accident.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The ATSB investigation report included the identification of two safety issues which are focussed on organisation, oversight and broad systemic considerations:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Further organisation, oversight and systemic issues have been assessed and addressed by the operator, CASA, and other parties, which is acknowledged in the ATSB report.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Therefore the ATSB does not consider that re-opening its investigation will add further safety benefits, but would unnecessarily divert investigative resources currently involved in other ongoing investigations.

       <p class="italic">
        The Government also notes the Committee's concerns regarding aspects of the investigation and these will be examined as part of the Canadian Transportation Safety Board peer review of the ATSB investigation methodologies and processes having regard to Australia's obligations under ICAO Annex 13.

        On 5 August 2013, CASA released a Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) which provides for better safety standards for air ambulance flights.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        CASA, as part of its legislated responsibilities, is Australia's aviation safety regulator charged with both the development and implementation of the aviation safety regulations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Therefore the Government does not support industry effectively drafting its own regulations through an "industry plan" as suggested by the Committee. Industry however should be closely consulted in the development of aviation safety regulatory proposals and CASA will continue to draw on industry expertise as part of regulatory development and review processes.
       </p>
