        My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Evans. Given that there have been four unauthorised boat arrivals in four days, carrying 137 people including crew, will the minister outline the government’s plans to accommodate this influx of unlawful immigrants, keeping in mind that the existing facilities on

             I will try to get the answer out over the interjections. Senator Kroger and the Senate would be aware that the Rudd Labor government has retained the excision of offshore islands, offshore processing at
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island" rel="nofollow">
              Christmas Island
             </a>
             and mandatory detention of irregular maritime arrivals. Therefore, those persons who have arrived unlawfully in the last few days will be taken to Christmas Island where they will be mandatorily detained.
            </p>
            <p>
             They will be detained in the detention facilities that the Howard government built in anticipation of this problem, they will be given the normal health, identity and security checks, and they will have any claims for asylum considered. We will be able to accommodate the most recent arrivals in the detention centre on Christmas Island. As I have advised the Senate before, we have also been increasing the capacity on Christmas Island in recent times, and there are plans for further capacity to be built in order to ensure that we have the capability of processing unauthorised arrivals on Christmas Island. They will be taken to Christmas Island, they will be detained, they will go through the normal health, identity and security checks, and they will have any claims for asylum assessed. If they are found to be genuine refugees, they will be resettled. If they are found not to be genuine refugees, they will be returned to their country of origin.

               as a response to the increased number of arrivals. We have a range of contingency measures available, including additional accommodation in buildings other than those that have been traditionally used for detention. If absolutely required we have tents available, as used under the previous government. But, as you would be aware, we also have organised for transportable buildings—better known in

                 just say that we have a range of contingencies on the island to deal with increased numbers, some of which we have already brought online. We also have a range of other contingencies that we can use. Obviously the numbers vary. Some people are returned. I think we have had 119 or so people returned to their country of origin when they were found not to be refugees. Six men were returned to

                 . We also have people resettled—people found to be refugees who come off the island. I would make clear to you that it is our intention to accommodate people on Christmas Island. I have made it clear for months that we have the

                 in Darwin if required, but we have the capacity and increased capacity on Christmas Island to deal with the current numbers. That is our first preference. We think that these recent arrivals will be accommodated there.
