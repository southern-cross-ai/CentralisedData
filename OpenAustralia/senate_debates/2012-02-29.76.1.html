           The government has put together a substantial amount of assistance in the jobs and competitiveness package very much having regard to those industries that are trade exposed. There is a substantial amount of assistance for industries which are emissions intensive and trade exposed through the provision of free permits, which will significantly alleviate the effect of a carbon price. The good senator also asked about jobs in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            South Australia

           . I would say to him this: the coalition's policy is to drastically cut and end continued support for the car industry, which, as he knows, is very important to the economy of South Australia.

                South Australia
               </a>
               n senators who come in here and lecture the government on jobs in South Australia while backing in the coalition's ending of assistance to the car sector, really, have no basis on which to make such an assertion. They have no grounds to stand on and some people might even say there is a touch of hypocrisy in those who ask such questions. We are very conscious, as a government, of the importance of supporting jobs, which is why we have put in place a very substantial amount of assistance through the jobs and competitiveness package.

                 In relation to the carbon price, I would again remind a senator, we have a very substantial amount of assistance through the jobs and competitiveness package. We recognise also that many businesses will be able to pass on the price increase to consumers and that is reflected in the assessment of the appropriateness of household compensation. That is why we are providing additional assistance to Australian households, to reflect the fact that there will be some prices that will be passed on. I would remind the senator his party supports an increase in the company tax levy to fund the Paid Parental Leave scheme that the shadow cabinet does not support. I would remind the senator that his party supports a policy which will cost Australian families $1,300 additional tax, for which they will not get any assistance. So, if he really cares about ensuring that our transition to a low-pollution economy is managed sensibly, he certainly would not be supporting the position that Mr Abbott is proposing.

                  , I ask a further supplementary question. Is the minister aware that

                  is planning on moving part of its clinker business offshore to mitigate the additional costs as a result of the government's carbon tax? What is the government's message to the 1,300 workers from Adelaide Brighton whose jobs may disappear as a direct consequence of this government's job-destroying carbon tax?

                   Yes, it is Senator Brandis. I am not in the boardrooms of every company in Australia. That is true. I wish I was as smart as Senator Brandis though and I might actually know it all, wouldn't I?

                       This government is committed to supporting Australian jobs. That commitment has been demonstrated through our response to the global financial crisis. That commitment is demonstrated by the fact there are 200,000 Australians in jobs who would not otherwise be had we followed the advice of the Leader of the Opposition. Our commitment is demon­strated by the fact that we have put substantial assistance in our clean energy package to support jobs and competitiveness. Our commitment is demonstrated by the investment in skills that we know is critical to give Australians the tools to get the jobs not just of today but of the future.
