        My question is to the Minister for Finance, Senator Cormann. I refer to the minister's joint statement with the Treasurer on 2 September 2014 that freezing the superannuation guarantee would have the impact of reducing businesses' overall wage bills. How can the minister and government claim that workers will have more money in their pockets when the minister and the Treasurer say that freezing the superannuation guarantee will reduce wage bills?

         I thank Senator Cameron for that question. While I have not got the release in front of me, I can confirm that he accurately quoted a small part of that release in isolation. I see him smile and laugh; he knows that is exactly what has happened. The truth is that increases in superannuation payments come out of wages and represent a cost to business. Everybody on this side of the chamber knows this.
        </p>
        <p>
         What I have pointed out for a very long time is that Mr Shorten—the Leader of the Opposition, when he was the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation—kept saying, 'No, no, no. There are increases in compulsory super. They do not come out of business profits. They come out of people's wages.' He kept saying, 'We are going to go and put our hands into people's pockets. Increases in compulsory super come out of people's wages.' On 1 July 2015, under Mr Shorten's plan, people were going to get a 0.5 per cent pay cut in order to pay for the increase in compulsory super.
        </p>
        <p>
         The important point here is that increases in compulsory super do not come out of thin air. They either come out of people's wages or they come out of the cost of doing business. By reducing the cost of doing business, we are enabling businesses across Australia to employ more Australians. Guess what? We inherited an economy growing below trend and rising unemployment from the Labor Party. We are working to turn that around. We are keen to ensure that we can grow a stronger economy and create more jobs on the back of stronger investment. Part of that is ensuring that businesses in Australia are more competitive internationally than what they have been in the past.

          of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, that the correlation between the superannuation freeze and wage increases would 'obviously not be linear' and that 'in the end, employers will pay what they can afford to pay.' Does the minister stand by his statement yesterday that workers will be better off because they will have more money in their pockets?

           That statement by Ms Carnell is very astute and is entirely accurate. I absolutely stand by everything that the government has said in relation to these matters. The point is that employers who hire employees and workers consider the overall remuneration package. If you pay an employee more in super, you pay them less in wages. I do not know which part of that mathematical formula Senator Cameron does not understand. Perhaps in the union movement people do not understand these sorts of realities. If you are in business, you look at the total cost of employing a particular employee. You pay more on superannuation, you pay less on pre-retirement take-home pay.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Senate" rel="nofollow">
            The Senate
           </a>
           agreed with the government that—in the context of the mining tax repeal package that we have put forward and the amendments that the Senate was keen on—we needed to ensure that there were other adjustments to the superannuation arrangements. That means that people will end up with more money in their pocket prior to retirement than they otherwise would.
