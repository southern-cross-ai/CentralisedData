        informed the Senate that I had received letters from Senators Burston and Lambie seeking appointment to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation and References Committees. For the positions to be nominated by any minority group or independent senators, in accordance with standing orders, two ballots will be held to determine which one of the two senators is to be appointed to each committee.

        Before proceeding to the ballots, the bells will be rung for four minutes. The ballots will be conducted consecutively, starting with a ballot for the legislation committee.

            The purpose of speaking whilst the bells are ringing, really, is to clarify points in relation to the division. The point you have made is probably not relevant to the division we are about to have. It's a matter for committees to determine attendance, and individual senators.
           </p>

             The bells having been rung—

           </p>
           <p>
            Order! The bells have been rung for four minutes. We will now proceed to the ballot for the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee. Grey ballot papers will be distributed and you are asked to write on the paper the name of the candidate you wish to vote for, and I remind you the candidates are senators Burston and Lambie. I invite Senator Burston and Senator Lambie to act as scrutineers.
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
             Can I
            </a>
            remind senators to remain in their seats during the entire process.

           <p class="italic">

             A ballot having been taken—
            </i>
           </p>
           <p>
            Order! The result of the ballot being Senator Burston, 29 votes, and Senator Lambie, 37 votes, Senator Lambie is elected. Unless any senator wishes for me to ring the bells again, I propose to move straight into the second ballot. No senator requests for the bells to be rung, so we will proceed to the ballot relating to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee. Pink ballot papers will be distributed. I indicate that the two candidates are again Senators Burston and Lambie. Senators, could I just propose this question: if any senator—and it is awkward because I don't want people to have to declare as it is a secret ballot—wanted to change their vote then we would proceed to a ballot. If senators wanted to keep the same vote they had in the first ballot then it would make no sense in having a second ballot. However, I am in the hands of senators as to whether you want to proceed to a ballot or not. Maybe if I just ask the question of the two leaders: do we wish to proceed to a ballot? The candidates?

              There is ambiguity. We will conduct a ballot.

             <p>
              Has every senator voted? I will ask the Clerks to collect the ballot papers. Again, I invite the candidates Senators Burston and Lambie to come forward to act as scrutineers. There being 28 votes for Senator Burston and 36 votes for Senator Lambie, Senator Lambie again is elected to the position on the committee.
