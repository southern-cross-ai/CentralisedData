        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Water, Senator Watt. Minister, in his second reading speech to the House on the Water Amendment (Water for the Environment Special Account) Bill 2012, then water minister Burke stated:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Importantly, the plan being proposed by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority stipulates that additional water … only be acquired through methods that deliver additional water for the environment without negative social and economic consequences such as infrastructure.
       </p>
       <p>
        Why is this government refusing to release the details of the social and economic impact to communities if the proposed Murray-Darling water recovery strategy is implemented, which communities will be targeted and what impact it will have on the costs of living and at the supermarket for constituents?

         Thank you for getting to the question, Senator Davey. In broad terms, for the reason this government, the Albanese government, is taking serious action about the Murray-Darling Basin, if you want to know why we're doing that, I'd suggest to the National Party: have a look in the mirror. Have a look in the mirror at the decade of inaction that the Liberal and National parties took over 10 years in implementing the Murray-Darling Basin Plan—

               Thank you, President. As I said, if the Nationals want to understand why this government has to do something to rescue the Murray-Darling Basin then they only need to look back at their track record over the 10 years that they were in power. The Murray-Darling Basin Plan that the former government was allegedly committed to required the recovery of 450 gigalitres of water for the environment. Guess how much was recovered in 10 years of coalition government?

                              , also said, in 20 February 2012, 'We don't do the environment, or anyone, a favour if we acquire volumes of water and have the impact that may have on communities, and then discover it can't actually be used.' Why is the government refusing to release details around which constraints programs it believes are needed to ensure environmental outcomes can be achieved?

                               Thank you, Senator Davey. Minister Burke was a very fine agriculture minister. He was also a very fine environment and water minister, who oversaw the delivery of the first Murray-Darling Basin Plan—a plan that is absolutely essential to deliver if we are to save agriculture on the eastern coast of our country. There are thousands of jobs and hundreds of communities that are depending upon the delivery of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. They were profoundly let down by 10 years of Liberal and National Party governments, which delivered two gigalitres out of the 450 required for environmental recovery.

                               What we have said is that, in delivering our plan, we will provide more time for it to be delivered, we will provide more options to deliver the remaining water—including water efficiency infrastructure projects—

They don't like hearing about the fact that they undermined the future of Australian agriculture and the future of our most important food bowl. We're not going to let that happen and we're going to save the Murray-Darling Basin.

                                      I will try again to get an answer. Basin Communities Committee Indigenous member, Mr Feli McHughes, stated recently, 'I'm very concerned that buybacks will further spiral our people in these communities into poverty'. When will the government listen to basin communities and voices like Mr McHughes's, and look at alternatives being proposed, like billabong restoration and complementary measures?

                                       Thank you, Senator Davey. Senator Davey has just exemplified the National Party's approach to this entire issue, which is to misrepresent the government's position in inquiries, in the media and to basin communities.

                                       We have made very clear over and over again that we do think that voluntary water buybacks are going to be necessary to save the Murray-Darling Basin, and they weren't required and weren't delivered under the former government.

                                          Well, if Senator Davey had allowed me to answer the question, what I was saying is that we have said that it is going to be necessary to undertake voluntary water buybacks to deliver the plan. But we have also repeatedly said that it is not the only option that we are considering. We are considering water efficiency infrastructure projects, but Senator Davey and people like her go around basin communities misrepresenting the government's policy and pretending it's only about buybacks. We have also said that all buybacks will be voluntary. We have also said that they will be done across the basin in order to minimise the impact on any one particular community. And we have also said that, where they do have a negative impact on communities, there will be structural adjustment assistance provided. It would be good if the National Party were honest for a change.
