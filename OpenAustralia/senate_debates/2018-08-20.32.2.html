         I thank Senator Hume for her question and her absolute commitment to ensuring that Australian households and businesses have the lowest electricity prices possible, which is the driving intention of the Turnbull government and has been for the last couple of years, as we have worked through reform after reform to drive down energy prices. Today, we announced a series of further reforms to further drive down energy prices.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission released its Retail Electricity Pricing Inquiry report in July. They announced and made very clear that the national energy market is not operating in the best interests of Australian consumers and that reform is urgently needed. That's why, today, the Turnbull government has announced that it is going to act on a number of those recommendations. Consistent with recommendations 30 and 49 of the report, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
          ACCC
         </a>
         and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Energy_Regulator" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Energy Regulator
         </a>
         will begin work on calculating a default price for households and small to medium-sized businesses to replace the current non-price-regulated jurisdictions.
        </p>
        <p>
         The ACCC found that a significant gap between standing offer prices and market offer prices has become excessive and that consumers have not been seeking the better deals. The default offer will provide additional protection that, for average consumers, could be in the range of $183 to $416. These are real potential savings, which could be between $561 and upwards of $1,400, to households and medium-sized businesses,. The government will also be accepting the ACCC's recommendation to implement a program to underwrite new, stable, low-cost, dispatchable generation for commercial and industrial consumers, ensuring that that's a technology-neutral program as recommended by the ACCC, giving further action to build on our already successful reforms that are already driving down prices.

              would be given the power to set a default market offer in each region. Customers who are on high-priced standing offers would see their electricity costs decrease as they move to the lower, default market offer.
             </p>
             <p>
              The government would also simplify the confusing array of offers that are currently on the market by requiring retailers to use the new default rate as a reference point for all advertised discounts. This will give customers much greater clarity when they consider whether or not to switch energy plans and, if so, which energy plan to switch to. Limits will also be placed on the penalties that customers can face when they don't pay their bills on time and lose their discounts.
             </p>
             <p>
              The government will work to ensure that states and territories act on this reform but, if they do not agree, will implement it through Commonwealth law because we are determined to make sure this new default offer applies from July 2019 at the latest to give certainty to consumers.

                 Not only are we going to make sure that these reforms are in place but we will hold energy companies to account to make sure they are delivered upon and that consumers see real benefits in relation to these reforms. The
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
                  ACCC
                 </a>
                 will prepare ongoing reports identifying cases where outcomes are unacceptable. Businesses will have the opportunity to explain and rectify those issues, but if businesses fail to do so the ACCC will be empowered to recommend proportional and targeted responses, for the Treasurer's determination. The range of enforcements and remedies that could be applied are wide ranging and far reaching, and go further than any such remedies ever proposed before. They range from beginning with a public warning notice to be issued by the Treasurer, through court-enforceable undertakings and the conversion of the default market office into a binding price cap, to, ultimately, the potential divestiture of assets or parts of energy businesses to make sure those businesses understand the severity of their failure to put consumers' rights first.

                  . Yesterday, when asked about the Prime Minister's last-minute changes to his energy policy, the minister said:

                 <p class="italic">
                  I’m not going to comment on something I haven’t seen the detail of, we are going to take that to the National Party party room, we’ve got a meeting at the Lodge where I am assuming we will be briefed on that tonight.

                 <p class="italic">
                  And post that briefing, post discussing with National Party colleagues and party room I will be much more comfortable in discussing those changes.

We've been incredibly strong for two years on advocating for an affordable, reliable response to the crisis that is facing households and our local industries, with a 300 per cent increase in power prices in my home state of Victoria, on the back of—

                                   Senator Farrell, I'm sorry that you made your way into question time without actually seeing the press conference by the Deputy Prime Minister; the minister for resources; the Leader of the Nationals in the Senate; the agriculture minister; and me—indeed, the entire cabinet team of the National Party—about 45 minutes ago. We stood as one, post our National Party party room meeting, fully endorsing the Prime Minister's announcement and the cabinet decision last night. And, as one, the National Party have been fighting for affordable, reliable energy across this country. We believe that the initiatives outlined by the Prime Minister this morning face the political reality we are in—that is, the only alternative here is the Labor Party's energy policy, based on an emissions target of 45 per cent and a renewable energy target of 50 per cent. If you think 26 per cent is a problem, go down your path. Your modelling is based on Greenpeace modelling, according to your own energy shadow minister. What a joke!
