         In relation to the industries which are represented in those locations, I have visited a number of them. I remind the senator—and it is a pity because I thought Senator Boyce actually had a slightly more realistic and progressive position on climate change than some others, but obviously I was wrong—that, for example, regarding the aluminium smelting and refining, which is an industry represented in Gladstone, as she would know, the government have made clear in the white paper that we would anticipate, obviously subject to the provision of information about emissions, that aluminium smelting would receive 90 per cent free permit allocation.

           Senator Macdonald says I have not talked to them. I have actually visited that factory, Senator Macdonald, and I have met with that company on a number of occasions. Senator Macdonald might want to talk to some of the scientists who actually talk about climate change, but that would not be something that would enter his ken—

             . In terms of aluminium refining, there was an indication that that was likely, again subject to the information being provided, to receive 60 per cent free permits. We have also made clear, for example, that copper smelting is likely to receive emissions-intensive trade-exposed assistance in the form of free permits.

               The point about the workers is that free permits are about the transition. I will take that interjection from Senator Macdonald. He supported the job-destroying

                  , I have a supplementary question, and I would like to move onto the topic of modelling later. Given that Xstrata has indicated that it would be forced to slash at least 1,000 Australian jobs and that Alcoa has stated that at least 800 of its Australian workers will be let go because of the government’s flawed emissions trading scheme, how many more companies have indicated to the government that they also will be forced to cut their workforce and future investment in Australia as a result of the emissions trading scheme?

                   I am asked about Alcoa and I again remind the good senator that we have indicated in the white paper that aluminium is likely to receive 90 per cent free permits. I also note that the Alcoa response to the draft legislation was to welcome it and indicate that they would work through the detail over the coming weeks. The reality is that we are ensuring a substantial amount of assistance today whilst driving the incentives for the clean jobs of tomorrow. Those opposite never talk about the jobs that are lost or forgone.

                       The question included a reference to Alcoa and I am talking about Alcoa. I understand that the senators may not like the answer because the answer is that not only are we on this side serious about supporting today’s jobs through the provision of assistance such as free permits but we also want to drive investment in the clean jobs of the future.

                               Those opposite do not wish to talk about the jobs that will be lost if we do not act on climate change in this country. They are happy to continue to duck that challenge, as they did for 12 years in government. Those opposite do not want to talk about the jobs forgone. They do not want to talk about the fact that we need to prepare this nation for a time where there is a global carbon constraint and we have to compete in that world.
