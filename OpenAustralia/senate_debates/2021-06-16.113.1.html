        My question is to the Minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme, Senator Reynolds. On 11 May this year, this minister was asked about the tragic death of 23-year-old Liam Danher, who died waiting for a seizure mat. The minister first claimed that she had personally been in contact with Liam's father, then she claimed she had offered to meet and had been in touch with Liam's father and then she admitted it was her office who had been in touch with Liam's father. Can the minister now clarify whether she has personally apologised to Liam's family and, if she has done so, when?

         First and foremost, I reiterate my condolences to Mr Danher's family. Any death of a child is always tragic. My chief of staff has been in contact reasonably regularly with Mr Danher's father. The family has relocated interstate. I have offered to meet with both parents at their convenience, and they have asked for me to wait until I have further information, which will come from the outcome of the inquiry.

           Why after 78 days has this minister failed to pick up the phone to personally apologise to Liam Danher's family? Why has she left it to her office?

            As I have said, my chief of staff has been in contact with Mr Danher, and I have, through my chief of staff, offered to either in person or on the phone talk with Mr Danher myself. My understanding is that he does want to talk to me but when I've got answers that will come after the outcome of the investigation. At that point, and at his request, that is when I will have contact with him directly, if he still wants to have that conversation.

              When asked how many thousands of taxpayer dollars the Morrison government spent on legal advice and lawyers to deny Liam his $445 seizure mat, the minister failed to answer and falsely claimed that she had been in contact with Mr Danher personally. Remember that? Will the minister now be upfront with the Senate and answer that question?
