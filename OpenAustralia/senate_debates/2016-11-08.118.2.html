        On behalf of the Chair of the

         Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security

        , I present reports of the committee and a corrigendum, as listed at item 13 on today's
        <i>
         Order of Business
        </i>
        and move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the Senate take note of the reports.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am pleased to present the committee's reports on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Code" rel="nofollow">
         Criminal Code
        </a>
        relisting of six terrorist organisations and the declaration of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State" rel="nofollow">
         Islamic State
        </a>
        as a terrorist organisation under the Australian
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Citizenship Act
        </a>
        2007. These reports fulfil the committee's statutory obligations to review the listing and relisting of terrorist organisations under the Criminal Code and the declaration of terrorist organisations under the Citizenship Act. For each of the six Criminal Code relistings, which include some of the world's most notorious organisations, including al-Qaeda, Jabhat al-Nusra and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jemaah_Islamiyah" rel="nofollow">
         Jemaah Islamiyah
        </a>
        , the committee was satisfied that appropriate processes had been followed and that the organisations continue to meet the criteria to be defined as terrorist organisations.
       </p>
       <p>
        The declaration of Islamic State as a terrorist organisation under the Australia Citizenship Act 2007 was the first of its kind to be reviewed by the committee. The effect of the declaration is that a person aged 14 years or older who is a national or citizen of another country loses their Australian citizenship if they engage in certain conduct on behalf of Islamic State. The committee was satisfied that appropriate processes had been followed and agreed that Islamic State is a terrorist organisation that is opposed to Australia's interests, values, democratic beliefs, rights and liberties, so that if a person were to fight for or be in the service of Islamic State the person would be acting inconsistently with their allegiance to Australia. I am presenting these reports at a time of sustained threat to the security of our community from people who seek to achieve their goals through violent means.
       </p>
       <p>
        I note that the committee's advisory report on the Criminal Code Amendment (High Risk Terrorist Offenders) Bill 2016 was presented out of session last week. The legislation reviewed in these reports demonstrates the need for continued vigilance and the importance of updating Australia's counterterrorism framework to protect the Australian community. I commend the reports to the Senate and seek leave to continue my remarks.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.

           Thank you. Labor senators, of course, will have more to say on this issue when the bill comes before the Senate. Today I want to take the opportunity to speak to the process that the parliamentary joint committee went through in reviewing the bill. In particular, I would like to highlight some of the issues that Labor members were focused on through the committee process.
          </p>
          <p>
           Labor supports the intent of this bill. We acknowledge the threat that terrorism poses for Australians and our responsibility to curtail this risk. We also acknowledge the extraordinary nature of the provisions that this bill seeks to establish. Our concern has been to ensure that proper scrutiny was applied to the provisions of this bill, and as always we seek to strike the appropriate balance.
