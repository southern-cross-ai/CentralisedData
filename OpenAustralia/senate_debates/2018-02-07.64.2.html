        , Senator Canavan. As one of the only regional senators in Queensland, I am constantly hearing about the need for more jobs in regional Queensland, particularly the opportunities for more jobs and investment for the Galilee Basin. Minister, what sort of support is the development of the Galilee Basin receiving?

         I thank Senator O'Sullivan for his question and his long interest in developing the resources of Queensland, including our world-class coal resources. Many Queenslanders support Senator O'Sullivan and me in our quest to get these resources developed so we can provide jobs and income for the Queensland people.

         That is from the words of a Labor candidate at the Queensland election just months ago. He knows the Labor Party have now forgotten them. They are seeking to wipe them out just to win a seat in Melbourne.

            Already the development of the Galilee Basin is employing people. It can employ a lot more if the project proceeds and gets going. Yesterday the Adani company confirmed they're employing 800 people right now. They're employing 235 people in the job-starved town of Townsville, a town that's desperate for jobs. A lot of those people in their Townsville office, some of whom I've met, have moved themselves and their families from Brisbane to Townsville because Adani moved their headquarters there.
           </p>
           <p>
            These are the people that
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Shorten" rel="nofollow">
             Bill Shorten
            </a>
            wants to put out of a job. He wants to put them and their families out of a job after they've upturned their life to move to Townsville for a new opportunity. I think that's disgraceful. It's not just the mine, though:

             John Wagner
            </a>
            , a businessman in Toowoomba, is employing 15 people at the moment. He says that he can employ 100 more if the project goes ahead. I want those hundred jobs for the Toowoomba region—as I'm sure Senator O'Sullivan does.

               As I was saying, the development of a mine like this creates economic opportunity right around Queensland and places like Queensland, but also right around Australia as well, because Adani have committed to use Australian steel on their rail line. It will be one of the few mineral based rail lines in this country that use Australian steel. The steel would be from Whyalla, so the people of Whyalla will get more economic opportunity in

They used to represent the people who worked out in the bush, but now they're so busy sipping lattes in the inner city and lining up for acai bowls in Melbourne that they've forgotten about the jobs and the people in rural and regional Australia.
