       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) How has the Minister or the department investigated the allegations raised by Mr Wilson of interference by ASIO with his employers, family, friends, peers, neighbours and business.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) Has the Minister or the department investigated the allegations raised by Mr Wilson of inappropriate and inadequate oversight and review by the

         Inspector General

        of Intelligence and Security (IGIS) of this matter; if so, how was that investigation carried out and what was the outcome.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) Has the Minister requested any information from ASIO, IGIS or from other sources in considering Mr Wilson's request for an investigation into the allegations concerning ASIO and IGIS; if so: (a) when and to whom was the request made; (b) what details were requested; and (c) was a response provided; if so, can details or a copy of that response be provided.

       <p class="italic">
        (4) Why has IGIS decided not to investigate any matters raised, despite Mr Wilson providing substantive additional allegations and detailed information concerning inappropriate ASIO interference subsequent to IGISs preliminary investigation in 2004.

       <p class="italic">
        (5) What did the preliminary investigation conducted by IGIS in 2004 consist of, and in regard to this: (a) was ASIO asked if there was any substance to the complaints raised by Mr Wilson about ASIO abuse and interference; (b) were any of the people named by Mr Wilson contacted or interviewed; and (c) was evidence against Mr Wilson that depended on the provision of intelligence by a foreign intelligence service, such as the United States of America, independently verified and corroborated by ASIO.

       <p class="italic">
        (6) Has Mr Wilson ever been, or is he currently, the subject of an ASIO investigation.

        (8) What other Australian agencies are, or have been, involved in investigating and/or the interference with Mr Wilson since 1996, as outlined in his complaints about ASIO and IGIS.

         The Prime Minister is advised the answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) My Department advises Mr Wilson's complaint has been examined by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security (IGIS) and that no further action is required.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) My Department has considered the allegations raised by Mr Wilson of inappropriate and inadequate oversight and review by the IGIS.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) No.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) and (5) The Office of the IGIS has advised that:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         It is not the usual practice of the Inspector-General to discuss individual complaints which have been made to her office. This practice has been adopted both to protect the privacy of individuals who make complaints and to protect the activities of the Australian intelligence community from unnecessary or unreasonable exposure.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         It is the standard practice of government and government agencies not to comment publicly on intelligence matters.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         As Mr Wilson has previously self-disclosed that he has made complaints to the Inspector-General, the Inspector-General is able in these circumstances to advise that she and one of her predecessors have previously examined Mr Wilson's claims and determined that there were insufficient grounds on which to proceed to a full inquiry. This remains the position of the current Inspector-General.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">

          ASIO

         is an agency that is administered by the Attorney-General. This question is best answered by the Attorney-General. Please see the response provided to Senate Question 1871.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (7) ASIO is an agency that is administered by the Attorney-General. This question is best answered by the Attorney-General. Please see the response provided to Senate Question 1871.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
