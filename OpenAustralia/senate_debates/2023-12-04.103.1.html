        by leave—It is my sad duty to inform the Senate that a short time ago the Prime Minister confirmed the death of our beloved colleague, the member for Dunkley, Peta Murphy. We offer our deepest sympathies to her loving husband, Rod, and all her family. We will all have the opportunity to say more about Peta in the days ahead, but, for now, I recognise this is the saddest of days for the Labor family. Peta was loved. She was respected by all of us and greatly admired by her community who she represented with passion and determination, even through all her illness.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the end of Peta's first speech, she quoted from
        <i>
         Pi
        </i>
        <i>
         p
        </i>
        <i>
         pi Longstocking
        </i>
        . Pippi's friend Annika had just told her that she couldn't beat the strongman at the show because 'he's the strongest man in the world', Murphy said. 'Man, yes, said Pippi, 'but I'm the strongest girl in the world, remember that.' Peta's strength was unmatched, and she will be greatly missed by us all. We offer our deepest sympathy to Rod and all of her family.

         by leave—On behalf of the opposition, I wish to express our deepest condolences to all of Peta Murphy's family; her husband, Rod; all of her loved ones; and her Labor family and friends, who, we appreciate, will be feeling enormous grief and sorrow at this tragic news. Peta Murphy conducted herself as an exceptional member of parliament. Particularly she showed such strength, such grace and such determination during her battle with cancer. We pay tribute to her life, as I know this chamber—and all—will do so appropriately in the coming days and weeks.
