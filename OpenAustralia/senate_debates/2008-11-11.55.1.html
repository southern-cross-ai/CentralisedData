        ) Bill 2008 is to amend the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000 to establish a national feed-in tariff (FiT) scheme. The objective of the FiT scheme is to provide reliable, long-term financial support for the commercialisation of a range of renewable energy technologies, both large and small. It is particularly intended to help those that are generally unsupported by the existing mandatory renewable energy target scheme or short term ad-hoc rebate policies such as the Solar Homes and Communities Program.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill is a revised version of my first feed-in Bill, with a number of changes resulting from lessons learnt during the Senate Environment, Communications and the Arts Committee inquiry into the earlier bill. I’ll come to those changes shortly.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        First I’d like to thank those who made submissions or attended hearings during the committee inquiry. It is quite clear, as rightly recognised in the Committee report, that there is overwhelming support for a gross national feed-in law in Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This overwhelming support is not surprising given that the renewable energy boom we are now seeing in many nations around the world is unambiguously attributable to renewable energy feed-in laws. The principal reason for this success is investor certainty - a feed-in law provides the certainty homeowners, farmers, businesses or anyone else needs in order to borrow the up-front cost of a renewable energy system, because they know that the income generated by system will meet the loan repayments.

        . Rather we believe they are compatible and complementary. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRET" rel="nofollow">
         MRET
        </a>
        should be retained because it provides a backstop, minimum level of renewable energy. The effect of MRET, however, is to support whatever renewable energy technology is currently the cheapest – in practice that mainly includes wind energy and solar hot water systems. By contrast, feed-in laws are tailored to support renewable energy that has a good prospect of becoming competitive in the future – these may include solar thermal, geothermal, solar
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PV" rel="nofollow">
         PV
        </a>
        , biomass, tidal, wave and so on. It is important to support a range of technologies for two reasons. First, it is not possible to be certain which technology will end up being most successful and second, because ultimately if we are to rely completely on renewable energy we will need at least a few technologies working together. When the sun isn’t shining we will need to be producing energy from other sources, such as wind, stored solar thermal, geothermal, biomass, wave etc.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Since the committee inquiry there have been a number of noteworthy developments. For example in October 2008, the international accounting firm, Ernst &amp; Young, released a report which concluded that Germany’s system of feed-in tariffs delivers more renewable energy at lower cost to consumers than Britain’s Renewable Obligation and its certificate trading system. This conclusion challenges the common misconception that feed-in tariffs cost consumers more than so-called “market-friendly” polices, such as tendering and certificate trading systems. Perhaps not surprisingly this was followed last week by the announcement that Britain’s Labor government will now consider a proposal for feed-in tariffs for renewable energy systems up to 3
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MW" rel="nofollow">
         MW
        </a>
        . This represents something of an ideological breakthrough because the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        , like Australia, had been a strong supporter certificate trading systems (such as the MRET). In other words, what the Greens are proposing is exactly what the

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Despite the strong support for a feed-in law expressed in the inquiry, the position of both the Government and the Opposition is to simply refer consideration to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
         COAG
        </a>
        . This is a deliberate strategy to delay action because, as the Government knows perfectly well, many of the States have recently introduced FiT legislation – albeit very poorly designed schemes - and they will be reluctant to now alter these schemes. A COAG harmonisation will be at best a recipe for a lowest common denominator scheme. At worst it will mean no action at all with years of deadlocked negotiations.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        , have a number of fatal flaws, the worst of which is the so called ‘net metering’. Net metering schemes only pay the premium tariff on the net quantity of electricity exported to the grid after accounting for in-home consumption. This contrasts with gross metering schemes, under which owners receive the premium tariff for all electricity produced by their systems (whether consumed at home or exported). The very significant advantage of gross metering systems is that owners and lenders can reliably estimate the value of the renewable energy their system will produce. This is much more difficult with ‘net metering’ systems – which explains why no scheme outside of Australia uses the net-metering approach. It also significantly increases the time needed for the investment to be paid back, reducing the incentive to invest. Net metering, frankly, is a deliberate attempt to set up a ‘Clayton’s’ scheme which looks like a feed-in tariff but does nothing.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A second major problem with most of the State schemes is that they support only solar photovoltaic energy. This is a major restriction. Most schemes around the world provide feed-in tariffs to a range of renewable energies to promote diversification and to maximise the chances of a real breakthrough in the commercialisation of one or more technologies. Again the ACT scheme is better than the other states because it offers feed-in tariffs for technologies other than just photovoltaics, namely wind and solar thermal.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A third major problem with most of the existing State schemes is that only small scale renewable energy generators are eligible to participate in the scheme. This too is a significant deviation from the successful European models. Why would we want to limit the potential of the scheme in this way? The Greens believe that both large and small scale renewable energy generators should be eligible to participate. Once again only the ACT has got this design aspect right.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        ’s attitude to renewable energy policies reflects a lack of appreciation of just how urgently, and just how rigorously, we need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Soon we will need to have a zero emissions electricity sector because achieving significant emission cuts in other sectors is more expensive. Evidence that the Government still doesn’t understand the gravity of the climate change emergency is that it clings to the outdated emission reduction target of 60% by 2050. That’s a long way behind the new targets of the UK and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA" rel="nofollow">
         USA
        </a>
        – 80% by 2050 – and even these nations are behind the science which clearly says that net zero emissions are required as soon as possible.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The federal government’s primary argument against feed-in schemes seems to be that the cost of the scheme will negatively impact low income households. Whilst there will be an impact on households, the experience from abroad indicates the impact is very slight and manageable. The key is to compensate through energy efficiency offsets such as proposed by the Greens through the retrofit of the nation’s housing stock. Even a cost impost of a couple of dollars per month on each household can raise enough revenue for a very effective scheme. Furthermore, it must be acknowledged that the MRET and the yet to be introduced emission trading scheme also inevitably impact on low income households. Compensation is necessary, but easily achievable through either the income tax and welfare systems, through the distribution of the revenue raised by the sale of permits in the emission trading scheme, or through investment in energy efficiency roll-outs to save householders money on their energy bills. The question isn’t will there be a negative impact on low income households as this can be offset. The question is, are feed-in schemes an effective way to kick-start the vital renewable energy sector? The answer is clearly yes.

        Australia could be on the cusp of a renewable energy revolution that will create tens of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in new infrastructure investment, helping to build us out of the economic downturn by building a zero-emissions, climate friendly energy network. But if we are to see this come to pass, we need to drive the changes from the federal level. A strong, national, gross feed-in tariff for all technologies legislated by the Commonwealth is the best way to do this.
