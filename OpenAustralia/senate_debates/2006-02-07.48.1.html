        On behalf of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Standing Committee
        </a>
        on Regulations and Ordinances, I give notice that 15 sitting days after today I shall move:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That the Civil Aviation Amendment Regulations 2005 (No. 3) as contained in Select Legislative Instrument 2005 No. 243 and made under the Civil Aviation Act 1988, be disallowed.
       </p>
       <p>
        I remind the Senate that these regulations amend the principal regulations to introduce new provisions concerning pilot operating procedures on and in the vicinity of non-controlled aerodromes. I seek leave to incorporate in
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        a short summary of the matters raised by the committee.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The summary read as follows—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Civil Aviation Amendment Regulations 2005 (No. 3) Select Legislative Instrument 2005 No. 243
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These Regulations amend the principal Regulations to introduce new provisions concerning pilot operating procedures on, and in the vicinity of, non-controlled aerodromes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        New paragraph 166(2)(c) requires that the pilot in command of an aircraft that is being operated in the vicinity of a non-controlled aerodrome must conform with, or avoid, the circuit pattern. New paragraph 166(2)(d) requires that when the pilot joins the circuit pattern this must be done in a certain direction. The latter requirement is subject to subregulations 166(3) and (4). The relationship between paragraphs 166(2)(c) and (d) is not clear.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Regulation 166 prescribes a number of strict liability offences. New regulation 166A also prescribes a strict liability offence, but subregulation 166A(4) provides a defence of reasonable excuse.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         The Committee
        </a>
        wrote to the Minister seeking advice on the operation of these provisions. The Minister has responded providing information on these matters. The Committee appreciates this advice which addresses most of its concerns. The Committee has decided to seek further advice on the circuit pattern provisions to allow it to finalise its consideration of these Regulations.
