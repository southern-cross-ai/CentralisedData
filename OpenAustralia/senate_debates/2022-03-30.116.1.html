         I thank Senator Askew for her ongoing interest in what is a very important issue for every single Australian. In last night's budget we made an announcement—an historic $1.3 billion of new funding—to bring new investment to women's safety initiatives. This brings our commitment to the first action plan, under the National Plan to End Violence against
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_and_Children" rel="nofollow">
          Women and Children
         </a>
         in this country, to $2.5 billion. The development of the next national plan has been the culmination of many months of consultation with advocates, victims-survivors, service providers, researchers and other experts across the whole of Australia to make sure that we had the most input and engagement we could, because we know that for the next national plan to succeed we must listen, we must engage and we must get this right. That is why the plan has been informed, importantly, by contributions by people who have lived experience of family, domestic and sexual violence. We have managed to gather that information through fora, such as the 2021 National Summit on Women's Safety, as well as surveys, targeted consultations, interviews and public comments that we sought throughout the process. The voices and experiences of victims-survivors are absolutely essential when we design the programs and when we deliver the programs because we need to ensure that our programs are designed to be delivered in a trauma-informed way.
        </p>
        <p>
         Importantly, our investment spans the entire life cycle of domestic violence. We need to deal with prevention, early intervention, response and recovery, because if we are to end gender based violence we must address all areas. The Women's Safety Package included $222.6 million towards prevention initiatives, including supporting Our Watch, and it included $328.2 million for early intervention as well as $480 million for response.

            Listening to victim-survivors and people with lived experience has actually reaffirmed what we already know, and that is that trauma stays with people unless it's addressed. We must ensure that people who are suffering trauma get access to the right supports beyond the crisis response. That's over months, years and, sometimes, lifetimes.
           </p>
           <p>
            Our historic $290 million commitment to recovery measures in yesterday's budget sets out a path to ensure that victim-survivors are supported so that they can rebuild their lives, participate in the workforce and participate in their community. We're particularly targeting and committing $48.7 million to provide targeted trauma informed mental health therapies and helping survivors navigate the healthcare system.
           </p>
           <p>
            Seeking justice must not add to the trauma, and survivors must be supported to work through their trauma sooner, guided by their own goals. That is why we're spending $87.9 million to expand the

              <p>
               Our government is absolutely committed to breaking down the barriers to women when they leave a violent relationship. Yesterday we announced an additional $240 million extension to the escaping violence payment, which provides women up to $5,000 to help them establish a life free from violence. This will support another 37,000 women who have made that incredibly brave decision to leave a violent relationship.
              </p>
              <p>
               We have also committed an additional $100 million to build emergency accommodation, because we know that the most important thing on the day that you make that brave decision is to have a safe place to go—a roof over your head where you can start to rebuild your life and get back on your feet. We're also providing $54.6 million to support women and children staying in their own homes, when it's safe to do so, through planning, personal safety et cetera. This helps women and children to remain in their communities and schools without disruption, and it ensures that perpetrators are punished and not the victims.
