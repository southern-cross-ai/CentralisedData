          Reg Swartz
         </a>
         was born on 14 April 1911 in Brisbane, Queensland. He was educated at Toowoomba Grammar. At the age of 17, he joined the Citizens Military Forces and later enlisted in the 2nd

         . He served with the 2/26 Infantry Battalion 8th Division in the Malayan campaign. After being captured by the Japanese, he was a prisoner of war for 3½ years, spending time in Changi and a period working on the Burma-Thailand railway. He returned to Australia in 1945. He re-enlisted in the

         and he was made an honorary colonel of the Australian Army Aviation Corps in 1969.
        </p>
        <p>
         Before entering parliament Sir Reginald had worked as an oil company executive. He was elected to federal parliament as the member for Darling Downs in 1949. He was the first member of the Liberal Party to hold that seat, winning it comfortably in the election which saw the coalition returned to office under

          Sir Robert Menzies
         </a>
         . He held the seat for 23 years and served as a minister in a number of portfolios in the Menzies, Holt,

        </p>
        <p>
         During his time in parliament he also led or participated in a number of overseas delegations and missions, including to India in 1957, the United Kingdom in 1965, South-East Asia in 1968 and

         in 1971. Curly Swartz—which I gather was an acknowledgment of his baldness—was Leader of the House in his last two years in parliament. He was described by a journalist as the government’s ‘most unflappable character and its best diffuser of contentious issues’. Prime Minister McMahon described him as a master of tactics.

         He was among 200 Australian former prisoners of war who accompanied Prime Minister Howard to Thailand in 1998 when he opened the Hellfire Pass Memorial Museum. The museum is a memorial to the 2,700 Australians who died building the Burma-Thailand railway in World War

         </p>
         <p>
          As Senator Minchin said, Sir Reginald entered the House of Representatives in 1949 as the Liberal member for
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darling_Downs" rel="nofollow">
           Darling Downs

          , a seat he held for 23 years before retiring in 1972. He was re-elected to the seat on eight occasions, on two of which he was elected unopposed. Prior to entering parliament he had worked in the oil industry. Sir Reginald had quite a remarkable and lengthy ministerial career spanning the Menzies, Holt,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McEwen" rel="nofollow">
           McEwen

          and Gorton governments. In researching his career, it struck me that he had quite a remarkable career. Unfortunately, he is not a name known well to my generation. I guess he retired at about the time my political consciousness was developing. He obviously had a very senior and full career and led a very interesting life.
         </p>
         <p>
          He was appointed Parliamentary Undersecretary for Commerce and Agriculture in 1952. He then served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade, Minister for Repatriation, Minister for Health, Minister for

          , Minister for Civil Aviation, Minister Assisting the Treasurer and Minister for National Development. There was not much he did not do. He was also Leader of the House of Representatives in 1971 and 1972. Clearly, he had a very distinguished and remarkable career. Before that time, he managed to fit in very good service for the

           Australian Imperial Force

          , and was unfortunately a prisoner of war for 3½ years. He was discharged from the military in 1946, re-enlisted in the Citizens Military Forces in 1947 and rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel.
         </p>
         <p>
          After retiring from parliament, he continued his career in business. He was chairman of the trustees of the Australian Army Aviation Corps. For his military service, he was made a Member of the Military Division of the Order of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire" rel="nofollow">

          in 1950. He was knighted in 1972.
         </p>
         <p>
          In 1936 he married Hilda Robinson, who unfortunately passed away in 1995. He is survived by his wife of his second marriage, Lady Muriel Swartz, his three children and their families. Sir Reginald, who lived in Buderim in Queensland, passed away on 2 February aged 94. On behalf of the Labor opposition, I extend our sincere condolences to Lady Swartz and all of Sir Reginald’s family and friends. He truly lived a full and active life and made an enormous contribution to Australian politics and government.
