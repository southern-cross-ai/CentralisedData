        , Senator Farrell. The Albanese government recognises that many people in Australia are facing cost-of-living pressures right now. Can the minister please outline how the passage of the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Strengthening the Safety Net) Bill in the Senate yesterday is helping to deliver on the Albanese government's $14.6 billion cost-of-living package to give some relief to Australians on some of the lowest incomes?

           Not one—delivering on our positive agenda to improve the lives of all Australians. We know cost-of-living pressures are having an impact on family budgets right across the country. That's why, in the 2023-24 budget, we committed $14.6 billion of targeted cost-of-living relief.
          </p>
          <p>
           I'll repeat that figure for you, Senator Ciccone: $14.6 billion. Of this package, $9.5 billion was designed to provide additional support for Australians who are living on the lowest incomes.
          </p>
          <p>
           Yesterday, the government's
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
            Social Services
           </a>
           and Other Legislation Amendment (Strengthening the Safety Net) Bill passed the parliament. The bill delivers more support for those relying on student and working age payments, for many single parents, for older Australians facing additional barriers to work and for many who receive support from Commonwealth rent assistance. These are responsible changes to target support to those doing it the toughest, without adding to inflation.
          </p>
          <p>
           With the successful passage of the bill, the rates of JobSeeker, youth allowance and eligible working age and student payments will rise by $40 a fortnight from 20 September. This increase will be combined with the indexation for those payments, which will be applied on the same day. This means a single jobseeker with no dependents will actually receive an increase of $56 a fortnight. This package of measures will make—

             An important part of the package is the increase in social services payments to some of the most vulnerable in our community.

              I once again thank Senator Payman for her insightful question. The bill that passed the Senate yesterday expands eligibility for the higher rate of JobSeeker to include single recipients aged over 55 years who've been on income support for nine or more months. This is because we know older Australians face a number of additional barriers when they are looking for work. We're also increasing support for single parents by extending eligibility for the parenting payment, the single one, to parents with their youngest child aged under 14. I know it can be tough for single parents, who are overwhelmingly women, to balance caring responsibilities and full-time work, studying or looking for work. As a result of these Albanese government changes and the great work of the minister in this area, Minister Rishworth, more than 57,000 single parents will be better off.

                 You've nailed it there, Senator Payman, and the reaction of those opposite gives us the clue that it's because the government is providing additional support to recipients of Commonwealth rent assistance with the largest increase in over 30 years. Maximum rates are increasing by 15 per cent plus indexation. This is one way that the Albanese government is addressing housing pressures after a decade of neglect under the former Liberal and National government. It is part of our comprehensive package of housing measures, which sees us working with housing ministers right across the country, in contrast to the former government, of course. I call on everyone in this place to work with the government in a constructive manner to support our housing agenda.
