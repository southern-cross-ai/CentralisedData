        I would like to begin by reflecting on Senator Macdonald's comments this afternoon. Those people who know Senator Macdonald who are listening on the broadcast will know that he's an enthusiastic, energetic senator for Queensland. But he was only half right when he reflected on how great
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         Far North Queensland
        </a>
        is, because the other half of that statement is, of course, how great the far north-west of northern Australia—that place we know as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberley_region" rel="nofollow">
         Kimberley region
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        During the recess, I had an opportunity to catch up with Elsa Archer and others—Senator Rachel Siewert was there and the new regional development minister,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alannah_MacTiernan" rel="nofollow">
         Alannah MacTiernan
        </a>
        , was also there—at the Kimberley Regional Forum, where, with local shires, we discussed a variety of issues that are important to continuing jobs growth and continuing economic development opportunities for the very large and remote numbers of Indigenous communities. I had the opportunity to talk about native title reform and how I think native title reform is necessary if we are going to lift and change that terrible scourge that is Indigenous disadvantage by giving Indigenous people better access to how they might utilise their lands for better resource extraction and for better pastoral lease operations.
       </p>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kimberley" rel="nofollow">
         The Kimberley
        </a>
        is a remarkable place. I know that people say that but, when you visit there—and I know that you, Mr Acting Deputy President Sterle, are a regular visitor to the Kimberley region—you can't but be impressed by its natural beauty—that's a given. But what is happening up there in terms of the pursuit of innovative agricultural techniques is really remarkable. I am not so worried about who brings good ideas to the people of the Kimberley, but you have to agree that the water-for-food initiative, which was a Colin Barnett Royalties for Regions Mia Davies initiative, has really transformed key parts of the Kimberley and it is a very, very exciting part of the world.

        just also extend my very, very personal thanks to Elsa Archer. People who know her know she is a stalwart of the Derby community and a stalwart of the Kimberley community, and I have been very heartened by the messages of encouragement I have received from Elsa Archer over the last few days, and of course people across the Kimberley.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would just like to talk this afternoon about a great deed. I am an active member of a variety of community groups across
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        , but one of the proudest groups that I am involved in is the Perth
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Rotary Club
        </a>
        . The Perth Rotary Club, with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvation_Army" rel="nofollow">
         Salvation Army
        </a>
        in Western Australia, under the fantastic leadership of Rebecca Tolstoy has had for the second year what they call the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_of_Hope" rel="nofollow">
         Path of Hope
        </a>
        Foundation Annual Gala Ball. It raises hundreds of thousands of dollars to beat domestic violence. It raises that money to support the great work that the Salvation Army does at the women's hostel in Perth's inner northern suburbs. It's not appropriate for me to identify its location, but they do some fantastic work.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Path" rel="nofollow">
         The Path
        </a>
        of Hope Foundation has worked tirelessly since its establishment in 2012 to break the cycle of family and domestic violence. The foundation's ethos is reflected in its name: to create positive pathways for women affected by violence.
       </p>
       <p>
        The great state of Western Australia is where I call home and I am privileged to call myself a very proud
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australian
        </a>
        , but it shocked me to learn that last year in 2015-16
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WA_Police" rel="nofollow">
         WA Police
        </a>
        received more than 50,000 calls for help from people reporting cases of family or domestic violence. If you break it down, that is approximately 158 calls a day, and it is very alarming when those statistics are shared with us. What do those statistics actually mean, though? They mean one in three women have experienced physical and/or sexual violence perpetrated by someone who is known to them. It means that domestic and family violence is the principle cause of homelessness for women and their children. It means that Indigenous women and girls are 35 times more likely than the wider female population to be hospitalised due to family violence.
       </p>
       <p>
        The gala ball brought together a diverse crowd. There were almost 600 people there. From the private sector, from governments, from rotary clubs to entertainers and entrepreneurs—it was a fantastic night. We were all there, though, for one cause. Many people had a great night. I was privileged to sit next to the Western Australian governor,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Excellency" rel="nofollow">
         Her Excellency
        </a>
        the Hon. Kerry Sanderson, who is a great Western Australian and a great ambassador for Western Australia. But, more than that, people were united in their single mission, the pursuit of one cause, and that was to celebrate the women and children who have survived family and domestic violence. Rebecca Tolstoy, the Path of Hope Foundation director spoke powerfully and eloquently about why we were there. She said: 'Tonight is all about one very special group of people—people who have chosen life, chosen a better future for themselves and their children and who are breaking that cycle of violence hour by hour, day by day, week by week. Their courage is to be commended and tonight is their night. Their actions and their bravery is a beacon of hope to others wanting to break the cycle and to choose a life free of violence.'
       </p>
       <p>
        The ball was a strong and powerful demonstration that the community was more determined than ever to break that terrible cycle that we know as family and domestic violence. During the course of the evening we all reflected on the need to provide safe and secure environments for women and their children who find themselves affected by domestic violence and family violence.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am pleased to share that the government announced a $100 million package last year to help prevent violence against women. But we were reminded at the ball that we all have a role to play in raising awareness about this scourge across our community. It is our responsibility to educate and empower the community to take action. It is interesting that as I have become more aware of this issue, I have become alarmed at the depth to which it permeates our community, and how important it is not to have government addressing this problem but to have community partnerships addressing this problem. What is particularly unique about the Path of Hope Foundation is that it is not just a ball once a year—this year's ball was the second year it has been held; it is actually a foundation that works on the ground to support women and their children from domestic violence. It works in refurbishing homes for people, refurbishing the women's hostel and providing education access for young children who are traumatised because they're no longer able to live in their normal or most reliable family environments. It supports these young children when they go to the local primary school. It supports these young children by building a playground in the hostel.
       </p>
       <p>
        Let me share with you the entirety of Rebecca Tolstoy's speech to the gathering two Saturday nights ago, 29 July. Rebecca said: 'We all know how wonderful it is to live in Western Australia and to be known as a west Australian. As someone who has chosen WA as my home, I love the can-do spirit. I love its warm, generous and friendly people and the willingness of Western Australians to rally behind people when they choose to have a go.'
       </p>
       <p>
        She went on to say: 'Let me begin by welcoming all of you who are enjoying the Path of Hope Gala Ball for a second time and marvelling at how this simple but important gesture is going from strength to strength. One person who captures the spirit of Western Australia is, for a second time, tonight's major sponsor.' I think it is important to recognise the contribution of a very, very committed Western Australian, a name that is well known to us; a successful Western Australian businessperson, but someone who does supports many, many charities throughout the community—that is, of course Mrs Rinehart, who, through
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hancock_Prospecting" rel="nofollow">
         Hancock Prospecting
        </a>
        and the Roy Hill project, generously provided support for the evening's event.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rebecca went on to say, 'We are truly blessed by the continuing support of other long-term financial donors to the gala ball: Mr Stan Perron, Mr David Reid, Mr Alan Tribe and Mr Richard Lockwood.' Rebecca said: 'Since our last gala ball, Path of Hope has travelled the world with its gesture of hope and empowerment, and has been greeted with open arms and encouragement. From Perth, Western Australia; to Atlanta, Georgia; to the meeting rooms of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations
        </a>
        in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" rel="nofollow">
         New York
        </a>
        ; to Stockholm, Sweden; and the halls of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_in_Geneva" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations in Geneva
        </a>
        , the world has recognised what we in Perth have known for a long time. We have taken the rich heritage of the trusted and complemented it with the innovation of a 21st-century approach. Our trusted local partnership between Perth Rotary and the Salvation Army is not only empowering the victims and survivors of domestic violence in our community, but is on the cusp of being a vehicle for liberating the lives of women and children around the world.'
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a very important point, because the Path of Hope Foundation is like none other I have seen. It is not just a very, very good Western Australian idea; this idea is now one that has captured the imagination of the United Nations and captured the imagination of friends and supporters in Sweden in Geneva. This is a truly remarkable local initiative born in Western Australia—
