           I understand, Senator Brown, that you will seek leave to move an amendment and that will be followed by Senator Macdonald seeking leave to move an amendment to your amendment. Upon leave being granted in both instances, I will put Senator Macdonald’s amendment to your amendment, then I will put your amendment, as amended—if it is amended. If it is not amended, I will then put your amendment as it stands and then I will put the motion, as amended, to the chamber.

             No, Senator Brown, you need to seek leave to move an amendment to the motion once it is formal. Is there any objection to the motion being taken as formal? There is no objection.

                , I raise a point of order on clarification. There is no problem with leave being granted but I would just like to ask whether Senator Bob Brown’s motion is correct. First of all, there is no such entity as the Queensland National Liberal Party, so I am not quite sure what his amendment refers to.

               </p>
               <p>
                Well? The second question is this: does Senator Brown really mean that he moves an amendment to my original motion by ‘adding the words that’ or is he proposing that his amendment replace the original motion? That will affect how we vote on it. I assume he means that his amendment should have been ‘that the following words be added’ to the motion and then saying what he is saying.

                 On the first question that you raise, that is not something that I need to rule on from the chair. On the second matter, it is a matter for Senator Bob Brown as to how that is intended. Again, I can only seek clarification from Senator Brown as to what his intention is.

                  I intend to move the amendment as a consequence of Senator Macdonald’s motion by adding the words. It dovetails very nicely. I move:
