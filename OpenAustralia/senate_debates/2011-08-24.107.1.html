        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Trade, Senator Conroy. On 1 February 2011 the Australian and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        delegations to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTO" rel="nofollow">
         WTO
        </a>
        jointly advised the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organisation" rel="nofollow">
         World Trade Organisation
        </a>
        that Australia would be in a position to issue new permits for the importation of apples from New Zealand on 17 August 2011. This announcement was well prior to the completion of the import risk analysis Australia was required to undertake. In fact it was before the Biosecurity Services Group had conducted the visit to New Zealand upon which
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosecurity_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Biosecurity Australia
        </a>
        had purported to base its recent risk analysis. So on what basis was this agreement made and this date chosen given the import risk analysis had not been completed in February? Why shouldn't Australian apple growers and pear growers conclude that from no later than 1 February the outcome of the risk analysis had been fixed so that New Zealand apples were coming to Australia?

         I thank Senator Xenophon for his question. Under
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTO" rel="nofollow">
          WTO
         </a>
         rules Australia had an obligation to implement the outcomes of the apples dispute either immediately or within a reasonable period of time. The Australian government decided to implement the outcomes by a scientific review of the existing 2006 import risk analysis. The reasonable period of time can be set either by agreement between the parties or by an independent arbiter. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
          New Zealand
         </a>
         and Australian authorities negotiated a period of eight months to complete this review, putting Australia in a position to issue import permits by 17 August 2011. If it had been left to an arbiter it is likely that Australia would have been given less time to implement the findings.

           WTO

           No. It is likely that if we had not negotiated that period with

            New Zealand
           </a>

             The government does not agree with this statement. There is nothing in the treaty that prevents

             . The WTO would not consider the provisions of the treaty in determining whether New Zealand could retaliate. It would only look at the parties' rights under the WTO agreement.
