         I thank Senator Burston for his question. The global agreement that you refer to is actually the responsibility of the minister for the environment, but I'm happy to assist, inasmuch as I'm ableâ€”through you,

         In terms of what our government is doing on the ground, we're supporting the communities, including Williamtown, Oakey and Katherine, by providing: an epidemiological study that will help us better understand the human health implications of exposure to

         ; a voluntary blood-testing program for residents living in the investigation areas around the Williamtown, Oakey and Tindal bases; dedicated mental health and counselling services to assist communities affected by PFAS contamination, including an online telephone counselling service; and a communication strategy focusing on the human health related aspects of PFAS.

This includes a voluntary blood testing program component, available for a 13-month period from 17 March 2018 until 30 April 2019. The Australian government has also extended the voluntary blood testing program in Williamtown,

            Again recognising that this is outside my ministerial responsibilities or those of the Minister for Health: the government understands that some communities potentially affected by
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PFAS" rel="nofollow">
             PFAS
            </a>
            contamination are concerned about how this may affect them. Their wellbeing is the government's absolute focus, and we'll work closely with them to provide advice and assistance as quickly as possible.
           </p>
           <p>
            As a government, we rely on advice from independent, scientific research authorities such as enHealth. The current research indicates that there is currently no consistent evidence that exposure to PFAS causes adverse human health effects. However, because these chemicals persist in humans and the environment, it is recommended that human exposure is minimised as a precaution. We will continue to be guided by the expert scientific advice and the literature from international and Australian-based researchers.

              I'd be concerned, Minister, about the 50 who have contracted cancer in a five-kilometre stretch along Cabbage Tree Road. Ask their opinion of that answer. Will the government listen to the advice of the

               Senator Burston, as I said previously, the Australian government takes the advice of enHealth as the independent scientific advisory body. In terms of research into
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PFAS" rel="nofollow">
                PFAS
               </a>
               , the government has committed to funding $12.5 million for a national research program into the human health effects of prolonged exposure to PFAS, to be administered as a targeted call for research by the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health" rel="nofollow">
                National Health
