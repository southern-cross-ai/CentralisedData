        by leave—I move opposition amendments (1) and (2) on sheet 6077:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1)    Schedule 1, item 32, page 9 (after line 33), after section 37ZM, insert:
       </p>
       <p>
        37ZMA  Consultation
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Before formulating the Clothing and Household Textile (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIC" rel="nofollow">
         BIC
        </a>
        ) scheme, the Minister must consult with industry about the products that are to be taken, under the scheme, to be eligible clothing and household textile products.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2)    Schedule 1, item 32, page 10 (after line 20), after section 37ZQ, insert:
       </p>
       <p>
        37ZQA  Commitment to Australian operations
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is a policy objective for the Clothing and Household Textile (BIC) scheme that entities that wish to obtain innovation grants under the scheme must be required to demonstrate a commitment to Australian-based manufacturing or Australian-based design for manufacture in Australia activities.
       </p>
       <p>
        37ZQB  Household textile products—manufacture using in-house fabrics
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is a policy objective for the Clothing and Household Textile (BIC) scheme that, for an activity of an entity that consists of the manufacture of household textile products to be taken to be an eligible clothing and household textile activity, such activity must result directly and predominantly in the manufacture of such products using fabric manufactured by the entity (in addition to complying with any other applicable requirements of scheme).
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to note very quickly, while moving those amendments, the importance of this scheme. I recognise the comments of Senator Stephens and I note particularly that in my home town of Devonport there are two major employers involved in the scheme who have heavily invested through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIP" rel="nofollow">
         SIP
        </a>
        program. I know the difference that it has made and I recognise the importance of following on with this piece of legislation and the innovations that it can bring.

         The government accepts these amendments. I, therefore, have little more to say other than that non-controversial legislation can actually move through this place with great haste.
