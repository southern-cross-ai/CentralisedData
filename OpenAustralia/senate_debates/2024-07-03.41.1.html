        I am absolutely disgusted, as an Australian citizen born here, to see the desecration of our national anthem, young kids being forced to touch the ground while reciting racist slogans like 'always was, always will be Aboriginal land', racist rapper songs being played to young kids calling for the murder of people because they're white, bureaucrats forcing racist views on infants and toddlers in the guise of reconciliation, and bewildered parents being confronted with indoctrination they never gave permission for and do not support. Welcome to the Australian public primary school in 2024.
       </p>
       <p>
        When my grandson told me he was being forced to touch the ground while reciting the divisive acknowledgment of country, I told him, 'You don't have to do it; this is your land as well,' and now he doesn't. I encourage all Australian families to do the same. They're your kids—not child soldiers press-ganged as cannon fodder in racist culture wars.
       </p>
       <p>
        These racist activists—teachers and lecturers—know what they're doing. They're getting inside kids' heads as early as possible to program them. It has to stop. But, with public education now thoroughly infiltrated by racist activists, it's up to Australian families to take a stand for their children. Schools are for education, not indoctrination. Any teacher that tries to indoctrinate children should be sacked and never allowed to teach in Australia again.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australian education outcomes have been declining for decades, and now we know why. At the referendum last year, more than 60 per cent of Australians rejected the racial division of the Voice. The activists are now coming for our kids so they can try again with the new generation they've brainwashed. We must not allow future generations to be indoctrinated with racist divisions. Every Australian citizen born here or overseas has as much right to this land as anyone else.
