        My question is to the Minister for Defence, Senator Reynolds. On Monday, the minister said that, in her meeting with Ms Higgins on 1 April 2019, she was 'not aware of the details or the circumstances of the alleged incident in my office'. When did the minister become aware, and who told her?

         I thank the senator for the question. As I indicated in my previous response, it's my understanding that Brittany has indicated she intends to pursue her complaint with the

             As part of this process, the Prime Minister’s office provided support to Minister Reynolds and her office in assessing a breach of the Statement of Standards for Ministerial Staff by the other staff member involved in the incident.

                  My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Birmingham. The Prime Minister has said that he was not aware of the allegations made by Brittany Higgins until Monday and that his office didn't know until Friday last week, despite the involvement of two ministers and current senior staff in his office. Former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull says he finds it very, very, very hard to believe that the
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PM" rel="nofollow">
                   PM
                  </a>
                  's office was not aware. Yesterday, the Prime Minister also said that he wanted to listen to Brittany, but then he questioned her report that she'd been contacted by his 'fixer', Yaron Finkelstein. Do you agree with the former Prime Minister that it strains credulity that Mr Morrison's office did not know about the alleged rape? And do you support the Prime Minister's suggestion that Brittany was confused and wrong about contacts from Mr Finkelstein?

                  <p>
                   In relation to advice provided to the Prime Minister's office, it's important to appreciate what Senator Reynolds has indicated previously—the respect for Brittany's choices and confidentiality. The primary concern is for Brittany and her welfare. It's out of concern for Brittany and to empower her decision-making that Minister Reynolds facilitated discussions between Brittany and police in early 2019. I note that the parliamentary department provided access to police with
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCTV" rel="nofollow">
                    CCTV
                   </a>
                   footage at that time and have preserved such footage to facilitate any future access. It's clear, obviously from what has been said publicly, that Brittany believes the support ultimately was inadequate, for which Minister Reynolds has unreservedly apologised. Concern for Brittany's wellbeing remains paramount, including her right to preserve her choices around whatever actions or steps that she takes. But the government will certainly continue to cooperate with any investigations undertaken.

                       The Prime Minister's made clear his view that he believes he ought to have been notified earlier. But, of course, as always, how such notifications are handled in the future will be a factor of consideration of the reviews that are underway, noting the fact that the privacy and confidentiality wishes of individuals also need to be respected when such issues arise.

                         The bungled response to incidents around Brittany Higgins's assault has involved senior staff in the Prime Minister's office, two ministers, security guards, the presiding officers and the Department of Parliamentary Services. The government's fingerprints are all over this, and it's simply impossible to imagine that an in-house investigation will be adequate to get to the bottom of this. When will the government commit to an independent investigation into the response to Brittany Higgins's rape allegations?
