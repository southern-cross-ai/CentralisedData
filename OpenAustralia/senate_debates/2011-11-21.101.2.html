        , let us add to that enjoyment. My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Sherry. Can the minister explain why the government has failed to respond to the Senate order to produce costings over the forward estimates of the measures associated with the mining tax? Given that the Senate deadline expired two weeks ago, what has the government got to hide?

         I am not sure whether the question should go to me or to my colleague Senator Wong. Nevertheless, the government looks forward to questions on the mining tax. We have already had two questions, albeit from our side of the chamber, on the mining tax. I am attempting to recollect, and you may correct me in the supplementary, but I understand the question without notice went to costings. I think that is what it went to and I am very happy to talk about the revenue that will be raised by the mining tax and the way in which it will be spent. I am more than happy because the last time I was given figures approximately $11 billion was the amount to be raised by the mining tax. The Labor Party is very proud of this measure because it is to build a stronger and broader Australian economy—

           I am not going to go to what was not the question. I am not going to repeat the earlier contribution that Senator Wong and I made in terms of the tax cuts, for example to small business, and the tax cuts to superannuation. I am not going to go to those issues. I do not want to be repetitive. I do want to stay on what I believe and what I recollect is the issue—that is, the $11 billion.

           is going to give the $11 billion back to the mining companies who actually want to pay the tax. I find that quite extraordinary. Not only do they want to give the $11 billion back to the mining companies that want to pay the tax in the first place, but they have committed themselves to one of the major expenditure items: the increase in the superannuation guarantee.

            , I ask a supplementary question. Given that the minister failed to clarify the costing over the forward estimates, can the minister confirm that by 2013-14 the cost of the measures associated with the mining tax will exceed by several billion dollars any revenue that the tax will raise? What is the dollar amount of the shortfall?

                   The thrust of your question is: why are we spending money on a range of programs from the revenue we project to raise from the mining resource rent tax? Well, why did you sign up to the superannuation guarantee increase? Why did the Liberal-National Party sign up to the superannuation guarantee increase, which is paid for by revenue from the mining resource rent tax? Why did you sign up to this measure yourselves if you do not believe the forward estimates in the long term from the mining tax revenue?

                    Order! Senators Wong and Cormann, I am trying to listen to Senator Sherry's answer and you are having a debate across the chamber. There is a time for debating this issue after question time if you wish. I need to listen to Senator Sherry.

                     is in this amazing position. They have signed up to a major expenditure measure that is being funded by the mining tax and at the same time they are saying they are going to scrap the mining tax. You are in a far worse position, if there is a position to be in. You are agreeing with a major expenditure item but you are going to reverse the tax that pays for it. How stupid can you get?
