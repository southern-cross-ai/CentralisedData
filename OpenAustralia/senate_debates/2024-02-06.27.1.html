        The Albanese government is delivering better and fairer tax cuts for all Australians. It's a plan to address the cost of living and is putting people before politics. Every taxpayer across the country will receive a tax cut and, under Labor's plan, 11.5 million people will receive a bigger tax cut than was proposed by Mr Scott Morrison some five years ago. A nurse in my home state of Tasmania on $76,000 will get a tax cut of $1,579, which is more than double what they would have received under those opposite. This is a tax cut which is better for middle Australia, better for working Australians, better for women, better for nurses, truckies and teachers, and better for the economy overall. It's a fairer, more responsible way to ensure more people get more help when they need it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ms Ley said that, if the coalition wins the next election, it will wind back these tax cuts. We know what that means. That means that there are going to be higher taxes for 11.5 million hardworking Australians. Those opposite only ever know how to say no. Say no to the 97 per cent of nurses who will get a bigger tax cut. Go back to your home states and tell the nurses that that's what you support. They're saying no to the 98 per cent of teachers who will get a bigger tax cut.
       </p>
       <p>
        If Mr Dutton and the coalition really cared about the cost of living, they would back this plan, because it's better for the economy, it's better for Australians, it's a better tax cut and it's based on the economic times of today. That's the most important thing: giving Australian workers help when the cost of living is a burden on most Australians. This is good, as I said, for women. It's good for tradies. It's good for teachers. It's good for our emergency service personnel. It's good for the Australian economy.
