           The government opposes this inquiry because the government has taken and continues to take strong action to improve consumer outcomes in the financial services sector by: commissioning the Financial System Inquiry and implementing its recommendations; developing legislation to address misaligned incentive structures and to lift professional standards of financial advisers; strengthening the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Securities_and_Investments_Commission" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Securities and Investments Commission
           </a>
           with a $120 million funding package; and commissioning a review of the external dispute resolution schemes in the financial sector, to deliver a one-stop shop and a review of small business lending practices. The government notes that on 14 September 2016 the Senate referred an inquiry into the life insurance industry to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services for report by mid-2017.

              Since I have been here, in four years I have been involved in nearly six inquiries into matters related to what we have before us in the motion today. That has been very useful. A lot of good people have spent a lot of time looking at the problems, misconduct and bad behaviour in the banking industry and looking at financial regulations. The conclusion that many of us have drawn after spending time in these committees is that we need to go the next step—that the Senate has done everything it can to help these people, especially the victims of financial crime—and that we need a parliamentary commission of inquiry or a royal commission into banks which could compel witnesses and have strong investigative powers. While we support this motion today, we really have to get on with looking after victims and getting some justice for them.
