        met with the minister, who said that she expected to approve negotiations within the next couple of weeks but was also speaking to then Qantas CEO

         Alan Joyce
        </a>
        who was 'not happy'. Then there were six months with no feedback to the department until the minister decided to ignore departmental advice and reject the Qatar application in July. Minister, what role did pressure from Mr Alan Joyce play in the ministerial rejection of her department's advice?

        <p>
         Thank you, Senator Chandler. The minister has repeatedly made clear throughout this entire debate that her actions were only ever based on one factor, and that was the national interest of Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         Throughout this debate, the opposition has repeatedly asserted that Mr
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Joyce" rel="nofollow">
          Alan Joyce
         </a>
         —as opposed to Mr Barnaby Joyce; another Joyce with an interest in aviation—has exerted some sort of influence over this decision. But I also note that the opposition has never been able to provide one skerrick of evidence to back up that assertion. I saw through the referendum campaign that, at one point, Mr Dutton was claiming that Mr Joyce had influenced the Prime Minister's decision about the Voice—again, no evidence; just going around making assertions.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would invite the opposition to provide just one skerrick of evidence to back up the assertions that it has been making now for weeks. I think it is quite telling that in a debate that has been going on for probably the best part of three months, the opposition has not been able to provide any evidence to back up that assertion.

             It's nice to hear from the

              Leader of the Opposition in the Senate
             </a>
             for a change. We don't really hear a lot from him these days. As I say, the opposition has never been able to provide a skerrick of evidence to back up the assertion that it makes. It has been engaged in a campaign of smear against Minister King for the best part of three months without any evidence to back up its claims.
            </p>
            <p>
             I stand behind what Minister King has said, which is that the government's actions were at all times based on our decision as to the national interest, just as previous decisions made by former coalition transport ministers, such as
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_McCormack" rel="nofollow">
              Michael McCormack
             </a>
             , to stop Qatar from having extra flights. I don't remember the opposition having any concerns about that; it is only when it's a Labor decision.

                   Senator Birmingham, I will certainly take advice, but I don't think that fits the gamut of points of order. As I said, that is a debating point, which of course senators are free to explore during the debate to take note of answers.

                    As I say, this entire campaign has been based on a complete lack of evidence. The minister has already said publicly that she speaks to the

                    s of major airlines regularly and that she knew exactly what their opinions were on the Qatar decision. She has said that she spoke to the Qantas CEO, just as she spoke to the Virgin CEO, and that she certainly knew their positions before those consultations. I'm afraid that you don't get to make a case by simply asking questions that don't have a factual basis in this desperate search for evidence to back up the assertions that you've been making for the last three months.
