        Introduction
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 19 February 2008, the Minister for Home Affairs, the Hon Bob Debus MP, requested the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories (‘the Joint Standing Committee’) to inquire into and report on the role of the National Capital Authority (‘the Authority’).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The terms of reference for the inquiry required the Joint Standing Committee to review the:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         administration of the National Capital Plan (‘the Plan’);
        </li>
        <li>
         Authority’s governance arrangements;
        </li>
        <li>
         level of oversight required to achieve the highest standards in design in the

         planning authorities; and
        </li>
        <li>
         promotion of the national capital.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        The Joint Standing Committee identified three key objectives for its inquiry:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         to ensure that the Commonwealth protect and promote the unique design of Canberra because it represents the intrinsic character of the national capital;
        </li>
        <li>
         where possible, align land administration with planning jurisdiction; and
        </li>
        <li>
         foster greater co-operation and collaboration between the Commonwealth and the ACT Governments on planning and related matters.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        On 16 July 2008, the Joint Standing Committee tabled its report

         The Government
        </a>
        will take the opportunity of this latest Joint Standing Committee report to consider how best to meet the Commonwealth’s obligation to the national capital. Issues considered in the process may be outside the scope of the Joint Standing Committee’s specific recommendations, but will address the issues raised.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government acknowledges the important work of the Joint Standing Committee and wishes to maintain the momentum created by the inquiry and Report. However, the Government will not immediately commit to all the current recommendations because it might need to implement the recommendations differently after a review of planning and land management responsibilities (discussed in the Government’s response to Recommendation 14).

        establishes the Plan, which ensures that Canberra and the Territory ‘are planned and developed in accordance with their national significance’. The Act also establishes the Territory Plan, which ensures, in a manner not inconsistent with the Plan, that the ACT is planned and developed to provide the people of the Territory with an attractive, safe and efficient environment in which to live and work and have their recreation.

        The process for developing and amending the Plan is set out in sections 14 to 23 of the Act. In performing this function, the Authority has the independence to propose amendments to the Plan, which the Minister may approve.

         Summary of the Report
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Joint Standing Committee proposed that the governance arrangements of the Authority should allow more independence to the Authority, commensurate with its status as a statutory authority. The Joint Standing Committee also recommended the development of a single integrated planning document for the ACT, comprising the National Capital Plan and the Territory Plan. The plan would be integrated through agreed definitions and clear geographic boundaries.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Chapters 1-3 of the Joint Standing Committee’s report provide a summary of the Joint Standing Committee’s role, previous reviews undertaken of the Authority and the role of the Authority. Recommendations are contained in Chapter 2 and Chapters 4-11.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Joint Standing Committee’s report contains 22 recommendations. The Government accepts 13 of those recommendations in full, in part or in principle.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government does not accept four recommendations that primarily relate to delegating planning powers to the ACT, the functions of the proposed National Capital Consultative Council and providing funding for a three dimensional digital plan.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government notes that the proposed Council is similar in form to the Minister for Home Affairs’
        <i>
         Minister’s Canberra Consultative Forum
        </i>
        . This forum enables ACT region representatives to express their views to the Minister for Home Affairs and the ACT Chief Minister. The Government considers that any changes to the Forum and the establishment of a new council should only have a consultative function, rather than any specific decision-making or recommendatory functions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government has noted five recommendations relating to: the position of Commonwealth Architect; airport planning; the preparation of a joint sustainable transport plan; resourcing for the Authority; and an independent review mechanism for certain decisions of the Authority.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government considers that the creation of the position of Commonwealth Architect may duplicate the role or the services currently available to the Authority.

        The Government agrees in principle to amending the Act to provide for the Authority comprising a minimum of five and a maximum of seven members.

        The Government does not agree that the Chief Executive should not be a member of the Authority. The Chief Executive will continue to remain on the Authority board, while being responsible for staff of the Authority as an Agency Head for the purposes of the

       <p class="italic">
        The Government, including the Authority and the responsible Minister, has the power to obtain any advice it requires in the performance of its functions. This includes obtaining architectural services. Section 44 of the Act allows the Minister, upon recommendation of the Authority, to appoint a committee to give advice to the Authority or to assist in the performance of its functions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government expects that the Authority will continue to seek advice of highly skilled and experienced architects when required. The Government will also retain the ability to obtain architectural advice on its building and/or land management projects through normal departmental procurement mechanisms.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government is also concerned that the creation of the position of Commonwealth Architect may only serve to duplicate and complicate the role of the Authority in the exercise of its statutory functions relating to planning and development of areas of land in the ACT.
