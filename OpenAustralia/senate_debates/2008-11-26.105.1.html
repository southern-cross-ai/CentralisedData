        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, Senator Faulkner. With Australia’s Navy on Christmas holidays for the next two months, can the minister reassure this chamber and guarantee that the ability of the Navy to be available at short notice to deal with people smugglers, illegal fishers and any other maritime incidents will not be diminished in any way during that period?

         I thank the shadow minister for defence for asking the first defence question from the opposition in this chamber since the Rudd government was elected—in excess of a year.
        </p>
        <p>
         The issue in relation to the Navy program and Christmas stand-down is an important issue. As I hope senators would understand, our Navy will improve recruitment and retention by changing Navy culture and improving workplace balance. This recognises that significant change is required to prepare Navy for the future with respect to new ships and equipment, current and future work practices and expectation, and, I might say, the drive for efficiencies. The initiative is a three-pronged program involving leadership and values, structural reform and cultural change and will be in place by early 2009.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am asked the important question by Senator Johnston of whether the stand-down period will affect capability. I can assure Senator Johnston that the reduced activity period is one example of how Navy will be enabled to continue delivering capability while also looking after its people. Operational requirements will still be met throughout this period, and of course, as senators would appreciate, Australia’s national security remains our No. 1 priority.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for his attempt at the answer. Given the Navy says that only 500 Navy personnel will be on active duty over these coming two months, including overseas deployments, exactly how many of Australia’s 12 frigates and 14 patrol boats will be on duty to protect our borders during the period?

           I thank Senator Johnston for his supplementary question. Over the Christmas period, half the patrol boat fleet will remain on duty protecting our borders, while our frigate

           and the Australian led Combined Task Force 158 personnel will remain on duty in the

           . As in the past, the Navy stands ready to respond swiftly to any unforeseen emergencies in our region with a frigate on standby on both the east and the west coast.

            , I ask a further supplementary question. I am obliged to the minister for that response. Having signalled to the rest of the world that our Navy is laid up for Christmas, just how long will it take for our Navy to be able to respond to emergency tasking over the December-January stand-down period?

             I accept the interjection that was made by a member of the opposition that this is an important issue. Let me say in response to the second supplementary question of Senator Johnston that the Navy’s preparedness will not be affected by the plan to stand down non-essential personnel in order to give them and their families the rest and respite that they have earned and that I hope members of the opposition—in fact I hope all senators—would agree is well deserved.
