       <p class="italic">
        Purpose of the Bills
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bills implement Australia's tariff commitments and obligations under the Rules of Origin Chapter in the Malaysia-Australia Free Trade Agreement (MAFTA). The bills amend the Customs Act 1901 to define MAFTA originating goods and the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to provide preferential tariffs for MAFTA originating goods in accordance with MAFTA.

       <p class="italic">
        Reasons for Urgency
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The MAFTA Treaty has been finalised and was tabled in Parliament on 14 August 2012 for the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties (JSCOT) to consider.

        The Governments of Australia and Malaysia have agreed to aim for the Treaty to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The amendments in these bills are required before the Treaty can commence and hence the need to be passed before 29 November 2012.

       <p class="italic">
        The bill introduces a range of measures to increase the resistance of Commonwealth law enforcement agencies to corruption and to enhance the range of tools available to law enforcement agencies to respond to corruption.

       <p class="italic">

Integrity tests are operations designed to test whether a public official will respond to a simulated or controlled situation in a manner that is illegal or would contravene an agency's standard of integrity. The introduction of integrity testing has been recommended by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill also increases the jurisdiction of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity to include all staff in the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre and the CrimTrac Agency, and prescribed staff in the

       </p>

        of Customs to deal with suspected corrupt conduct and brings those powers in to line with powers currently available to the AFP Commissioner and the ACC CEO.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Reasons for Urgency
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This bill contains a number of measures aimed at addressing recently identified opportunities to strengthen the resistance to corruption of a number of key Commonwealth law enforcement agencies. Introduction and passage of this bill in the 2012 Spring sittings of Parliament will allow these important anti-corruption measures to be implemented as soon as possible. The agencies affected by this bill all play a key role in border security. Delay in passage of the bill may provide opportunities for vulnerabilities in these agencies to be exploited by organised crime.
