         I thank Senator Fawcett for his question and his interest in training in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         , and his concern, in particular, for students afflicted by the crisis that has befallen
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
          TAFE
         </a>
         in South Australia. This week we have been made aware of the decision by the national training regulator, the Australian Skills Quality Authority, to suspend
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE_SA" rel="nofollow">
          TAFE SA
         </a>
         's registration in relation to 14 courses that TAFE SA was administering. This is as a result of an audit, a random audit, that was undertaken into 16 courses run by TAFE SA. So 14 out of the 16 courses that had been audited in TAFE SA have been given the thumbs-down by the national regulator as a result of serious, serious mismanagement on the part of TAFE SA and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
          South Australian
         </a>
         government. Indeed, TAFE SA was found not to be compliant with numerous clauses of the standards for registered training organisations in Australia. Seven of the suspended courses are on the national and state priority lists, demonstrating they are indeed important courses, and the impact is estimated to touch upon at least 800 students across plumbing, commercial cookery, meat processing, hairdressing and automotive refinishing. The problem, though, is not limited there. Ms Susan Close, the minister for education in South Australia, has conceded that she and the government have no idea of the scale of the problem that has been createdâ€”that, given 14 out of 16 courses audited have been found to have fundamental problems, Ms Close has admitted, she has no idea how many more courses might be affected, how many more students may be impacted, or how many people who have qualifications that they may not have received adequate training for may well be out there. This is a most serious problem, a most serious embarrassment, for the South Australian government and it's one that Minister Close ought to be held to account for.

            Over the last five years, the federal government has provided some $771 million to the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
             South Australia
            </a>
            n government to support vocational education and training. In that time, however, senators would be shocked to know that the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
             South Australian
            </a>
            government has decreased its investment in vocational education and training from what was $516 million in 2012 to $425 million in 2016. We see there the clear trajectory of a state government who, of courseâ€”we in this chamber knowâ€”can't keep the lights on. Those who have followed the welfare of the most vulnerable in South Australia would know they can't manage to keep vulnerable children safe, or disabled South Australians safe. They certainly can't manage to grow the economy or create jobs. And now it is clear they cannot even manage to run a training system in South Australia, they have cut their funding, they've chopped and changed their policies, and they've now left hundreds or thousands of students stranded with qualifications for which they received inadequate training.

               This is a matter, I know, that Senator Fawcett has followed particularly closely because, Senator Fawcett, with his background in aviation, has been well aware that not just the training regulator but also
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CASA" rel="nofollow">
                CASA
               </a>
               , the civil aviation safety administration authority, has undertaken its own audit identifying that aircraft engineering and training undertaken by

                TAFE

               SA has failed to live up to the adequate standards. So we have here clear signals that areas of critical safety have been failed, in terms of the training provided to students in
