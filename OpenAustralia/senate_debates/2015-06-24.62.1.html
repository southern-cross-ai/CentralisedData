        My question is to the Assistant Minister for Social Services, Senator Fifield. Can the minister update the Senate on the implementation of the new national carers gateway announced in the 2015 budget?

         I thank Senator Seselja for yet another question. I think colleagues would be aware that there are close to three million carers in Australia and I think all colleagues recognise the incredible role that they play. In this regard, the Prime Minister seeks to lead by example, on behalf of colleagues, as evidenced by the annual Pollie Pedal fundraiser which, over many years, has raised many hundreds of thousands of dollars for Carers Australia. I know it is a commitment that all colleagues share.

         Being a carer can be very demanding, particularly in the prime working years of one's life. It is also important to recognise that there are many young carers in the nation. That is why the government announced in this year's budget that we would invest $33.7 million in establishing a new carer gateway. From December 2015 the national carer gateway will provide a nationally identifiable place for all carers to go for information, regardless of who they care for, so they can access information about support and referral to services. The gateway will consist of a national website with a service finder and a national contact centre as the first step in a longer-term plan to better support carers.
        </p>
        <p>
         On budget night we announced that we would establish a gateway advisory group, co-chaired by Ara Cresswell of Carers Australia. Today I am announcing the membership of that advisory group, which will consist of people with lived experience of being a carer, people who have had to interface with the disability and aged-care systems and mental-health systems, people who will provide good advice to the government on better support for carers.

           There are hundreds of thousands of young carers in Australia who have to juggle their caring responsibilities, study and, often, part-time work as well. Unfortunately, too often it is their study that gives way under the demands on their time. That is why the coalition has put in place, in honour of an election commitment, a Young Carer Bursary Program. It has an initial commitment of $3 million over three years to assist young carers aged 25 years and under to continue their studies. From February 2015, 150 annual bursaries valued up to $10,000 have been provided for carers. I am pleased to advise the chamber that such was the demand we were able to find additional funding to offer an additional 150 bursaries, valued at $3,000 each, to help these important Australians.

             Another important aspect of the government's announcement in the budget is that we are going to commence work on integrating the supports that carers receive to ensure there are dedicated and improved services for carers. This year the government is investing $532 million in carer supports through the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
              Department of Social Services
             </a>
             and, obviously, that is in addition to the $6.7 billion in direct payments to carers. This support includes counselling, respite training and assistance to continue education or participate in the workforce. We as a government are committed to continuing to improve the supports for carers and it will be on the basis of co-designed work on a plan to be undertaken with stakeholders, including carers, over the next six months which will determine how the national carer gateway will interact with the existing service system. This is a very important area of government policy.
