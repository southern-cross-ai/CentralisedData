        This week, Treasurer Jim Chalmers handed down the Albanese Labor government's first budget. Throughout the term of the former government, women's voices were ignored. Women knew that the former government were not interested in representing their interests, and I heard time and time again while campaigning that the Liberals were out of touch on issues like women's safety in the workplace and at home. They abolished gender-responsive budgeting, a Labor legacy. But now, with the first Labor budget in nearly a decade, we have finally restored it, putting women back at the centre of our budget.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was a special moment on Tuesday night, hearing this Labor government's budget indicate a true understanding of what will improve the lives of women in Australia, such as making early childhood education more affordable and accessible; providing six months of paid parental leave, with flexibility for it to be shared between both parents; tackling the gender pay gap; and investing in women safety. As a Labor senator, I am so proud to be part of the team that will be driving gender equality, and as a young woman, I feel incredibly lucky that our country's government is recognising and rewarding the work of women. When you support women's equality, our ability to participate in society and our contribution to the economy, you support the entire nation's progress and prosperity. The Albanese government knows this. We know that women's equality is central to building a stronger economy and a better future for all Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to take this opportunity to reflect on the disturbing trend that we are witnessing globally of the erosion of women's rights. In Afghanistan, girls and women are being denied their God-given right to education. They're being denied essential social and economic participation. In India, the incidence of sexual crimes against women continues to rise, and female feticide remains an ongoing tragic concern. In almost every conflict around the globe, crimes against women are used as a tactic of war. In Iran, the human rights violations have long been a concern for Australia. But the recent death of the young and innocent Mahsa Amini has sparked widespread protests. My heart goes out to Mahsa's family and loved ones, who have endured the loss of their daughter, sister and friend.
       </p>

        As I stand here today, in this chamber, advocating for greater opportunity for women and greater respect for women and calling for equal rights and equal pay for women, better education for women and change in the global perception of women, I must point out that I am doing so with my hijab on my head. This hijab is an integral part of my identity and expression of my faith. It is the crown I wear with pride. It was with her hijab on her head that Malala Yousafzai stood up against the Taliban and became a global advocate and hero for female education and progress. It was with her hijab on her head that Senator Ilhan Omar entered the

        Senate. It was with her hijab on her head that Kubra Dagli won gold in the

        </a>
        . The hijab does not oppress; lack of opportunity oppresses. Lack of education oppresses. Lack of access oppresses. Ignorance oppresses. Outdated perceptions oppress. Oppressive regimes oppress. It does not help women and girls in Iran or anywhere in the world to misunderstand the issue and falsely label the hijab as oppressive. I stand here strongly in solidarity with all women and girls around the world in their struggle for equality and recognition.
