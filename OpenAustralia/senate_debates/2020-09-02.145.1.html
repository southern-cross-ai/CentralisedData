        My question is for the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Minister Cormann. Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott gets two taxpayer-funded staff members, a driver, an office, a private vehicle, free travel, and a pension worth over $300,000 a year. Mr Abbott has accepted a role advancing the interests of a foreign nation. There is a strong probability that Mr Abbott will be employed to assist the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        to negotiate trade deals that may not necessarily benefit Australia's sovereign interest. Is the Prime Minister really going to allow Australian taxpayers to pay Mr Abbott, pay for his office, pay for his travel, pay for his staff, and pay for his car while he's working against the interests of the same Australian taxpayers that are covering his bills?

         I thank Senator Lambie for that question. I'm somewhat disappointed that a Labor senator has just felt it appropriate to say that that was a good question, because in Australia we have a great tradition, in a non-partisan fashion, of treating our former

            Really? When I say I can't hear a minister answering the question, the retort to the chair is: 'He should answer the question.' I'm asking to be able to hear the minister answer the question. He does not have a quiet voice, and I can't hear it. Senator Cormann.

             Despite my voice, I don't think any of my colleagues are falling asleep as I'm answering this question today. We treat our former
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Ministers" rel="nofollow">
              Prime Ministers
             </a>
             with courtesy and respect. The work expense arrangements for all of them are the same. I believe that all of them pursue alternative opportunities to contribute, internationally and domestically. I don't believe the information Senator Lambie has, that Mr Abbott is paid for work that he is conducting to facilitate international trade. I don't believe he's paid for that role. I don't think it is appropriate to make the sorts of reflections that were just supported by a Labor senator in this chamber—disappointingly—in relation to any of our former prime ministers.

               Whether he was paid or not, I was kicked out of the Senate in 2017 under section 44 of the Constitution, for dual citizenship. The thinking has always been that dual citizens have dual allegiance, to Australia and to another country. If another country was paying me to promote their interests, potentially over the interests of Australia, would that be considered a dual allegiance? And, if so, would I, like Mr Abbott, still be entitled to an annual salary from the taxpayer?

                Firstly, Mr Abbott is no longer a member of the Australian parliament, so the constitutional arrangements around eligibility for federal members of parliament do not apply to Mr Abbott. Mr Abbott, like any former member of parliament or any former Prime Minister under the old parliamentary pension arrangements, obviously qualifies for the arrangements that have been in place for all on the same basis. I think it's entirely inappropriate to make the suggestions that are being made here. I think it is deeply personal and inappropriate, and—

                   Senator Lambie, I've allowed you to restate part of the question, but that was not a point of order. I think the minister is being directly relevant to the question as asked. There's a chance to debate it later. Senator Cormann.

                    I answered the question directly. The analogy that Senator Lambie sought to make with her circumstance when she found herself in breach of constitutional eligibility requirements is not valid, because Mr Abbott is no longer a member of the Australian parliament.

                      What would the Prime Minister like to say to the thousands of veterans whose compensation claims have been denied in the courts every year, each amounting to far less than the $700,000 a year we're paying the former Prime Minister to work against Australia's national interest?
