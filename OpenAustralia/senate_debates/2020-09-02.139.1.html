        , Senator Cash. Can the minister update the Senate on how the Morrison government's record economic response of over $300 billion to the COVID-19 pandemic is keeping small businesses in business and their employees in work through the economic effects of the pandemic?

         I thank Senator McGrath for the question. As the Minister for Finance has stated, COVID-19—a global pandemic—has had a devastating impact on not only the global economy but of course the Australian economy. When a government has to shut down parts of the economy, it is going to have a detrimental effect. We know that it has had a devastating effect on many small and family businesses around Australia, but that is why the government took decisive action and continues to take decisive action to respond to both the health aspects of the pandemic and of course the economic aspects. Small and family businesses are the engine room of the Australian economy. In particular, they support rural and regional economies around Australia. That is why we are investing a record stimulus of in excess of $300 billion in the economy to ensure that we can support them.

                   . The economic support is flowing through to small and family businesses around Australia. We know that the JobKeeper program is supporting around 3.5 million Australians to maintain that really important connection with their employer. Yesterday legislation passed this place that will ensure that that support continues until March next year. The cash flow boost is also flowing through to small and family businesses around Australia. Over 785,000 businesses are now accessing over $24 billion in assistance, with that important money flowing through to them. At this time, the apprentice wage subsidy is supporting over 51,200 employers, most of which are small businesses around Australia, to retain almost 90,000 apprentices and trainees. Small and family businesses are the backbone of the Australian economy, and the Morrison government will continue to support them.

                      On the government side—the coalition side—of the chamber, we understand that putting in place policies that will support small and family businesses to prosper, grow and create more jobs for Australians is essential for a strong economy. We've had a record of doing that since we were elected to government. In particular, though, we are fast-tracking tax relief for small and family businesses around Australia because we know that it's their money. The more we can give back to them, the more they can invest back into their businesses and create more jobs for Australians. We are, of course, ensuring that small businesses are paid on time through a range of initiatives but, in particular, through the government's own payment policies. We are cutting red tape for small business. Red tape is a blocker in terms of job creation, and we are absolutely committed to cutting red tape where we can. Investing in mental health resources for small businesses is so important, given the devastating impact of COVID-19 on the economy—

                         The Morrison government understands that small and family businesses are the backbone of the Australian economy. We understand that we need to put in place—and we have put in place—policies that will enable them to prosper, grow and create more jobs for Australians. In terms of our plan for economic recovery and getting Australia and Australians through the COVID-19 pandemic, every minister and every department is working to put job creation at the centre of everything we do. We will continue to build on the measures that we have already implemented to help the economy and to ensure that small businesses are able to create jobs. As the Minister for Finance has stated, this includes undertaking important skills reform and ensuring that Australians are skilled in areas of the economy that are creating jobs. The important industrial relations reform that the Minister for Finance referred to includes removing unnecessary red tape through deregulation and, of course, streamlining project approvals—a key factor in job creation.
