        <p>
         I thank Senator Edwards very much for his question, because the government's plan to implement a continuous naval shipbuilding program will provide the certainty that Australia's defence industry has been lacking for such a long time. It is also a key element of the government's national economic plan to support the transition to a stronger 21st century economy, to drive jobs and growth and investment. Importantly, our plan provides for the capability our Navy needs to keep us safe in our region and strong on the world stage.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Turnbull government has now committed to investing in the construction in Australia of our future submarines, our future frigates, our offshore patrol vessels and our Pacific patrol boats. Importantly, both the future frigate and the offshore patrol vessel builds are going to launch our continuous naval shipbuilding strategy, which provides our defence industry with the certainty it needs to invest and to create jobs. We know that our continuous naval shipbuilding program will create around 2,500 direct jobs at both the Adelaide and Henderson shipyards. The future submarine program itself will create around 1,100 jobs in Adelaide as well. These are jobs for the future, as we stop the boom-bust cycle that has cost industry and jobs for far, far too long.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government's commitment to a continuous naval ship build provides small to medium enterprises across the country—from all over the nation, in fact—who will be part of the supply chains with the work that they will need for years to come, and it gives them the certainty to plan, to invest and to engage in the workplace creation and the technological developments that are so important to this capability, not just on one project but on a continuing flow of work. This is absolutely essential for them to invest in their local communities and to employ Australians.

That is why our commitments to the defence industry—set out, for example, in the Defence Industry Policy Statement and the white paper—are a key element of the Turnbull government's national economic plan to drive jobs and growth, to support the transition to the new 21st century economy. It is an economy that is technologically advanced, with an advanced defence manufacturing industry that will provide new high-tech jobs for decades to come and help to create a stronger, more capable

                  That question from Senator Edwards is very important, because this really is a national endeavour. It is about the National Innovation and Science Agenda and the Defence Industry Policy Statement working hand in hand to drive science and innovation right across Australia, particularly in

                   South Australia

                  and particularly in Adelaide. I recently visited a company called Fugro

                  , which supports the Navy in providing a laser airborne depth sound capability using innovative technology that they now export right across the world. That is a real credit to the innovation in South Australia, in Adelaide. I understand Senator Dastyari cannot be here with us this afternoon to enjoy the benefits of what South Australia can deliver. I think Senator Dastyari has given a whole new meaning to 'kicking an own goal' after his experience post the

That difference is about making a decision and committing to the future acquisition of the 12 submarines that we need for our strategic capability and that will also engage Australian industry to a point never seen before. That is a decision of which the Turnbull government is justly proud, that is a decision which will create thousands of Australian jobs and that is a decision which will deliver the capability that the

                     has been selected as the preferred design partner of the submarines 'subject to further discussions on commercial matters'. Minister, has the government entered into a contract that stipulates all 12 submarines must be built in Australia?

Of course as anyone with a basic, even rudimentary knowledge of negotiation and normal commercial processes would be aware, these matters will be finalised through that process. In fact I can only imagine what those opposite would try to say if they decided that we had undertaken too many steps in the process—they would say that was inappropriate so close to an election. They cannot have it both ways. The government's commitment is quite clear, the government's announcement is quite clear and the government's announcement is that the first 12 future submarines will be built in South Australia with DCNS as the preferred international design partner.

The commentary that Senator McEwen and those opposite might care to make—and I have not actually seen Senator Conroy on his feet but I am a patient person so we will see how we go—is completely unfounded. The decision could not be clearer. And as much as it irks those opposite that they were incapable of making a decision, this government has.
