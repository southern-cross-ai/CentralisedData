        I seek leave to make a short statement about the Disallowance of the Export Control (Fees) Amendment Orders 2009 (No. 1). I was not able to get to the chamber fast enough when this matter was dealt with, and I know that leave was sought by others to make short statements.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to indicate to the chamber, in relation to the postponement motion by Senator Colbeck of the Disallowance of the Export Control (Fees) Amendment Orders 2009 (No. 1), that I was not in agreement with that being postponed. These fees come in from 1 July and will have an impact on a lot of businesses. I do not believe the package that has been negotiated will ensure that every person affected by these fees will be covered. Given that it is going to cost a lot of businesses in Australia an extra $40 million each year for the next three or four years, this is a huge issue. I want it noted that I would have preferred that disallowance was voted on and I would have voted for the disallowance. But it has been deferred to the next sitting period.
