        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) The proposal is being assessed under the EPBC Act through an accredited assessment of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">

        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) The Australian Government will only consider whether it is appropriate to contribute funding for alternative water supply options for Orange if construction of the Macquarie to Orange pipeline is not approved.
