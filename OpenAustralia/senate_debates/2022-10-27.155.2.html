        In the Senate today I want to share some meaningful thoughts from a rally I attended in Perth for Tuart Place. Tuart Place, of which I'm proud to be a patron, supports survivors of institutional child sexual abuse. Based in Fremantle, it has occupied its headquarters at 24
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Street" rel="nofollow">
         High Street
        </a>
        since its inception. That location has become a home and a haven for survivors. The organisation is now threatened with eviction.
       </p>
       <p>
        The owners, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Brothers" rel="nofollow">
         Christian Brothers
        </a>
        , who it must be noted have previously supported Tuart Place, plan to sell this property. Many voices—many voices—were heard at the rally, calling for Tuart Place and its services to remain where they are. Dr Philippa White, the director, said: 'Tuart Place needs to stay right here on the ground floor of this building, where we have been since 2007. We have exhausted every option for moving and, yes, we could rent a two-room office space with a reception area, but what we would lose would be everything that we have built—everything that is special about this place and everything that is our community. People who come here often have had many different homes when they were young and it is hard to settle down after that. This is a stable, familiar, accessible place where you can just drop in and are always welcome. The staff and volunteers are warm and friendly and it feels like home,' she said of Tuart Place. 'You don't just take that away, especially now as people are getting older and need more care.'
       </p>
       <p>
        And John Ryall, a child migrant, said, 'This building, 24 High Street, is unique as it meets all the needs of the staff and members . There are no buildings like it in Fremantle that we can afford. Many of our people feel safe and secure here.' This is a matter of great concern. This concerns many West Australians. I especially call upon the Christian Brothers today to show greater charity to this important group of vulnerable Australians.
