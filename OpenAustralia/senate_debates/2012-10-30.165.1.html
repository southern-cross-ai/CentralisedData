         The Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) A national recovery plan for the greater bilby was adopted under the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_Protection_and_Biodiversity_Conservation_Act" rel="nofollow">
          Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act

         1999 (

          EPBC
         </a>
         Act) in 2007 and is currently being revised.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Within Queensland, the Department of Environment and Heritage Protection and the Department of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Parks" rel="nofollow">
          National Parks
         </a>
         , Recreation, Sport and Racing are the lead agencies responsible for coordinating the implementation of on-ground actions identified in the national recovery plan.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Predation by feral cats is recognised as a key threatening process under the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC_Act" rel="nofollow">
          EPBC Act
         </a>
         . A threat abatement plan for predation by feral cats was made to provide national action, guidance and coordination to abate the threat from feral cats on biodiversity.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The Australian Government has recognised that the greatest need in feral cat control is for a broad-scale, cat-specific toxic bait for use in conservation areas. The Curiosity® feral cat bait has been developed and is currently undergoing field trials to gather the necessary efficacy data to register the bait. The government has committed $3.96 million to this project between 1996 and 2012. Once registered and commercialised the Curiosity® feral cat bait will be available to conservation managers.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Threat abatement plans have also been developed for other feral animals that pose a threat to the greater bilby, including foxes and rabbits.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         A large part of the greater bilby's Mitchell Grassland habitat in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_Country" rel="nofollow">

         .
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         At Currawinya National Park an area of 25 square kilometres is protected within an electrified boundary fence built with donations from a not for profit organisation the 'Save the Bilby Fund' and with assistance from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Parks_and_Wildlife_Service" rel="nofollow">
          Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service
         </a>
         . It is the only site in Queensland where the greater bilby has been reintroduced into the wild.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         There are 19 projects totalling over $5.5 million over the past 5 years of the Caring for our Country initiative that directly address threat abatement issues, these were funded through various Business Plans.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Regional funding is provided for the 3 Natural Resource Management Regions, an investment of nearly $20 million over the past 5 years. A significant proportion of this would be used to address threat abatement activities.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) In addition to the above, a specific objective identified in the national recovery plan for the greater bilby is to inform and involve the community and all stakeholders in the recovery process.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Community engagement in greater bilby protection is actively being pursued by the 'Save the Bilby Fund'.
