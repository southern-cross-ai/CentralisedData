        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Senator Fifield. I refer to the Prime Minister's pre-election promise that there will be 'no cuts to the ABC'. Will the government keep its pre-election promise?

         The Australian government has no current plans to reduce funding for the ABC, or for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SBS" rel="nofollow">
          SBS
         </a>
         for that matter, or—and I am sure the senator will find great reassurance from this—to review their editorial policies or programming. We all know that the ABC is a generously funded organisation, courtesy of the Australian taxpayer. But all Australian government agencies and departments should make sure that they are making the best possible use of every single taxpayer dollar, and that is the intent behind the efficiency review that Minister Turnbull has announced. But I can assure the chamber that this government intends to keep all its election commitments.

           The same goes for
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SBS" rel="nofollow">
            SBS
           </a>
           as well. The government do not have any plans to reduce funding. But, again, for SBS as for the ABC, it is it important that every taxpayer dollar is used to its optimum benefit, and that is why the efficiency review that Minister Turnbull announced also applies to the ABC. I think it is just good and prudent government to make sure that government agencies, government departments, SBS and the ABC are being as efficient as they possibly can be. What is the opposite of being as efficient as you can be? It is being as inefficient as you can be. I do not think anyone for a moment is suggesting that that is a good approach. So the government makes no apology for the fact that we are trying to ensure that taxpayers get optimal value for every one of their dollars.

             I know those opposite get quite excited at any mention of the Commission of Audit. But I can assure the chamber that the Commission of Audit and the audit commissioners are here to help. The purpose of the audit commission is to advise government how each taxpayer dollar can be spent to ensure that taxpayers get optimal value from the expenditure of that particular dollar.
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commission" rel="nofollow">
              The Commission
             </a>
             of Audit report will be released. A decision has not been taken yet as to when that will be. But I know that those on this side of the chamber will join with those on the opposite side of the chamber in looking forward to reading the contents of the Commission of Audit report and the contribution it can make to good public policy.
