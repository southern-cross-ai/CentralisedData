            Minister, do you accept the science that burning fossil fuels is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and that rising greenhouse gas emissions are linked to the warming of the world's oceans?

             I thank Senator Whish-Wilson for his question. If you are asking me whether I'm a climate denier, Senator Whish-Wilson, no, I'm not. One thing that this government has always been absolutely clear about and remains absolutely committed to is making sure that we support Australians with reliable, affordable, dispatchable power. But, at the same time—

               I just want to stress how hard I worked to make this a very, very simple question. The point of order is on direct relevance. Saying you are not a climate denier is not answering the question. It was really a yes or no question.

                Just as you were trying to write a tight question, Senator Whish-Wilson, I was trying to hear the minister, but I couldn't, despite my numerous calls to order across the chamber. However, while I couldn't hear part of the minister's answer while I was calling the chamber to order, I can't accept your submission that I can direct the minister how to answer the question. I will listen carefully. You've reminded the minister of the question and I do so again.

                 Senator Whish-Wilson, I am more than happy to give you the government's policy as it relates to supporting Australians and supporting Australian industry and making sure we also are in a position where we can protect Australia's environment and take up our responsibility for the protection of the world environment as well. If you wish to ask things in relation to oceans, maybe you should consider asking your question of the Minister for the Environment.

                    I do think that was a fair point of order on direct relevance, Senator Whish-Wilson. Senator Ruston, the question related to various concepts rather than government policies. So I take the opportunity to remind you that you can answer in a personal capacity or in a government capacity because the question did ask 'do you accept'. So, to that extent, it wasn't a broad question on government policy.

                     Well, I think I did answer Senator Whish-Wilson's question in my first response immediately after him asking the question, and I will stand by that. I am not a climate denier. However, I also am a very strong believer in all of the policies that have put in place by the government of which I am a member to make sure that we meet our obligations and we support a future in this country and this world that makes sure that our environment is protected for our children and for their children.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     But we as a government are not going to undertake those policies to the detriment of Australia, Australians or the Australian economy. We will make sure, in the process of going forward into a future that I think every Australian wants, that we will do—

                        Once again, thank you very much, Senator Whish-Wilson, for your question. I can only answer the question as it relates to requesting me to provide you with my opinion, which I'm quite happy to do. I am not a climate denier and I believe that it is extraordinarily important that we make sure that we look after our environment.

                        But if you want to ask specific questions in relation to the environment—and many of the things that were in the substance of your question, Senator Whish-Wilson, related to very, very specific aspects of environmental policy—I do not represent the Minister for the Environment. However, I am more than happy to take on notice the questions that you have asked in relation to the environment and refer them to the environment minister to provide you with an answer to your questions.

Can you then explain to coastal communities, ocean lovers, tourism operators, surfers, divers and fishers right around the nation why you are responsible for releasing 80,000 square kilometres of new ocean acreage to oil and gas companies to explore for the exact same fossil fuels that are responsible for killing our oceans?

                           Yesterday, I answered the question in relation to the opening up of a particular area of ocean between Victoria and Tasmania. But, once again, the independent assessment of the environmental impact of anything that occurs is undertaken by an independent organisation, NOPSEMA. I'm sure that you, Senator Whish-Wilson, would be very well aware of NOPSEMA's obligations under the act to make sure that they do not enable or allow exploration to be undertaken in a way that's detrimental to the environment in which it is being undertaken.
