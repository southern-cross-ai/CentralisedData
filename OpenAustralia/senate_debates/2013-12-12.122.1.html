          <p>
           I thank the honourable senator for his question. A short while ago, the High Court gave its decision in the Commonwealth's proceedings seeking a declaration of invalidity against the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
            ACT
           </a>
           's same-sex marriage legislation. As a result of the decision, the judges decided in a unanimous joint judgment of six of Their Honours to uphold the Commonwealth's legal challenge. One member of the court, Justice Gageler, recused himself, I understand because, as Commonwealth Solicitor-General,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Honour" rel="nofollow">
            His Honour
           </a>
           had given legal advice to the Commonwealth.
          </p>
          <p>
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commonwealth" rel="nofollow">
            The Commonwealth
           </a>
           welcomes this decision. The basis upon which the decision was reached by Their Honours was the supremacy of the marriage power in section 51(xxi) of the Constitution. I will read a couple of sentences from the statement that the court published:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           The
           <i>
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_Act" rel="nofollow">
             Marriage Act
            </a>
           </i>
           provides that a marriage can be solemnised in Australia only between a man and woman and that a union solemnised in a foreign country between a same sex couple must not be recognised as a marriage in Australia. That act is a comprehensive and exhaustive statement of the law of marriage.
          </p>
          <p>
           As a result, the inconsistent provisions of the ACT legislation were held to be void and of no effect. As I said on 10 October when I announced that the Commonwealth would initiate these proceedings:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Irrespective of anyone's views on the desirability or otherwise of same-sex marriage, it is clearly in Australia's interests that there be nationally consistent marriage laws.
          </p>
          <p>
           At the moment, the Commonwealth Marriage Act provides that consistency. That is the position which the High Court, I am pleased to say, has upheld today.

            <p>
             The appropriate reaction of members of parliament, irrespective of their political positions, to decisions of the High Court is always to respect the authority of the court. I might say that even if the decision had gone the other way, and the Commonwealth's proceedings had been dismissed rather than upheld, my answer would have been the same. It is imperative that all members of parliament, irrespective of their personal opinions, uphold and respect the authority of decisions of the courts.
            </p>
            <p>
             That has not always been the case. I recall that under the previous government, in September 2011 when the High Court gave its decision in the Malaysia solution case, the High Court and individual members of the court were attacked by members of the cabinet and by the Prime Minister.

               It is important because the High Court is the final arbiter of legality in this country, and no minister of this government will do what ministers of the previous government did and attack decisions of the High Court and attack members of the High Court by name when a decision is resolved against the executive.
