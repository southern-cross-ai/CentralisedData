        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Birmingham. Yesterday, Senator Birmingham said that the robodebt scheme 'obviously had issues'. When did the Morrison government first become aware that the robodebt scheme 'obviously had issues'?

           Was the government told in a departmental brief on or around 1 March 2017 that a third of robodebts had been reassessed and reduced to zero dollars?

            In relation to a particular departmental brief on a particular date, I will take that on notice and seek to provide a response to the senator. I would reiterate in this matter that it is important for governments to be able to ensure that taxpayer dollars, where they are paid out, are paid where they are validly meant to go. And, in relation to our government, we have acknowledged on this program that there was a need to refund certain payments and to correct in relation to those issues. We equally stand by the need to make sure that taxpayer dollars are respected and that the Commonwealth recoups those where they have been wrongly claimed.

               Our government has worked through these issues, which have been the subject of extensive questioning in relation to the dates, which the senator refers to, that particular information may have been provided. If there is something further to be provided in relation to the information I took on notice beforeâ€”which, I suspect, has probably already been dealt with through Senate estimates committee hearings in questions to Senator Ruston of a highly repetitive nature around dates and timesâ€”I will make sure that it is included. But it does not negate the fact that the government sought to make sure taxpayer dollars went to the purpose for which they were intended, and our government will continue to do so, where we can and where appropriate.
