        This legislation, which now includes amendments to both the Migration Act and the Criminal Code, complements and further strengthens the amendments previously introduced to parliament. It builds on and reinforces the measures passed by the parliament on 16 November. These measures are only necessary because of the mess the opposition leader, Mr Dutton, made of the home affairs portfolio while he had carriage of it in the former government.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's important that we don't forget how we got to this place. We got here because the High Court found that a detention regime that was implemented by Mr Dutton as minister was unconstitutional and unlawful. We got here because Mr Dutton failed to resettle any of the former detainees, who have now been released in line with the High Court orders. We got here because Mr Dutton intervened to allow the plaintiff in the High Court case to apply for another visa. We got here after a month of politics from Mr Dutton—politics rather than protecting the community. We saw only last week Mr Dutton and the coalition vote against laws that we as the government introduced that sought to strengthen this regime. But, instead of backing that extra layer of protection, Mr Dutton and the coalition voted with the Greens against those amendments only last week. That is how we got here—after a series of failures by Mr Dutton and the coalition over Mr Dutton's period as the home affairs minister.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now Mr Dutton tries to blame the Albanese government for his own failures. We all remember that person at school who you were listed to do a group assignment with and who tells you for years, for weeks or for months that they've contributed their bit of the assignment, and then you find out on the day that the assignment is due that they haven't done anything. That is the situation we found with Mr Dutton. There were years of claims made by Mr Dutton that he had done this and done that and that he was this tough and that tough. Now we find out—now that he is not the Minister for Home Affairs anymore—that his entire migration system and his entire detention system was an absolute ruse that didn't stand up in court. That is how we got here. Let's not buy any of this nonsense from the opposition that this is the Albanese government's fault. The responsibility for this mess lies firmly at the feet not just of the coalition but of Mr Dutton himself. We need to remember that, as we in the Albanese government fix this mess and make these laws go through—making strong laws stronger, making strict laws stricter and making tough laws tougher. That's what we are doing with the legislation to fix Mr Dutton's mess.
       </p>
       <p>
        Specifically this package strengthens the already robust laws that have been introduced to ensure the protection of the community by introducing new powers for the courts to impose community safety orders where there is substantial admissible evidence of a high risk to the community from people who have previously committed a serious, violent or sexual offence. This judicially supervised scheme includes a mechanism to detain, or impose additional conditions on, noncitizens who pose an unacceptable risk to the community but who have no real prospect of being removed from Australia in the reasonably foreseeable future.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 8 November, the High Court determined that plaintiff NZYQ's detention was unlawful 'by reason of their having been, and continuing to be, no real prospect of the removal of the plaintiff from Australia in the reasonably foreseeable future'. The government recognises and respects the constitutional jurisprudence of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         High Court of Australia
        </a>
        , which is reflected in this scheme. What we are proposing is modelled on the high-risk terrorist offenders scheme established under the former coalition government. Indeed it is precisely the sort of scheme that Liberal and National MPs and senators have been calling for. Above all, the proposed scheme reflects the expectations of the Australian community that all lawful mechanisms available to a government should be utilised to ensure community safety.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government has already put in place a number of stringent visa conditions to manage risks to the community posed by certain noncitizens in response to the High Court's decision. These conditions underpin the ability to manage the NZYQ cohort in the community, and new powers support monitoring and compliance with the conditions. The government will continue to review these arrangements to ensure they remain fit for purpose, and we have committed to developing further amendments as required to ensure the ongoing safety of the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia is the greatest country in the world, and for decades we have welcomed waves of migrants who have made Australia home. Australians rightly expect to live in safety in the community, and the proposed package of amendments I am moving today focus on an assessment of the risk posed by a person who has been convicted of a serious violent or sexual offence, and on a determination to be made by the minister for immigration as to whether or not the strict conditions that can be imposed through our visa framework are sufficient to effectively manage that risk. Where the minister forms the view that the strict visa conditions available under the Migration Act may not effectively manage the risk to the community, the proposed amendments provide an option for the minister to approach the courts to seek the imposition of a community safety order. The application to the court must be supported by substantial admissible evidence of the high risk the noncitizen poses to the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Let me be clear. A community safety order would be made by a court, not the minister. Reflecting on the High Court's decision, the making of a community safety order would be—as it must be—a judicial decision, not an administrative decision. Under the amendments moved here today, a community safety order can be either a community safety detention order—that is, preventive detention—or a community safety supervision order. This would, in effect, allow for the making of an order that most effectively manages the risk to the community appropriately and proportionately to the circumstances. A community safety detention order will be used for the highest-risk individuals where the court determines that there are no viable conditions that could effectively manage the risk posed by the individual if they were in the community. Before making such an order, the court must be satisfied that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of seriously harming the community by committing a serious violent or sexual offence, and that there is no less restrictive measure that could effectively manage that risk. On the other hand, a community safety supervision order can be used to impose conditions on individuals where the court determines such conditions would effectively and appropriately manage the risk of the individual while they are in the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Before making a community safety supervision order, the court must be satisfied that each of the conditions, and the combined effect of all the conditions to be imposed on the offender by the order, are reasonably necessary, reasonably appropriate, and adapted for the purpose of protecting the community from serious harm by addressing the unacceptable risk of the offender committing a serious violent or sexual offence. The legislation must not specify or limit the conditions available to the court. Instead, it allows the court to tailor the order to the specific risk posed by the noncitizen to the community. Under this scheme, it is important to give the courts the flexibility to adapt the community safety supervision order conditions to the circumstances of each offender in order to support compliance, maintain proportionality and effectively protect the Australian community.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amendments moved today also create offences for failing to comply with a community safety supervision order. Where a community safety supervision order is made, the order overrides all community protection related visa conditions previously imposed by the minister. In effect, those conditions are superseded by the decision of the courts. However, all national security and status-resolution related conditions would continue to remain valid and enforceable.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the instance where the risk may not meet the threshold for applying to the courts for either of the community safety orders, the minister would have available the range of strict visa conditions, together with associated offences for breaching those conditions. These include, for example: conditions relating to monitoring and reporting; conditions related to contact with or proximity to minors; and conditions related to contact with a victim or their family. The bill retains criminal offences for breaching those conditions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the amendments being moved today, a community safety order could be made for up to three years, and successive orders could be sought. Under the new community safety orders and ministerially imposed visa condition schemes, a requirement for an annual review of the risk posed by the noncitizen has been included. In addition, the noncitizen can appeal a decision by the court through judicial review mechanisms, or via a review of visa conditions through administrative appeal. In effect, the arrangements can endure for as long as the risk remains. Under these laws, all restrictions on the individual's liberty, whether they are in detention or in the community, must be proportionate to the level of risk the noncitizen poses to the community. The amendments also provide law enforcement with the necessary powers to monitor an individual, subject to a community safety supervision order, to ensure the individual is complying with the conditions imposed on them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Let's not forget that, as I say, at all times over the last few weeks through this debate the safety of the community has been the utmost priority for the Albanese government. Not playing politics but protecting individuals—that's what we're doing through this strong legislation. It's about time the opposition stopped the politics.

        <p>
         I have to say on those last comments that, unfortunately, the only thing this government has done is play politics. Let's start with some of the comments that the minister has made in relation to NZYQ. Let's talk about the truth of NZYQ, who is the plaintiff in this matter and the person to whom the High Court decision actually applies. The coalition inherited from Labor 30,000 people who were put into the community on bridging visas. Why did that happen? Because our detention centres were full. Fifty thousand illegal maritime arrivals had arrived under the former Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government. We had a mess to clean up. We had to reintroduce temporary protection visas because—lo and behold!—the Labor government had abolished them.
        </p>
        <p>
         In order to clean up this mess that we inherited from the former Rudd-Gillard-Rudd Labor government, it was a fact that, under migration law, assessments needed to be done on individual claims for protection. It was also a fact that you couldn't determine what to do with an individual until their status had been determined. In other words, you had to work out if they were found to be owed protection or not and whether they could be deported back to their country of origin. So, despite the rhetoric from the Labor Party today, at staged periods in time the minister did at law what he had to do and lifted the bar to allow a certain number of people to make this application to have their protection claims assessed. Just so everybody understands, this was not an issuing of a visa. Despite what the minister and Labor have been saying, there is a big difference. The bar was lifted, as we know, for large cohorts. We were dealing with 30,000 people who had been put into our community on bridging visitors because our detention centres were full. The minister did not deal with individual cases at this point in the process. It happens to be a fact that, without lifting the bar to enable people's claims to be assessed, we could not determine what to do with them. That is actually a legal fact. One of those potential options was deportation if they could be returned to their country of origin.
        </p>
        <p>
         So it is false to suggest—the Labor Party know this, but it doesn't stop them—that the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Dutton, intervened to grant NZYQ a visa. That is just not true. The facts do not sustain what the Labor Party are saying. The Prime Minister, Minister O'Neil and Minister Giles, quite frankly, should be ashamed of themselves for trying to mislead the Australian public.
        </p>
        <p>
         Without a doubt, though, these types of comments were an embarrassing attempt to try and distract from the complete incompetence of the Albanese Labor government when it comes to the handling of detainees being released into the community. This also happens to be a fact: NZYQ would not be in Australia were it not for Labor's failed border protection policy which allowed 50,000 arrivals on more than 800 boats.
        </p>
        <p>
         Let's put on the record what actually happened despite what the minister and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Labor Party
         </a>
         have been misleading the public with. What did Mr Dutton, as the relevant minister at the time, actually do? He allowed a process to take place for those who had arrived under Labor. Remember that there were 50,000 illegal maritime arrivals, more than 1,200 dead at sea and thousands of children placed into detention because of the failed border protection policies of the previous Labor government.
        </p>
        <p>
         Mr Dutton allowed a process to take place, where those who arrived under Labor could apply to have their claims for protection assessed by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Home Affairs
         </a>
         , Immigration and Border Protection. Despite what Labor said, the fact remains there was no intervention and no visa was ever granted to this individual. Labor were either misleading the Australian public or, alternatively, perhaps they don't understand immigration law. NZYQ arrived, lo and behold, in September 2012 under the former Labor government. He arrived on a boat. He fell into the 13 August 2012 to 1 January 2014 fast-tracked cohort. We were cleaning up the mess left to us by the former Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments. That fast-tracked cohort consisted of 24,500 illegal maritime arrivals and they all had the bar lifted en masse because, under that law, that is what the minister had to do. You couldn't determine what to do with an individual until their status had been determined; hence the minister had to lift the bar.
        </p>
        <p>
         Cleaning up the mess even further, though, in 2015-16, the minister exercised these power on, lo and behold, 24,120 occasions, covering 23,014 non-citizens. So under sections 46A and 46B of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Act" rel="nofollow">
          Immigration Act
         </a>
         , the minister may exercise his powers to lift the legislative bar which prevents certain non-citizens from making an application for a visa. Where the minister exercises these powers, the minister specifics a class a visa for which the person may apply. So, again, despite everything that the Labor Party has been saying—clearly, desperate, no two ways about that, but they know that; that's life with the Australian Labor Party—they are quite happy to spread mistruths, as long as the mistruth fits the facts and the narrative that they want to tell. Let's not worry about what the actual facts say. In fact, God forbid the Australian people ever know what the actual facts are under this government, good grief. It is false to suggest, as I said, that Mr Dutton intervened to grant NZYQ's visa. He was cleaning up a mess left by the former Labor government in relation to the in excess of 50,000 people who had arrived here by boat.
        </p>
        <p>
         I also have comments that I will make the next time I'm given the call in relation to an amendment that I will be moving. But in the first instance, Minister, assuming this bill is passed—and the coalition, as we have indicated, will be supporting this bill through the Senate—does the government have an indication of how many individuals released from detention as a result of the High Court decision will meet the threshold to be redetained or to have a supervision order applied?

          Rather than a question, this is a political attack that the opposition has been engaging in over the last few days. They seem to not appreciate the central point of the High Court judgement, which is that the decision as to the detention of one of these individuals is a matter that must be made by a court rather than by a minister, so it would be completely irresponsible to ignore the High Court ruling for me or any other minister to give the number of people who are expected to be covered by this regime, because we would then be getting back to exactly situation that existed under Mr Dutton as the minister, which was found to be unconstitutional and unlawful by the High Court.
         </p>
         <p>
          The whole point of the decision of the High Court was that decisions as to the detention of these individuals must be made by a court rather than a minister. On a number of occasions over the last few days, in their desperate desire to score political points, the opposition have either wilfully ignored the High Court judgement or failed to understand it, and that is exactly the problem that got us where we are. The problem that we've had is either the former government's wilful ignorance of the law or their contempt for it and desire to override it.
         </p>
         <p>
          As to the number of people who are expected to be captured by this new regime, I'm not in a position to give that number, because that would be flying completely in the face of the High Court reasoning. What I can say is that the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
           Department of Home Affairs
          </a>
          will engage with law enforcement authorities in relation to each NZYQ decision-affected noncitizen who has committed serious violent or sexual offences to determine the risks they pose to the Australian community and consider making applications to the court for orders based on the available evidence. I'm sure Senator Cash is aware of the eligibility requirements for someone to be issued with one of these orders. I wouldn't expect that it would be every single individual in the cohort, but these sorts of orders could be made in relation to people who have, for example, committed serious, violent or sexual offences, and there are other eligibility criteria that need to be fulfilled before one of these orders can be sought by the minister or granted by a court.
         </p>
         <p>
          As I've said before, this regime that we are putting forward is modelled very closely on the high-risk terrorist offender regime that the former coalition brought in. Just as that regime did not allow for the preventive detention of every single convicted terrorist offender or other category of offender—it applied to particular types of people rather than an entire cohort—I would expect similarly that a regime that here is based on and modelled on the coalition's regime for high-risk terrorist offenders would apply to some but not all of the people who have been released into the community as a result of the High Court decision.

           That is a complete misrepresentation in relation to what we're asking you about. The question I asked was: how many in the cohort have committed a serious, violent or sexual crime that has a sentence of seven years of more attached to it? In other words, how many of the 147 rapists, paedophiles and murderers and the contract killer that you have let out of detention have committed a serious violent or sexual crime that has had a sentence of seven or more years attached to it as a maximum? You see, if you don't fall within the first limb, you don't even make it to the second.
          </p>
          <p>
           That now gives me an opportunity to talk about the amendment that we will be moving for this exact reason. The amendment that we are moving is a straightforward amendment. It is about being straight with the Australian people, because, quite frankly, that is what they deserve. But, based on that last decision from the minister, there's nothing to see here. We don't even know how many of the 147 fit within the first limb of our test. I hate to tell the Australian people this, but if you're not in the first limb of the test—guess what?—you're out; the preventive detention order does not apply.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Australian people are entitled to know who is being released into their communities. The fact of the matter is: at this point in time, we only know the tip of the iceberg. We know that the government has released paedophiles, murderers, rapists and a contract killer. Who else? Who are the serious criminals the government has decided to release? Let's be clear: every one of those released from detention was released because of a decision by this government, and the overwhelming majority were released before we had even seen the High Court's reasons. It was a knee-jerk, panicked response, and for the vast majority we don't know what they've done or why the government released them.
          </p>
          <p>
           What is worse is that, based on the answer to my question, the minister himself doesn't know—good grief! The government doesn't know, of the 147 they've released into the community, how many are going to even make it into the first limb. The first limb is very important. I would have thought the minister, perhaps at the instruction of the Prime Minister, would have already done an assessment of the 147. How many of those 147 even meet the first-step threshold the government is putting in place? Is the answer zero? I don't know; the minister hasn't told me. Maybe the answer is zero. Is it three? Is it four? We don't know. That is the basic question we would like the government to ask in the first place.
          </p>
          <p>
           This is an amendment, in terms of what I will have to now move, that will require the government to tell us. It is very simple. It accords with the standard the government has set for itself. This government talks a lot about openness and transparency, but, I have to say, it doesn't talk the talk, unfortunately. If the government is prepared to live by the standard it set itself, it will support the amendment the coalition is putting forward. As I said, it's very simple. Our amendment will require the minister to prepare a statement of reasons for every detainee whom they decide to release as a result of the NZYQ case; that is currently at 147. It says the minister should prepare that statement and then table it within the parliament within seven days. It's pretty simple. When Minister Giles decides to release someone, he should tell Australians why. The only thing the government has said to date is, 'Oh, it's because of the High Court and the decision in the High Court.' Seriously? Tell us how the High Court decision applies to each of the 147 that you have released.
          </p>
          <p>
           The minister should be clear about the visa that has been granted. He should explain to the Australian people what conditions have been imposed. He should reveal their visa history. He should be upfront about the character concerns of the person who, like the 147, is currently living in the Australian community. The Australian public are entitled to know about their past convictions both here in Australia and overseas, and the minister should set out in detail the basis on which he determined there was no real prospect that the person would be removed from Australia in the reasonably foreseeable future—which is the NZYQ case. Under our amendment we're going to help the government help the Australian people understand why they are doing what they are doing. Under our amendment we would learn whether or not the incompetence displayed by the Albanese government in the NZYQ case is a pattern of behaviour.
          </p>
          <p>
           Let's reflect on what happened in that case. The government, as I said, made two concessions. It conceded two important facts, and that terminology—'important facts'—is not mine; it is from the High Court itself. The court put significant weight on those two important facts the government conceded on 30 May. The first concession was that NZYQ could not be removed from Australia. The second concession made by the government was that there was no real prospect of the plaintiff being removed from Australia in the reasonably foreseeable future. The government made those concessions in May, lo and behold, even though they hadn't actually finished making inquiries about whether or not he could be resettled. One might ask: why in God's name would the government have made those concessions? The Labor government made those concessions as at 30 May. But then we get the High Court reasons, and this is what they reveal. When they realised the magnitude of their stuff-up in August, they then started making inquiries with
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes" rel="nofollow">
            Five Eyes
           </a>
           partners.
          </p>
          <p>
           Let's be clear, for the record: this is what happened under this incompetent government. They conceded that there was no way NZYQ was ever going to be removed from Australia, because no-one would take him. After making that concession, which forced the court's hand, they decided to go back and check. Maybe this case would have been entirely unnecessary. Maybe the result could have been avoided. Was this a pattern of behaviour? Did they do this in other cases? I don't know. The Australian people don't know. But I can tell you from the feedback I've been getting into my office and from reading comments online across all the newspapers, the Australian people would like to know: how many people were released without even checking if other countries would take them?
          </p>
          <p>
           Let's see if this government can meet the commitment to transparency and openness that it loves to trumpet—a commitment, I might say, that has only ever been honoured in the breach. Australians know that in the ordinary course they will struggle to get information out of this conniving, secretive, hypocritical government. Let's hope the events of the last four weeks have made them see the error of their ways. I hope they understand how badly they have lost the trust of the Australian people.
          </p>
          <p>
           I say again to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Labor Party
           </a>
           : we are giving you an opportunity. Once again, we are here to help you, just like we were on your last piece of legislation. We proposed six amendments, even though you said it couldn't be done, which you accepted. We are once again cleaning up your mess. We are giving you the opportunity to work with us, to make sure the people who are being asked to bear this risk—the Australian people—actually understand what and who is coming down the line. They need to know who is being released. So the question is, will the government support our very simple amendment? Or are you basically saying 'stuff you' to the Australian people? Are you saying, 'We will not tell you what we have done'? Are you saying, 'We are prepared to expose you to a risk'? In fact, given the last 48 hours, I would think it's a pretty significant risk: allegations of a serious sexual assault and then allegations in relation to a minor. But they're not prepared to tell you about the risk.
          </p>
          <p>
           Again, I ask the minister: how many in the cohort will fit into the first limb of the test the government has set out for itself?

           <p>
            I refer to my earlier answer, in which I made very clear a point Senator Cash continues to not seem to appreciate, which is that we got to this mess because Mr Dutton and the coalition implemented an unconstitutional and unlawful detention regime in which the then minister, Mr Dutton, decided who was detained and who was not. That is exactly what the High Court has found to be unconstitutional and unlawful. The regime that we're putting in place will leave it to the court to make that decision. Senator Cash can ask as many times as she likes how many people this will apply to, but I'm not going to give a number, because that is exactly the problem we are trying to fix—ministers dictating these terms rather than courts.
           </p>
           <p>
            I know Senator Cash and the coalition have a long history of believing governments can operate outside the law. We saw that with robodebt, and we saw the consequences of that. But this government will follow the law and we will follow the High Court reasoning, whatever we might think of it, and we will deliver laws that do stand up in court. For that reason, I'm not going to be any more specific about this issue.
           </p>
           <p>
            During that contribution Senator Cash moved some amendments, so I might just take the opportunity to put the government's position on the record. We will be opposing Senator Cash's amendments, because, simply put, they are unworkable. We appreciate that there is a desire for transparency around the operation of this regime. That is why I refer Senator Cash to clause 395.49 in the amendments, which requires the immigration minister to, as soon as practicable after each 30 June, cause a report to be prepared about the operation of this new division, which sets up the preventive detention regime and the community safety order regime, during the year ended on that 30 June. The clause in the amendments gives some level of detail about what that report must include. This is an annual report that will need to be tabled by the immigration minister to provide a level of transparency around the operation of this regime. Subsection 2 of the clause says that report must include the number of each of the following:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            (a) applications for each kind of community safety order made during the year;
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            (b) each kind of community safety order made during the year;
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            (c) applications for review of each kind of community safety order made by serious offenders during the year;
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            (d) applications for review of each kind of community safety order made by the Immigration Minister, or a legal representative of the Immigration Minister, during the year;
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            (e) each kind of community safety order affirmed during the year;
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            (f) each kind of community safety order varied during the year;
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            (g) community safety orders revoked (including by operation of this Act) during the year.
           </p>
           <p>
            So the very amendments that we are moving require an appropriate level of transparency from the immigration minister each and every year about the operation of this regime, but they do so in a workable manner that won't jeopardise, for example, the potential resettlement of some of these individuals.
           </p>
           <p>
            As I said in my earlier contribution, one of the reasons we are in this situation is that, the entire time he was the Minister for Home Affairs, Mr Dutton failed to resettle any of these individuals. We know that the former government had a policy of not taking up the resettlement deal that was on offer from
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
             New Zealand
            </a>
            , for example. That belligerence and that refusal to work with other countries around resettlement is one of the reasons some of these individuals remain in detention. We don't want to jeopardise that by providing some of the information that Senator Cash's amendments require.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will take you through the Senator Cash's amendments. Proposed section 76G(1)(a) and (b) in her amendments would cover only those visas granted between 8 November, being the date of the High Court decision, and 18 November, which is the commencement date for the Migration Amendment (Bridging Visa Conditions) Act 2023. Proposed section 76G(1)(c) would cover all grants under regulations 2.25AA and
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BB" rel="nofollow">
             BB
            </a>
            . I noted that regulation 2.25AA existed prior to NZYQ, and this provision could be interpreted so as to apply to any visa ever granted under regulation under 2.25AA, noting that that provision was inserted in 2013 and has been used for noncitizens outside the NZYQ cohort. Proposed section 76G(2)(f) requires the minister to table information about the basis on which there is no real prospect of removal. There are legitimate concerns that the minister being required to provide information about the potential refoulement of a noncitizen or the noncitizen's protection claims could further jeopardise removal efforts.
           </p>
           <p>
            As I say, one of the problems that we're dealing with at the moment is the failure of Mr Dutton to resettle any of these individuals that we're talking about. The last thing we want to do is jeopardise the potential future resettlement of any of these individuals by requiring the minister to provide information which could jeopardise those removal efforts. Similarly, providing details of how and why a person cannot be removed would have potential adverse impacts on the relationship between Australia and relevant countries who have been approached and/or the noncitizen's home country. This could also prejudice future negotiations on issues, including on returns, and it could also affect Australia's international relations. Proposed section 76G(3) provides that the statement—that Senator Cash's amendments require—must not include personal details about the noncitizen. However, the breadth of information required to be given under 76G(2) would be so broad as to easily enable the identification of the noncitizen. For example, the person's immigration history would presumably include previous dates of entry and departure from Australia. These significant issues with releasing information that would potentially identify them may therefore constitute a breach of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_Act" rel="nofollow">
             Privacy Act
            </a>
            requirements. Listing country of origin or citizenship is sensitive because some are from very small countries, but for some the nature of the crime and other elements being specified by the opposition would also potentially allow for the identification of the person being released.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's for these reasons that we'll be opposing the amendments. We're trying to strike the right balance in terms of transparency by requiring the immigration minister to table that annual report that's required under clause 395.49, but we think it would be impracticable and unworkable and could jeopardise future removal efforts if we were to agree to the amendments being moved by Senator Cash.

             I'll just make a few comments, and I know Senator Hanson also has some questions. In terms of what we are seeking, all we're asking the government to release is consistent with the types of details you would ordinarily expect to see from a court or the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAT" rel="nofollow">
              AAT
             </a>
             . This government clearly has a perennial problem with detail.
            </p>
            <p>
             Proposed clause 395.49 goes to the actions of the minister. It tells the Australian people nothing about the details of who the Albanese government has decided to release. It does not say the things that we are asking about. It does not say what offences have been committed here or overseas. It does not say what efforts the government has made to try and resettle these individuals. It does not tell the Australian community about the risks they will need to live with—because that is the fact: the Australian community are living with these risks. Quite frankly, if this is the best the government can do in terms of transparency, I don't believe it passes the pub test. But the government have said they will not be supporting our amendment, which was all about transparency with the Australian people.
            </p>
            <p>
             In relation to the question that I asked the minister, the definition of 'serious violent or sexual offence' is added to this bill, and it provides:
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             <i>
              serious violent or sexual offence
             </i>
             means an offence against a law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory where:
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             (a) it is an offence punishable by imprisonment for life or for a period, or maximum period, of at least 7 years; and
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             (b) the particular conduct constituting the offence involved, involves or would involve—
            </p>
            <p>
             and then it takes you through a series of offences—
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             (i) loss of a person's life or serious risk of loss of a person's life; or
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             (ii) serious personal injury or serious risk of serious personal injury; or
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             (iii) sexual assault; or

             et cetera. I would have thought the government already would know how many of the 147 are going to make that first limb, but clearly they do not. So I will ask the minister: when were drafting instructions given in relation to this bill, and when did drafting on the bill actually commence?

              I'd have to take on notice the precise date that drafting instructions were first issued—I think that was the question—or that a request was made for drafting. But I'm advised that policy design work on this matter began before the High Court decision was handed down and before the High Court reasons were handed down. I'd have to take on notice the precise date for drafting instructions, but it's also worth remembering that this bill has been prepared in stages. The bill that we're debating tonight contains the amendments that were passed in the House of Representatives last week despite the opposition of the opposition and the Greens, who voted together to stop us making those laws stronger. Now, of course, we are adding to that the community safety order regime. I suspect what we will find when I come back to you is that drafting instructions were issued at different periods of time because the bill has been prepared in stages. I think it would be reasonable to think that the drafting instructions that set up the strengthening of the laws that went through the House of Representatives last week probably were issued before the drafting instructions for the community safety order regime.

                I have a very specific question. Given the bill last week did not have the preventive detention scheme in it, when were drafting instructions given in relation to the amendments on sheet

                101, which would establish the preventive detention regime, and when did the drafting commence?

                 Again, I'll have to take the precise date on notice, but, as I said in my earlier answer, policy design work around the response to the High Court decision actually began before the High Court decision was handed down. I am happy to come back to you on notice about the date that the drafting instructions were issued for the community safety order regime, but it would be reasonable to expect that final drafting instructions were issued after the High Court reasons, because it was necessary to have those reasons in order to make sure that this regime was constitutional.

                        On 8 November 2023, the High Court answered questions of law reserved for its consideration in a special case to the effect that ss 189(1) and 196(1) of the

                        insofar as they applied to the plaintiff as at those dates.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        What I would suggest to you is that, based on the fact that this was brought to the courts earlier this year, you would have been aware of it if you were right across it and knew what you were doing. As to this whole case and the determination that was brought down by the court, it states here:
                       </p>
                       <p class="italic">
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Court" rel="nofollow">
                         The Court
                        </a>
                        held that ss 189(1) and 196(1), as applied to the plaintiff, contravened Ch III of the Constitution because the plaintiff's detention was not reasonably capable of being seen as necessary for a legitimate and non-punitive purpose in circumstances where there was no real prospect of the removal of the plaintiff from Australia becoming practicable in the reasonably foreseeable future.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        This has, in a couple of other cases, been brought before the courts well before this. One was the Chu Kheng Lim case, and there was also a case in 2004 where the courts held that you can't keep people in detention for an unlimited period of time if they can't practicably and reasonably be relocated or sent back in the foreseeable future.

                        Basically, when this was brought to your attention, you'd been in government for nearly a year. The fact is that you didn't understand that in two previous judgements your case was not represented properly, and that's why the judgements were brought down. You were unprepared. Actually, you've been caught with your pants down. To sit here and listen to you accuse

                        <p>
                         Thanks, Senator Hanson. We're just trying to get an answer to your specific question, but I have to disagree with your assessment of the situation. What I think you've just argued is that, because of an earlier judgement—I'm not sure which judgement or which year it was in—a judge apparently, according to you, cast some doubt on whether it was legal to indefinitely detain these people, and you're saying that because of those previous comments this government should have known that it wouldn't win this case. I can't really see how that puts Mr Dutton in a better position, because he and his government were in power for 10 years and followed the same practice that we followed for, as you put it, about a year before this case started. So, if you're saying that this government made the wrong call to comply with the earlier ruling of the High Court in the Al-Kateb decision—I think that's what it's called—back in 2004, then I would expect that you would be equally critical of Mr Dutton for having done exactly the same thing.

                        <p>
                         Be that as it may, we make no apologies for having opposed this case in the High Court. It was brought, as I say, this year. We argued that the individual involved should remain in detention. That had been the understanding of the Australian law for at least 20 years, through both Mr Dutton's period in office and our 12 months or so before the case started, and we continued to argue that it was lawful to hold this individual in detention.

                         , obviously, found a different way and they overturned that judgement from about 20 years ago. So, given we're a government that complies with the law, we've now followed the law and released that individual and the other people who were caught up in it.

                         I'm not sure that it's wise for me to give you the names of countries that were approached about the potential resettlement of this plaintiff. What I can say is that there were about six different countries that, since we came into government, we approached to resettle this individual. I haven't been advised of this, but I take it that the answer in each case was no. I can't speak to what efforts were made by Mr Dutton or the coalition to resettle this individual when they were in power, but what we do know is that when they lost office these 147 people had not been resettled. What we also know is that the former government rejected the offer of resettlement that

                         had put on the table for a whole bunch of different people. Perhaps, if they hadn't been so belligerent about that, we wouldn't be in this situation.

                          Minister, you know that a lot of these people will not be taken back by countries if they have criminal offences against them. These people include paedophiles, sexual offenders, rapists and murderers. You know the other countries won't take them. You know that the coalition government actually did try to get these people resettled. You know that

                          wouldn't take criminals either. You know that to be the truth, and you keep passing the buck, because you've tried yourself, and it hasn't worked. You haven't been able to do it.

                           The short answer is that this government complies with the law, whether it's law that's written by the parliament or law that's decided by courts. I know that is an unusual situation in Australia, because we did have a government that operated outside the boundaries of the law—for example, with robodebt—but this government takes the law seriously and complies with the law.

                           made a decision that was about one individual and their case, but the decision that they made applied to other people in the same circumstance. If we hadn't released those people, we would be facing claims for compensation for unlawfully detaining those people. I know you've often got a lot to say about wasting taxpayers' money, and I don't think it would be a great idea to waste taxpayers' money paying compensation to people who are illegally detained. That's what we would have been doing if we had ignored the High Court ruling and continued to detain those people.

                           I will just respond to your comments earlier on. You seem to think that Mr Dutton and the coalition attempted to resettle these people. I don't think that has been said by anyone, so I don't know if that's right or not. Secondly, on your point about resettling people in

                           , you would find—and I'm happy to get you the numbers—that, since this government came to power, reached an agreement with the New Zealand government and took up the offer of the New Zealand government to resettle people who were in detention, we have successfully done that. New Zealand has accepted people who were previously detained in Australia but whose cases the former government wasn't prepared to take up.

                            were probably not criminals—not to the same extent as those you have released. You never even waited. After the High Court decision was handed down, you never waited to see what the determination was and the full reasons for their decision. That came nearly two weeks later. You acted to release these people into our society, knowing that they were criminals. You have made it unsafe for a lot of people, and the Australian people are concerned about who is now living amongst them. We've seen the cases of the ones who have now been caught because they have committed crimes. Since you released these people from the detention centres, the parliament passed a law that they should wear ankle bracelets. But isn't it funny that a few of them said, 'We're not wearing them'? One actually absconded; he's gone. Another three refused to put them on. Yet what happened to them? Why weren't they held? Why weren't they detained? The law says that they should wear the ankle bracelets. You put that in there. That was an agreement between the government and the opposition, and I supported it. But no. You released them into society without the ankle bracelets. You're really worried about the Australian people, aren't you?

                            What I don't understand now is the decision by the High Court and your inaction in relation to making sure that society was safe after you released these people. Minister, where does this now leave us? Because of your inaction, we've now got numerous boats coming across to Australia. One has landed on our shores. I know that other boats are being turned back. One boat has landed with 12 people in it claiming refugee status in Australia. Will the High Court ruling now impact those people? How long will you be able to keep them in detention—until we rule whether they are really refugees or economic refugees, whether they are of good character, have jailable sentences or are criminals? What do you intend to do about this? If they are of the same character as the others, what is now going to happen to these illegal boat people who, under your government, are going to cost us billions of dollars? Are you in the same boat—pardon the pun—where you cannot contain them for an unreasonable amount of time?

                             Again, Senator Hanson, the short answer is no. First, our government remains absolutely committed to the policies underpinning Operation Sovereign Borders. Of the small number of people who have attempted to come to Australia by boat since we were elected, each of those people is either awaiting return in Nauru, has been taken to Nauru or has been taken back to their home country. To suggest otherwise is not true. In fact, this government has invested more in Operation Sovereign Borders than we saw under the coalition.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             Your question really goes to whether this High Court decision will apply in some way to people who seek to come to Australia by boat. Again, they're completely different concepts. This High Court decision is about a relatively small group of detainees, people who had already come to Australia but, for one reason or another, were not able to be taken back to their home country in the reasonably foreseeable future. It was about the decision of governments to detain those people indefinitely. That's a particular category of people that is different to anyone who seeks to come to Australia by boat. As I say, this government's policy is that anyone who seeks to come to Australia by boat will be either turned back or taken to Nauru.

You're right; the scheme that's being proposed is limited to those who have been convicted of a serious violent or sexual offence and pose an unacceptable risk of harm to the community by committing such a crime again. An assessment of the risk that an individual poses under this regime is based on expert evidence from relevant officials such as psychologists and psychiatrists with experience dealing with serious sex and violent offenders.

                               There is a significant and well-developed body of research that has guided the development of assessment tools relating to violent and sexual conduct which have been utilised in similar regimes by the states and other countries. It's the intention of the Commonwealth to work with jurisdictions on the implementation of the proposed regime, including by identifying appropriate risk assessment tools. There are a number of state and territory regimes for the preventive detention of violent and sexual offenders, as well as a number of international examples. That's why the Commonwealth will work with states and territories and international partners to understand their experiences using risk assessment tools and expert evidence. There are existing tools for violent and sexual offenders which can be used to guide an expert assessment of their probability of reoffending and to determine what type of intervention approach would be most appropriate.

                                Is it seriously the case that you're rushing through this legislation and you're not able to identify what risk assessment tools you're going to be using for the purposes of bringing—no doubt, in the days that follow the legislation passing—applications to the courts for community safety orders? Having gone through this charade of rushing everything through, are you suggesting that, while it's still warm on the photocopier, you're then going to engage in some form of consultation process with the states and foreign jurisdictions to find out which risk assessment instrument you're going to use, or is the truth of the matter that you're going to be using the

                                 Senator Shoebridge, I do reject your characterisation of what we're doing here. I know the Greens opposed the legislation that we initially introduced and passed here last time we sat. I made the point that, in opposing that legislation, the Greens seemed not to be concerned with community safety. I would have thought that the fact that we have now seen three of these individuals be either arrested or charged with new offences would have underlined the importance of passing this legislation as quickly as possible to keep the community safe. I don't know what other evidence the Greens party requires that would demonstrate the urgent need to introduce this legislation. Whether assessment tools have been finalised or whether they are days away from being finalised, that shouldn't get in the way of this parliament putting in place a legislative regime that is designed to keep the Australian community safe, especially since we are approaching the end of the parliamentary year. In this government's view, there is no time to waste, and that's why we've been keen to get this legislation passed as quickly as possible. But, if the Greens party want to see a situation go on where we don't have a preventive detention regime or community safety orders regime in place and if they're content to see more reoffending by these individuals, then that's something you're going to have to justify to the Australian community.

                                 But your question relates specifically to the

                                 -2R tool. Just before I come to that, there are tools that are used by states and territories overseas such as Static 99 and
                                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARMS" rel="nofollow">

                                 , and they have been proven to be valid and reliable in supporting professional assessments of reoffending potential. There's significantly more data in relation to violent and sexual offenders, compared with terrorist offenders, and that has supported the further development of these tools. In relation to the VERA-2R tool that you've asked about, as I'm sure you are aware, Senator Shoebridge, that is a structured professional judgement tool used in law enforcement, correctional and intervention program contexts in Australia and internationally to assess the likelihood of a person's risk of engaging in violent extremism. It's one of the tools that have been used and relied on by experts to assess individuals for division 105A proceedings under the existing high-risk terrorist offenders regime.

                                <p>
                                 But VERA-2R is a tool adapted to assessing violent extremism and, whilst relevant in respect of terrorist related violence, it is not adapted to assessing the risk of the offender committing a serious violent or sexual offence. I think that you can read into that that it's not the intention to use that tool for this regime, given that tool is specifically designed for the assessment of risk of committing terrorist related violence. But, as I say, the Commonwealth will review all available tools and identify which are appropriate for use to support the community safety order regime. I really would have thought that recent days would have made the Greens party reconsider its position in saying that we don't need to get moving on this legislation.

                                   I respectfully disagree with Mr Donaldson's assessment of this. He's obviously entitled to his view, but this government does believe that the regime that we're putting in place is necessary to protect the Australian public, just as we supported the implementation of a high-risk terrorist offender preventive detention regime. Community safety orders are designed to ensure the protection of the community from a small category of noncitizens—that's what it's being used for in this legislation—and that is a category of people who have been convicted of a serious violent or sexual offence. Similar regimes exist in the states and territories. The scheme is targeted at individuals who pose an unacceptable risk of harming the community by committing a serious violent or sexual offence and who are noncitizens in respect of whom there is no real prospect of their removal from Australia becoming practicable in the reasonably foreseeable future.

                                    In the final moments, I just want to take the minister back to the answer that he gave Senator Hanson, because it's worth digging into what the minister said in response to her questions about the need to release the detainees. On 8 November, the High Court issued a writ of habeas corpus in NZYQ, and we've never disputed that you needed to comply with that order. That's clear. Of course you did. And, of course, the principles laid down by the High Court in the NZYQ case will apply more broadly. That is the nature of High Court reasons.

                                    But the thing that the government is trying to hide is that it is dependent on a government assessment. I would put to you that the misleading part of the comment that you gave to Senator Hanson is this: the decision to release, in each case, is a government decision. Let's just assume for a minute—and I can't say that this is the case—that each of the 147 detainees was required to be released. If that were true, it should have involved 147 decisions, each of which involved the careful application of the principles laid down by the High Court over 74 paragraphs. It should have involved the facts, the history of the matter and the prospects of removal, in light of the principles articulated by the seven justices of the court. But the only thing we can say for sure is that in the vast majority of cases that didn't happen. We know that, because at the time the government released the vast majority of detainees it did not have the court's reasons. The Attorney-General can make all the statements that he wants and then table them in the Senate, saying, 'Oh dear, the High Court made me do it,' because that is literally what we have been hearing from the government day after day, excuse after excuse after excuse—the Attorney-General: 'It isn't my fault;' the Prime Minister: 'It isn't my fault.' Meanwhile, the Australian people will be living with paedophiles, murderers, rapists and a contract killer who have no right to remain in Australia. That is a fact. And they were released because the Albanese Labor government—the Prime Minister himself, Minister Giles and Minister O'Neil—bungled the case in the High Court and then panicked and botched the response. The record should be crystal clear that this is a debacle of your own making. The question before we finish is: what is the status of the 340 additional individuals who were referenced in the High Court hearing?

                                     ():  Again, I am really surprised that the shadow Attorney-General, someone who aspires to be the Attorney-General of this country—the first law officer of this country—and, indeed, who has already been the Attorney-General continues to make an argument that the Australian government should not comply with a High Court ruling. It's an extraordinary proposition that Senator Cash has been advancing over the last few days. I can understand it, given that Senator Cash served in a government that delivered us robodebt, an illegal system. We know that Senator Cash has a history of not personally cooperating with law enforcement when it comes to police investigations. A deputy commissioner of the

                                     I know Senator Cash is defensive about that, but it's there for all to see. Senator Cash and the coalition have never followed the rule of law. I notice that a former Attorney-General, Mr Brandis, recently had something to say about the need for governments to follow the rule of law. Sadly, it would seem that Mr Brandis's view is not upheld within the current coalition.

                                     Mr Dreyfus, an Attorney-General who does believe in complying with the law, issued a statement today. I might just read from it so as to clarify this situation once and for all. Mr Dreyfus said:

                                     The High Court has held that, if a non-citizen has been refused permission to remain in Australia, and there is no real prospect of removing them from Australia in the reasonably foreseeable future, the non-citizen cannot lawfully be held in immigration detention …

                                     undertakes expert assessment of whether a person is an "NZYQ-affected person". If and when it is clear that a person in immigration detention is an NZYQ-affected person, the Department must immediately take steps to secure the person's release from detention. There is no legal basis on which the Government can delay releasing the person until, for example, a court orders the person's release.

                                     Moreover, whether a person is required to be released turns solely on whether they fall within the limit identified by the High Court's order in NZYQ—and not, for example, on their personal circumstances including any criminal history they may have.

                                    <p class="italic">
                                     It is a fundamental principle of our system of law that the government cannot deprive a person of their liberty without positive authority conferred by law. Following the High Court's decision in NZYQ, there is no power to detain the affected non-citizens under the Migration Act. There is no power for a minister to direct an officer to detain the affected non-citizens.

                                     For these reasons, any delay in releasing an NZYQ-affected person could expose the Commonwealth and individual officers to liability for (among other things) false imprisonment. Any officer who continues to detain a person who they know is an NZYQ-affected person may also be acting in breach of the

                                     So every time Senator Cash and her colleagues continue mounting this argument that the government was not required to release the people that we have released, what she and the coalition are effectively saying is that the Australian government should continue detaining people that we have no legal right to detain.

                                     The High Court has made the law clear and governments, I would have thought, should follow the direction of the High Court. I think it is slightly concerning that the opposition are suggesting that the kind of government they would operate would be one that would ignore the High Court and would detain individuals without any legal power to do so. That is a very worrying suggestion, and I would urge Senator Cash to reconsider that position.

                                     While I'm on my feet, I might just point out that Senator Cash, Mr Dutton and their colleagues have made a lot of hay over the last few weeks about the individuals we are talking about. You would think that their record in government around immigration detention has been without blemish and that they never exposed the Australian public to any risk. Well might I remind the opposition that their record was somewhat different to how they might like to remember it. The

                                     So even in 2018, five years into the coalition government, there had been more than 80 escapes from immigration detention centres. So for people who want to come in here and be holier than thou about saying that their record was blemish free and they never exposed the Australian public to any risk, well, the facts don't actually back that up.

                                     . In 2014, in the early period of the coalition government, when Mr Morrison was still the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, it was reported that 'an underworld figure capable of extreme violence was on the run after escaping from the Victorian detention centre he was being held in as he awaited deportation from the country. The Minister for Immigration and Border Protection,

So let's not pretend that the detention regime that was overseen by Dutton, Mr Morrison, Senator Cash, all of the coalition, was some perfect system that never exposed Australians to risk. Those are just three examples where we saw escapes—in some cases, we saw mass escapes—from immigration detention under the

I think we should all recognise the kind of wild claims that have being made over the last few weeks by the coalition as base politics, because we know the thing they are best at is playing politics, dividing the Australian community, injecting fear into the Australian community rather than working constructively to keep the Australian community safe.

                                      Minister, constituents lack confidence in Labor when it comes to security, especially after the last few weeks. So I'm wondering whether or not you will be supporting my amendment to do a simple review of the legislation, especially the amendments. If not, what is the problem?

                                      I remind the Senate that last week's highly significant Water Amendment (Restoring Our Rivers) Bill 2023 saw 31 amendments from the government to its own legislation in the

                                      plus 20 amendments in the Senate. There was a total of 51 government amendments to its own bill, and those from the crossbenches and the Liberals brought them to 69. Minister Burke has been falsely creating the dishonest label 'closing loopholes' to hide the Hunter mining and energy union's complicity in aiding some labour hire firms in Australia's largest-ever wage theft worth billions of dollars. We're told that the Greens oppose the Nature Repair Market Bill 2023. They said so themselves just last week. Yet the Greens now support it because Labor has apparently agreed to allow the Greens to move amendments to the

The government has a very shoddy reputation and is lacking credibility for its legislation that's been rushed and bullied and bulldozed into this place from the start of its term. So, Minister, I ask whether or not you'll be supporting our amendment for a simple review of the legislation.

                                           Thanks Senator Roberts. No, we won't be supporting the amendment putting forward a review. As I made it clear earlier in this debate, we are modelling this regime on the existing high-risk terrorist offenders regime. So we have some confidence in its ability to work, given it's been based on a regime that already exists. In addition—I don't know if you were here, Senator Roberts, when I mentioned this before—one of the amendments that we've tabled, clause 395.49, requires the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and

                                           to deliver an annual report about the operation of this regime. That is intended to give a level of transparency going forward to how this regime is operating, and we think it is an adequate measure to ensure that there is transparency in the system.

                                               Absolutely. Let's just be clear that, despite the rhetoric coming out again from the minister's mouth, we have never disputed that the government needed to comply with the order of the High Court. That is a fact. We have never disputed that. Of course, you did. The issue we have is in relation to the other 147 detainees who have now been released. The government has refused to answer whether or not that involved 147 separate decisions and whether or not each of those cases involved the careful application of principles laid down by the court over 74 paragraphs. They have refused to tell us whether or not the assessments involved the facts, the history of the matter and the prospects of removal in light of the principles articulated by the seven justices of the court. One can only assume, therefore, that in the majority of cases this did not happen. We know that. Why do we know that? Because you did not have the principles articulated by the seven justices of the High Court when you released the vast majority of the detainees. The Albanese government did not have the court's reasons. So what we would like to see you do, as I've said, in relation to each of the 147 hardcore criminals—rapists, pedophiles, murderers and a contract killer—that you have released into the community, is provide the Australian people with a complete analysis of the assessment that was undertaken. I won't hold my breath.
