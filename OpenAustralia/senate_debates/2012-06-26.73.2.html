Appropriation legislation and subsection 44(1) of the FMA Act are not sufficient. Many existing programs, without clear legislative authority, are in real peril. The FFLA Bill seeks to ensure that the status quo can be maintained and that recipients of Commonwealth funding will not be detrimentally affected.
