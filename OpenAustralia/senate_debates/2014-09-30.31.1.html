        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Senator Cash. Minister, could you please inform the chamber as to when the minister was first made aware of allegations that asylum seekers are being forced to trade sexual favours in exchange for access to amenities, including showers, inside the Nauru detention centre? And when was the minister made aware of cases of sexual assault and child abuse inside the centre?

         In relation to Senator Hanson-Young's question and the minister becoming aware, I will speak with the minister. In terms of what are allegations that Senator Hanson-Young has raised, I understand that the allegations that have been raised have been referred to the Department of Immigration and Border Protection for investigation. This government, as with any government, takes allegations of this nature very seriously. As I stated, they have been referred to the Department of Immigration and Border Protection for investigation, but at this stage they are allegations.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for her answer. Does the minister have any information to update the Senate as to when that investigation is due to report or how long that investigation will take?

           I would need to take that question on notice. At this stage, my understanding is that the allegations have been referred to the Department of Immigration and Border Protection for investigation.

             I will confirm for the Senate that, in relation to the situation with Cambodia, if a refugee wants to go to Cambodia they will elect to go voluntarily. The memorandum of understanding is only in relation to those who elect to go there voluntarily. If Senator Hanson-Young is in any way suggesting that people will be forced to go there, that is completely, totally and utterly incorrect. What Senator Hanson-Young fails to recognise and what those on the other side fail to recognise is that this is what a regional solution looks likeâ€”a settlement in a country other than Australia, within the region. Those on the other side talked about a regional solution. It is we on this side who are implementing a regional solution.
