        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Evans. How does the government expect the

         As Senator Payne I am sure would acknowledge, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
          COAG
         </a>
         process under this government has been highly active and has a broad agenda of work that seeks to build better relations between various levels of government. We are the first government to take local government seriously and we try to build them into that work as well—feedback you would have got if you had spoken to any of the local government representatives who were in Canberra last week. This government does have a large agenda of work for the states through the COAG processes, be it health, education or a whole range of other services. Clearly, the states are required as part of that process to provide information to the Commonwealth to assist it in those negotiations and that work. The senator seems to be making some suggestion that some of the information that the states are providing is dated. I am not aware of those claims, if that is the claim she is making. The states are responsible for bringing to the table up-to-date information on their programs and how they are administering those and the impacts of those programs that inform debate. If she has a particular concern about a particular piece of information or a concern about whether there is up-to-date data on a particular subject, I am happy to take that up with the Prime Minister on notice and see if I can assist her.

          I have a supplementary question,

           Mr President
          </a>
          . My particular concerns are expressed as health, Indigenous affairs, disability services and housing affordability, so let us start there. Secondly, why does the federal government not require the states and territories to provide up-to-date information to the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
           COAG

           I am trying to be helpful to the senator, but I am not quite sure what her accusation is or what point she is trying to drive at. She seeks to say that they are not providing up-to-date information. She provides no evidence of that and does not then seek information from me about those matters. As I indicated, if the senator has a particular concern that she wants to draw my attention to, I am happy to get that. But a general concern that she thinks the information may be old—I am sure there is something specific behind this—

            , I rise on a point of order. My question was very specific to the minister and he is not making any real effort to answer. My question was in relation to the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
             COAG

            Reform Council’s work in health, Indigenous affairs, disability services and housing affordability, for the second time, and the requirements that have been placed upon the states and territories to provide up-to-date information in that regard.

             I believe the minister is answering the question. The minister has 16 seconds remaining. The minister is not necessarily going to answer in the form that you like and I cannot instruct the minister to answer a question in a particular way.

              As I said, I am trying to be helpful, but listing four broad areas including health and Indigenous affairs and saying all the information is old does not really take us anywhere, and is not something I am able to respond to. If she has a particular concern, I am happy to see what information I can get for her.

                meetings will be scheduled in accordance with normal practice by the Commonwealth and state governments to pursue those agendas. I am not sure whether mining taxes will be on the agenda. I suspect not, although I am sure they will be keen to hear from Mr Barnett, the

So, yes, we might want to have a chat about that because he has embarrassed Mr Abbott by saying that he thinks mining companies ought to pay $300 million only in Western Australia in increased royalties—his big new tax on mining companies.

                  I think we will be interested in having a discussion with Mr Barnett about his great, big new tax on mining, his increase in mining royalties and why he thinks mining companies can pay more, and perhaps he might have some advice for the opposition on these matters.
