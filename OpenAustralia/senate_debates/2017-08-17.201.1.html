        On Monday, following the Deputy Prime Minister's statement regarding his citizenship, I sought advice of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        Home Office on my citizenship status. By Monday evening, I was advised that a caseworker at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Home_Office" rel="nofollow">
         UK Home Office
        </a>
        was of the view that, on the basis of the limited facts that I had provided, I was a British citizen by descent through my Scottish-born father. I was not provided with any further information to support that view at that time.
       </p>
       <p>
        My mother was born in Australia and was an Australian citizen. My father was born in Scotland in 1927. I was born in Sydney in 1965. My parents divorced when I was eight and my mother raised me. I had very little contact with my father throughout his life, and he died nine years ago. My mother died five years ago. Growing up, my parents always told me that I was not a dual citizen. My understanding since early childhood was that in order to be a dual British citizen I would need to apply for it. Indeed, an internet search reveals a host of websites which say having a Scottish-born father allows one to apply for citizenship but mention nothing of automatic citizenship by descent.
       </p>
       <p>
        I advised the government and the government sought legal advice from the United Kingdom, which I understand was received today and was considered by the government's committee of cabinet within the last hour. The government also sought advice from the Australian Solicitor-General.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have just met with the Prime Minister and am taking this opportunity to make the Senate aware at the earliest possible opportunity of the position. I understand that the Attorney-General will provide further information to the chamber, but I can advise honourable senators that, on the basis of the Solicitor-General's advice, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PM" rel="nofollow">

        has indicated to me that he sees no reason for me to stand aside from my portfolio responsibilities. I will also continue as Deputy Leader of the National Party. When the Senate meets on 4 September, the government will move a motion to refer the matter to the High Court, sitting as the
