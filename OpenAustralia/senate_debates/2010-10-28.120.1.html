        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation, Senator Sherry. I refer the minister to the Labor Party’s pre-election commitment to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … request the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        to design a process for the selection and ongoing review of the superannuation funds to be included in modern awards or enterprise agreements as default funds.
       </p>
       <p>
        Given that, in his otherwise comprehensive statement on superannuation made in parliament earlier this week, Minister Shorten faithfully regurgitated all other superannuation election promises developed by his predecessor—except for this one—has this unequivocal pre-election commitment become Labor’s latest broken promise?

         Thank you for the question on superannuation. It is always good to get a question on superannuation, albeit in my representational capacity on this occasion. The senator has asked about Minister Shorten’s speech earlier in the week in the House of Representatives, and of course the senator has referred to a range of commitments that this Labor government has given, and has long given, in respect of superannuation.

           I think, if you look at the question, the senator has referred to the statement by Mr Shorten and the range of initiatives that this Labor government has proudly announced in respect of superannuation. This is the government of superannuation, as we know, looking back at our record over 20 years.

             I would not call the superannuation guarantee and $1.2 trillion in saving a failure. I would not call the fact that the Labor government has increased the retirement savings of all Australians a failure.

               There is no point of order, but I do draw to the attention of the chamber the fact that, during the response to the question, there was an interjection by you with another question, which the minister responded to. That makes it difficult for me. If there is a question that you would like answered and you stick to that one question, it gives me a chance to rule. I did think that the minister, in fairness to him, was coming to the answer. Minister, you have got 46 seconds remaining. I draw your attention to the question and you have heard the ruling on the point of order.

                  again, looks at his question, he will see that he referred to Mr Shorten’s speech. Of course, the key aspects of that speech referred to the Labor government’s intention to increase the superannuation guarantee from nine to 12 per cent, which will benefit 8.4 million Australians—and which we know the Liberal Party opposite will oppose, like they have always opposed superannuation in this country—

                          I think I was attempting to directly respond to the senator’s question about default funds. As I was saying, I do recall reference in the completed Cooper review, which examined the operation structure of our superannuation system—and a very fine report I might say in passing—to the issue of default funds. I recall an examination of the current parameters for establishing default funds, which, as Senator Cormann correctly—at least on this occasion—observed are established, primarily, not exclusively, through the industrial award system—
