         I thank Senator Polley for the question and also acknowledge her long advocacy for housing and housing support for people who are doing it tough in Tasmania. The Albanese government wants every Australian to have the security of having a roof over their head, and we know that too many Australians are being hit by growing rents and that there are those struggling to buy a home. And, sadly, there are far too many Australians who are facing homelessness.
        </p>
        <p>
         Part of this situation was of course brought about by the decade of inaction and lack of leadership we had from those opposite when they were in power. But we were elected with a plan to clean up the mess that was left behind and deal with some of the country's housing challenges where we can. Fundamental to our plan is increasing the supply of new housing, and the $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund will be the largest boost to social and affordable housing in a decade. The homes that will be delivered through the fund over the first five years are one part of our ambitious housing agenda, which also includes broadening the National Housing Infrastructure Facility, the Housing Accord, the $1.6 billion per annum National Housing and Homelessness Agreement, the Interim National Housing Supply and Affordability Council, and a new National Housing and Homelessness Plan. We'll also implement the Help to Buy Scheme and the Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee.
        </p>
        <p>
         Again, it is something that will come to this chamber as part of this fortnight, and we are hoping we can have the support of the whole chamber in making sure we are supporting the injection of resources and capacity into the social and affordable housing sector. It's important for women fleeing domestic violence. It's important for single women who are at risk of homelessness. It's important for veterans who are facing homelessness. I think this is a bill that we need to pass through the Senate, hopefully with the support of everybody.

            enator GALLAGHER (â€”) (): I thank Senator Polley for the supplementary question. We know that too many people are paying the price for a former government that didn't believe that the Commonwealth had a role in addressing the housing needs of all Australians. However, in the Senate last week housing experts working at the coalface of Australia's housing challenges gave their view of the Housing Australia Future Fund. National Shelter called it 'the most critical housing legislation to be brought forward in the last 10 years'. The City Futures institute said it's a 'timely reassertion of national leadership on housing'. And PowerHousing described it as a 'transformative reform that will enable the housing needs of more Australians to be met'.
           </p>
           <p>
            There was near-unanimous support for the bills by representatives and stakeholders of this sector and acknowledgement that any delay in their passage would greatly impact those Australians who most need the housing it would provide. I urge those senators in this place who are considering their position on this bill to listen to the views of those who work in the sector about what needs to be done.

               I thank Senator Polley for the second supplementary question. After no Commonwealth leadership for the last decade, we have taken substantial steps in the last 10 months since forming government to turn the tide. When asked whether the Senate should act more quickly to support our government's package, the Community Housing Industry Association declared that it was 'absolutely urgent'. The Housing Industry Association said, 'We have to put something in place right now,' and the Property Council said, 'The quicker all of these mechanisms are up and running the better.' Every day we hear from stakeholders about the need in the sector and the importance of the passage of these housing reforms to ensure that we are getting resources into the sector. Again, I urge those opposite, who say no to everythingâ€”they say no to wage rises; they say no to industrial relations reform; they said no to renewable energy; they said no to help with power bills; they say no to the safeguard mechanism; they say no to the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NRF" rel="nofollow">
                NRF
               </a>
               â€”not to say no to the Housing Australia Future Fund.
