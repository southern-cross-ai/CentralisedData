        , who I hadn't seen for over two years. It was a year of deep loss, as well, as my beloved cousin, Imran; my brilliant teacher, my friend and mentor, Dr Ronnie Harding; and my bestest longboy, Cosmo, all passed away, leaving a big hole in my life.

       <p>
        In the political world, there was upheaval too—some good, some bad. In Australia, we got rid of the toxic Morrison government, and let's not forget the 'greenslide'. In Iran, we are seeing a massive, women led revolution for justice. However, in the US there was the devastating overturning of Roe v Wade, a big step backwards for women's rights.

        I'll be ready to greet 2023, reenergised to fight for climate action, for gender equity and for racial justice. From the bottom of my heart, thank you to all of you who work here and support the work we do, including the clerks, the cleaners, the chamber attendants, the committee staff.
