        My question is to Senator Abetz, the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage. It regards the proposed dam that the Queensland government wishes to construct on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_River" rel="nofollow">
         Mary River
        </a>
        , south of Gympie. The Mary River, for the minister’s information, is one of the last natural habitats of the extremely rare lungfish and Mary River cod. The dam would also have downstream effects on the quality of water into the Great Sandy Straits and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraser_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Fraser Island
        </a>
        world heritage area. As the dam would require the resumption of around 900 rural properties, covering 7½ thousand hectares, and put at risk 10 per cent of the local dairy industry, can the minister assure the people of Queensland that the federal environment minister will meet his responsibility under federal law to ensure that threatened species and all world heritage values are protected? Will the federal environment minister insist that there is a thorough and comprehensive environmental impact assessment, rather than any fast-tracked rush job, where a state government has already indicated its determination to build the dam regardless of the impact?

         I was made well aware of this issue some 10 minutes ago, courtesy of Senator Bartlett, and I thank him for that. I can assure him that the Minister for the Environment and Heritage will live up to his responsibilities and he will apply his usual forensic and robust skills in determining whether or not the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC" rel="nofollow">
          EPBC

         Act is impacted on in any way by the proposal. As I understand it, this matter has not been put before the Australian government as yet. I understand that the proponents of the project will need to do so in due course. When that occurs, I have no doubt that the minister will live up to his responsibilities as requested by Senator Bartlett.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I ask the minister to seek information and report back to the Senate about whether the federal government will insist on the Queensland state government meeting its obligations under the national water strategy and agreement and to indicate that it will not permit any breaches in regard to that if the state government insists on going ahead with such a dam.

           I have been requested to seek further information. I will do that and pass on that request to the minister.
