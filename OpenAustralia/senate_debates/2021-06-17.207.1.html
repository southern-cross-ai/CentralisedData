        My question is to the Minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme, Senator Reynolds. In defending her heartless failure to pick up the phone and personally apologise to the family of Liam Danher, after 78 days in the portfolio, the minister asserted, 'If my Chief of Staff does something on my behalf, then I consider that is the case.' Why won't the minister just pick up the phone and apologise to Liam's family?

         I thank the senator for that question. In all of these circumstances—and, tragically, there is more than one case—my first and foremost consideration is to respect the wishes of the family. As I have previously advised this chamber, my office has contacted Mr Danher's family—his father, in fact—and offered a call or a meeting with me. It was agreed it would be best that this meeting take place once more information is available, and when that has occurred. The

         chief legal counsel is reviewing Liam Danher's case and will provide a report on the detail and any learnings that the NDIA can take from this case. The outcomes of that will be communicated to the family, prior to any public comment on this case.

            With respect, I've allowed you to remind the minister of the question. The minister is entitled to answer the question in the terms that she sees fit. She is talking about this particularly unfortunate event, and, in that sense, she is directly relevant and answering the question as she deems appropriate. Senator Reynolds.

That is exactly what I'm doing in relation to this case and also to other cases that have come to my attention.
