        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. I refer to General Motors Holden's submission to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Productivity Commission
        </a>
        , which says:

       <p class="italic">
        Without public assistance, Holden's local manufacturing cannot compete globally.
       </p>
       <p>
        Does the government accept that support is necessary to help sustain the auto industry and the thousands of people it employs in Australia?

         I can confirm to the

We have already put in place a plan that would be of great assistance to the auto sector and who stands in the way of delivering that assistance to the automotive sector? The Australian Labor Party is playing sabotage with the will of the Australian people, as expressed on 7 September. We know and the Australian people know that—

             The Australian people know that this nation needs a plan to reboot the Australian economy. We delivered that plan and the Australian people endorsed it on 7 September 2013. Regrettably, those on the other side are not willing to accept the result and are therefore using or abusing the excess numbers they currently enjoy in this place to sabotage our policies.

                The only person I know who used the expression 'full of it' was Senator Conroy describing former Prime Minister Rudd. Here we go. The Leader of the Opposition in this place is trying to quote an anonymous source and she tells us we should somehow take it seriously. I say to the Leader of the Opposition that if she wants to come into this place she should come up with some credible assertion and not just, 'We believe he said, she said to somebody,' and it happens to be printed in the media. As far as this government is concerned, the

                  Here we have a genuinely serious situation for members of the automotive manufacturing sector in this country and all that Senator Wong can engage in is the game of politics, talking about alleged destructive background briefing. Senator Wong and those on the other side would know about destructive background briefing. They would recognise it if they ever saw it because that is exactly what they did to Mr Rudd and then to Ms Gillard, and of course since the election against Mr Rudd as well. From that shambolic government we inherited a mess. From that shambolic government we have said that we will take responsibility for cleaning up that mess.

                        There is no point of order. I cannot tell a minister how to answer or respond to a question. It would assist question time if people did not interject on the answers and then invite a response at that time as well. You have six seconds remaining, Minister.
