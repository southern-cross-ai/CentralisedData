        I rise this evening to talk about progress on major infrastructure projects in my duty electorate of Swan. I have been inspired to take this action following a similar discussion which occurred in the other place recently. I have been advised the member for Swan claimed credit for ensuring the federal government delivered on a promise to upgrade
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Eastern_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Great Eastern Highway
        </a>
        . I was somewhat taken aback by this suggestion. My surprise sprang from my intimate knowledge of the progress of this project. It has a history that goes back some time—in fact, a little while longer than the current member's interest.
       </p>
       <p>
        Great Eastern Highway, for those not familiar with this part of the world, is a road which starts near the entrance to Perth city and the famous Causeway Bridge. It meanders through the eastern suburbs of Rivervale, Ascot, Belmont, Cloverdale and Redcliffe to Perth airport. Past this point it continues through Guildford and Midland to suburbs and, later, towns in the hills district. As part of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AusLink" rel="nofollow">
         AusLink
        </a>
        national network, it will take you to the eastern states of Australia. It is an important road, as it links the airport to the city, and for that reason it is a busy road.
       </p>
       <p>
        The proposal was to upgrade a stretch of the highway from Kooyong Road to the airport. This section has only four lanes but currently services 55,000 vehicles per day. Traffic volume is forecast to increase to 66,500 vehicles per day by 2016 and is projected to reach 79,000 vehicles per day by 2031. My former colleague
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Wilkie" rel="nofollow">
         Kim Wilkie
        </a>
        lobbied the Howard government for many years to fund upgrades to this part of the highway; however, it must be said that there was not much interest. On 18 November 2006 he received a response from Howard government minister Mr Jim Lloyd, which said in part:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … this section of highway is not part of the AusLink National Network, and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        n Government is responsible for its funding …
       </p>
       <p>
        He went on to say:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … I can see no particular virtue in the inclusion of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEH" rel="nofollow">
         GEH
        </a>
        in the Perth Urban Corridor Strategy …
       </p>
       <p>
        In stark contrast, the Rudd government in 2007 committed $180 million to upgrade that part of the highway. Funding for the planning phase was committed by the Carpenter government in 2008. Since that time, the project has been expanded and the estimated cost is now some $350 million. As a result, the current government has increased the Commonwealth's contribution to $280 million. Work has begun and is scheduled for completion in late 2013. Contrary to the views of others, there was never any danger that we would fail to honour our commitment. We accepted that this major works project was necessary to increase the capacity, the safety and the efficiency of one of the city's principal transport routes.
       </p>
       <p>
        The federal government has also made a commitment to the Gateway WA project. This project involves upgrades to the road network around Perth airport. In essence, the project includes a freeway-to-freeway interchange at the intersection of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leach_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Leach Highway
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonkin_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Tonkin Highway
        </a>
        . It will also increase freeway capacity to six lanes. The estimated cost of this project is $600 million. The federal government's contribution will be $480 million. It is a project that has been identified by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australian
        </a>
        government as a national infrastructure priority. I agree.
       </p>
       <p>
        As all would be aware, Western Australia is experiencing a massive expansion in the resources industry. That means more fly-in fly-out workers using what is fast becoming the busiest airport in Australia. The proposed consolidation of the domestic and international airport terminals by 2017-18 is expected to double passenger and freight movements by 2030.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gateway" rel="nofollow">
         The Gateway
        </a>
        project is critical to ensuring that we can meet this demand. If the last resources boom showed us anything, it is that funding of key infrastructure projects cannot be put off if we are to maximise its benefits.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally I would like to talk about the rollout of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network" rel="nofollow">
         National Broadband Network
        </a>
        , the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        . Over the years I have received a number of complaints from local residents about broadband black spots. The complaints have come from residents in parts of Kewdale, Cloverdale and areas around Ferndale and Langford. All of these suburbs are within five to 10 kilometres of the central business district. They are not regional areas; they are not rural areas. So why are they unable to access broadband services?
       </p>
       <p>
        The answer is blindingly obvious. Telstra, in being allowed to be run as a vertically integrated monopoly, had no incentive to maintain or develop new infrastructure. The NBN will fix that by separating the wholesale from the retail. It will create a level playing field between service providers. Retail prices charged to consumers will be determined by the retail service providers. That, of course, will stimulate competition. The fibre network will mean more choice, greater competition and better value services. Along with faster and cheaper broadband for families and local businesses, it will also provide equity in access. It is true to say that the NBN will change the way we live.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am very pleased that last year the government announced that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Victoria Park
        </a>
        would be the second phase rollout of the NBN. Initially, 3,000 homes and businesses will be connected to the network. From there, the network will spread through Telstra's copper network of ducts, pits and exchanges. The agreement with Telstra will enable NBN Co. to deliver next generation super broadband services with less disruption to residents and reduced rollout costs.
       </p>
       <p>
        These projects are part of the Gillard government's commitment to infrastructure projects in Western Australia. In all, Western Australia will receive record funding of $920 million for transport infrastructure alone. As well as upgrades to the Great Eastern Highway and the Gateway WA project, that funding will enable upgrades to road and rail into Port Esperance, upgrades to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Northern_Highway" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , an access road for Bunbury Port and the Northbridge rail link project through Perth's CBD.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the Swan electorate, the federal government's commitment to major infrastructure projects is welcomed by residents, local businesses, transport companies and large-scale commercial enterprises, local and state government representatives and, I think it would be fair to say, the member for Swan.
