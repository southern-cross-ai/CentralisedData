        BIOSECURITY AMENDMENT (ADVANCED COMPLIANCE MEASURES) BILL 2023
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia's biosecurity system is put to the test every single day.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Through the arrival of travellers and aircraft into Australia, the arrival of cargo and vessels, international mail and parcels, and the unregulated movement of wild animals, the wind and the waves.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Strong biosecurity is essential to protecting over $90 billion worth of agricultural production and more than $5.7 trillion worth of unique, environmental assets.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Strong biosecurity protects our people, our environment, our economy and our lifestyle from the biosecurity threats of today and tomorrow.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Unfortunately, there are still those whose actions put all of this at risk, either accidentally or deliberately.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Earlier this year Operation Avoca identified one of Australia's largest, single detections of biosecurity risk material.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        38 tonnes of risk material was detected by our dedicated, biosecurity officers. That's seven shipping containers worth of unauthorised meat products, turtles, pigs' heads and smallgoods trying to enter the country.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Material that could have been harbouring foot and mouth disease, African swine fever, white spot syndrome virus or Xylella (
        <i>
         zy-lell-a
        </i>
        )—any of which could devastate our agriculture, fisheries and forestry industries.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As the number of international travellers and the amount of cargo continue to increase, so do the regional and global threats, including
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FMD" rel="nofollow">
         FMD
        </a>
        and hitchhiker pests like khapra beetle.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        During the COVID-19 pandemic, non-compliance with Australia's biosecurity laws could have risked the introduction of new COVID-19 variants into our country.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This could have had devastating impacts or our public health and our vulnerable population.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is high time to re-evaluate the current penalty regime in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosecurity" rel="nofollow">
         Biosecurity
        </a>
        Act in the face of such threats and consequences.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Our biosecurity system is strong, but to keep Australia safe, the laws that underpin the system need to remain fit for purpose.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill" rel="nofollow">
         Bill
        </a>
        strengthens the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosecurity_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Biosecurity Act
        </a>
        to enable targeted intervention, better risk management and more proportionate responses.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill enables a more intelligence and evidence-based approach to biosecurity risks involving international travellers at our border.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In order to properly respond to risks, people must be open and truthful. We must make sure that penalties available under the Biosecurity Act are an effective deterrent to those who would knowingly providing false or misleading information.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        With stronger penalties, in some cases up to $275,000, we better reflect the seriousness of breaches of the Act and provide a more effective deterrent to non-compliance with biosecurity laws.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For lower-level contraventions of the Act, the infringement notice scheme provides an effective method for managing non-compliance.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Last December, we passed legislation to create a new class of infringement for deliberate concealment of non-declared goods.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This infringement of 20 penalty units, or $5,500, is the highest ever and I congratulate biosecurity officers who have already started exercising it.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Whilst this was a big step, the current infringement notice scheme does not cover some provisions that are critical for the management of biosecurity risk.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These new infringement notice provisions in the Bill address the current gap in the ability of biosecurity officers to penalise individuals and businesses whose behaviour is less serious but may still have significant consequences for our biosecurity.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Big or small, all threats can expose Australia to significant biosecurity risk.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These changes in the Bill complement measures in the Albanese Government's 2023-24 Budget to sustainably fund our biosecurity system for the first time.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For years we have seen independent reviews and industry groups call for permanent, dedicated biosecurity funding and greater accountability for how that funding is spent.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Biosecurity is a shared responsibility and so is paying for it.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The sustainable funding model recovers more than ever before from biosecurity risk creators, whether that be importers, international parcels and mail or travellers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The model rebuilds cost recovery to protect taxpayers, increase the contribution from importers and ensure that biosecurity services to industry are efficient and effective.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Our sustainable funding model locks in higher and permanent biosecurity funding, along with a fair system to pay for it.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia's biosecurity system is recognised as among the best in the world.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill and our new sustainable funding model will ensure that we maintain our reputation as a supplier of safe, high-quality produce, while protecting our farmers, our economy and our environment from biosecurity risks into the future.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill makes important improvements to the Australian IP system to help ensure it remains modern and fit for purpose.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A key measure in the Bill improves the protection of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games" rel="nofollow">
         Olympic Games
        </a>
        insignia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill will also modernise, streamline and simplify other aspects of the Australian IP system and provide more certainty to Australian businesses as they protect their great ideas.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The government has consulted on the amendments contained in this Bill with key stakeholders, including the Australian and International Olympic Committees, who support these changes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The
        <i>
         Olympic Insignia Protection Act 1987
        </i>
        was designed to prevent unauthorised actors profiting from the Olympic movement. Under the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Charter" rel="nofollow">
         Olympic Charter
        </a>
        , the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Olympic_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Olympic Committee
        </a>
        is required to take necessary steps to prohibit illegitimate use of Olympic insignia. However, ambush marketing and other unauthorised use of these insignia detract from the branding and reputation of the games. Protecting the Olympic insignia and restricting its use to the Australian and International Olympic Committees helps protect the Olympic movement and ensure the games generate revenue through sponsorships and licencing arrangements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill amends the
        <i>
         Olympic Insi
        </i>
        <i>
         gnia Protection Act 1987
        </i>
        to make clear that only the Australian and International Olympic Committees can register Olympic insignia as trade marks in Australia. The changes align the wording of the Olympic Insignia Protection Act with the
        <i>
         Trade Marks Act 19
        </i>
        <i>
         95
        </i>
        , so they work together to prevent the unauthorised registration of trade mark applications containing Olympic insignia. The amendments will also provide greater legal certainty for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         IP Australia
        </a>
        to reject speculative trade mark applications from applicants other than the Australian or International Olympic Committees. Such applications can be made in an attempt to profit from activities associated with the Brisbane Olympic Games. Trade mark applications made in bad faith are often filed years in advance of an Olympic event, so it is important to act now. These amendments will ensure that the Olympics Insignia Protection Act's objectives are met.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is important to note that this only makes changes to who can protect Olympic insignia, making it clear that is limited to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOC" rel="nofollow">
         AOC
        </a>
        or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOC" rel="nofollow">
         IOC
        </a>
        . It does not change the rules for how these insignia are used, which is to prevent unfair competition in commercial settings.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition, the Bill amends the
        <i>
         Trade Marks Act 1995
        </i>
        , saving businesses time and hassle by simplifying processes, increasing procedural fairness, closing gaps and ensuring that government can engage with customers in a modern and flexible way. The Bill will also make changes to streamline the way users interact with parts of the trade marks system.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill will also streamline the administration of trade mark renewals by aligning the relevant grace period payments to a consistent 6-month duration. Currently, in exceptional circumstances where a trade mark application is still pending after 10 years, the available grace period for paying a renewal fee is up to 10 months after the renewal is due. The amendment changes the grace period for this situation to 6 months, aligning with the grace period for renewal fee payments under normal circumstances. This amendment will provide consistency across all trade mark renewal due dates. This will also ensure that trade mark registrations that are no longer active can be removed in a timely way. This will improve certainty and simplify processes for trade mark owners.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill will also clarify requirements to revoke a trade mark registration to ensure procedural fairness for all trade mark owners. The amendments simplify and clarifies provisions dealing with revocation of the registration of a trade mark, where a component of a notice of opposition to registration of that trade mark has been overlooked.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        After a trade mark is accepted by IP Australia, it can be opposed—for example, by a competitor. This opposition process consists of multiple steps. If one of these steps is overlooked, or if the opponent needs an extension of time to complete one of these steps, the trade mark application might proceed to registration in error.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This amendment ensures that a trade mark registered in error in these circumstances can be revoked and the opposition will resume. This will allow a fair process for both sides. The provisions for revoking registration in those circumstances will by aligned with other current oppositions processes before IP Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill will implement safeguards to protect a trade mark owner who needs an extension of time to provide evidence to help them defend against removal of their trade mark for non-use. Under the Trade Marks Act, third parties can apply for trade mark registrations to be removed if they have not been used.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_marks" rel="nofollow">
         Trade marks
        </a>
        can be defended against these non-use removals, usually by their owners.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If a due date is missed in one of these non-use proceedings, the trade mark may be removed from the Register of Trade Marks. Under the current Act, that removal is irrevocable in some circumstances. So even if an owner is entitled to an extension of time, they cannot defend their registration.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This amendment clarifies provisions to enable restoration of a trade mark registration where an owner missed the deadline to respond to a type of opposition, but is later granted an extension of time to respond. The amendment means an owner can continue to defend their registration if they miss a due date but are eligible for an extension of time. This will give trade mark owners a fair opportunity to present their case.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill will modernise the way crucial information about the status of trade marks is communicated publicly. Currently, the government is required to use an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_Journal" rel="nofollow">
         Official Journal
        </a>
        to communicate trade marks information. However, the world has changed, and IP Australia now publishes this same information on its website and through an online search portal which is easier to access and keep up to date. These amendments will remove the old-fashioned restrictions requiring the printed journal to be maintained and allow the government to communicate such information through up-to-date, user-friendly technology. Benefiting business by providing a single, current source of official trade mark information through a modern online search portal. Moving to format-neutral provisions will reduce duplication and future-proof the administration of the IP system and enable us to deliver trade mark information in an accessible way for users, when and how they want it.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Finally, the Bill makes one minor amendment to the
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patents_Act" rel="nofollow">
          Patents Act
         </a>
         1990
        </i>
        to repeal transitional provisions. These provisions apply to patents granted under the previous Patents Act 1952. The last patent protected under the 1952 Act expired in February 2016, and the six-year statutory limitations period on actions for infringement under that Act expired in February 2022. Therefore, these provisions will cease to serve any purpose and will be redundant. This is good regulatory practice and helps to streamline the patents system.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am pleased to introduce this Bill, which will provide legal certainty ahead of the 2032 Olympics, as well as ensure our IP system is fit for purpose in supporting Australian business to innovate and grow.

        For a long time, ASIC has relied on its exemption and modification powers under the enabling Acts to update the law for changing circumstances.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The amendments will move the operation of the legislative instruments into the primary law to improve the clarity of the law, provide certainty, and make it simpler for regulated entities and consumers to understand their rights and obligations.

        The

       <p class="italic">
        By bringing the anti-avoidance provisions in the Corporations Act into line with those in the National Consumer Credit Protection Act, this amendment will ensure that predatory lenders cannot respond to a product intervention order by engaging in avoidance activity that is not covered by the order but results in similar detriment to consumers.

        Schedule 2 to the Bill delivers the Government's election commitment to remove the education requirements for experienced financial advisers who have 10 years' experience and a clean record, who have passed the financial advisers exam.

        Schedule 2 also addresses technical limitations in the education requirements for new entrants into the financial advice profession and financial advisers who are registered tax agents.

        Together, these amendments address practical implementation issues faced by financial advisers.

       <p class="italic">
        By better recognising the experience of long-serving financial advisers, the Government is providing a pathway for experienced advisers to remain in the industry.

        to facilitate competition in the provision of clearing and settlement services for cash equities traded in Australia, and to ensure that, should competition emerge for these services, it is safe and effective.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These amendments implement recommendations of the Council of Financial

        </a>
        s, which considered issues relating to competition in the clearing and settlement of cash equities in 2012, 2015, and 2017.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To do so, Schedule 3 introduces a rule-making power for ASIC and an arbitration power for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Competition_and_Consumer_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Competition and Consumer Commission
        </a>
        . The rule-making power will allow ASIC to make rules applicable to clearing and settlement facility licensees, their associated entities, and other persons specified by regulations, about their activities, conduct, or governance in relation to clearing and settlement services covered by a Ministerial Determination.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        ASIC will be empowered to make rules to implement the Council of Financial Regulator's policy statements in both a monopoly or a competitive environment. This flexibility will allow ASIC to adjust regulatory settings where a committed competitor for the provision of clearing and settlement services emerges to ensure that competition is safe and effective.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In the interim, ASIC will be able to make rules enforcing the Council of Financial Regulator's regulatory expectations for the monopoly provision of clearing and settlement services.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The arbitration power will allow the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        to arbitrate disputes about the terms and conditions of access to clearing and settlement services subject to a Ministerial Declaration.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government expects this Declaration will only cover certain clearing and settlement services provided under monopoly conditions, or where a provider exerts significant market power. Once competition is effective for those clearing and settlement services, the Government expects that the Ministerial Declaration would be repealed in respect of those competitive services.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Until then, this arbitration regime will provide an important backstop for entities seeking access to clearing and settlement facility infrastructure where good-faith negotiations have broken down.

        Schedule 4 to the Bill makes a number of technical changes to the
        <i>
         Taxation Administration Act 1953
        </i>
        and
        <i>
         Income Tax Assessment Act 1997
        </i>
        to improve the operation of the First Home Super Saver Scheme so that it works better for first home buyers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Currently, the legislation underpinning the First Home Super Saver Scheme is inflexible and can result in a poor user experience with the scheme, including users having their savings for their first home locked away until retirement.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The changes will better enable mistakes made during the First Home Super Saver Scheme release process to be fixed without adverse financial outcomes for users of the scheme.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To do so, Schedule 4 will increase the discretion of the Commissioner of Taxation to amend and revoke applications to have funds released under the First Home Super Saver Scheme, and will allow individuals to do the same, without those individuals being prevented from re-applying in the future.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Importantly, these changes will apply to eligible applications made from 1 July 2018. This helps ensure users of the scheme who have not been paid any of their FHSSS savings due to an error in the application process can access the money they saved to purchase their first home.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Schedule 4 also includes special transitional provisions which extend the flexibility provided by the amendments to eligible users who previously unsuccessfully applied to have savings released under the scheme and have since started holding a relevant interest in real property or land.
