         I thank Senator Smith for his question. The Australian government has publicly stated that we strongly condemn the atrocities committed in Myanmar's Rakhine, Shan and Kachin states, as detailed in the full report of the fact-finding mission on Myanmar that was released yesterday. We are very disturbed by the conclusion that war crimes, crimes against humanity and likely genocide have occurred in Rakhine state. Australia has been a strong supporter of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
          UN
         </a>
         fact-finding mission, which has worked very hard to provide a thorough, credible and independent investigation. I met with Mr Chris Sidoti, the Australian member of the UN fact-finding mission, last week to discuss their findings. I look forward to discussing the next steps with international counterparts during UN leaders' week in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" rel="nofollow">
          New York
         </a>
         next week.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Australian government is considering options in response to the fact-finding mission's report, including the option of targeted sanctions. In line with the mission's recommendations, Australia will support international efforts on accountability and justice in Myanmar. Australian negotiators are working on these initiatives in Geneva at the current session of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights" rel="nofollow">
          Human Rights
         </a>
         Council, of which we are a member. Australia will continue to work with the government of Myanmar, the international community and our counterparts in the region towards a long-term and durable solution to the complex problems in Rakhine state. Myanmar continues to face formidable challenges as it transitions to democracy from five decades of military rule. As a regional partner, Australia will continue to support those efforts to achieve democracy and national peace and reconciliation for the benefit of all people in Myanmar.

               It is an important question, because Australia's response has been focused on the urgent needs of those who are affected by the humanitarian crises in both Myanmar and Bangladesh. We have provided $70 million in humanitarian assistance since September last year. In Bangladesh, that assistance is providing food for over 800,000 people and nutrition supplements for over 139,000 women and children. It's also helping to reinforce shelters, to reunite children with their families and to create safe areas for vulnerable women and children. In Myanmar, our Australian aid has provided food and essential supplies to 150,000 people in

               and health and counselling services for almost 60,000 women and girls, including survivors of sexual and gender based violence. We're working with
