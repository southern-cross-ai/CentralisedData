        I recently had the honour of hosting the Leader of the Opposition, the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Dutton" rel="nofollow">
         Peter Dutton
        </a>
        , in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        . I aimed to show him firsthand the challenges we face, which I'm grateful for, unlike the Prime Minister who's shown no interest in the Northern Territory so far. What the opposition leader learned was how true traditional owners are silenced by unrelated interstate activists who pay other Aboriginal people to pose as traditional owners to push their activist agendas. We listened to 86-year-old senior traditional owner Pompey Raymond and his daughter Rosemary, who, despite the lies that the Greens peddle, have been part of the years of groundwork and consultation for established agreements in the Beetaloo.
       </p>
       <p>
        Labor and the Greens say they respect
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations
        </a>
        , yet they hypocritically ignore traditional owners who don't share their values. These voices are not their priority. Before organisations such as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GetUp" rel="nofollow">
         GetUp
        </a>
        even began their campaign in the Beetaloo, Pompey had already signed off on agreements for nine of the 10 leases for gas extraction in the Beetaloo. Since GetUp have been involved, Pompey and Rosemary have regularly been threatened by activists and fake traditional owners.
       </p>
       <p>
        They shouldn't have to be looking over their shoulders in fear because they want better outcomes for their lot. They shouldn't have to fight for jobs, opportunities and a future for their children and families. They shouldn't have to fight for what people in this chamber take for granted. They want to contribute to lowering the cost of living through supporting Australian energy, but Labor's budget razor gang has slashed these opportunities for ideological priorities, making the future of marginalised Aboriginal Territory children even bleaker, not to mention increasing the cost of living for all Australians. Labor, you must be so proud of yourselves.
