            The Australian people rightly expect the Senate to deal with the urgent legislation before us. The

             ALP
            </a>
            -Greens tactic of stalling, spoiling and outright sabotaging the government's legislative agenda is an abuse, the likes of which this chamber has not previously witnessed. The legislation the government seeks to have passed on behalf of the Australian people is legislation for which the Australian people voted: repeal of the job-destroying and household-budget-blowing carbon tax, a carbon tax that is killing the manufacturing sector of this country and blowing a $550 hole in household budgets. We also seek the repeal of the mining tax, which is stifling investment and jobs growth. With today's announcement that unemployment is at 5.8 per cent, the need to implement the coalition plan to reboot the economy and clean up Labor's mess is more urgent than ever. Vital legislation for which we have a mandate, like for the

             ABCC
            </a>
            and the Registered Organisations Commission, is being deferred to committees that do not even deal with legislation by the ALP-Greens alliance, to dates well into next year, such is their sabotage.

              The carbon tax, which is so bad that Labor promised we would not have one in 2010 and so bad that they said they would abolish it in 2013, is being kept alive by that very same Labor Party's tactics in this chamber. Those opposite know that Mr Rudd and Mr Marles were right—that the right thing to do is to repeal the carbon tax. But they cannot acknowledge the will of the Australian people. For this chamber to break for Christmas without resolving vital legislation, which includes budget savings to staunch the haemorrhaging budget we inherited from Labor—savings that we bravely and honestly put to the Australian people before the election and which the people of Australia voted for. And do you know why they voted for it? Because they knew $732 million would need to be borrowed from overseas which the next generation would need to pay back, with interest. That is why they voted for us. Here we have Labor stifling, stalling and sabotaging our savings measures, some of which they themselves put forward during the last election. The savings measures are vital. The Labor-Greens games in this place are the metaphorical middle-finger salute to the Australian people and to Australian democracy. Let us be perfectly clear—

                I have heard some of the interjections from the other side. I can indicate that we will have a full one hour of question time, and you can ask every question you like in relation to the situation at Holden. But it is vital that this legislation be passed. So let us be very clear: every single measure on which we seek the Senate's concurrence—and, if not concurrence, then at least a vote—was fully and clearly articulated by us well before the election. Indeed, the Greens campaigned against all these measures and their vote collapsed by one third. The Labor Party campaigned against these measures and were defeated, despite the fact that they actually did support some of these measures—including the abolition of the carbon tax. So, bizarrely, the Labor Party that actually supported some of these measures is now using the tactics of spoiling, stalling and sabotaging to ensure that the policies they took to the election will not be passed and carried or determined by this chamber.
               </p>
               <p>
                The Australian people have a right to expect that the very clear policies of a government should be considered and, as a minimum, voted on by this Senate. We say to those opposite: we will sit here until Christmas to have these matters determined because they are so vitally important and so vital for the national interest—issues on which we campaigned and won.

                 This is the extent to which this government does not want to talk about loss of workers' jobs. This is the extent to which this government will go to avoid facing up to the sabotaging of Holden that has occurred under this government. This is question time, ladies and gentlemen of the Senate. This is question time—when the government of the day answers questions from the opposition and from the crossbenchers about important issues. It is a day after thousands of workers and their families in this country faced the extraordinarily sad prospect of not being employed in safe and secure jobs in which they had been employed for years, and what does this government want to do? It wants to pull a stunt in question time so they can change the subject. Well, I tell you what: workers and their families across this country are alive to you. They know what you are doing. They know you do not want to come in here and face the music. They know you do not want to come in here and answer questions such as these. You do not want to come in here and answer questions about the $500 million that you took out of the car industry prior to 2015. You do not want to come in here and answer questions—

                     , I rise on a point of order. My understanding is that question time for an hour follows this debate, so the leader is misleading the parliament.

                         The reality is: this government sought, when it comes to the car industry, to not only take $500 million out between now and 2015 but provide it with nothing other than uncertainty beyond 2015. In this last week we have seen in this parliament this government sabotaging Holden through the leaking of senior economic ministers, followed by the Treasurer of the country goading Holden and daring them to make a decision, and the

                         demanding that they make a decision ahead of your review. As to why you are doing this today, let everyone be clear: this is a stunt to change the subject. We know that if you had been really serious about managing this debate properly, you would have done so. But you did not. You have mismanaged your program. And instead of Senator Abetz reflecting on the way in which he and the government have managed their program, he comes in here instead to undertake a stunt, to try and show, presumably to the Prime Minister's office and other people: 'No, we are really trying to get it through. We really are.' I think the example was when we had one of their own senators, Senator Macdonald, taking up government business time to move an amendment to one of their own committees and using the debating time to have a go at the Prime Minister's office. Do not come in here and tell us that you have managed your program well. We know what has happened in here. You have mismanaged the program—

That is what they do. They want to put in place a guillotine. They want to manage debate so there is not proper debate.

                             I think Senator Abetz's own comments might be useful here. In March 2013 he said:

                             repeat—repeat—and say very, very strongly on behalf of the opposition that we oppose any further adjourning of the Senate, because we believe these issues need to be ventilated, and ventilated fully.

                            <p>
                             He goes on to say:

                              I rise to say that the Greens will not be supporting this motion from Senator Abetz. It has been a stellar performance from Senator Abetz but it is very clear to me that, if the Greens and Labor had suddenly supported this, the blood would have drained out of the faces of the government because they have all got their tickets booked. They are already on planes. They have mentally left this place already, and they would just freak out beyond all measure. We all know that.

I am sure a lot of Australians will be very pleased that big business, the big end of town, has not been let off the hook.

                                    As I was saying, we are saving the government from itself. Senator Abetz spoke about worrying about savings measures. Well, we are interested in revenue measures. We think it is appropriate that people actually pay their way in this country, and the big end of town do not want to pay their way. They cannot wait. They want you to sit here to get rid of the mining tax so they can maximise their fortunes. No doubt

                                    and others are on the phone saying, 'Come on; sit there until you get rid of the mining tax so that we can maximise our profits.' I can tell you,

                                    , there are a lot of people around the country who do not want to see the mining tax go, because they believe that the big end of town should pay their way in this country, and we intend to make sure that they do. In fact, we should be raising the mining tax, not actually getting rid of it. We need to have the revenue. We have got a revenue crisis in this country—and that is what we should be addressing.

                                      are not going to stand by and see this game being played. We know it for what it is. In fact it is a waste of the Senate's time. It is half an hour that you could be spending on the business of the Senate or half an hour bringing on an urgency debate about the big issue of Holden closing down in this country and the future of manufacturing. That would have been a useful thing to do for half an hour of the Senate's time, not half an hour of this fake and false debate, as I said, just covering up for the fact that we know that the ministers' officers are all ready to go and leave here the minute that the Senate finishes. So we will not be supporting this motion. We think they should be talking about the things the country wants to talk about, and that is how we future-proof the nation for these manufacturing industries leaving us.

Let it never be forgotten that the Labor Party tried to deceive the Australian people at the recent election and actually said, 'One of our promises is to repeal the carbon tax.' We have seen the flyer that Senator Louise Pratt distributed in

I think the Australian public would be appalled to learn that it is just too hard for those opposite, the Labor Party and the Greens, to do one more week's work in Canberra before they go on Christmas holidays.

                                           , that this parliament adjourned at the end of June this year, and since we adjourned this is only the 10th day on which the Senate has sat to consider public business. We might ask ourselves: why is that? Because there was a political coup on the other side of the parliament. There was a leadership change that instated a new Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, and then there was a long election campaign and a change of government. If the Labor Party and the Greens get their way, we are going to adjourn today after only 10 days in the second half of 2013, and we will not be back for another nine weeks. Yet it is too hard for the Labor Party to sit.

                                                        I doubt that there has ever been a more clear and more explicit commitment by a party going into an election than that of the coalition before the last poll in promising to repeal the carbon tax. I doubt that there has ever been an election commitment that has been more oft repeated by an Australian political party than the coalition's commitment to repeal the carbon tax. What we have seen from those opposite, for as long as this parliament has been sitting since the election, has been delay, delay, delay—and that delay has had only one purpose, and that has been to seek to subvert the will of the Australian people as expressed at the last election.

                                                        We are not seeking in this motion to gag. We are not seeking to guillotine. We are seeking to afford the Australian people the opportunity for their parliament to give effect to their will. The contrast could not be greater with those on the other side. We saw those opposite in the last parliament use the gag and use the guillotine on legislation that actually sought to breach a solemn election commitment—it sought to breach the commitment given by Prime Minister Gillard to the Australian people that there would be no carbon tax under a government that she led. The former government sought to gag and guillotine debate on legislation that sought to breach an election commitment. We are doing the exact opposite. We are seeking to extend the period for debate in order to see an election commitment given effect to in the form of the legislation before this chamber. I say again, we are not proposing a gag and we are not proposing a guillotine. Those opposite, in the last session of the last parliament, guillotined 55 bills. We are seeking to afford the opportunity for an election commitment to be given effect to. What we are proposing is that this chamber sit until the job is done.

                                                              Those opposite should not stand in the way of the will of the Australian people being given effect to. We want to stay here until the work is done. Those opposite have used every procedure to delay debate. They have split the package of bills into 11 separate entities. We are barely halfway through consideration of the second piece of legislation.

They need to afford this chamber the opportunity to do its job. We are not proposing that question time be dispensed with—far from it. Our motion is very deliberately and very specifically worded so that if the carbon tax legislation and other important legislation is not dealt with by eight o'clock—which we know it will not be—the parliament continues to sit. Question time will still happen. That important accountability mechanism will still be in place. All we are seeking to do is afford the Australian people the opportunity to have their will expressed in this place through having the legislation put to a vote. Now we know those opposite have indicated they will vote against every piece of legislation in the carbon tax repeal package. We know they have said that, but they need to do two things. They need to allow the parliament to continue to sit so that the legislation can be put through all stages. But they need to do something more than that: they need to change their minds and they need to get out of the way and they need to allow that legislation to be passed. Those opposite do have an opportunity to reconsider, and that opportunity is very shortly when they can support this suspension motion and when they can then vote for the subsequent motion that would allow the parliament to continue to sit. They should do so.

I should not have been surprised when it seemed to move through with just a vote by the parliament to give this chamber a chance to consider the motion, followed by an opportunity for an exchange of one-minute statements. I was surprised, and thought that the government had given the chamber the chance to decide which way we would go on this motion. But, no, that happened yesterday. We come back in today and the exact same motion is put up before us this afternoon; the same intent of the motion came through this afternoon. My response is the same.
                                                                  </p>

                                                                   As we said on this side, the sitting pattern is determined by the government. When we agreed to that sitting pattern, we said that we would not be agreeing to requests for extensions of hours except in exceptional circumstances. Since we had that discussion, there has been no approach by the government putting their reasons to us about what they need to look at, explaining why things are so urgent or saying what they want to have done. That has not occurred. In fact, the attempts to talk about the schedule have been made by me when I have gone to see the Manager of Government Business in the Senate to look at what is happening. But, no, we have not had any discussions about the process they want to follow.
                                                                  </p>
                                                                  <p>
                                                                   Senator Brandis talking about the lack of sitting days in this sitting pattern is surprising at best. We heard from senators earlier that we had the election a mere 14 weeks ago. The election happened; the result was known. People wanted to know when were we going to sit, when were we going to come back to Canberra to begin this session. We did not hear from the government; a discussion did not occur. In fact, the only time allowed for the Senate in this sitting pattern was three weeks, and one week of estimates. The government decided that sitting pattern. We have worked with that sitting pattern. We had a whole week of sitting last week and again, in a calm and reasonable and adult way, the government did not put before us the urgency they had.
                                                                  </p>
                                                                  <p>
                                                                   As I said yesterday, the Senate considers each piece of legislation that comes before it. We look at the legislation. Every senator in this place has the right to consider the legislation and take part in the debate. So many times in the last parliament we sat and listened to every single member of the then opposition make the same speech over and over again—in fact, all of us on this side knew the content of that speech and we could have said it over and over again—but every senator had the chance to take part in the debate.
                                                                  </p>
                                                                  <p>
                                                                   The sitting pattern is determined by the government. The government has the right to organise the business of the sitting pattern. We have gone through the debate as presented to us. We had the offer yesterday for a change of hours. That was voted on by this chamber, and it was defeated. Today we have the same proposal to sit beyond eight o'clock to fulfil all of the bills listed by the government. This had not been taken to us before it was moved. We do not think that is adult, we do not believe it is reasonable and we certainly do not believe it is calm management of this chamber.

This morning, when there was another chance for the government to bring forward an hours motion, it did not happen. It was not put on the red to say this was going to happen today.
