         Thank you, Senator Smith, for your deep interest in aged care and also particularly for organising a terrific series of visits and meetings on aged care in regional

         I am very pleased to advise that the free trade agreement has secured the best ever market access to services provided by China to a foreign country. As Minister Robb has said, when it comes to services, this is the best ever deal China has done by a country mile. China, like or own population, is ageing. By 2025 it is expected that there will be 300 million people aged over 60 in China. Compare this to our own consumers, where by 2020 it is expected that there will be 1.6 million Australians over 65 who will need some form of care.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is an unprecedented opportunity for Australian aged-care providers to access the world's second largest economy and its huge potential in aged care and health. The agreement permits the establishment of wholly Australian owned hospitals and aged-care services in China. It is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for our aged-care industry. It demonstrates that there is demand in China for the training that we can provide in management, nursing, gerontology, personal care, reablement and facilities management. Australian aged-care providers are keen to sell their services and experience to China. Australian facility managers, property developers and architects are keen to sell their operational and design expertise. This is an opportunity that we cannot afford to let go begging. Also, Australian universities and

         s are keen to sell education and training services for all levels of aged care both in China and also from Australia.

           In November this year Austrade, in collaboration with China's national peak body for aged care and health industries, will launch the first Australia-China international aged care summit. The summit will showcase Australian aged-care capabilities and will facilitate bilateral engagement to support commercial opportunities and potential collaborations. Providers who participate will be able to build up some contacts and businesses opportunities and meet potential joint-venture partners. They will also benefit from government access and on-the-ground assistance from the Austrade team in China.

           As we know, former Prime Minister Bob Hawke is a huge fan of this agreement. We have heard much from

             The ageing of the population and how best to provide support and care to the elderly is a major policy issue in China. There is already rapid expansion of aged-care services in China. Both the Chinese national government and the provincial governments know that a lot more is needed to meet the future demand that they have.

China is very keen to establish government-to-government dialogue to learn from us but also, importantly, in these arrangements we need to be very open to learning from the Chinese as well. The
