Is the government aware of the serious adverse health effects for people living in close proximity to wind turbines, including causing symptoms such as sleep deprivation, headaches, high blood pressure and heart palpitations as well as problems with concentration and memory?

          Senator Fielding

         for his question on the health impacts of people who live near wind turbines. I will have to seek further and better information from the relevant minister about the allegations that Senator Fielding has made. I will not extend the issue any further. I am not going to venture into this area. These are issues which should be dealt with and I understand Senator Fielding does raise this question as a serious issue. I do not have information on that, but I will seek to gain further and better particulars for Senator Fielding at the earliest convenience that I can.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Is the government aware of the independent report commissioned by Noel Dean entitled
          <i>
           The Dean—Waubra Wind Farm Report
          </i>
          from a resident of Waubra which showed there was a cluster of adverse health issues affecting residents living nearby to wind turbines and that, as a result and on the advice of medical practitioners, some families have been forced to move away from their family home to escape the damage wind turbines cause? What action does the government plan on taking to protect families from being forced from their family homes?

           for his interest in the issue of the health of people who are living near wind turbines. I am not aware personally of the report you referred to. It is an issue that, in the circumstances, I will take on notice and seek further information from Minister Roxon’s office on to see what we can usefully contribute to the question he has raised.

            , I ask a further supplementary question. Given that the Australian peak body, the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHMRC" rel="nofollow">
             NHMRC
            </a>
            , has already done a rapid response into some of these concerns and given the mounting physical evidence of adverse health effects associated with living in close proximity to wind turbines, will the government commit to setting up an inquiry to investigate the adverse health issues of living in close proximity to wind turbines, including actually interviewing local residents?
