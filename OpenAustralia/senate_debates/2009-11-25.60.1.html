       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Long service leave entitlements for employees in the black coal mining industry flow from industrial instruments (awards and workplace agreements) and from contracts of employment.  They are based on an employee’s service in the industry, rather than service with a particular employer.  Funding of long service leave entitlements is supported by an industry scheme established by the Funding Act and related legislation.  The Funding Act provides for the reimbursement of employers where they make a payment to an eligible employee in respect of the employee’s entitlement to long service leave.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        From 1 January 2010, the present industry awards prescribing long service leave will be superseded by modern awards under the
        <i>

         FW
        </a>
        Act) which are not permitted to include long service leave entitlements.  While long service leave entitlements will be preserved under section 113 of the FW Act after 1 January 2010 they will no longer be award-based.  As a consequence, from 1 January 2010, employers in the black coal mining industry will not be entitled to reimbursement from the Fund in respect of long service payments they make to employees in respect of the preserved entitlements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The proposed amendments will ensure that the Funding Act applies to the preserved entitlements in the FW Act.  The proposed amendments would also include a definition of the “black coal mining industry” to align with the scheme with the Modern Award.  That definition will also apply to related legislation, that is, the
        <i>
         Coal Mining Industry (Long Service Leave) Payroll Levy Act 1992

        and the

        <i>

       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 1) 2009.  This Proposal created a new item 41H in Schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff to provide Free rates of duty for certain goods used in automotive testing and evaluation.  This Proposal was tabled in the House of Representatives on 11 February 2009.
        </li>
        <li>
         Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 2) 2009.  This Proposal increased rates of customs duty for certain alcohol and tobacco products applicable to goods imported under the Australia-Chile Free Trade Agreement.  The
         <i>
          Customs Tariff Amendment (Australia-Chile Free Trade Agreement Implementation) Act 2008
         </i>
         gave effect to the Australia-Chile Free Trade Agreement but did not take into account subsequent alterations to the Customs Tariff, as a result of the February 2009

          Consumer Price Index
         </a>
         increases and increased duty for certain spirit-based alcoholic beverages, known as “ready-to-drink” beverages or “alcopops”.  Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 2) 2009 was tabled in the House of Representative on 25 February 2009 and gave effect to those increases.
        </li>
        <li>
         Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 4) 2009.  This Proposal increased rates of customs duty for certain beer and grape wine products, as a consequence of the August 2009 Consumer Price Index increases.  This Proposal was tabled on 16 September 2009.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        When enacted, the Customs Tariff (Incorporation of Proposals) Bill 2009 will amend the Customs Tariff to give legal effect to the alterations contained in the Customs Tariff Proposals.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 1) above provides reduced duty rates for goods and is unlikely to be subject to a legal challenge.  The critical Proposal is Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 2) 2009, that was tabled in the House of Representatives on 25 February 2009.

        Successful passage in 2009 will enable the amended duty rates to be incorporated in the Customs Tariff prior to February 2010 and will provide certainty for importers, as well as the automotive industry.

        The Bill amends the
        <i>

       <p class="italic">
        On 12 February 2009, the Treasurer announced that the Government will amend the
        <i>
         Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975
        </i>
        to clarify the operation of the foreign investment screening regime.  In particular, the amendments will ensure that any investment, including through instruments such as convertible notes, will be treated as equity for the purposes of the Act.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These amendments will apply retrospectively from the date of the Treasurer’s announcement.  Introduction and passage of this Bill in the 2009 Spring sittings will ensure that the Government has the capacity to examine all investment proposals that could potentially be against Australia’s national interest.  Delaying the passage of this Bill may potentially cause confusion for prospective foreign investors wishing to invest in Australia.
