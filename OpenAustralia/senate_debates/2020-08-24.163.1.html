        These amendments will make it clear that test pieces used by aviation security inspectors must be inert and that in the performance of their duties aviation security inspectors must not endanger the health or safety of the public. The amendments that have been moved by the government will also insert a requirement that the number of exemptions granted by the Secretary of the Department of

       <p>
        As I said, this bill was scrutinised by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee made some recommendations. In relation to that advice these are the relatively minor but important amendments that the government is moving to the bill.

         Tonight, Labor would like to note the Greens amendments to improve transparent reporting that will be before the chamber. Labor very much agrees and has asserted in this debate that transparency is critically important. In our conversations with the government, we have been assured by the government that officials will accurately and transparently answer questions in relation to exemptions granted by the Secretary of the Department of

         during Senate estimates, and these are matters that I touched on in my second reading speech. So can I ask the minister, please, if she can outline why estimates, in this case, is the appropriate forum to raise these matters?

          Senator Pratt, in response to the questions that you have raisedâ€”which, I understand, are in relation to the amendments that will be moved by the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Greens
          </a>
          tonightâ€”the government amendments to the bill, I am instructed, include a requirement for the number of exemptions given to classes of screening officers issued by the secretary to be reported in the department's annual report. Reporting the number of exemptions given by the secretary is appropriate for the annual report. The additional information that would be required would require a level of detail to be included in the annual report that is not appropriate. The additional information being requested may be sensitive in nature and indicate a situation that may be subject to exploitation by persons intent on causing harm to the aviation or maritime industry. Should senators require the additional information proposed in the amendments, I am instructed that you are correct; senators will have the opportunity to ask the department during estimates hearings throughout the year, but we will obviously be opposing what the Greens will put forward.

           Thank you for your response that outlines that this information will be reported in part in the annual report. In the context of senators being able to ask questions about that report in Senate estimates, can I ask the minister to elaborate on the nature of the information that will be made available? For example, will officials report the length of time that exemptions are applied to screening officers?

            I'm instructed that we will be reporting the number of exemptions that are granted by the secretary each year in the department's annual report. In relation to the questions that senators may have at estimates, those senators may ask those questions at estimates, and an answer may or may not be given depending on what that question is. I can't pre-empt what those questions are going to be.

             In that context, given the secretary does have the ability to exempt screening officials from training, I'm sure the minister would agree it is appropriateâ€”and it shouldn't go to the detail of the kind of national security matters that you're highlightingâ€”that the public understands how long an exemption is applied and to whom it's been applied to and perhaps who exercised that exemption. For example, you could characterise whether each exemption has to apply to an individual, or it might be a whole class of people that carry that exemption over a particular period of time. So can you outline for the Senate the kind of information that we should reasonably be able to ask? For example, we would want to know that it's not the same exemption being applied over and over again.

              Again, as I've stated, what will be reported in the department's annual report is the number of exemptions given to classes of screening officers. Again, I can't pre-empt what information a senator may elicit from the secretary at an estimates hearing, but a senator can certainly put a question to the secretary. If the secretary is able to answer that question, I'm sure that he would. And, if not, he would state the grounds upon which he is unable to provide that information at that point in time.

               Thank you, Minister. Now, we have had in the opposition assurances that officials will accurately and transparently answer questions in relation to exemptions. And now the minister seems to be indicating that it is really up to the secretary the extent to which they may choose to answer those questions. But in negotiations the government has asserted that the secretary will be ready and willing to answer those questions. So I'm very keen to hear from the government that you will be in a position to answer questions such as how long the exemptions were in place and not just the class of people but the number of officers to whom that exemption applied as well as whether it's being applied in the same circumstances over and over again.

To the extent that the secretary is able to answer a questionâ€”other than, say, relying on a ground of national security or a ground that's set outâ€”the questions you have just put forward would be reasonable.

                 Thank you for acknowledging that they would be reasonable questions, because that does indicate that for the kinds of questions we have in mind we will be able to access the answers. Could the minister outline the preparation that officials will complete before each estimates to ensure that the secretary and other witnesses are able to answer such questions. For example, the annual report highlights the number of exemptions and the classes of people. But clearly we're seeking now an undertaking from the government that the kind of information that I've asked about will be available.

                  The normal preparation, I assume, would apply. I can't speak on behalf of the secretary. But certainly you have been around for a very long time and you would be aware that there is a provision whereby senators who have questions can provide those questions to the relevant department in advance in anticipation of ensuring that information is readily at hand on the day of the actual estimates hearing.

                    Again, we're dealing in hypotheticals here, because I really don't know the nature of questions that may be asked at estimates. But certainly in relation to any estimates hearings there are grounds an official can rely on in the event that they believe they are unable to give an answer. That can then be challenged by senators, and there is then a procedure that, as you would be aware, the senators are able to go down. But certainly in this respect one would believe that it would be national security.

                    <p>
                     Thank you, Minister. In that context, you are therefore assuring us that we should be able to get an answer to questions like whether an exemption is repeatedly applied if the same circumstances are envisaged for each exemption. Clearly that wouldn't go necessarily to the security information behind that. We should be at liberty to know at least that the government is not relying on an exemption in order to continue to have untrained personnel doing screening. You would be able to be clear in an answer that each exemption is used on a unique and novel basis, so that we can be clear that the exemptions aren't being renewed again and again.

                      I've just been asked to clarify that it is the secretary, not the government, that will be issuing the exemptions. I would also say, again, Senator Pratt, that today is not estimates. I cannot anticipate the types of questions that may be put by different senators at the estimates hearing, but the normal rules of estimates would apply.

                       On a similar line of questioning, Minister Cash, I heard in your statement that it wouldn't be appropriate for this information to be in the annual report but that it would be appropriate to ask the questions at estimates. I'm just trying to understand what the difference is. In effect, the legislation just becomes a question on notice for which the answer must be put in an annual report. I'm struggling to find the difference between the two.

                        Senator Patrick, I'll give you an example that would clarify the situation for you. As I've already stated to Senator Pratt, the additional level of information that we're referring to would require a level of data to be included in the annual report that is not appropriate. The additional information being requested may be sensitive in nature and indicate a situation that may be subject to exploitation by persons intent on causing harm to the aviation or maritime industry. For example, an exemption may be given to a class of screening officers from a particular airport. Publication of this information may expose the airport or aircraft departing from that airport to undue risk. In order to reduce the risk of information of this type being exploited, we would obviously be unable to support the amendment that was being put forward by the

                          Again, Senator Patrick, the position of the government is clear. The government amendments to the bill include a requirement for the number of exemptions given to classes of screening officers issued by the secretary to be reported in the department's annual report. It is the opinion of the government that reporting the number of exemptions given by the secretary is appropriate for the annual report. But it is the position of the government that the additional information, as required by the

                            Again, Senator Patrick, as I've said to Senator Pratt, I am unable to anticipate the questions that may be asked by senators to the departmental secretary or the minister at estimates. However, to the extent that those questions are in order and the information is able to be provided in the normal course of events, I am instructed that, subject to the determination of the secretary, that information would be provided. But, as you would know, Senator Patrick, there is a provision an official at the table can rely on if they do not wish to provide that information, and there is certainly a process that senators are able to undertake, in the event that they do not accept the ground upon which the official has relied, all the way to a vote on the floor of the Senate.

                             I'm not actually talking about a hypothetical question. I'll just run through these one at a time. At estimates, if a senator, such as myself, asked a question of an official or indeed the minister representing about the number of screening officers in the class of screening officers covered by each exemption, would I get an answer to that question, or would the minister advance public interest immunity?

                                 Thank you. Of course I understand that process quite well. Unfortunately, this is the sort of thing at estimates where we get a relatively simple questionâ€”and I have spelt out this question in detailâ€”and I end up getting an answer that seeks to avoid actually answering the question. That is exactly the sort of treatment we get at estimates. I am in a process nowâ€”in fact, there is a motion that will come before the Senate in the next day or soâ€”where officials refused to provide a valuation that had been obtained on a water licence, a valuation that itself stated that after 90 days it was no longer valid and gave cautions about relying on it after that time, and was denied to the Senate on order for production and questions on notice, and yet a citizen can get it under
                                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOI" rel="nofollow">

                                 So you have a track recordâ€”or the government has a track recordâ€”of being very cavalier in the way public interest immunities are advanced, and the Senate is actually not very good at standing up for itself. I say that regretfully. I refer you to my first speech when I talked about the difficulties or the failures of the Senate to enforce these sorts of orders. We have a shameful situation where a citizen can get an answer under FOI but a senator cannotâ€”in fact, an order of the Senate does not produce that answer. So that's my concern.

                                 I'm actually genuinely trying to work out whether or not to support the Greens motion. I would have thought that, having looked at theseâ€”and you've stated, Minister, that you don't want to support this particular amendment. I'm trying to understand where the offence lies or where the difficulty lies in these very specific questions. They're not hypotheticals. I simply want to know whether or not the officials would answer. I point out very specifically that it is not for an official to deny the answer to a question; only a minister can do that. You are representing the minister at this point in time in this chamber.

                                   The government will be supporting the amendments moved by Senator Pratt on behalf of the opposition. The bill currently includes a provision that requirements may be prescribed in delegated legislation but does not mandate this. The proposal is that the powers to conduct system tests cannot be used unless requirements for the conduct of the tests are prescribed in the regulations. Transport security inspectors follow standardised policies and procedures when conducting system tests. Although tests need to vary between regulated entities, test types and locations, the amendments are worded in such a manner that they would not unduly impact on the ability to conduct covert system testing. As I've said, on that basis the government will be supporting the amendments moved by the opposition.

                                    I thank Senators Pratt and Patrick for asking questions about these amendments because it has elicited from the minister no reason why these amendments should not be supported. Basically, these amendments seek to reveal a greater amount of information where there are exemptions being granted to certain levels of training and qualifications that security officers are meant to have. This legislation says that security officers should have a level of training and a level of qualification. We are supporting this bill on the basis that we have appropriately trained and appropriately qualified security officers.
                                   </p>
                                   <p>
                                    If there is a need to exempt officers from these requirements then we need to know why. We need to know more than just the number of exemptions, which is all the minister seems to be suggesting is required. I'm sorry, it just does not wash to say that we can ask these questions at estimates. I have been in the Senate for six years and have quite a lot of experience of asking such questions at estimates. I know what happens. You have prevarication. You get things taken on notice and you get the response in the week before the next estimates session. It can take a year or longer to get a straight answer out of estimates if the government wants to hide the information. If the government is concerned about security implications or any other implications of revealing this information, there is a really good way to ease the government's concern, and that is to actually not have very many exemptions. I cannot see why these exemptions should be necessary except in extreme circumstances.
                                   </p>
                                   <p>
                                    My amendments say that we need to know not just the number of exemptions that are granted but the number of screening officers in the class of screening officers covered by the exemption, so that we can see whether that number is a small or large proportion. If only one out of 100 of those screening officers were exempt from the need for training or qualifications, you would think, 'Maybe there are extenuating circumstances,' but if there were 80 out of 100 and this were ongoing, then that would be something that we, the public and the community need to know about. It's certainly something we in the Senate need to know about.
                                   </p>
                                   <p>
                                    We need to know the number of requirements from which a class of screening officers is exempt under each exemption so we know whether it is just a small number of the requirements or whether it is all of the requirements that are being waived. We need to know the period for which this exemption is going to be in force. Is it just for a short period, perhaps, while the screening officers are actually doing their training and there is a shortage of screening officers and these people are doing their training at the same time they are on the job and the exemption will cease after a few months? Or is it an ongoing issue? These are all very reasonable and very important bits of information that are needed to make sure that the security regime that is being put in place is appropriate, with appropriately trained officers who have got the appropriate skills and qualifications.

                                    I listened very closely to the minister as to why this amendment was not reasonable, and I'm afraid I was not convinced by her answer. I think essentially there's just a reluctance to go into this level of detail. All we were told was that this level of detail is not appropriate. I'm sorry; that is not good enough. Good legislation requires this level of detail being available to the public and to the Senate. This amendment will ensure that the level of information that the Senate needs and that the community needs is published in the annual report and is available for everyone on a timely basis.

                                     I just have a couple of questions in relation to the undertakings that have been provided by the government to Labor. Just to help me out, I'm wondering how long an undertaking lasts for. Does it last until the end of the parliament? Does it last until a change of prime minister? Does it last until a Liberal government leaves office and is replaced, perhaps, by the Labor Party in government? Or is it somehow enduring? How long does that undertaking to the Labor Party last? Maybe it's a bit like conventions, where we have longstanding conventions where the courts accept the exemptions and the parliament accepts the exemptions. I'm thinking of things like cabinet-in-confidence as a convention of cabinet, which the Morrison government has just expanded quite dramatically to cover pretty much everything that

                                     used to do under a veil. There's an example of, if undertakings are made or something happens by way of convention, how they can be quickly overturned just at the will of the executive. I actually wonder why Labor might accept an undertaking rather than having something embedded in law. Minister, again, how long does the undertaking that you have provided the Labor Party last for?

                                       Yes, of course I can ask those questions at estimates and I can ask them in the chamber, but you're doing exactly what officials often do, which is answer a question that I didn't ask. So, to be very clear, my question is: how long does the undertaking that you have made to the opposition last? I'm just wondering if this is the sort of answer that Labor are going to get when they get into estimates. Will they ask a question and get greeted with silence?
