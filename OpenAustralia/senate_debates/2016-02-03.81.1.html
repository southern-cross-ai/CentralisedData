        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister in the Senate. A joint media release by the Prime Minister, the Attorney-General and the employment minister on 30 December summarised the Heydon royal commission's findings as revealing a widespread and deep-seated culture of lawlessness in the construction industry and beyond and stated:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This corrupt and illegal conduct will not stop unless there is immediate and effective Parliamentary intervention, meaningful reform and strong leadership.
       </p>
       <p>
        As evidenced by the increasing public concern about corruption and lawlessness within a range of organisations, such as doping in sports and match fixing, the systematic exploitation of foreign workers, the abuse of political entitlements and so on, it is clear that misconduct and lawlessness are not confined to the building and construction industry. Does the government believe that the range of misconduct I have just mentioned satisfies its definition of either 'corruption' or 'lawlessness' and, if not, why?

         Senator Wang, it may, depending on the circumstance of the particular case, and in general yes, it does. Senator Wang, you rightly point out the very serious matters which were found by the Heydon royal commission to be part of what the royal commissioner concluded to be a widespread culture within the trade union movement.

Senator Wang, that is why this government is committed to giving effect to the recommendations of the Heydon royal commission. Might I point out, as has been observed by others, that the recommendations of the Heydon royal commission are not based upon any contentious factual disputes. The findings of the—

             I will take that interjection, Senator Conroy. Senator Conroy said that the findings are not based on any evidence. Senator Conroy, they are based on admissions. Not only are they based on evidence; they are based on uncontroverted evidence, undisputed evidence, confessions and admissions. So, listen, there is no area of factual contention in relation to the findings of the royal commissioner Mr Heydon. There is a test of character now—

                        as well as state and territory police agencies. There has not been any indication of a culture of corruption in Australian public administration. There has not. In fact, the instances where in either political life or in Australian public administration there have been instances of corruption are notably rare. The same cannot be said of all state governments and all state public administration but it can be said, and I think we should be very proud of this, of the Commonwealth.

                          With respect, let us take one thing at a time and let us not confuse two issues. I just said to you that in Australia our public administration and our politics—certainly at a federal level—have been remarkably free of corruption. There have very seldom been instances of either corrupt members of federal parliament or corrupt public servants. There have been one or two—very rare indeed. However, the same cannot be said of the building industry. That is why, by the way, one of the reasons we set up the Heydon royal commission is that there was an enormous volume of evidence that a culture of corruption across the trade union movement—not affecting all trade unions, I hasten to add, but affecting many—was endemic and widespread, and that is exactly what the royal commissioner found on the basis of uncontroverted evidence, admissions and confessions.

                            I thank Senator Johnston for his question and, yes, I can. I think all Australians know that the construction industry is critical to a productive Australia, and a more productive Australia equals more jobs for Australians.

                            The construction industry is Australia's third-largest employer. It employs over one million people in this industry, and those one million people are employed by the hundred thousand plus predominantly small and medium businesses. The reintroduction of the Australian Building and Construction Commission has great potential to make the sector, as I said, more productive, and a more productive economy means more jobs for Australians.

                                        is about introducing meaningful consequences for unlawful conduct in the building and construction industry, whether this conduct is undertaken by an employer or a union in the construction sector. In terms of the Cole royal commission, almost a decade ago now, and now the Heydon royal commission, both support the need for a separate specialist building regulator to ensure that workplace laws, laws that all Australians need to abide by, are actually abided by in that particular sector.

Flagrant breaches of workplace laws on such a scale are quite frankly unacceptable. It is a sad day when those on the other side are continuing to stand for unlawful behaviour in the construction sector, as opposed to standing, alongside those on this side of the chamber, for lawful behaviour.
