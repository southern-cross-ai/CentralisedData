        My question is to Senator Sherry, the Minister representing the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. Why has the government continued its attack on the most vulnerable members of our community by breaking a $500,000 commitment to fund the training opportunities and options for learning project for disadvantaged and at risk youth in southern Tasmania?

         As I have indicated on a number of occasions, this Labor government faces a very significant high-inflation legacy courtesy of the former Liberal government. Underlying inflation is currently running at approximately 3.6 per cent, and that is well above the target band of two to three per cent that the

             Senator Minchin should be careful. He is not addressing the future leader of the Liberal Party, Mr Turnbull, outside the party room now. He should be careful how he addresses this place. But in terms of the specific program that Senator Bushby has outlined here today, as I indicated, I think last week, if the senator wants an answer in respect of a specific program, he should refer his question to the minister responsible for that particular portfolio.

              , I ask a supplementary question. Can the minister confirm the funding announcement for this project was made on 9 October, prior to the election being called? Isn’t this just another example of Labor cutting a vital, fully funded program, in this case for our most disadvantaged youth, so it can fund spurious and politically motivated projects like protecting a dead tree in Queensland?

               I do not know about a dead tree in Queensland, but I know about a dead opposition! In terms of the program, as I have indicated—and I am trying to be helpful to the senator—if the Senate wants answers to specific questions concerning programs, they should be referred to the specific minister responsible.
