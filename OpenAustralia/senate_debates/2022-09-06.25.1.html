        As Assistant Minister for Indigenous Health, I would like to give a short update on Indigenous health in the first hundred days of this government. The Australian government is investing $106 million to provide face-to-face support for older
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations
        </a>
        people and $115 million to provide culturally safe aged-care facilities. We're also progressing on our commitment to train 500 new First Nations health workers to fill gaps across the health system. The National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation, NACCHO, is working hand in hand with us to design the program to ensure it meets the needs of First Nations people and the health services which care for them.
       </p>
       <p>
        We've invested in better outcomes and more appropriate care for people living with cancer across Australia. On Sunday we marked Polycystic Kidney Disease Awareness Day, and we know a large number of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
         Indigenous Australians
        </a>
        suffer from kidney disease and are on dialysis for end-stage kidney disease. It was an important moment last week when we announced that a life-changing treatment for chronic kidney disease is now available to thousands of Australians through an expansion of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_Benefits_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
         Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme
        </a>
        listing. It's the first new treatment added to the PBS in more than 20 years for Australians living with proteinuric chronic kidney disease, and thousands of Australians could benefit from a subsidised listing each year. It could also benefit any Australians living with chronic kidney disease. We know that the disease takes a heavy physical, social and economic toll on First Nations communities, with First Nations people being twice as likely to have the condition and much more likely to die from it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although these issues are complex and can't be fixed overnight, our government is committed to continuing this work because all Indigenous Australians—indeed, all Australians—deserve to live long, healthy and happy lives.
