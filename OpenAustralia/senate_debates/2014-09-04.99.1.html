        My question is to the Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Senator Cash. Can the minister update the Senate on how the government's counter-terrorism measures will help our border protection agencies to identify individuals who seek to leave Australia to fight in foreign conflicts?

         I thank Senator Back for his question in relation to what is obviously a very serious area. I can inform the Senate that the government is taking action to address the threats to our borders, not just through people smuggling, as senators would know through the success to date of Operation Sovereign Borders, but against terrorism and the threat that foreign fighters present to Australia. As part of the $630 million counter-terrorism package announced on 5 August by the Prime Minister, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Customs" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Customs
         </a>
         and Border Protection Service will receive $150 million for several measures, including establishing counter-terrorism units at Australia's major international airports and the rollout of biometric testing, which the former government talked about but never delivered. It will be delivered by this government and we have allocated the appropriate resources to ensure that this occurs.
        </p>
        <p>
         Counter-terrorism units commenced operations at a number of airports in August 2014. Customs and Border Protection will shortly establish similar units at all international airports in Australia. These measures will add to the more than 1,300 officers already deployed to more than 40 airports across Australia. The most recent announcement will complement the creation of the Australian Border Force, which will be formed on 1 July 2015, with the consolidation of the

         into the Department of Immigration and Border Protection. This will allow for the creation of the new, single, better resourced, frontline force responsible for investigations, compliance and detention.

           The package of measures recently announced by the government will further assist border agencies in addressing these threats both with increased resources and broader legislative powers. We will be bringing to the Australian parliament a package of legislative measures designed to toughen and strengthen the powers available to prevent certain people from entering and leaving Australia. Our border agencies do know that there are some Australians who seek to leave Australia to take part in foreign conflicts. Counter-terrorism unit officers have already had success in intercepting a number of such people of national security concern. Those departing Australia to take part in overseas conflicts are a risk to national security. If they are successful in leaving Australia, they may eventually return war hardened and with the intent to harm Australians. The officers of the Customs and Border Protection service should be commended for the exceptional work that they do in keeping all Australians safe.

             It is no secret that the key areas in the customs space have been neglected over the period of the last six years. Over $700 million was ripped out from the Customs and Border Protection portfolio under the former Labor government, and this government is putting that funding back. The creation of the Australian Border Force will achieve budget savings by managing both Customs and Border Protection and the Department of Immigration and Border Protection and some functions of the department. We are reinvesting those savings back into the front-line operations of the agency.
            </p>
            <p>
             In a fiscal environment like the one which we have inherited that is how you get additional resources to the front line. You do so by having more efficient agencies. The establishment of the Australian Border Force will better equip the portfolio to deal with the integrity challenges, resulting in clearer lines of accountability and improved resourcing. The funding, resources and policies the government is rolling out are all going towards making Australia safe.
