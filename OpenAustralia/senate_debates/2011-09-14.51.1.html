        , Senator Conroy. Is the minister aware of the release of an opinion poll by the public interest group NewsStand showing that a two to one majority of Australians back a media inquiry? If he is, can he account for the position of the opposition as espoused by Mr Turnbull that there should be no media inquiry? Is Mr Turnbull totally out of touch with public opinion or is he simply trying to send a warm glow down to Holt Street?

         I thank Senator Bob Brown for his question. Like you, Senator Brown, I am indeed surprised that those opp­osite are so out of touch with public opinion on this issue. Perhaps they should simply keep reading the

         The government believes it is necessary to support the independence and integrity of the media in the face of technological change and that the public have a right to have trust in our media. As I said earlier today when announcing the inquiry, a healthy and robust media is essential to the democratic process. Labor believes it is incumbent upon govern­ment to ensure that regulatory processes and industry structures are sufficiently strong to support the continuation of a healthy and independent media that is able to fulfil its essential democratic purpose and to operate in the public interest. I made this very clear a little over an hour ago, but let me repeat it for those whom seem to have missed it. The government is not interested in attacking any one media organisation or in seeking to reduce the necessary scrutiny of the political process that is at the heart of a functioning—

          I remind senators that any interruption to the answer is disorderly. It does not help question time with people wanting to throw their comm­ents into the ring during question time. Post question time, that is at 3 pm, there is a time for people to put forward in a robust manner their views on these issues. That is when it should be done.

            , I ask a supplementary question. The NewsStand poll shows that 87 per cent of people believe it should be easier to make complaints about the media. I ask the minister if he is aware that Mr Turnbull has complained that the inquiry may put some sort of legislative backbone into the Press Council. Can the minister say why it is that Mr Turnbull would want the Press Council, against the public interest, to remain a jellyback?

                     The fallback always is that the minister may respond to that part of the question which he can respond to. That is what the standing orders say. There is no point of order raised by Senator Brandis. Senator Brandis has not asked that the question be ruled out of order. So I humbly submit that the question is in order.

                      </a>
                      : I would draw your attention to your memo to all senators of 25 August 2011 in which you state:
                     </p>
                     <p class="italic">
                      A question inviting a minister to comment on opposition policies is strictly out of order—
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      you then go on to say—
                     </p>
                     <p class="italic">
                      although questions seeking the minister’s knowledge of how other policy proposals would affect matters within that minister’s responsibility have been ruled in order.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Mr President, I would contend that both the primary question of Senator Brown and the supplementary do no more than invite the minister to comment on Mr Turnbull's words or policies and are therefore clearly out of order on the basis of your own ruling.

                                     I am not one to be terribly precious about such things in the chamber and have engaged in vigorous debate across the chamber myself. So I do not pretend that I do not support that. But, while I think you quite rightly said that you did not hear the comment made—and neither did I—the senator, to his credit, got up and admitted to the comment. It then becomes, I think, a question for you as to whether or not it is appropriate. I think this is the second occasion where a coalition senator in the last few days has referred to senators on the crossbenches, comparing them to Nazis. I do not think that is appropriate. I do not think it is a standard this Senate should set. As I said, given that the senator informed you,

                                     , that he made those comments and that he was prepared to withdraw, I think it would be best for all concerned if the senator just withdrew.

                                              The media inquiry I announced today will focus on print media regulation, including online publications and the operation of, as I said, the Press Council. The government believe a separate and distinct examination of the pressures facing newspapers and their newsrooms, including online publications, will enhance our consid­eration of the policy and regulatory settings.

                                              Australia needs to ensure that the news media continue to serve the public interest in the digital age. The inquiry will be asked to assess the effectiveness of the current media codes of practice in Australia, particularly in light of technological change, the impact of this change on the business model that has supported investment in journalism and the production of news, and ways to enhance media diversity in the digital area.
