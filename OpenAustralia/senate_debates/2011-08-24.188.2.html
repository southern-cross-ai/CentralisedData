        Tonight I rise as part of the adjournment debate to pay my respects to a man who could only be described as a true believer and a carrier of the light on the hill. Walter Rex Neil, known as Rex, dedicated his life to the labour movement. He was a man of unwavering commitment to repre­senting working people.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to acknowledge that in the chamber tonight we have fellow senators from Tasmania: Senators Urquhart, Bilyk and Polley. I welcome their support tonight.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rex was taken from us suddenly and unexpectedly so tonight, as part of my contribution, I wish to reflect on Rex's achievements and commitments to the Labor Party and to the union movement. Only a matter of weeks ago hundreds of people, including family, friends, politicians, state and national union leaders and members of the Labor Party joined to pay their respects at the service for Rex, including the current
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTBU" rel="nofollow">
         RTBU
        </a>
        Tasmanian State Secretary, Samantha Simonetis, who Rex had worked closely with over the past few years, and former National RTBU Secretary, Roger Jowett, who reflected on Rex's life in his contribution at the service. It is a testament to the mark Rex had made and clearly showing the esteem in which Rex was held in right across the party and the union movement that so many people joined together to pay their respects to Rex Neil. I had the pleasure of meeting Rex nearly 30 years ago when I joined the Tasmanian branch of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Labor Party
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Rex began his career on the railway in 1959 as a porter at Railton. Immediately upon commencing his position on the railway lines Rex become a member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Railways_Union" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Railways Union
        </a>
        , the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARU" rel="nofollow">
         ARU
        </a>
        . At that time Tasmania's railway system was a strong and thriving government department with 3,000 employees, an urban railway system in Hobart, a premier intercity passenger service, and the Tasman Ltd and rail workshops at Invermay Road which could produce both locomotive and rolling stock. Whilst working on the railways Rex was promoted through the grades of shunter, station master and finally to train controller, working the train control boards in Launceston.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rex's involvement in the railway union saw him represent railway workers in Tasmania for over 50 years, filling a huge number of positions with the ARU and the amalgamated Rail, Tram and Bus Union, the RTBU, at a state and national level. Rex was a passionate advocate for ARU members and rose to the position of Tasmanian branch secretary in 1974. He held this position until 1993 when he became assistant branch secretary of the newly amalgamated Rail, Tram and Bus Union.
       </p>
       <p>
        The creation of the RTBU came about as the part of the larger restructuring of the labour movement. The RTBU came into existence after an amalgamation of the Australian Railways Union, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federated_Union_of_Locomotive_Enginemen" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Enginemen
        </a>
        , the Australasian Tramway and Motor Omnibus Employees Association and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Union" rel="nofollow">
         National Union
        </a>
        of Railway Workers. Whilst this was a difficult and challenging time, Rex immediately saw the benefits of the amalgamation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whilst Rex was renowned as someone who was always straight to the point and made it clear where he stood, he possessed the finest qualities any union organiser could hope for: he was a terrific listener. Every worker Rex represented had a story to tell about their job and their workplace, and Rex made sure he was there to hear every story. The story of the modern railway worker is of someone that is called upon to work unsocial hours undertaking shift work as a single driver operating freight or as working as part of a small gang, but either way it is unusual to see many other workers. But Rex made it his business to ensure that he was accessible and that every member was able to talk with their union representative face to face. This often meant Rex worked unsociable hours as well to ensure that his union members were kept informed and had the opportunity to speak to their union representative. This commitment and care for his members highlighted the type of man Rex was; in fact, you could not have met a more genuine, caring and outstanding advocate for his members than Walter 'Rex' Neil.
       </p>
       <p>
        During his time in the RTBU the rail industry faced many challenges, none bigger than in 1999 with the incoming American owners of the privatised
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TasRail" rel="nofollow">
         TasRail
        </a>
        . During the 20 years previous there had been rationalisation of the workforce which had seen the Tasmanian rail system privatised. Add to this the anti-union and anti-collective bargaining legislation and policies of the Howard government and the RTBU, like many unions, were facing a particularly difficult period. When the new American owners of TasRail took over in 1999 they had a well-established record of anti-unionism. These were dark and difficult days indeed. Some union activists were not rehired, rail workers were given the ultimatum of a job and an individual workplace agreement or nothing, which threw wages and conditions out the window, and meant the prospect of looking for a new job.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rex continued his passion and commitment to the union movement through these dark years until what can be described as Rex Neil's proudest moment in his time contributing to railway unionism and railways in Tasmania, with the renationali­sation of the Tasmanian rail system by the state government, followed by historical high levels of investment delivered by both the state and federal Labor governments which has seen the upgrading of infrastructure and rolling stock. A new single, enterprise wide collective agreement was implemented and ratified by members, with the union density in the industry now back to a healthy 70 per cent and still growing. These achievements are in no small part thanks to the role Rex played.
       </p>
       <p>
        In speaking at Rex's service, former RTBU national secretary and colleague Roger Jowett summed up Rex fittingly when he said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        All of us in the RTBU and the wider labour movement have been enriched by his lifelong contribution. His life work is both testament to the foundations of collectivity and solidarity upon which unions are built and it why we can proclaim: we are proud to be union.
       </p>
       <p>
        And this rang true for Rex, who was a proud life member of the Australian Labor Party and held various positions in the party such as national and state conference delegate, administrative committee member, vice-president, president of the North Launceston branch and platform chair of the Community, Health and Transport Services Committee. Despite this, despite playing a enormous role in the Labor Party, it was always Rex's union members who came first. But Rex's commitment to the Labor Party could never be questioned and ran a very close second. Rex really was a genuine Labor man. One of his grandchildren recounted at the service that Rex said he didn't mind what his grandchildren did as long as they promised him two things: firstly, to support the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlton_Football_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Carlton Football Club
        </a>
        —which I personally cannot agree with—and, secondly, to always vote Labor.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whilst Rex was involved in numerous Labor campaigns, there are a couple that really stick in my mind which I will share tonight. Rex was heavily involved in the campaigns of former Tasmanian Labor state government minister and member for Bass,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Cox" rel="nofollow">
         Jim Cox
        </a>
        . Rex and Jim first met at a function where Jim was describing to Rex the difficulty of completing the dreaded job of getting all of his posters erected before the election. It was this first chat which started a long association between the two. Every election Jim and Rex would have this quiet chat and magically a few weeks out from the election hundreds of Jim Cox posters would suddenly appear. Party members also recall Rex's vital involvement in many campaigns through the use of his trusty van, and it was this trusty van which again demonstrated his tireless commitment to the labour movement. What other person would attach several posters on their van by attaching them with screws through the bodywork? Rex also used this trusty van in the 1996 Bass federal election campaign where
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_O'Byrne" rel="nofollow">
         Michelle O'Byrne
        </a>
        defeated
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warwick_Smith" rel="nofollow">
         Warwick Smith
        </a>
        . Rex took up the bus driving duties, ferrying campaign volunteers all over the electorate to go doorknocking. And in a free moment of the campaign, Rex would drive the van around the block over and over, waiting for a park to open up in front of Warwick Smith's office so that he could park the van right out front, with Michelle O'Byrne's name all over the van whilst obscuring the view of Warwick's office and his name.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rex also used his van to great effect in the 2007 'Your Rights At Work' campaign delivering posters all over Launceston. It was examples like these, and many others too numerous to mention, that made Rex a true believer of unwavering commitment to the labour movement. Whilst Rex was a quiet achiever there was no doubting his passion, commitment and dedication to his beloved ARU, RTBU and the Labor Party. He was truly a man who cared deeply about other people and he worked to improve the lives of those less fortunate. He was a true Labor warrior and someone who will be terribly missed, but will be remembered by the beautiful memories he has given us. Farewell Rex.
