         Labor won't be supporting this motion. We think it's an area for reform and we are willing to engage in discussions in good faith with all parties, but we do not believe it should be transacted through a motion in the Senate which doesn't allow for any of those discussions. We've been clear and consistent on our policies for accountability and transparency on political donations. However, we believe any change, if we are after serious change, requires more consideration than a motion in a part of a program where it can't be discussed.

          Given the motion seeks to direct me, I'm going to seek leave to make a short statement too.
         </p>
         <p>
          Leave granted.

          </a>
          described by this motion, including venue hire, catering and security, are provided on a strictly commercial basis. There is no subsidy provided whatsoever. In fact, prohibiting such venue hire would prove detrimental to the operations of Parliament House through the loss of revenue such events bring in. Furthermore, the application of such a policy change is not immediately clear cut, as 'private political fundraising activities' can apply much more widely than simply to political parties—for example, to organisations that undertake disclosable political expenditure and activities while not formally standing candidates for election.

          The question is that motion No. 1158 be agreed to.
