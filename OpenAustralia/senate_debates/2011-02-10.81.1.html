        <p>
         I thank Senator Polley for her ongoing interest in this issue. Today I am pleased to both welcome and announce to the chamber that Telstra and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
          NBN
         </a>
         Co. have finalised the key commercial terms to allow for the more efficient rollout of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network" rel="nofollow">
          National Broadband Network
         </a>
         . Today’s announcement represents a big step towards bringing affordable high-speed broadband to every home, school, hospital and small business in Australia—no matter where they are located. The commercial terms pave the way for a final agreement to allow NBN Co. to use Telstra’s assets to rollout the NBN and for Telstra to decommission its copper network.
        </p>
        <p>
         In support of these arrangements, the government and Telstra have reached in-principle agreement for the package of measures announced by the government last June. These measures will facilitate the transition of the NBN and they include a public information campaign to inform people about the migration of services from the copper based network to the NBN, assistance to retrain Telstra’s workforce to deploy the NBN, and implementing the government’s reforms to deliver the universal service obligation and other public-interest services.
        </p>
        <p>
         The deal also provides certainty for consumers. It means that people will continue to have access to their fixed-line voice services, including in areas where the NBN will be delivered by non-fibre technologies. People will continue to have access to payphone services. Universal access payphones will continue to be available and they will be funded in the public interest rather than in the commercial interest of Telstra.

          <p>
           Today’s announcement means that communities across Australia, from city to country and back, and families and businesses both big and small can all take comfort that, regardless of where they are, they will have access to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
            NBN
           </a>
           . This is another significant step forward in the delivery of the NBN, the largest nation-building infrastructure project in Australia’s history. As well as allowing for a cheaper, more efficient rollout of the NBN, the in-principle agreement ensures there is continuity of basic, universal service outcomes for consumers while the country transitions to the NBN. Under the 11 years of the previous Howard government broadband policy was neglected, resulting in many people in outer suburban and rural and regional Australia being treated like second-class citizens. It has taken the Gillard Labor government to address this neglect.

             The agreement announced today takes a large step towards treating all Australians as one and providing all Australians with an opportunity to share in the technology of tomorrow. Unfortunately there are still some people who do not want this as an outcome; there are still some who do not want to see all Australians treated fairly. There are still some who do not think that all Australians deserve access to world class infrastructure, to world class leading broadband. Who are these people, you might ask. Who on earth could they be? Who would want to deny Australians in city, outer suburban and rural and regional areas? It is no surprise, and it saddens me to say it, that those opposite continue to try to keep Australia in the digital dark ages.
