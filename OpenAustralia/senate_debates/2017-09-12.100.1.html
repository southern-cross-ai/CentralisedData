       <p class="italic">
        This bill will provide seriously or terminally ill patients, whose doctors believe medicinal cannabis will relieve their suffering, with rapid access to these treatments.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill makes two crucial amendments to the
        <i>
         Customs Act 1901
        </i>
        and the
        <i>
         Narcotic Drugs Act 1967
        </i>
        to give faster access to medicinal cannabis for those patients with illnesses from which they are reasonably likely to die within a matter of months, or from which premature death is reasonably likely to occur in the absence of early treatment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This bill:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        1) Allows access to Australian medicinal cannabis products through Special Access Scheme Category A; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        2) Ensures the government cannot block Special Access Scheme Category A access to imported medicinal cannabis products via import licence conditions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Special Access Scheme (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAS" rel="nofollow">
         SAS
        </a>
        ) of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_Goods_Administration" rel="nofollow">
         Therapeutic Goods Administration
        </a>
        (TGA) provides a pathway to provide for the import and/or supply of a therapeutic good that is not registered on the Australian Register for Therapeutic Goods (ARTG), for a single patient, on a case by case basis.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_SAS" rel="nofollow">
         The SAS
        </a>
        allows doctors to prescribe the most appropriate treatments to their patients even when that treatment is not yet registered.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        While there are different categories under the SAS, category A only applies to those patients whose doctor believes their condition meets the definition established by the regulator, specifically "patients who are seriously ill with a condition from which death is reasonably likely to occur within a matter of months, or from which premature death is reasonably likely to occur in the absence of early treatment."
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The regulatory requirements for the category A pathway involve a notification to the TGA by the doctor, and reflect the seriousness of the condition of patients who meet the eligibility criteria for this category.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Any unapproved therapeutic good can potentially be prescribed by a doctor and supplied via the SAS except drugs in schedule 9 of the Poisons Standard (where the manufacture, possession, sale or use is prohibited by State or Territory law). Schedule 9 drugs cannot be accessed through the SAS Category A process.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        When the TGA rescheduled medicinal cannabis treatments from schedule 9 of the Poisons Standard to schedule 8 in November 2016, these treatments became eligible for supply via category A of the SAS for those eligible. However, the Government cynically sought to cut off this access to these terminally ill patients by blocking category A access for Australian produced medicinal cannabis in the Narcotic Drugs Amendment Act 2016, and introducing a disallowable instrument to block category A access for importation of international medicinal cannabis.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 13 June 2017, the Senate voted to disallow the instrument blocking category A access to imported medicinal cannabis. This made it unlawful to prevent importation of medicinal cannabis via category A of the SAS. Despite this, the government wrote to all those suppliers with import licences, telling them that they would not be permitted to import under category A due to a condition in their import licence. They included in that letter a veiled threat that their licence would be in jeopardy should suppliers seek to import under category A.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This action by the government is condemned, and the first amendment this bill makes ensures that the government cannot block importation under category A by relying on conditions of import licences.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The disallowance motion that the Senate supported in June this year related only to imported medicinal cannabis treatments. In introducing the
        <i>
         Narcotic Drugs Amendment Act 2016,
        </i>
        the government blocked category A access for Australian medicinal cannabis treatments.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The second amendment this bill makes is to ensure that Australian medicinal cannabis, along with imported medicinal cannabis, is accessible via category A of the SAS. This not only ensures that emerging Australian medicinal cannabis suppliers are not disadvantaged; it also ensures that when Australian medicinal cannabis treatments become available, terminally ill patients will be able to access them rapidly.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This bill is about securing access to medicinal cannabis for those Australian patients who need it most, in the face of needless cruelty and red-tape from this government.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I commend it to the Senate.
       </p>
       <p>
        I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted; debate adjourned.
