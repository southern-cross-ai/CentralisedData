        With reference to mining exploration applications for the

        coastal region and nearby offshore sites:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) Is the Minister aware of the large number of mining exploration leases pending over areas of the Arnhem Land coastal region.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) Is the Minister aware that applications placed in a Darwin newspaper for the proposed offshore oil and gas exploration were only advertised in English.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) Is the Minister concerned that only English was used, given that exploration will impact most significantly on Aboriginal people who may speak languages other than English.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) Has the department reviewed the potential impact of these leases; if so:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) what are the potential cultural and environmental impacts of the cumulative offshore oil, gas, and seabed mining, as well as land-based mining;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) what account is being taken of the proximity of recent offshore oil and gas, near-shore, up-river and estuary mineral exploration applications to areas where Aboriginal people extensively hunt, gather and fish;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) has any assessment been undertaken of the impact these activities will have, particularly on health if food sources are negatively impacted;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) has the impact of the exploration activity on the Arnhem Land coastal region and nearby offshore sites been calculated in relation to the traditional owners' song lines and sites of spiritual significance; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) has a clean-up plan for any oil or chemical spills been proposed; if so, how does this clean-up plan propose to deal with the issues such as the large tidal range, crocodiles, lack of roads and a 6 month wet season; if not, why not.
