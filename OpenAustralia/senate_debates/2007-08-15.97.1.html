         Thank you, Senator Conroy, for the question. The issue to do with complaints about journalists is to be dealt with and can be dealt with through the appropriate regulatory authorities, but the issue to do with the journalists mentioned by Senator Conroy is: what complaint is it that one needs to make about what has happened? It is quite extraordinary that, apparently, the journalists in question—and I know only what I have read about it—appear to have had an off-the-record conversation with the Treasurer or, alternatively, a conversation that they agreed to treat as off the record, and somehow or other the conversation that happened over two years ago was not thought to be worthy of reporting. If it was on the record, it was not thought worthy of reporting two years ago; if it was off the record, all of the principles of journalism would suggest that it should not be used at any time at all.

           Something that is off the record should remain off the record. Something that is on the record, if it is newsworthy, should be dealt with in the normal news circle and not saved for some later purpose two years later and used for some other entirely unacceptable purpose. The issue to do with the Treasurer which was apparently the subject of some conversation, however interpreted by the journalists, has been denied by the Treasurer. It is interesting that the Treasurer has pointed out, very appropriately I would suggest, that a conversation that has been alluded to by the journalists in question apparently was not recorded at the time at which it was made and has been substantially reconstructed from recollections of the conversation. The Treasurer has said very plainly and publicly that he had no recollection of three journalists scribbling away to provide an accurate record of a conversation that was alleged to have taken place.
          </p>
          <p>
           As I was not there, I do not think it is appropriate for me to speculate further about the particular event. Suffice to say that the substance of it has been totally dealt with, completely and utterly dealt with, in terms of the leadership of the Liberal Party. It has been dealt with between the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. It has been comprehensively dealt with by the Treasurer agreeing to serve as Treasurer and the Prime Minister agreeing to serve as Prime Minister, and the Australian public have never had such a government.

            , I ask a supplementary question. Is the minister aware of whether any complaints have been lodged with the Australian Media and Communications Authority by the Treasurer or on his behalf? Is the minister aware that the Treasurer has successfully taken legal action against publishers in the past? Given that, won’t the Australian public choose to believe the three senior, respected journalists if the Treasurer takes no action to prove his claim that they are lying and he is not?

             , firstly, I wish to take a point of order in relation to the supplementary question asked by Senator Conroy because he very clearly reflected on the Treasurer and very clearly inferred that either the three journalists were lying or, indeed, he was lying. It was a question where there was a very clear inference and a reflection on a member of the House of Representatives.
