        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Brandis. When the same-sex marriage postal survey result is released tomorrow, which bill will the government endorse? Will it be Senator Smith's bill, which does provide protection of religious freedom while finally making marriage equality an Australian reality, or will it be Senator Paterson's bill, which would take us back to the dark ages by legalising homophobic discrimination?

         Thank you very much for the question, Senator Hinch. I'm glad you've raised the question of the postal survey because, on any view, the postal survey has been an outstanding success. I want to take the opportunity you afford me, Senator Hinch, to congratulate my colleague Senator Mathias Cormann, who was the Acting Special Minister of State at the time the postal survey was conducted, had superintendence of it and did a magnificent job. We will find that 80 per cent or so of the Australian electorate has participated. As the government said at the time: whether you favour reform of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_Act" rel="nofollow">
          Marriage Act
         </a>
         or whether you want to maintain the status quo, the important thing was that people should have their say—and they have had their say in droves. I don't want to anticipate what the result will be when it's announced at 10 am tomorrow because the government has been very, very careful to respect the process.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Hinch, you ask about two private senators' bills that have been foreshadowed by my colleagues Senator Smith and Senator Paterson. What the Prime Minister has always said and what I've always said is that, in the event that there were to be a 'yes' vote, then the government would facilitate a parliamentary debate on a private member's bill—or perhaps it will be a private senator's bill. That will be a matter for the private members or senators concerned and a matter for the chamber.

           Senator Brandis, what does it say about your government that, in 2017, your party room would even debate legislation that discriminates against gay people and could even open the door to discrimination against black people, or Jews, or some other people on religious grounds?

            Senator Hinch, that's just wrong. There has been no such debate in the government party room or in the Liberal party room. There has been no discussion of Senator Smith's bill or of Senator Paterson's bill in the government party room or in the Liberal party room. Senator Hinch, might I remind you that, when it comes to the removal of discrimination against gay people in this country, my side of politics has taken the lead on many significant occasions both in state parliaments and in this parliament.

              , unlike in the other place, we get these time-wasting supplementary questions, especially dorothy dixers from the government side. I'll forfeit that option in protest.
