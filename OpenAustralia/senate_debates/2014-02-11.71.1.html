        My question is to the Assistant Minister for Social Services, Senator Fifield. Can the minister provide the Senate with any information on the impact of the recent Victorian bushfires on older people living in aged-care facilities in affected areas?

         Bushfires, as we know, are an unfortunate fact of life in Australia, particularly at the moment in Victoria. While it is important that all Victorians are prepared, older Australians in aged-care facilities are particularly vulnerable at these times. The safety and wellbeing of aged-care recipients is of paramount importance. I am sure we all agree that we want to ensure that older Australians stay safe until danger has passed.

         I am pleased to inform the Senate that no aged-care facilities in Victoria are currently under threat, as the fire situation has eased in Victoria, thanks in part to the efforts of firefighters and emergency services personnel, who, as we know, have worked around the clock. However, over recent days, two aged-care facilities in Victoria were evacuated. The first facility, the On Luck Chinese Nursing Home, in Donvale, was evacuated on Saturday. Twenty residents were relocated to be with their families until the threat had passed. All residents have now been returned safely to the facility. In the second facility,

           While primary responsibility for responding to emergency events lies with state and local governments, the federal government does work very closely with state and territory health and emergency services management agencies to support service providers during emergency events like bushfires. Specifically, the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
            Department of Social Services
           </a>
           , if required, will consult local and state providers to identify suitable alternative places for residents in other facilities outside the area of threat and will also monitor the temporary care arrangements made for residents during and after a bushfire. The safety of older Australians is of paramount importance at these times. It is a legislative requirement for approved providers to have emergency risk management plans and protocols in place to protect their residents during emergencies such as bushfires, and the Aged Care Quality Agency has a monitoring role.

             In emergencies such as bushfires, federal and Victorian agencies liaise closely together to ensure that communication is maintained and that there is collaboration to ensure that any residents who need to be relocated are found temporary accommodation until danger passes. In fact, it is not uncommon for
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
              Department of Social Services
             </a>
             staff, when it is required, to be embedded at emergency headquarters hubs to make sure that there is seamless communication between Commonwealth and state authorities.
            </p>
            <p>
             Sometimes residents—and this is by far the preferable outcome where it is appropriate—will stay with their families for the duration. On other occasions, it is necessary to find another aged care facility. Regardless, it is important that all three arms of government work together to ensure that this vulnerable group are protected at times of danger.
