        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Evans. My question concerns the recent police raid on Kunoth town camp in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Springs" rel="nofollow">
         Alice Springs
        </a>
        , which residents described as an ‘over-the-top terrorist like raid’. Is the minister aware of this raid? Can the minister tell the Senate how many police were involved and whether they were exclusively
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory

        Police or whether
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">

         I thank Senator Siewert for the question. I suspect that even if I had a brief I would not be able to answer all those questions in one go, but I do not have any advice on that particular incident. While I can try to get the minister’s response as quickly as possible, I have no personal knowledge of the incident nor a brief on the details of it. So I am afraid I cannot help the senator in terms of providing any information now, but I will take it on notice and provide her with what I can as soon as possible.

           Senator Siewert, it is question time. You are entitled to ask a supplementary question, so it is acceptable if you put it in the form of a question.

               I just asked Senator Scullion whether he knew about it, but he didn’t seem very helpful either! So I am not sure it has been as much at the forefront of some of our minds as it perhaps should have been. I do acknowledge the senator’s interest in the area and the serious concerns that she has raised, but I just do not have a brief. I will take her supplementary question on notice as well and try to get her an answer.
