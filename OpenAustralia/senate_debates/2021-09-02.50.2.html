           Young Australians have many reasons to be optimistic and hopeful for the future. The Australian government's National Youth Policy Framework acknowledges the challenges faced by young people, particularly from the impacts of COVID-19, and outlines the government's significant support and ongoing commitment to delivering practical measures to listen to and support young Australians.

              I will not be supporting this referral to a select committee, for the same reason that I haven't supported Senator Roberts or Senator Canavan. I refer again to page 485 of
              <i>
               Odgers'
              </i>
              , where the Senate had resolved or put a proposition forward that there should be only three select committees at any one time. If this referral were to go to a reference committee that already stood I would support it.
