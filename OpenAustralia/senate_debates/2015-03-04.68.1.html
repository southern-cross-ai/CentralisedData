        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Senator Birmingham. In my engagement with communities relating to the need to balance economic development with minimising environmental harm, community confidence is key to progress. Will the minister confirm that in his request for advice to the

        </a>
        dated 26 February 2015 relating to the Watermark project, he stated that the advice sought from IECS in April 2013, two months prior to the enacting of the water trigger amendment, met the legal requirements of the

         I thank Senator Wang for the question and, given the question contains some very specific informational requests, I thank him for the prior warning. As you, and I am sure many other senators, are aware, the Minister for the Environment, Mr Hunt, has stopped the clock on the Watermark coal project to seek further information from the Independent Expert Scientific Committee on Coal Seam Gas and Large Coal Mining Development. This will ensure that the most up-to-date scientific information is utilised for the assessment of the project under our national environmental laws. This follows Minister Hunt taking the step of visiting the area and listening to the concerns of farmers—

               Whilst, as I understand it, Senator Wang is correct about that letter, I am advised that an amended request by the then environment minister, Mr Tony Burke, was submitted to the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IESC" rel="nofollow">
                IESC
               </a>
               on 17 April 2013—after the original request had been withdrawn. The amended request included reference to the water trigger—because the water trigger legislation had been introduced into the parliament by that stage. The amended request was submitted to ensure that the IESC advice to be provided did include consideration of that water trigger then before the parliament.

                 I can confirm that Minister Hunt issued a notice on 24 October 2013—that was one of the first actions he took as the Minister for the Environment—notifying the proponent of the Watermark coal project, and of course the public, that the water trigger would be applied to the project. The notice was published on the

                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IESC" rel="nofollow">
                  IESC
                 </a>
                 since they provided their advice, which again is standard practice. The project was going through the

                 approval system until the final Planning Assessment Commission report was provided to the Commonwealth on 29 January this year. That is when the Commonwealth assessment recommenced. As I indicated in answer to the first part of the question, subsequent to that the minister has taken the step of stopping the clock on this project to ensure that the most up-to-date and relevant IESC advice is taken into account so that we have the most robust scientific information to make an informed decision.
