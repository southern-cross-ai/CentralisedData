         We've seen numerous times in this place individuals take to Facebook, take to public platforms, to express views which we don't agree with, whether it's supporting criminals, like those to my right, the Greens—

            On the point of order, it is quite a broad question, but in my view it does need to be restricted to meanings or potential meanings or imputations of that particular comment, rather than observations on others, to be directly relevant. But it is very broad, I must say, in that sense. I call Senator

                 could paraphrase what I think the Deputy Prime Minister was talking about, he was reflecting on Mr Christensen's comments in the chamber and clearly articulating that he didn't support them, that he supported following the medical advice. He himself is also following the health advice right now, as he is in lockdown in Armidale,

                   [by video link] The Deputy Prime Minister has also said: 'I'll say that to my colleagues, I can assure you that when you've got a thin margin, don't start giving reasons for a by-election.' Did Mr Morrison's Deputy Prime Minister give that advice to the Prime Minister?

                      [by video link] Why does Mr Morrison continue to prioritise protecting his own job over protecting the jobs and lives of ordinary Australians? When will he finally take responsibility and stand up to the extreme elements of his own party room who are spreading dangerous misinformation?

                       I completely reject the premise of Senator Ayres' question. How absolutely ridiculous. The Prime Minister, our government and, I would have hoped, the entire parliament here in Canberra has had one focus for the last 18 months: assisting Australians to get through this global pandemic together; making sure we encourage people to get vaccinated, even with
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AstraZeneca" rel="nofollow">
                        AstraZeneca
                       </a>
                       —we've got a chief medical officer in Queensland who can't even say the word 'AstraZeneca'—where there is no vaccination shortage, if you're going to choose that particular vaccination; and working with states and territories. We've got millions of Australians right now in lockdown and they're not able to get to work. It is our government that is actually supporting them with individual disaster payments should they lose hours of work. It is our government, in partnership with both Liberal and Labor state governments, that is supporting those small businesses who are subject to lockdown.
