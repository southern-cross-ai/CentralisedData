        My question is to Senator Conroy, the Minister representing the Treasurer. Can the minister outline to the Senate the importance of the $42 billion National Building and Jobs Plan announced yesterday to our ability to withstand the global recession?

         I thank Senator Moore for that question. The Rudd government has taken decisive action with its $42 billion investment to support the economy and jobs. In the current economic climate there is an overwhelming case for the Nation Building and Jobs Plan. As I outlined yesterday, these are almost unprecedented economic times. There is a global recession and the outlook has deteriorated sharply in the last few months. We know that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMF" rel="nofollow">
          IMF
         </a>
         has cut its forecast for global growth three times in the last four months and is now forecasting a deep global recession. We know that, in all, six of Australia’s top 10 trading partners are now in recession. We know that the global recession has wiped $115 billion off government revenue and has imposed a deficit on the budget.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am continually amazed that those opposite just do not quite yet understand how serious the economic emergency is, which must explain—it is the only rational and logical explanation—why they continue to play short-term political games rather than facing up to these challenges. Australia is better placed than most countries, but we cannot completely resist the pull of these international forces. That is why the Nation Building and Jobs Plan is so important.

           Given the conditions that we face, the government is taking the only responsible action to support growth and jobs in the face of the global recession. We had a choice of further spending from the temporary deficit or higher unemployment. We make no apologies for choosing to save Australian jobs and fight for Australian jobs. Those opposite will stand condemned. If only they had had the opportunity to wait another few hours before their shadow cabinet met, because one of their great criticisms is that it will not be spent. The retail figures for December that came out this morning blew a large hole in the argument of those opposite because what it showed was a major increase—

              IMF
             </a>
             supports payments to increase spending and stimulate the economy—no less than authority than the IMF. This demonstrates yet again how out of touch Mr Turnbull and those opposite are with the lives of Australian families, workers and the experts. Mr Turnbull should go to the schools around the country and explain to them why they do not need decent libraries, halls and refurbishments. Mr Turnbull should travel the country, because once again Mr Turnbull is putting his own self-interest ahead of the national interest.

                   In the face of a worsening global financial environment, and indeed the onset of a global recession, we have taken decisive action to support the Australian economy. We outlined the economic security plan before Christmas. We outlined a

                   </a>
                   package. We outlined a $6.1 billion long-term plan to assist the Australian automobile industry and associated component industries. The world economy is going into recession. This is driving Australians onto the unemployment queues. What this stimulus package is designed to do is to support and protect jobs and to try to ameliorate that. So let’s be clear about this: the economic illiteracy of those opposite—

                      Those opposite well know the cumulative impact of the measures taken by the government last year and this year will be delivered over time. The government has been absolutely upfront about the fact that the global recession will impact on growth and jobs here—absolutely upfront. That is why the government has taken decisive action: to limit the impact of the global recession on Australian jobs. The Nation Building and Jobs Plan will help support up to 90,000 jobs over the next two years.

                       , I have a supplementary question. Will the government release the Treasury modelling, as referred to by the Treasurer in a television interview this morning, which underpins this claim that the package will support 90,000 jobs?

                        As those opposite well know—and practised themselves—Senator Minchin many, many times and Senator Coonan before him consistently refused to release Treasury modelling. They consistently refused to release it. We on this side know there is no quick fix or silver bullet when you are facing a global recession. To come in here with simple short-term politics and display complete amnesia from just over 12 months ago, when you were on this side of the chamber, simply shows that these questions are designed to not face up to the challenges that we are currently embroiled in.

                         , I have a second supplementary question. If it is the case that this package will support 90,000 jobs, will the minister confirm that each of these jobs will in fact cost taxpayers $230,000 per year?

                          That is an absolutely absurd question. It has no sensible place, because those opposite know that there is no sensible calculation involved in deriving those numbers—none whatsoever. We will stand by the Treasury’s modelling on this ahead of Senator Abetz’s and Senator Minchin’s mickey mouse, back of the envelope projections. But what we will be watching for over the weekend, when you go back to your constituents, is for you to start telling them they cannot have the $600 or the $950, when you stand there and start saying to Australians, ‘Look, we’re sorry—short-term politics says we have to say no to this, but don’t you worry if you lose your job. We’ll be in there playing short-term politics,’ because that is what is going to be at stake here. When you vote on this, that is what is going to be at stake here. You are going to be putting Australians on the unemployment queue.
