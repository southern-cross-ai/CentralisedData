             When asked whether the board had urged Senator Conroy to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of the NBN, Ms Smith-Gander said:

               </a>
               project was not about technology, it was not about marketing and it was not about spin; it was, in essence, a giant construction project. Again, NBN Co's former deputy chair let the cat out of the bag. She said that NBN Co's model of layer upon layer upon layer of subcontractors—the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Lee" rel="nofollow">
                Sarah Lee

              <p class="italic">
               You had to go four up the chain until you actually got to one of the head contractors. I don't think that's the right way to have relationships with the people who work for you.
              </p>
              <p>
               There were too many layers of management and not enough efficient execution. It was obvious to the board, the construction firms and the coalition that the previous government were not focused enough on execution. And the only person who could not see that was Senator Conroy.

                 Ms Smith-Gander's remarks remind us of how important it is to learn why the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
                  NBN
                 </a>
                 failed under the previous government. We are ensuring that the truth is told and that lessons are learnt. We asked NBN Co's new leadership to review the project. This work revealed the truth about Labor's plan: that it would cost $73 billion and take a decade to finish. We have asked

                 </a>
                 to audit NBN Co's governance. That work is almost complete and we look forward to receiving it. We have also asked Mr Bill Scales AO, former chairman of the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">

                 </a>
                 , to audit the policy process which resulted in the NBN. It will be fascinating to learn what due diligence Senator Conroy and his colleagues undertook, it will be fascinating to hear from where they obtained their advice and it will be fascinating to learn the basis for Senator Conroy's promise that taxpayers would earn a return of 7.1 per cent on invested capital.
