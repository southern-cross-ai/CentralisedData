What formula did the Minister for Resources apply in making the decision to ensure that the recent announcement didn't contravene the government's own 43 per cent emissions reduction target and Australia's commitments under the Paris Agreement?

In the meantime, we need to transition from the current position that we find ourselves in to that 43 per cent reduction, and the way in which we're going to do that—

                                       Thank you, Senator Grogan, for your advocacy on climate and other progressive issues over many years. Those on this side of the chamber understand that action on climate change isn't just good for the future of the country, it isn't just necessary because of the situation we see around the globe; it's also good for our economy and it's good for Australian jobs. That's what it's good for. I know this is difficult for those opposite to understand. After nine years of the climate wars being a centrepiece of their political project, it is hard for them to understand that there is actually a way forward that is about jobs and about dealing with climate.

                                             tell you why? Because we know those on the other side will do anything not to talk about climate change. You will do anything not to talk about climate action. You will do anything not to debate the bill. You will do anything to ignore that the Australian people clearly voted for action on climate. You can't bear it, can you? You can't bear it. You can't bear it that the climate wars that you thought would continue to yield a political dividend might actually end. You can't bear it.

                                             , that President Reid in 1999 made this point: that questions may not be asked on the detail of the bill or debate, but otherwise the topic is not barred from questioning. I know that it's a hard thing, isn't it? If you're a member of the coalition, you just don't want to talk about climate, because Senator Payne doesn't agree with Senator Canavan, and Senator McKenzie doesn't agree with Senator Ruston. They are utterly divided on this. They are utterly divided on this, and the voters know it.

How will the Albanese Labor government climate policies deliver on action and put an end to the coalition's climate wars?

                                                         I'll take the interjection from Senator Watt—they've lost their reason for being, which is a decade of the climate wars preventing progress. Now what are you going to do? What are you going to do when the bill comes before the chamber? The question for the Liberal Party and the National Party is: will you learn from your mistakes? That's the question for the coalition.

It's a dreadful thing to actually want to advise the parliament, isn't it? It's such a dreadful thing! I know it seems like an odd thing, that you'd actually want to try and advise the parliament!

However, concerns have obviously been raised externally by others, including, I think, the senator and others who have been in the media. I'm advised that these are being dealt with by the Chubb review, which I'm happy to give further information on when I can find that piece of paper.

I can say to him, as someone who, unlike some in this place, does believe in the benefits of utilising the market for good, rather than for bad, that we do need integrity in the system of carbon credits to ensure that there is additionality, that we're actually reducing Australia's emissions and using an incentive to do so. I have seen some of the reporting, including, as the senator says, from firms engaging in the market. I understand the concerns he's raising.

As you pointed out, given the need for transparency and accountability and, ultimately, integrity in our carbon markets, will the government commit to including a review of the regulator as a function of the Chubb review?

As I said, these are matters which are being discussed publicly. We understand the need for integrity in the market, particularly if, as we hope, the legislation which the opposition don't want me to talk about passes this change. Then, obviously, there would be a framework which would incentivise that. I think that the terms of the review as I understand them from the advice I've received do extend to scheme governance, and that's appropriate.
