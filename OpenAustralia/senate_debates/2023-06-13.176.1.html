        On 24 February 2022, Russian troops launched an assault on Ukraine with a view to completely undermine the sovereign and democratic rule of that nation. The war has now been waged for almost 16 months, with countless lives lost on both Ukrainian and Russian sides. Last week, Russian forces blew up a dam that supplied drinking water to thousands of Ukrainians, ruining nearby agricultural land. Incredible loss of life has followed. This is a heartless attack on human rights. The war itself is an attack on the concept of state sovereignty and an attack on a democratic government.
       </p>
       <p>
        Here in Australia, we're blessed to be a nation with strong democratic rule and clear geographic borders. Unlike our counterparts in Ukraine, most Australians have never known what it's like to live through a war or live in fear of our lives. But many of us—immigrants or the children of immigrants—have at least some connection with the displacement, the turmoil and the horror of war. Whilst Australia's history is far from perfect, our nation is one to be proud of and one worth protecting. The stories of Ukrainian civilians fighting on the front line to protect their nation fills me with the same sense of pride I get from the stories of our Anzac heroes. Ukraine, too, is a nation worth protecting. I commend the advocacy of Ukraine's Ambassador to Australia, Vasyl Myroshnychenko, and his efforts to ensure that the war in Ukraine remains at the forefront of Australia's mind. It cannot be left to the Ukrainian people to fight alone. Russia's continuous attack on Ukraine is an attack on democracy and therefore an attack on all democratic states. As a fellow democratic nation, Australia has already done so much, but there is much more to do, to assist the Ukrainian people in any way we can in their fight to protect democratic self-governance.

        Over the weekend I attended the National Labor Women's Conference in Fremantle, which adopted a motion circulated in my name and that of my fellow Labor colleague from Western Australia Tatyana Igonina to continue to support the women of Ukraine. Tatyana is of Ukrainian heritage but was raised in Uzbekistan. Her son Temur is an international chess grandmaster and is close friends with Ukrainian grandmaster Igor Kovalenko, who now spends his days fighting to protect his country. Tatyana told me of a call her son had with Mr Kovalenko, in which they could hear from bomb sirens outside his house. This is a stark reminder that the conflict in Ukraine is not a distant problem.
       </p>
       <p>
        The motion at the conference this weekend promised Labor's continued support for Ukrainian women, through humanitarian aid and assistance with the recovery after this awful war is over. Women and children have especially been targeted by Russian troops. I'm sure we all recall the horrific images of the bombed maternity hospital in Mariupol early last year, with women in labour being removed from the ruins of bombed hospitals and day-old babies being pulled from under the rubble. Russia's indiscriminate attacks are in complete contravention of the law of war and the Geneva conventions. This motion passed over the weekend by Labor women is a symbolic gesture of

        Another way we can support the effort in Ukraine is by improving bilateral relationships with Ukraine's neighbouring states. On Thursday, Senator Paterson and I will be hosting the inaugural combined event for the Parliamentary Friends of Estonia, the Parliamentary Friends of Latvia and the Parliamentary Friends of Lithuania. Their excellencies Kersti Eesmaa, the Estonian Ambassador to Australia; Margers Krams, the Latvian Ambassador to

        </a>
        ; and Darius Degutis, the Lithuania Ambassador to Australia, will be in attendance to discuss improving the bilateral relations between Australia and their respective countries. This event and these friendship groups have been formed with the express intention of improving Australia's relationship in the area and enhancing strategic cooperation. Through this, Australia can have a stronger presence in north-western Europe and better placed to provide and support and gain a stronger grassroots understanding of regional issues like the war in Ukraine.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's through democratic cooperation, including improving relationships with foreign embassies and ambassadors, that Australia can strengthen and support democracies around the world. In a time where dictatorial governments and international polarisation are still on the rise, democracy is more important than ever. By supporting the success of Ukraine in the war effort, Australia is ensuring the success and resilience of a democratic government, an ultimate ally. Australia has always been referred to as the lucky country, and I truly believe we are. We have our own challenges, but we have enough bounty and blessing to ensure we never abandon our democratic friends in their time of trial. Ukraine, we stand with you.
