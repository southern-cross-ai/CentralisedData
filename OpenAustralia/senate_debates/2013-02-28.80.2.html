        My question is to the

         Leader of the Government in the Senate
        </a>
        . I refer to the Prime Minister's plans to visit
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         Western Sydney
        </a>
        and her visit to the Rooty Hill
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        on 12 August 2010 in the closing days of the last election campaign. On that election visit, the Prime Minister told the people of Western Sydney and, indeed, Australia that she would bring the budget back into surplus in 2013 and that Australia's net debt would not exceed six per cent of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
         GDP
        </a>
        . It is now around 10 per cent. Given that the Prime Minister has broken both these fundamental election promises about the budget—solemn promises, which in fact underpin her ability to deliver everything else—why should the people of Western Sydney believe anything she tells them when she condescendingly drops in to Western Sydney to see them again in March 2013?

           No Liberal government has ever achieved this coveted trifecta from all three global ratings agencies; it is the first time in our nation's history. When Senator Abetz talks about 'delivering everything else', what he wants to ignore is all of the promises and achievements of this government that have been delivered. Our economy has grown by 11 per cent since Labor came to office. We have September-quarter growth at 3.1 per cent, compared to the 10-year average of three per cent. Those opposite describe this as having 'no pulse' and 'flat lining', yet three per cent is higher than the 10-year average. There is low unemployment at 5.4 per cent, which is well below the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
            OECD

           This government takes an exceptional job creation record to the people of

            Western Sydney

           : around 847,000 jobs have been created since Labor came to office. We have inflation at 2.2 per cent—

            —does the minister agree that what the people of Western Sydney really want from this government is a plan, not just a visit when the polls turn sour? If the government is fair dinkum about helping the people of Western Sydney, why won't it abolish the carbon tax, which both increases the cost of living and destroys jobs, stop the boats and commit to build the WestConnex?

             There will be more to come if Mr Abbott becomes the Prime Minister of this country, because cutting services is what Liberals do—it is in their
