           I am interested that Senator Cormann has asked me about taxing petrol, because I was surprised to find his comments in the chamber, in September 2007, where he said of Mr Howard's emissions trading scheme: 'This will be the most comprehensive
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETS" rel="nofollow">
            ETS
           </a>
           , in the world, broader in coverage than any scheme currently operating anywhere; a world-leading scheme to cover 70 to 75 per cent of total emissions. By including large emitters alone, the scheme would cover 55 per cent of total emissions; however'—and this is the best bit,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
            Mr President
           </a>
           —'by including transport and other fuels the coverage of the scheme is significantly increased.' So Senator Cormann used to back an ETS which covered petrol.
          </p>
          <p>
           What happened? Senator Cormann used to come into this chamber and say, 'Yes, we are going to have a great scheme.' and: 'We would have had a great scheme under Mr Howard. We would have had a scheme that covered 70 to 75 per cent of total emissions, including transport and other fuels.' So when Senator Cormann stands up in here and tries to play a bit of politics with the carbon price, one might recall that in this chamber he previously supported an emissions trading scheme with wide coverage, including transport and other fuels. People can judge the legitimacy of his question knowing that background.

             , I ask a supplementary question. Clearly, unlike former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, the minister did not understand that Copenhagen was one big failure. Can the minister explain why the government considers that carbon emissions from coal are more harmful than carbon emissions from petrol?

              The government has made very clear its view about the importance of pricing pollution, and the reason we want to price pollution is so we start reducing it, because—and this is pretty intuitive—as long as something is free, it will keep occurring.

                The reason we want to price pollution is that, unless we put a price on it, we will keep polluting. The whole point of pricing pollution is to give an incentive to pollute less, to invest in clean energy and to tackle climate change. It is true that we have to work through how you transition a very highly carbon-intensive economy like Australia to a low-polluting economy. As we have taken this policy forward, the Australian people will have seen that we have been very focused on how we do this efficiently, effectively and at lowest cost.

                 , I ask a further supplementary question. The Prime Minister said that there will be no carbon tax on petrol under the government she leads, because people in outer suburban areas have no choice other than to use petrol. Given evidence that, irrespective of a carbon tax, the main electricity generator in

                 , will not have any choice but to use more coal to generate all the necessary electricity to ensure Western Australia's energy security, can the minister explain why the government would impose a carbon tax on electricity generation when all it does is push up the cost of electricity without doing anything to reduce global emissions?

                       My point of order is in relation to the requirement for the minister to be directly relevant to the question. There was a very specific question: why would the government impose a carbon tax on electricity generators like
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verve_Energy" rel="nofollow">
                        Verve Energy

                       </a>
                       when it will do nothing to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions because Verve will continue to use coal in order to ensure energy security in WA? The minister can quote my speeches from four years ago—and I am flattered that she reads them—but it is not directly relevant to the question.

I assume the reason he supported it at the time was that, as we know, putting a price on pollution is the most economically efficient way to ensure we reduce our pollution and shift to a lower carbon economy.
