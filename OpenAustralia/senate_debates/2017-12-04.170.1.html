           The Australian government carefully considered the Senate Community Affairs References Committee report's findings and recommendations and have coordinated a whole-of-government response. The report made 30 recommendations, and the recommendation calling for a royal commission is the only recommendation not agreed. The government does not consider that a further inquiry is needed. The report's findings and recommendations, as well as the work being done in relation to state-based inquiries, have informed the development of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
            NDIS
           </a>
           Quality and Safeguarding Framework. The arrangements outlined in the framework will address many of the issues raised in the inquiry. The government is establishing a national independent body to protect people with disability and prevent them from experiencing harm arising from poor-quality or unsafe support or services under the NDIS.

              Labor announced in May that, should we win the next federal election, we would establish a royal commission into violence and abuse against people with disability. The continued abuse of Australians with disability by people who are meant to care for them demands a royal commission. People with disability experience much higher rates of violence than the rest of the community and, in many cases, this violence occurs in places where they are meant to be receiving support. Children with disability are at least three times more likely to experience abuse than other children. People with disability and their families have been campaigning for a royal commission for years. Only a royal commission has the weight, authority and investigative powers to examine these horrific accounts of abuse and violence against people with disability. Labor calls on the government to now establish a royal commission into the abuse of people with disability.

                 , how long it would be in my short tenure here before I sat within this place filled with disgust, but I guess we now know. Over 150 submissions were made to the Senate inquiry into this issue and, of the 30 recommendations made, the call for a royal commission was probably the most substantial. So, in its opposition to this motion this evening, the government is saying to those 150 submission makers that it simply doesn't care. It is absolutely disgraceful, and I will vote for this motion with pride.
