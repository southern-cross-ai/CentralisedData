       <p class="italic">
        (iii) a world-leading Australian innovation in the World Mosquito Program's use of a naturally occurring bacteria (Wolbachia) is a safe, natural and effective way to combat the threat of disease – this self-sustaining method protects communities without posing a risk to natural ecosystems, and

        (iv) the program to reduce the threat of mosquito-borne diseases was pioneered by Australian researchers, starting as a small research project in Cairns in January 2011, with the support received from the Queensland community – it has now become a major global health collaboration operating in 10 countries, including Australia, Kiribati, Fiji, Vanuatu,
