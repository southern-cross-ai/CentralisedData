        My question is to the Minister for Defence, Senator Johnston. I refer the minister to his mocking comments about the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        of submarine builder
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASC" rel="nofollow">

        The guy's a fascinating submarine sustainer but I'm not sure he's built too many himself.
       </p>
       <p>
        Why is the minister so intent on breaking his promise to build 12 new submarines in Adelaide that he is now personally denigrating someone who has built and maintained all six Collins class submarines at the ASC for the past 25 years?

         It may be that we have one submarine builder in Adelaide, because we have not built one for 20 years. I want to say that, when I was appointed to this particular ministry, I was told two key facts by the department with respect to submarines. Firstly, that the inaction of the previous government meant that we were facing a very serious capability gap because of the planned withdrawal date of the Collins class submarine. Of course, Senator, you would be aware that this is a vital piece of strategic deterrence to us, given we have most of the value of our $1.6 trillion economy using the sea. Secondly—

        </p>
        <p>
         I note that I am being interrupted by the person sitting at the table leading the opposition. She knows the truth about the value of this program. The estimated cost of the future submarine program was said to me to be more than $40 billion. Essentially the same figure was handed to me from the previous government. That is the whole program cost for 12 submarines.

             supported the $40 billion price tag by saying, in 2009, that they thought the value of 12 submarines built in Adelaide would be $36 billion. Taking into account the cost of inflation, the out-turned dollar value of a 20-year build of 12 submarines is—

                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASC" rel="nofollow">
                   ASC
                  </a>
                  to show me their costings. It is a one-page document based upon a piece of computer software, where you fit in a 4,000 tonne submarine in terms of materials, and out pops a number. They do not even know our top-end requirements. They have never designed a submarine at ASC. They have never designed a submarine.

                   I rise on a point of order. The minister is referring to a document. I was wondering if the minister would table it for the Senate. He is inviting people to know.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Here is your chance: table it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The PRESIDENT: Minister, do you have anything on the point of order? There is no point of order, Senator Conroy.

                    The opposition is fully aware of the problem that is confronting the government with this program. Having done nothing they are now saying, 'You should be doing something.' They did nothing because they had costed it at an out-turned dollar value of $88 billion.

                     I have a further supplementary question. Why has the minister resorted to trashing the hard-working men and women of the Australian ship and submarine building industry in order to justify breaking his promise? Isn't it time that government held a competitive tender process for our new submarine fleet so that the Australian people can be confident that the submarines were chosen on merit, not the personal bias of the minister?

                      was delivering no submarines in 2009 for $1 billion. ASC was delivering no submarines for Australia in 2009 for $1 billion. They have no improved their output, thankfully, after two or three visits from Mr Coles to tell them how to do it properly. They are $350 million over budget on three air-warfare destroyer builds. I am being conservative. It is probably more than $600 million but because the data is so bad I cannot tell you. You wonder why I am worried about ASC and what they are delivering to the Australian taxpayer! Do you wonder why I wouldn't trust them to build a canoe? What they have done on the air-warfare destroyer I have had to—and
