        on the work to date of the task force and on Defence abuse at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force_Academy" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force Academy
        </a>
        were tabled in parliament. Mr Len Roberts-Smith and his task force team have worked very diligently in often difficult circumstances to deliver outcomes for former Defence members who have alleged that there has been abuse against them. In their dealings with complainants on these very serious and difficult matters, they have demonstrated empathy and compassion.
       </p>
       <p>
        The DART was created to provide Defence personnel who have complained of physical abuse, sexual abuse, harassment or bullying with an avenue for resolution through counselling, reparation payment, participation in a restorative-engagement process and other more traditional means, such as administrative sanctions or criminal action against the perpetrators.
       </p>
       <p>
        I recognise that considerable work remains to be done. Further support is required for those who have contacted the task force. The government is determined to ensure that the task force's terms of reference are fully and independently discharged. While the task force was due to conclude on 30 November 2014, the government has decided to extend it with a view to bringing its important work to a timely and appropriate conclusion.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Attorney-General and I have appointed the current deputy chair of the task force, Mr Robert Cornall, to lead the task force and accelerate its work. As a former secretary of the Attorney-General's Department, Mr Cornell brings a wealth of experience to this position. In response to Mr Roberts-Smith's recommendations regarding the Australian Defence Force Academy, I have also directed the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Defence
        </a>
        to engage the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_Discrimination_Commissioner" rel="nofollow">
         Sex Discrimination Commissioner
        </a>
        to work with me to examine the issues raised in the report on Defence abuse at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADFA" rel="nofollow">
         ADFA
        </a>
        . I have worked with Ms Elizabeth Broderick in the past and she has a great deal of credibility on this issue. She is a strong advocate for women, she led the review into the so-called ADFA skype incident and she is very familiar with both ADFA and the wider Defence community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I recognise the harm done to some people. I am working hard—indeed, I am committed—to ensure that where harm is done, the men and women of the ADF have a place to go that is independent, a place where outcomes are fair and transparent. The government will respond in the near future to these reports and will consider Mr Robert-Smith's recommendations, including that of a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Commission
        </a>
        being conducted with respect to ADFA. We will consider those recommendations very carefully.
