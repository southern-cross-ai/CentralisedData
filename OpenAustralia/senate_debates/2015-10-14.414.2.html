        Minister, I want to go back to an issue that we started talking about earlier in the day before going on to other evaluation issues: the issue of when you are looking at the evaluation process. For a start, you outlined how the collection of data sets is going to make up the baseline information.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_I" rel="nofollow">
         If I
        </a>
        understood what you were saying correctly, the state government and the Commonwealth government are going to be looking at various data sets. Is that a correct understanding of the baseline evaluation process?

          What is the time frame for the collection of that data? Will that be collected prior to the commencement of the trial? I will leave it at that, firstly.

           I think that things will be measured pre, during and after. There will be data sets before, data sets during and data sets after. I cannot give you detail as to exactly what data sets will be received and when particular data sets feed into which particular components of the evaluation. I just do not have that information, sorry.

            I have a specific reason for asking this, and that is why I was talking about baseline data. During the committee inquiry process there seemed to be some doubt as to whether there would be adequate baseline information collected. That is why I am asking specifically about the data sets—so that we have a baseline from which to evaluate.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the problems with evaluating the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
             Northern Territory
            </a>
            intervention has always been that there was not that key data set—a baseline data set—available. I am particularly pursuing this line of questioning to find out whether we will in fact have an adequate baseline data set from which to evaluate and whether it will be available before the start of the trial and whether it will be publicly available so that we all can see what that baseline data is.

              South Australia
             </a>
             n government to establish the appropriate baseline data sets. Whether it can be released publicly or not, I do not know. I guess one of the considerations would be whether, in a small community, data sets could potentially identify people. I do not know—I am not familiar enough with it—but I know that there are some reasons why particular data sets in particular formats might not be able to be released. I am just surmising on that point. I think that it would be the intention to make available the baseline data sets in the interests of transparency, because I think everyone wants to see what the results of the trial are.

              Thank you for that. Our experience with the

               NT
              </a>
              intervention is that anything less than 20 just has 'less than 20', and that has been generally acceptable. That is a way that we can get around that particular issue. If that is in fact the intention, that would be a good start. Is the government intending to provide extra funding to the state for this data collection and for the ongoing evaluation? How much funding has been set aside for this process?

                Firstly, where extra data is needed beyond what they generally collect, have you considered that? Secondly, for the evaluation per se, have you set aside a particular level of funding to ensure we have money available for a thorough process?

                   There will be qualitative as well as quantitative. The nature of the qualitative work will be interviews, feedback, focus groups—not in the sense of focus groups that we might be more familiar with, but there will be a range of different mechanisms to seek that qualitative input.

                    I want to go back to the original question. In relation to the independent organisation that will carry out the qualitative analysis, will the government go through the normal process of tendering it out, and what funding is allocated to that? Is that the process that will be used?

                        The reason I am asking is that it is quite clear from the evidence we have heard, both in this chamber and in the inquiry, that not all income support recipients in the Ceduna area have been consulted. If that same process happens again, you will get a skewed evaluation. That is why I am asking whether there is a commitment that all participants will be involved. What is the commitment to having an independent process where there is not a selective analysis or consultation with people?

                            I want to go to the questions I was asking earlier about commitment of funding to like-size communities who have similar sorts of issues so that we have an adequate comparison between a community that is getting the sorts of wraparound services that you are providing—$1 million worth of services is quite a significant injection of services—and a community that does not get that. Many communities do not get that. How will you compare apples with apples if you are looking at the impact of the card versus the impact of the services? I go back to where I was heading before we went off on another issue. Will you be looking at a like community that does not have the card but that is receiving the services so that we can then look at the impact of card and the impact of the services? Many of us would argue that those services are key. I will say again that it is really good that services are going in. This is so we can look at what the impact of those services is and what the impact of the card is.

                              So that I am not verballing you: does that mean you will be having a comparison community where you are putting in that level of services but they do not have the card? I want to be really clear about this.

                                 Minister, before you answer that question, I have a supplementary question to that one. It is in terms of the fact that one of the core aspects of the trial was an audit of the current services and then community consultation to augment those current services. I am interested to see whether a similar process has occurred anywhere else with quite a specialised preparation. In the paperwork we received on the trial, it was very clear that there had been a specific audit of the current services in the region and discussions with the state government about the services they are providing and then, on top of that, with community consultation, Minister Tudge provided the augmentation of the million dollars. In terms of having a direct comparison, will there be any place that would have had that same degree of service focus to make that kind of comparison, or are you preparing to have a more general process about similar services rather than the same?

                                       I am finished with the evaluation framework for the time being. I want to go to issues around the package of early childhood services. The letter to the shadow minister says that Ceduna was prioritised as one of the 10 communities in the early childhood services $20 million commitment.

                                         Thank you. My next question is related to that, and that is: if it was after, does that mean that there will now be 11 communities, or did one community then miss out? I am trying to work out whether they were getting the funding anyway, or if it means that there is another community that is now missing out or in fact whether we have an extra community. I am not complaining if no-one was kicked out.

Going back to the community panels that we talked about earlier, during the community affairs hearing there was a range of discussions about how they would operate. In your previous answers this afternoon, you were really clear that this was going to be determined by the community. We understood that was the process. I asked on the day at the community affairs inquiry: is it possible to have a range of options within the same community around this assessment process? We talked at the time and I raised the issue on the

                                                            about the fact that members of the community would feel more comfortable with different people. We talked in the discussion with the department that afternoon about whether it would be someone from Centrelink or a community determined panel, and whether the same people from an Indigenous community would be assessed by the same people as by the non-Indigenous community. This range of discussions occurred, and my understanding when I went away from that meeting was that it was still under consideration; however, there could be the possibility that there would be a range of options all determined by the community and all agreed by the minister to suit a number of the people in the community. I am just wondering whether that variation is still under consideration.

I understand what you are saying, which is that the community will be determining how to run it. I still hold concerns about what the minimum standards I was asking about earlier are, and who therefore makes the decision that there may be several bodies?

It is important that there is consistency and integrity in the decision making so people understand that. I am just trying to clarify: is it an appellable decision so that, if you go to the body and ask to change from 80-20 to, say, fifty-fifty and the group or the authorisation says no, is this an appellable decision as I would understand an appellable decision under the act?

I will seek some advice on that. The initial advice, and I guess this is the ultimate advice as well, is that the minister could override a panel decision. Someone could raise it with the minister as to whether there is an avenue below the minister. The minister will review the operations of the panel in addition to that at least every six months. In terms of how the processes operate, how the particular body operates, to some extent that will still be the subject of consultation.

If you recall, we were talking about small communities with a small number of people who are going to have to front up to people who, in a lot of instances, they know quite well to air their personal views or opinions. Given that, I would have thought that there was even more reason for the fact that you would need an appeal process. There is a big gap between going to the local community body and to the minister.

You are talking about putting in place another process where people can have a review outside the minister?

I suspect I could almost answer my question because I will get told 'the contingency fund', but what are the processes that you have agreed with the community will be funded in terms of sitting fees, operational fees, secretariat—this is obviously going to be a very sensitive issue, so there is going to have to be due process around this community body. What are the processes that you have been discussing and that you have established to ensure those due processes when dealing with very personal information and the direct impacts on people's lives? What funding has been made available, and what other things would be funded through this community body?

Each individual member of the local community body would be required to sign a declaration of confidentiality confirming that they will not disclose any protected information of trial participants. As I was saying before, there will be further consultations to ensure that it is an appropriate review process that will be set up to allow an independent review of decisions separate from the board.

As you have just pointed out, there will be statutory obligations, which means that it needs to have an adequate level of funding to support it. That is why I was asking that, why I was putting it in that context. What funding has been made available?
