         The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) The net impact of the efficiency dividend on the department for 2012-13 was a reduction of $8.166m: $3.040m is attributable to the original 1.5 per cent efficiency dividend and $5.126m is attributable to the additional 2.5 per cent efficiency dividend.(2) The department adopted an internal budget strategy that complied with the Government's expectation of no forced redundancies. Targeted savings from contractors and consultants, international and domestic travel, hospitality and entertainment, media and advertising, printing and publication expenditure and delivery of training was also included in the department's budget. Voluntary redundancies were offered and contracts for non-ongoing employees were not renewed beyond 30 June 2012 where appropriate. A rigorous recruitment process was put in place which applies to every vacancy within the department. When a vacancy occurs it is to be filled from within the department if possible, prior to external recruitment action being commenced.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) Employee expenses accounts for 64.14% of the 2012-13 budgeted expenses.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) A net reduction in (a) staff and (b) consultants and/or contractors expenses is included in the approved 2012-13 budget for the department. The amount of the reduction cannot be specifically quantified.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (5) (a) 24
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) none
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (6) The table at Attachment A details the current full-time equivalent staff distribution across classification bands.
