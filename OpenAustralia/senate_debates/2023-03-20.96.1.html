        My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, and Minister for Emergency Management, Senator Murray Watt. Minister, what assets does the Commonwealth have which could be used to help remove dead fish from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darling_River" rel="nofollow">

         Thanks, Senator Davey, for the question. As Senator Davey is well aware, the Commonwealth is always open to the option of deploying
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Defence Force
         </a>
         personnel to assist in any natural disaster, if requested by the state government. I am not aware of any request having been made by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         government for that form of assistance. I'm happy to be corrected, if such a request has been made. But, of course, the other point to be made is that the Menindee Lakes fish deaths, while absolutely tragic—and I think all of us have been very disturbed by the footage from there—do not constitute a natural disaster, so I'm not sure whether there is even the capacity to deploy the Defence Force, even if such a request were to occur. If Senator Davey is aware of a request having been made by the Defence Force, I'm happy to be made aware of that, but I'm certainly not aware of any request having been made.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, it's not uncommon for the opposition to call for the deployment of the Defence Force and other federal assistance when it hasn't been requested by state governments. We saw Senator McDonald do that in a radio interview last week in relation to the floods in north-west Queensland, only a matter of hours after I'd informed her that no such request had been made by the Queensland government. But never let things get in the way of making a political point when that can be made!
        </p>
        <p>
         As I said, I think we are all concerned by the large-scale fish kills that are being captured on footage at the moment at Menindee Lakes, and this, of course, is the second time in four years that we've seen this occur. While this is still being investigated, it seems that it's mostly caused by blackwater and the low oxygen that results from that. The fish kills have been caused by flooding, combined with high temperatures, which is what causes that low oxygen that flows from blackwater.

                      Thank you. As the minister is well aware, six years and $15 million have been spent researching ways to deal with and remove large volumes of dead carp from our waterways under the National Carp Control Plan. What are some of the ways that the National Carp Control Plan proposes for large-volume dead fish clean-up that could be offered to

I also understand that an emergency operations centre has been activated at Menindee to coordinate multi-agency operations. The centre will ensure fresh and clean water supply is maintained to the Menindee township, as well as coordinate the removal and disposal of fish. Of course, the tragic events we do see unfolding at Menindee are yet more proof to fully deliver the Murray-Darling Basin Plan—something that the former government were unable to do in all their years—

                          Senator Davey, not only have I looked at the National Carp Control Plan but also I have looked at in particular the fact that it was first announced by the then minister, Mr Joyce, back in May 2016, and was supposed to be delivered in 2018. Four years later, when the coalition lost office, it still hadn't been delivered. I don't remember this level of outrage around your own government having failed to deliver the National Carp Control Plan that it said would be delivered in 2018.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          The carp plan is complete, although the report that has more recently been received by the government provides insights into the feasibility of the carp virus as a biocontrol agent. There are uncertainties about its efficiency and effectiveness in safely removing carp from our waterways. I am surprised that the National Party—being the environmental vandals that they are—want to get out there and immediately release a virus into the Murray-Darling.

                               I have a point of order, thank you, President. My point of order is that the minister has reflected poorly on every senator in here who is a member of the National Party by calling us environmental vandals. I ask him to withdraw.

                                 I withdraw, but I am surprised that the National Party want to release the carp virus into the Murray-Darling when there are serious concerns about the effects that it would have.
