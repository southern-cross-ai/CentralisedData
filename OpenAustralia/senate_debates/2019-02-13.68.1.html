        , Senator Cash. I refer to what Minister Dutton said yesterday about the Liberal-National government's strong measures to secure our nation's borders. Can the minister further update the Senate about what measures the government has implemented to stop the boats and combat the people smugglers?

         I thank Senator Hume for her question. As we have said today in debate on the bill that came before the Senate, the Morrison government, the Liberal-National government, understands that the fundamental priority of a Commonwealth government must be the security of Australia's borders. We make no excuses for that at all. When we came into office in 2013, we said we would put in place the right policies to ensure that we stopped the boats, we stopped the deaths at sea, we got the children out of detention and, ultimately, we were able to close the detention centres. That was a tough suite of policies. We put in place turnbacks, a policy that those on the other side said would never work. Well, guess what? Turnbacks have worked. We also have a fundamental commitment to offshore processing. That is something that, again, has been integral to the policies that we put into place. Of course the third part of the suite of policies was temporary protection visas.
        </p>
        <p>
         You need to be tough but fair when it comes to border protection in Australia. The policies that we have put in place have been successful. Why? Because, as Senator Hume knows, you do not blink when it comes to national security. You do not blink when it comes to securing Australia's borders. If you do, what do you see? Fifty thousand people arriving on over 800 boats, as with the border protection policy of the other side, and 1,200 deaths at sea that we know of. We will always maintain our resolve in relation to Australia's border security.

            Absolutely. Statements made by those on the other side and legislation that is now in place, supported by those on the other side—our intelligence agencies have been very, very clear—will absolutely give a clear signal to the people smugglers that, because of the actions of the Labor Party and Mr Bill Shorten, under a Labor government they will be back in business.
           </p>
           <p>
            Mr Morrison has today indicated that we will now be reopening the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island" rel="nofollow">
             Christmas Island
            </a>
            detention centre. But what else? This legislation that has gone through now gives those in the people smuggler trade the opportunity that they have been wanting to take for a very, very long time. The only reason they were unable to take that opportunity was because of the policies put in place by the Liberal-National government.

               Clearly, if Mr Shorten is prepared to weaken Australia's border protection whilst in opposition, can you honestly imagine what a Labor government led by Mr Bill Shorten would do if they were ever in government? The last time Labor were in government they sided with the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
                Australian Greens
               </a>
               in the Labor-Greens coalition and they dismantled the Howard government's strong border protection laws. In 2013 the people clearly voted for the Liberal-Nationals government to stop the people smuggling trade, and that is exactly what we did. In opposition the Labor Party have clearly indicated what they are prepared to do if they are ever elected to government. The legacy is there. We cannot afford to ever blink when it comes to border protection. (
