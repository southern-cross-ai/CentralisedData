          CJ
         </a>
         260 has been circulated as a request for the reasons given in the circulated statements. The amendment would enable regulations to be made that may then allow eligible entities to receive quarterly refunds of research and development tax credits rather than annual refunds. The amendments have no effect on the amount of the tax credit or offset but only on the timing of the refund, therefore the tax credits will be subject to reconciliation at the end of the financial year and any adjustments made then.
        </p>
        <p>
         This scheme depends upon administrative action being taken under regulations to be made by the Governor-General. If under the regulations an entity fulfils the requirements, it will then be eligible to receive the quarterly tax credits. Thus, if there is an effect on a charge or burden on the people through increased appropriations, it occurs only after this rather convoluted process. The possible effect on the appropriation is therefore only indirect.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the past the Senate has regarded only a very direct effect on an appropriation as an increase in a charge or burden on the people within the meaning of section 53 of the Constitution. It is also apparent that the amendment will not increase the total amount of offset credits to be paid. The precedents of the Senate do not support the amendment being moved as a request and it will, therefore, be treated as an amendment. With the concurrence of the committee the statement of reasons in relation to this matter will be incorporated into
         <i>
          Hansard
         </i>
         . There being no objection, it is so ordered.

          On the running sheet there is reference to clause 3, schedule 1, concerning a start date for the operation of the bill. I had circulated an amendment in my name and I understand the opposition has circulated an amendment to the same effect. Which amendment will you be taking as having precedence?

             The Senate
            </a>
            has long accepted that an amendment should take the form of a request if it would have the effect of increasing expenditure under a standing appropriation. If it is correct that these amendments require the Commissioner of Taxation to refund amounts payable from a standing appropriation, it is in accordance with the precedents of the Senate that the amendments be moved as requests.
           </p>
           <p>
            These amendments extend the com­mencement date from 1 July 2010 to 1 July 2011. This particular issue is one that has been of significant contention right throughout the process and one that the opposition suggested should occur from the outset of the discussion of this legislation. Unfortunately the minister, in the initial stage, was not prepared to consider this but, of course, the passing of time that we have all discussed and noted since the legislation was first put into the chamber has effectively necessitated the fact that this date should be changed. I do note that we have gone past the second commencement date as well but, given that we both agree that these amend­ments should be passed, I think that we might as well get on with that. Even though the opposition does not support the legislation as it stands for the reasons I stated earlier in the second reading debate, these amendments should be passed as part of this process.

             I understand that we are trying to process these matters as quickly as possible. I am not able to support the opposition group of amendments although I do support the change in the start-up date. Given the time that has now elapsed, I think it is appropriate that the start-up date be 1 July 2011. As I understand it there are a number of other amendments within this category which the committee has decided to take as a whole that go to a range of other matters, which, given the changes that have now occurred with other amendments, are no longer necessary. I propose, Mr Chairman, that we reject this group of amendments and support the government's amendments which are moved in the next block, which have the same effect of changing the start-up date but do not go to a range of other measures which are now obsolete because the Tax Laws Amendment (Transfer of Provisions) Act 2010 has commenced. The presumption in these amendments as they were moved in their original form, particularly relating to amendments (23) and (25), is that the provision of that act would not apply. Part 5 of the bill is, therefore, not incorrect and amending the bill in the manner suggested by the opposition is unnecessary.

               If that is the ruling, I indicate to you that the position of the government remains the same as I have indicated. I believe that schedule 1, item 1 as listed by the government covers this ground more effectively and has the same effect in terms of changing the start-up date.

                    I indicate that the government does not support this amendment. The govern­ment has accepted the recommendations of the Senate Economics Legislation Com­mittee in relation to the object clauses. Therefore we have sought the changes necessary throughout the consultation process. The measures here, we argue, have been carefully considered and well conceived and clearly reflect the policy intent of the bill. The bill will support R&amp;D where the knowledge produced can be either general or in applied form. Such knowledge can range from blue sky research through to experimental development in a production environment. The proposed modification would actually impede the understanding of the bill and not do, as I understand, what the opposition senators are seeking to do. The government's position is that we do actually need to have that broad definition as it is indicated in the bill.

                      <p>
                       I want to thank the opposition for the approach they are taking on this matter. This has been a long process of discussion but I do want to emphasise the importance of the dominant purpose test in terms of the integrity measures that the government seeks to pursue through this bill. The proposed amendments will permit some firms to claim business-as-usual expenses under the R&amp;D tax incentive and therefore would undermine the integrity of these arrangements. It would have quite serious implications, of course, in terms of the financial implications of this bill.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       The dominant purpose test for supporting activity is in fact vital to the measures in the bill, that is, to prevent leakage of the incentive to business-as-usual production activities that are mainly being conducted for reasons other than supporting core R&amp;D activities. So the improved targeting of this incentive is a key feature of what we are trying to achieve here. If the package is to provide the increased rates of assistance, that is doubling the level of support for small enterprises and increasing it for medium-sized enterprises by one-third, there need to be opportunities to ensure that there is some integrity in these arrangements. We need to be able to ensure that the assistance with cash payments for innovation start-up firms is able to be delivered in a manner which will not blow the whole finances of the scheme. The dominant purpose test applies only to supporting activities, not to the core R&amp;D activities. Therefore narrowing the application of the dominant purpose test will not result in any more core activities actually being undertaken. If you look to the work of

                       , he states that the dominant purpose distinction:
                      </p>
                      <p class="italic">
                       … neatly excludes from the concession activities which, though directly related to the R&amp;D project, would take place with or without the R&amp;D project and so are therefore no part of the full incremental costs of the R&amp;D project.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Dr Gruen in his report also states:
                      </p>
                      <p class="italic">
                       The dominant purpose test has been designed to remove from assistance production activity for which there is very little policy rationale for assisting. It is overwhelmingly activity which would take place in any event because it would take place without the R&amp;D project being undertaken.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       So the proposed amendments would create difficulties for firms around this whole threshold issue. In some years they would have to apply for the dominant purpose test and others they will not.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       The proposed amendment will not reduce any compliance costs for the R&amp;D tax credit. Firms will still be required to distinguish between core and supporting R&amp;D activities when applying for the R&amp;D tax credit. A wide range of support will be available to assist claimants, including small and medium-sized enterprises, in the transition to the new program. I made very sure of this in terms of the budgetary arrangements that underpin these measures so that we can have extensive guidance material available for administrators. There will be a hotline to advise claimants and there will be a formal advisory function of AusIndustry to provide advance findings so that there will be certainty in the arrangements entered into. And there will be additional funding of $31 million over four years which has been allocated to AusIndustry in the 2009-10 budget to increase the resources available for administration of the new program. I might also add that further protection as to the assertions that I am making, about the purpose of these changes, is guaranteed by the establishment of the review mechanisms in the legislation through the R&amp;D board which will allow us to be able to measure the policy intent in terms of how it is actually being implemented. I am very confident that the R&amp;D board, given the personnel that are available on that, will be able to sort the wheat from the chaff in regard to any administrative high jinks that people might claim that people get up to when it comes to administering these types of schemes. So in respect of a range of levels to protect the integrity of the scheme and to also ensure that we do meet out commitments in terms of the policy intent, I believe there are very strong guarantees built into these arrangements for this bill.

So by reinstating the obsolete 50 per cent threshold, the amendment would facilitate tax planning entities which are not truly small and medium sized enterprises and could manipulate their structures to inappropriately access the 45 per cent refundable tax offset.

                           This is one of the areas that I spoke about during my speech in the second reading debate. The government was making claims about claims that were not verifiable. It is trying to limit industry's access to R&amp;D. Yet those that were clearly outside that process were being investigated. We have also had discussions over the last week or so where the government says it is going to do one thing in one piece of legislation but its actions in another area actually operate in a different way. So you have in this bill, as we read it, that it makes changes to qualifying arrangements that only allow for claimants to receive assistance where R&amp;D occurs away from the building site and we know, having discussed this at estimates, that there are circumstances where the R&amp;D actually does occur on site. Yet the Green Building Fund processes assume that no additionality is required. So we have the circumstance in the Carbon Farming Initiative where the government was saying to us, under that piece of legislation, they wanted to protect agricultural land. Yet, in moving to lock up 430,000 or 572,000 hectares of forest in Tasmania, you are going to move the forest industry out onto the agricultural land in Tasmania, because you need 100,000 hectares of plantation to make up for the land that you are locking up under the other process. So you can forgive people for being confused about the government's approach in relation to these matters, where they say they want to do one thing in one piece of legislation and head off and do something completely different, and in fact the opposite, in another measure. It is on that basis that we believe that this amendment should be supported.

                            The government does not support this amendment. The bill merely replicates a longstanding exclusion on expenditure on the actual acquiring or construction of a building. It has always been part of the legislation framework within the R&amp;D regime. This is a policy that has been supported by successive governments, including the Howard Liberal government.

This too will increase amounts paid out under a refundable tax offset, which would be met from the standing appropriation in section 16 of the Taxation Administration Act 1953, and the amendments are therefore presented as requests.

                              The government does not support these measures. The expenditure not at risk rule is an important integrity arrangement within the existing R&amp;D regime. The removal of the expenditure at risk rule would open up a loophole that currently does not exist.

                                    The government takes the view that it is important to ensure the integrity of this program, and therefore asking firms to identify their core and supporting R&amp;D activities separately is in fact a reasonable proposition. The new rules in the bill will allow administrators to shine a light on claims which should not be supported by taxpayers' dollars.
