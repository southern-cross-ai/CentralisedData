        , Senator Ruston. How is the Morrison government ensuring people with disability and their carers have access to appropriate and accessible information during the coronavirus pandemic?

         I thank Senator Chandler for this really important question. Clearly the coronavirus is going to impact disproportionately on certain groups in our community. These groups are more likely to be at risk of contracting the virus and more likely to have poorer health outcomes—none more so than many of our people who live with disability. So making sure that people with disability, their families and their carers can access information about such issues as preventive measures, good hygiene and where to get the appropriate supports that they might need to get them through the pandemic has never been more important.
        </p>
        <p>
         That's why the government has provided additional funding for a disability information hotline, specifically directed to providing advice around the COVID-19 pandemic. This free 1800 number is available from 8 am to 8 pm, Monday to Friday. It provides information, referrals, support, and emotional support and counselling to people who are impacted by either living with disability or supporting somebody who does live with disability. We've made sure that our staff are highly trained so that they can understand what the person needs and provide them with the information and support that they may need. We are making sure that our staff are directing people to information about where to get
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPE" rel="nofollow">
          PPE
         </a>
         and where to get food relief, if they need it. And we're just making sure that there's a friendly voice on the end of the phone if these people want someone to talk to. We're delighted to say that, since April, a number of people living with disability, their carers and supporters have used the services of the hotline. Over 2,700 calls have been received—many telephone based but also online. More than 1,700 of these calls have been able to be referred to appropriate services to support people in their particular areas of need. We want to make sure that, through this process, people who live with disability are able to get flexibility and choice around the services they need.

            The government absolutely recognises the significant effect that this COVID pandemic is having on the mental health of all Australians. People who live with disability are also significantly impacted by this, whether it be through isolation, meaning that they are kept away from people who might be supporting them or their loved ones, through social distancing or through a number of other restrictions that have been placed on Australians. That's why we have provided additional support to all Australians. In recent times, an additional $12 million has been made available to make sure that people in Victoria have access 24 hours a day, seven days a week to health services like Lifeline, headspace or Kids Helpline. We want to make sure that services are available so that people can seek support and get the counselling they need. This is part of a $500 million mental health package that's been put in place by this government to support mental health during this pandemic.

               Clearly, positive experiences with support workers, carers and advocates for people with disability are absolutely critical in reducing or minimising harm and trauma. It helps to foster a trauma informed recovery and healing process. We, as the government, are funding the development of a best-practice guide to make sure support for people with disability is appropriately targeted to their experiences and to make sure that it is trauma informed.
              </p>
              <p>
               The government is providing funding to Blue Knot, a well-known supporter of counselling services, to develop this guide. Blue Knot has actually already developed similar types of guides. In fact, they published the
               <i>
                Practice guidelines for clinical treatment of complex trauma
               </i>
               . The guide will help to build better capacity of organisations and practitioners to help them better understand complex trauma and make sure that the response, particularly to people with disability, is informed by that information. This work is part of—
