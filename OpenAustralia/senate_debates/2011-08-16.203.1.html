        asked the Minister representing the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, upon notice, on 16 March 2011:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        With reference to travel behaviour change programs:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        How many positions are currently employed within the department specifically related to encouraging active transport, such as walking and cycling.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Can information be provided outlining the history of funding and the national approach to travel behaviour change programs.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Can an outline be provided of the current pool of funding and resources for a nationally coordinated approach to travel behaviour change programs, for example: (a) are there dedicated TravelSmart behaviour change programs within each state and territory; and (b) how does the Commonwealth invest in them.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To what extent is investment in active transport infrastructure, as a conditional requirement of all Commonwealth funded urban road and passenger transport projects, being promoted within the department, including, for example, shared/cycling paths, end of trip facilities and public transport nodes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Transport behaviour change programs bring together a range of mutual benefits for our transport and health systems â€“ with the new Australian National Preventive Health Agency established in 2010, has there been any effort to link these common agendas; if so, how; if not, why not.

        <p>
         The Minister for Infrastructure and Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The Major Cities Unit is responsible for the Department's activities within cities such as active travel. As of 31 March 2011, it had an average staff level of 6.8.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The Department has not funded any specific travel behaviour change programs. The Minister for Infrastructure and Transport launched the National Urban Policy on 18 May 2011. This included a $20 million Liveable Cities program, announced as part of the 2011-12 Budget, to support projects that improve the quality of life in our cities, including those that promote active travel through walking and cycling.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Various states and territories provide their own TravelSmart (or equivalent) behaviour change programs. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Government
         </a>
         does not currently provide funding to these programs. In 2008-09, the Government invested $40 million for the construction of cycling infrastructure under the National Bike Paths Projects component of the Jobs Fund.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         There is currently no formal conditional requirement for active transport infrastructure in Commonwealth funded urban road and passenger transport projects.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         There is no formal link between the Department and the Australian National Preventative Health Agency in relation to transport behaviour change programs.
