        My question is to the Minister for Defence. I refer to the minister's comments last Friday, when asked about the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Navy" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Australian Navy
        </a>
        's involvement in Operation Sovereign Borders. The minister said he was 'not aware of operational matters'. However, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_the_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">

        and the

        </a>
        are responsible for the health and safety of Defence Force personnel under the Work Health and Safety Act—a duty which, according to section 14 of that act, cannot be transferred. How can the minister possibly carry out his obligation to ensure the health and safety of our Navy personnel if he is not aware of what they are being asked to do as part of Operation Sovereign Borders?

         has sought and issued a declaration of exemption relating to personnel who carry out specific on-water activities under Operation Sovereign Borders. He has acted in accordance with his authority under the Work Health and Safety Act 2011. Illegal-entry vessels on the open ocean were already an inherently unsafe working environment; and, indeed, may I remind the senator that 50,000 people on 800 boats have underlined how unsafe. Our Navy personnel and our Customs personnel have had to deal with that level of safety due to the public policy failure of the former Labor government. A declaration of exemption will prevent personnel involved in specific on-water activities associated with Operation Sovereign Borders, who are therefore implementing government policy, from being subject to penalties for breach of Work Health and Safety Act provisions in appropriate circumstances. And I remain interested to see what the Labor Party's attitude to that will be in due course. This—

             , I ask a supplementary question. On Friday, the minister also said that he was concerned about nine-day turnarounds and post-traumatic stress for Navy personnel involved in Operation Sovereign Borders. But, when asked to explain incidents involving the Navy, the minister said, 'No, I can't—they are on-water matters that are not my responsibility.' All Australians are concerned about our Navy personnel, but the minister is the one who is responsible for their safety. When will this minister take that responsibility seriously?

              personnel, particularly those involved in this phenomenal policy failure. I will deal with cases of post-traumatic stress in the way they should be dealt with. I will provide the resources, the professional personnel and all of the services necessary to ensure the recovery of affected personnel and to ensure they do not suffer any permanent mental illness from what they have had to deal with because of the dysfunctionality and negligence of the previous government. All water operations related to Operation Sovereign Borders are the province of the Minister for Immigration. The fact is that the Navy has done an amazing job in dealing with more than 50,000 people on 800 boats.

Hasn't the minister's refusal to take responsibility for the health and safety of Navy personnel in Operation Sovereign Borders—as demonstrated again here today—or to answer any questions about it, allowed a cloud to hang over our Navy personnel? Is it not time the minister allowed the Navy to respond and to clear up the mess that this government's secrecy is creating?

                   The program, which I support and will continue to support, comprises a predeployment resilience brief, an annual mental health and wellbeing screening, a screening interview by a psychologist, specific tailored screening, and support in the event of combat or trauma exposure, including referral for further detailed clinical assessment and treatment as required. Until this policy failure, we did not require such treatment for our sailors. We do now because of you!
