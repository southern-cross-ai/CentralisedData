         I thank Senator Bragg for the question. We know that the search for a vaccine is one upon which the world is focused. Without a vaccine, as we know, we won't be able to return fully to the life we knew prior to COVID-19, and you only have to look at the changes that we've had to make here in the parliament as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Australian government is taking targeted action to ensure that Australians have access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines if and when they become available. Our strategy is fourfold. The first is in research. We've allocated over $358 million towards research in relation to vaccines, preventions, treatment and respiratory medicines. Most significantly, there's been an investment of $5 million in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
          University of Queensland
         </a>
         molecular clamp. Another vaccine funding round has opened, and the government expects to receive the peer reviewed recommendations shortly. The second is in direct procurement with leading international vaccine candidates. We have already announced our agreement with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AstraZeneca" rel="nofollow">
          AstraZeneca
         </a>
         , and negotiations are advanced with multiple other candidates. The third is in participation in the international Covax Facility, which is an international consortium to give participant nations access to a variety of potential vaccine candidates. It acts as a common platform for investment in return for common participation in whichever vaccine is successful. And the fourth is in onshore manufacturing capacity for a vaccine in Australia either directly or under a licence, including through
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSL" rel="nofollow">
          CSL
         </a>
         . We're confident that these investments and actions will secure early and sufficient access to a safe and effective vaccine.

            As the Prime Minister and the health minister stated last week, the government signed a letter of intent with a
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
             UK
            </a>
            based drug company,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AstraZeneca" rel="nofollow">
             AstraZeneca
            </a>
            , which means Australians will get access to the University of Oxford COVID-19 vaccine for free should trials prove successful, safe and effective. The government and AstraZeneca have committed to working together so that all Australians will get access to such a vaccine. Of the 160 different vaccine projects in the world, the Oxford vaccine is one of the most advanced and promising. Crucially, the letter of intent between the government and AstraZeneca covers all of the steps that are needed to bring a new vaccine to market. It covers vaccine development, production and distribution. The government will continue discussions with many of these developers while at the same time backing Australian researchers. We will continue to take advice from our best medical, scientific and manufacturing experts.

              As we await the development of a vaccine, why is it important to maintain social distancing and practical health steps to minimise the risk of transmitting the virus so we can reopen and grow our COVID-safe economy?

               As the entire world watches and waits for a vaccine, it has never been more important to observe appropriate health precautions. The second wave that the state of Victoria is now experiencing has made it abundantly clear how vigilant we need to be in observing practices like social distancing. In June and July of this year we saw positive signs of economic recovery in the states that have supressed the virus. As we minimise the transmission and the risk of transmission, we minimise the risk of harming the economy.
              </p>
              <p>
               We must all exercise an abundance of caution and continue to follow the medical advice on the practical steps that will keep us all safe. Again, stay 1.5 metres away from other people, whenever and wherever we can; maintain good handwashing practices, and coughing and sneezing hygiene practices. Stay at home if you're unwell and get tested if you have respiratory symptoms or a fever. And, of course, download the COVIDSafe app so that we can find the virus more quickly.
