         I think Senator McDonald would know that we agreed to that as part of our election campaign, and the comments of Minister King that she referred to reflect that. There is a range of other spending around that program. I think in the budget it was funded as part of a broader package with other elements in it, and we are currently working through all the details around that. We want to make sure that there are appropriate business cases and due diligence and that the spending is the right amount of spending that should be allocated to that. That is the work that I've been reflecting on for the last question times here, about doing an assessment essentially that every dollar that was committed in the previous government's last budget is actually quality spending going where it's needed. That's the work we are doing.

           A week later, on Tuesday 20 September, at a press conference with the Treasurer, Minister Gallagher said in reference to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Arm" rel="nofollow">
            Middle Arm
           </a>
           project: 'We are looking at them all, all of those commitments, line by line.' Seven days earlier Minister King had committed outright to the project. Minister, who is telling the truth: you or the infrastructure minister?

            It's a shame you can't rewrite your supplementary questions in light of the answer I just gave. In that press conference we were asked about a range of programs, and we are reviewing all of them. We are reviewing every single measure in the budget, but there are a range of measures that we matched. The work we are doing is to make sure that the money that was allocated is the right amount of money to go to that program because, forgive us over here, some of your budgeting was pretty dodgy, to be honest.
           </p>
           <p>
            We are a grown-up government where ministers do their jobs. We don't have a Prime Minister taking responsibility for every portfolio and making decisions based on apparently nothing. We want the evidence and we want the assessment. The

               I don't think I could have been clearer about the original question, because I did answer that straight up. In terms of the other outcomes of the decisions that we have been taking through the budget process, you will see those reflected in the budget process. As you did in your budget, we are going through them line by line.
              </p>
              <p>
               We have to make some savings, we have to reprioritise, we have to make sure that the precious dollar that's going out the door is actually going where it's needed. In some cases grants under your government went where proponents didn't even know they had applied for it.
