        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Water, Senator Wong. On 30 May 2023, Minister Plibersek said that the Albanese government was:

          I'd urge you to listen. Minister, why does the so-called co-design partnership apparently not include farmers or, indeed, any other Australians holding private property rights, who will clearly be substantially impacted by any changes to the law?

            I am not sure of the context of the quote that the senator is using. If it's something similar to what Ms Ley said when minister—she said:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            … it needs to be addressed through a national conversation. … This is about the government working with
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
             Indigenous Australians
            </a>
            and recognising their right to determine what is important to them.
           </p>
           <p>
            So said Ms Ley.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would make the point that I have no doubt that Minister Plibersek will, if there are any changes that are proposed, ensure that stakeholders—all stakeholders—are consulted. I know Minister Watt is very consultative in his portfolio with some of the sectors, industries and communities that you reference. I think it is regrettable that the opposition is using the concerns that people have about some state legislation, which I understand, but you people are using it in order to try and fuel some fear about what this government is doing, when we are actually taking a very similar approach to that taken by the previous government.
           </p>
           <p>
            I go back to the response I gave in, I think, the answer to the second supplementary that Senator Cash gave me. We did have the destruction of Juukan Gorge, and we all, including the company concerned, recognise what a tragedy that was, that destruction of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
             First Nations
            </a>
            heritage. And there was an agreement across parliament that we did need to ensure that this didn't happen again. And I regret that the tenor of the questions to me today demonstrates that that bipartisanship, in some quarters—
           </p>
           <p>
            You may snort, Senator Cash, but I actually think there are some things which should be bipartisan, and it is disappointing that you don't seem to think so.

              I'll preface this again by saying these laws, and the Labor approach to these laws, are having a significant impact on regional communities, particularly farming communities. Minister, can you guarantee that the Albanese government's cultural heritage laws will not follow the West Australian Labor model of imposing penalties of up to $1 million for individuals and $10 million for corporations, as well as jail terms—massive penalties in jail terms—for even inadvertent breaches? If not, why not?

               As I said in relation to an answer to Senator Cash, we will not be adopting or duplicating existing state and territory regimes. What we will be doing is modernising Indigenous heritage protection laws in Australia. And I'm grateful for Senator Duniam who on 28 November last year said that the Juukan Gorge events:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               … were so disastrous that they made it very clear that comprehensive work needed to begin, as a matter of urgency, on modernising Indigenous heritage protection laws in Australia.
