        My question is to Senator Ludwig in his capacity as Minister Assisting the Attorney-General for Queensland Flood Recovery. Can the minister please advise the Senate on the progress of Commonwealth support for the Queensland recovery and reconstruction effort following the series of natural disasters over this summer?

         I thank Senator Moore for her question. As a Queenslander I note that she has been truly in the thick of it in Queensland during the January flood events. I note the commitment to supporting the rebuilding and reconstruction in Queensland following such a devastating summer of natural disasters. Since the series of natural disasters that have occurred, the Gillard government has taken decisive action to support Queenslanders through the crisis recovery and the rebuilding phase of these events. To date the government has made over 380,000 payments of the Australian government disaster relief and recovery payment totalling approximately $447 million to support individuals. Further wage assistance in the form of the Disaster Income Recovery Subsidy has been paid to over 51,000 people, with a total payment of approximately $22.7 million to people affected by the floods.

         and state governments have also moved to activate the natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements to provide targeted support for those in need. Yesterday I announced with Premier Bligh an extension of category D concessional loans to cover a defined portion of 39 local government areas. Eligible businesses, primary producers and voluntary not-for-profit organisations that have incurred extreme damage will be able to access up to $650,000 as a concessional loan with up to $50,000 provided as a grant component. When I went to Dalby and Emerald and Tully the community told me that the $250,000 concessional loans did not provide enough support for people who had suffered extreme damage. These new concessional loans reflect the feedback and the community views that I heard during these visits.

          Thank you, Minister. What further assistance has been made available to local councils in areas of Queensland impacted by floods and Cyclone Yasi? Can the minister update the Senate and give us further information as to the government’s action to support local councils?

           I thank the senator for her question. On Saturday the Deputy Prime Minister, the Queensland Treasurer and I announced the Queensland local government package. This $315 million package is directly targeted to support the repair of critical infrastructure and utilities and to support employment not covered by the natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements. Through this package the Gillard and Bligh governments are continuing to support the essential local government work that is so needed to get the communities back on their feet. The package includes up to $265 million to the Queensland Reconstruction Authority to fast-track these repairs of damaged infrastructure across Queensland. This will go towards the priority repairs of severely damaged water and sewerage infrastructure owned by local councils. It will also provide up to $145 million to support the reconstruction of the Brisbane ferry terminals and the Brisbane River Walk. In addition there is an upfront payment—

            Minister, my final supplementary question goes to the responsible financial management required to provide this most needed assistance to Queenslanders. Can the minister inform the Senate of any action that would impact upon Commonwealth support for our state?

             I thank Senator Moore for her second supplementary question. In the debate on the government’s flood levy senators were able to put nuances and thoughtful contributions on the public record as the Senate considers this matter, so I will not go to the substance of that bill. The announced flood levy and associated saving measures are the sensible course of action to manage the Commonwealth’s financial obligations.

             While the government has been consistently working and delivering for the reconstruction of Queensland, what we have heard from the Liberals opposite is nothing but pure politics on this issue.

             senators have spent much of their contributions to this debate attacking the member for O’Connor, Mr Crook, settling petty party squabbles, rather than addressing the national interest of supporting the rebuilding of Queensland,
