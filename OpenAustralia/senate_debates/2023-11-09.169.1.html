        I rise to take note of the annual report of the

        </a>
        and the first annual report of the Domestic, Family and Sexual Violence Commission. Both the Australian Institute of Family Studies and the Domestic and Family Sexual Violence Commissioner are undertaking work to end the scourge of domestic, family and sexual violence, work that is inseparable from the work of all governments, policymakers, service providers and Australians. Addressing all forms of violence is a national priority, so the evidence of greater priority in some areas of need is inescapable and irrefutable. The evidence is there about areas of particular need. Domestic violence rates in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        are seven times higher than the national average. More than half of the prisoners in the Northern Territory jails are there for domestic violence offences, and, in their wake, there are often already traumatised, vulnerable families.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Prime Minister was asked in Darwin last Saturday if his government would change the structure of federal domestic violence funding, which is currently based on population rather than demand, to needs based funding. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PM" rel="nofollow">

        's answer: 'Funding announcements would have to wait until the May 2024 budget,' as if money is the single answer. PM, accountability is personal accountability, organisational accountability and leadership accountability. There is a case for special attention in the Northern Territory because women, children and the elderly experience higher rates of

        than anywhere else. The reporting by victim-survivors is low; therefore, what data is available doesn't show the true extent.

        </a>
        Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price are right to focus on the areas of greatest need. The coalition's call for an audit of Indigenous-specific funding is based on evidence. An audit would identify delivery and progress gaps in programs for Indigenous Australians and shine the spotlight on everyone in the service delivery supply chain. For the most vulnerable children and for adults abused, a royal commission into child sexual abuse is necessary to focus on solutions and on improving their lives. The need cannot be in dispute but your will to close the gap is.

        One year ago, we were told there was a 10-year national plan with an ambition of ending domestic violence within a generation. From there, there were two national action plans. If you want to end violence within a generation, common sense and evidence suggest the greatest impact will come from responding to children, those already in prison and the most vulnerable, as well as those identifying and escaping domestic violence, and those who identify escalating behaviour of concern. Without taking from frontline services, if you really want to stop intergenerational impacts then prevention and early intervention must be given greater focus.
       </p>
       <p>
        More than 58 women have been killed in male-perpetrated violence in 44 weeks in Australia, and six women were killed in 10 days last month. There are also the lifelong consequences for loved ones.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Darwin, where the PM flew in on his way to yet another foreign destination, the largest-ever coronial inquiry into the deaths of four Northern Territory women is hearing harrowing evidence of systemic issues surrounding family violence. And that is being heard as we speak today.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sure, DV knows no boundaries, but respond in greater measure to where the evidence points you. Recent estimates hearings confirmed your election announcements are not necessarily outcomes. On top of your claims for cheaper mortgages, cheaper power that have not materialised, the ever-increasing working poor, there's your own election promise of 500 new frontline workers for the DV and family violence sector. We know that at 12 months not one of your promised front-line workers was in place, and we won't know how many are in place until reporting in early 2024. Australian taxpayers saw you spend $450 million on your failed referendum. Imagine if you spent that instead on family violence or on much-needed emergency housing for those fleeing.

        November 25 kicks off 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence, an annual international campaign for the elimination of violence against women. Every bit counts. Every action matters. To create safer communities, action—not announcements—will speak louder than words. Accountability, not announcements, will speak louder than words. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
