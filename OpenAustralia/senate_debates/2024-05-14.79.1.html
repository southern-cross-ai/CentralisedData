        My question is for the Minister representing the Minister for Communications. Watching free sport on our
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">
         TV
        </a>
        is part of the Australian way of life. Whether it's the footy, the cricket or watching the Matildas in action, sport brings us together as a community, whether you're rich or poor. The government's new communications bill will stop this for Australians who watch free-to-air TV over the internet—an increasing number as fewer and fewer aerials are sold. No more free sport for them. As we struggle to get our kids off social media and outside into the fresh air, we should be doing everything we can to give them sporting idols to look up to in their lives. Will the minster please explain why this government won't ensure the antisiphoning rules truly protect the right of all Australians to watch free sport no matter how they access their television services?

         Thanks, Senator Lambie, for the question. Like you, I very much enjoy watching sport on free to air, and I know many Australians do as well. Of course, some of us choose to go for Queensland teams, but others make the wrong decision and go for another state! You can't help everyone. The issue that Senator Lambie does raise is obviously an important one. We have seen a very big move towards pay

          TV
         </a>
         to be able to watch some of the leading sporting events in our country, and that is something that is of great concern to the Albanese government.
        </p>
        <p>
         I know that Minister Rowland, as the communications minister, has been working on this for quite some time. Under Minister Rowland's leadership, the government has reviewed the antisiphoning scheme and antisiphoning list and is in the process of amending both to recognise the contemporary media environment. So—as a position statement from the government—we are absolutely committed to maintaining free access to events of national significance, including sporting events. The antisiphoning scheme is a key mechanism for achieving this. We did commit to reviewing the scheme in the context of the 2022 federal election to ensure that it remains fit for purpose in a contemporary media environment. Although there was broad support for the objective of free access to important sporting events, submissions to the review highlighted differing views on key issues.
        </p>
        <p>
         There has been a particular issue, I know, regarding the telecasting of women's sport, which is growing in popularity in a massive way—the Matildas, our netball teams and a range of other sports as well. There has been hug progress in the recognition of women's sport in recent years, and I know that Minister Rowland is particularly interested in ensuring greater parity in the broadcast of women's sporting competitions and events.
        </p>
        <p>
         The bill currently before parliament is a significant expansion of the scheme, and it does address a gap under the current scheme through which Netflix, Amazon and other online—

           Recent data shows that just 61 per cent of Australian free-to-air
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">
            TV
           </a>
           viewers watch it through an aerial and that that number is going down. Recent data also suggests that watching sport and having a common passion is a great way to enhance social cohesion, something that seems to be lacking in this country. As more and more high- and medium-density housing is built, fewer aerials and ground stations are going up. Why is the government ignoring these figures and leaving those Australians behind to watch sport only via paid streaming services?

              You're obsessed with deals—get a grip. As I said, this is an issue that Minister Rowland is taking very seriously. I share—and I know Minister Rowland shares and the government as a whole shares—your concern that Australians should have free access to major sporting events that are of national significance. You're right, Senator Lambie: they are things that bring us together as families and as communities. We do want to make sure that you don't have to pay to see every event of that kind.
             </p>
             <p>
              That's why the bill that's before the parliament is an improvement to the system. It's about stopping some of the online broadcasters from acquiring exclusive rights to events without a free-to-air broadcaster having any rights. That will enhance the ability of free-to-air television broadcasters to acquire rights to iconic events.

Due to the cost-of-living crisis, just one in 10 households changed their TV in the last six months. Why won't this government let the millions of Australians who can't afford to get a new TV watch free-to-air sport?

                 Thanks, Senator Lambie. I don't agree that the way the government is approaching this will result in that outcome. As I've said a couple of times now, we absolutely share your desire for the average Australian to be able to watch sporting events of national significance on free-to-air
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">
                  TV
                 </a>
                 . It's not something that should be discriminated against on the basis of your wealth. We understand there is a role for pay TV in the media environment, but there are certain events that should be preserved for free-to-air TV. So, as I said, the bill that's before the parliament is designed to address a gap under the current scheme through which Netflix, Amazon and other online entities could acquire exclusive rights to events without a free-to-air broadcaster having any rights. That change will enhance the ability of free-to-air television broadcasters to acquire the rights to some iconic events, noting that, where free-to-air broadcasters acquire the television rights to such events, they typically also acquire the rights for their own streaming services.
