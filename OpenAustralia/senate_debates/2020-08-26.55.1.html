        My question is for the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, Senator Birmingham. Can the minister advise the Senate of what the Morrison government is doing to diversify and expand opportunities for Australian exporters and Australian businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic?

         I thank Senator Stoker for her question and for her advocacy for Australian exporters and businesses, particularly those from Queensland. Without ever compromising on Australia's values or interests, our government works continuously to expand opportunities for our exporters right around our region and the world. Most notably, during the recent parliamentary recess we welcomed entry into force of the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, on 5 July, which will allow over 99 per cent of Australian goods exports to Indonesia by value to enter duty free or under significantly improved preferential arrangements compared with their counterparts.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am very pleased to advise the Senate that many Australian businesses and exporters are already taking advantage of the opportunities provided by our trade deal with Indonesia. Some 37 semitrailer loads of duty-free oranges have already been shipped to Indonesia this year. Some 510 tonnes of duty-free lemon and lime exports have already been shipped. Some 963 tonnes of mandarins have already been shipped. Close to 46,000 head of cattle have already been shipped duty free to Indonesia. We equally see huge opportunities for our grain growers. Ultimately, we will see next year more than 500,000 tonnes of grain able to enter Indonesia duty free, growing year on year thereafter. Frozen beef and sheep meat tariffs have halved already, and we see duty-free steel making its way to Indonesia as wellâ€”close to 5,000 tonnes already from Australian business.
        </p>
        <p>
         This, in addition to the services opportunities created and the enhancement of regional opportunities that will be put in place through the regional comprehensive economic partnership agreement, shows just how strongly we are working to help Australian business diversify their trade across our region.

            Beyond our region our government continues to pursue and negotiate the opportunities for enhanced trade with the European Union and the United Kingdom. Together there are more than 500 million consumers across those markets, where we see high restrictions, high tariffs and limited and small quotas for many of our particularly agricultural exports. Wine Australia estimates that
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU" rel="nofollow">
             EU
            </a>
            tariffs add up to 25 per cent on the import price of Australian wines into that market. Beef and sheepmeat exporters face small quotas but high tariffs in those markets, a significant imposition.
           </p>
           <p>
            Securing better, fairer access is the goal of our free trade agreements with both the EU and the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
             UK
            </a>
            , and I'm pleased to say that we have entered, through virtual rounds, the eighth round of negotiations with the EU and two rounds now with the United Kingdom. We are continuing to make good progress on those and we are determined to provide further opportunities for our farmers.

               Opening access and reducing barriers through trade agreements is one thing. We then need to provide advice and assistance to Australian businesses to be able to take advantage of those opportunities. Yesterday I was pleased to launch the Indonesia-Australia Business Connect program, a three-month digital program of market webinars led by Austrade to provide business with an Indonesia market entry guide, particularly for our food and beverage exporters; a program of webinars unpacking market access arrangements, especially for horticulture, meat, livestock and grain producers; and online education, training and skills events. This is sitting alongside a 12-part free digital
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTA" rel="nofollow">
                FTA
               </a>
               seminar series that our government is providing.
              </p>
              <p>
               So far almost 4,000 people have watched these free seminars but, importantly, they are part of the very significant growth in the number of Australian businesses we see exporting. We've managed to see growth of more than 18 per cent of Australian businesses exporting in our term in office and we want to continue to help more businesses to do so.
