        My question is to the Minister for Indigenous Affairs, Senator Scullion. Can the minister update the Senate on negotiations with state governments to shift responsibility for municipal and essential services in remote Indigenous communities from the Commonwealth to state governments?

         I thank Senator McGrath for the question. Earlier this year I announced that I would be working with state governments to reform the delivery of municipal and essential services. I am pleased to be able to update the Senate today that we have reached agreements with the Queensland,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australian
         </a>
         , Victorian and Tasmanian governments for these states to take on responsibility for municipal and essential services in remote Indigenous communities.
        </p>
        <p>
         The delivery of municipal and essential services includes the supply of power and water. The management of infrastructure is, of course, a state and local government responsibility, however, the Commonwealth government has been supporting these services in remote communities for decades. The agreement that this government has now reached will ensure that the Queensland, Victorian, Tasmanian and Western Australian governments will take ongoing funding responsibility for municipal services. The only exception is
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         which has not yet accepted the generous offer we have made to fund the delivery of municipal and essential services in remote communities in that state.
        </p>
        <p>
         The agreements we have reached with state governments include a single up-front payment that will be used to support municipal and essential services. The state governments will then take responsibility for the delivery of these services. This is a historic agreement that we have reached and it demonstrates that this government is delivering outcomes for Aboriginal and

          Torres Strait Islander

           In every town and city in Australia, essential and municipal services are the responsibility of state and local governments and it should be no different in Indigenous communities. The involvement of the Commonwealth government in funding municipal services has complicated and confused roles and responsibilities. Services have not been delivered in the way that residents in other towns and cities expect. Residents have not had to deal with two or three different levels of government to receive basic services that most Australians take for granted.

           are getting out of the way and letting states do their job. Instead, the government will focus on our priorities of getting children to school, adults into work and making communities safer. Under our approach, we will deliver better outcomes for Aboriginal and

             For many years successive Commonwealth governments have been funding municipal services in remote Indigenous communities using this inconsistent and confused approach. Since 2010 the former government—those opposite—announced their intention on an almost yearly basis to transition out of this funding arrangement but each year, extending the funding for another 12 months, failed to reach agreement. This is a significant achievement and I congratulate the Queensland, Victorian, Tasmanian and
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
              Western Australian

             governments on reaching the agreement with the Commonwealth.

             Whilst I am disappointed at this stage that the

             n government has not taken on responsibility for its residents in remote Aboriginal communities, I remain hopeful that we will be able to come to an agreement. My door remains open for the
