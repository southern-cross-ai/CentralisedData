        APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 2006-2007
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is with great pleasure that I introduce
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appropriation" rel="nofollow">
         Appropriation
        </a>
        Bill (No. 3) 2006-2007.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There are two Additional Estimates Bills this year:
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appropriation_Bill" rel="nofollow">
         Appropriation Bill
        </a>
        (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4). I shall introduce the latter Bill shortly.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Additional Estimates Bills follow on from the Appropriation Bills that were introduced into the House on the occasion of the 2006-2007 Budget. They seek appropriation authority from Parliament for the additional expenditure of money from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_Revenue_Fund" rel="nofollow">
         Consolidated Revenue Fund
        </a>
        , in order to meet requirements that have arisen since the last Budget.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The total appropriation being sought through the Additional Estimates Bills this year is in excess of $1.8 billion. That amount is partially offset by expected savings in appropriations of around $464.2 million. Taking savings into account, the expected net increase in expenditure arising from Additional Estimates Bills is approximately $1.37 billion, or about 2.1% of total annual appropriations. These savings are described in the document accompanying the Bills, the “Statement of Savings Expected in Annual Appropriations” which I will table shortly.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The total appropriation being sought in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) this year is almost $1.2 billion. This proposed appropriation arises from changes in the estimates of programme expenditure, due to variations in the timing of payments and forecast increases in costs, reclassifications and from policy decisions taken by the Government since the last Budget, most of which were described in the “
        <i>
         Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook”
        </i>
        document published in December last year.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I now outline the major items provided for in the Bill.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        An increase of $74.2 million will be made available to the

        I table the “Statement of Savings Expected in Annual Appropriations”, and I commend the bill to the Senate.

       <p>
        APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 4) 2006-2007
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Appropriation Bill (No. 4) provides additional funding to agencies for:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         expenses in relation to grants to the States under section 96 of the Constitution and for payments to the Territories, and local government authorities; and
        </li>
        <li>
         non-operating purposes such as equity injections and loans.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        The total additional appropriation being sought in Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2006-2007 is almost $637 million.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The principal factors contributing to the additional requirement since the 2006-2007 Budget include $277.4 million in additional payments to the States, Territories and local government authorities, including:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         $222.5 million to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry to support primary producers in regions that have been declared eligible for Exceptional Circumstances assistance support;

          Snowy Hydro Limited

         corporatisation agreements.  The payments compensate for the lower dividends received by these States from Snowy Hydro Limited as a result of the company now paying company tax, ensuring that the States are not penalised by the new structure.  The additional payments arise because the sale of the company will not proceed.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Bill 4 also proposes $359.6 million in additional appropriation for non-operating expenses, the more significant of which I now outline.

       <p class="italic">
        The Department of Defence will be allocated $49.7 million to acquire protective equipment to enhance the security and effectiveness of deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan.  It is also proposed to provide $18.6 million to the Australian Defence Force to meet the cost of responding to the civil unrest in East Timor.  In addition, the Australian Defence Force will be provided with $14.2 million to fund the first stage of the Enhanced Land Force initiative.  These funding increases are partially offset by savings in other programmes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Capital funding of $22.5 million will be provided to the Australian Federal Police to increase its capacity to respond to peace-keeping and peace restoration assignments.

        In addition, capital funding of $17.3 million is proposed for the Office of Workplace Services to fund office fit-outs associated with its expanded regional presence and to develop an information technology application to manage claims and infringements.

       <p class="italic">
        The Department of Human Services will be provided with $34.4 million in capital to centralise project management and procurement activities for the Health and Social Services Access Card project.  These additional funds will be offset by savings in Centrelink and Medicare Australia.
