         say at the outset that I welcome the opposition's welcoming of Mr Gonski's appointment. I was very pleased to see that

          Mr Hockey

         and Mr Robb released a statement welcoming his appointment and that his appointment has been warmly received by members of the business community. In terms of the criteria for the choice of Mr Gonski, I would refer the honourable senator to the section of the act which states that a person is eligible for appointment if they have substantial experience or expertise and professional credibility and significant standing in at least one of the following fields—

          , I rise on a point of order. I am pointing to the requirement for the minister to be directly relevant to the question. I asked a very specific question as to whether the minister, her office or her department was told by Mr Gonski that

                   began the process of identifying appropriate candidates for the chair and board positions in the second half of last year, an executive search firm was engaged and the department asked Mr Gonski to meet with the board to seek their views. Mr Gonski was requested to speak with members of the fund to seek their views on key attributes for the upcoming vacancies for chair and member of the board as well as potential candidates they considered might be suitable to fill these upcoming vacancies. Mr Gonski was not asked to provide recommendations about who should fill either of these positions but to summarise the views of the board and to convey this to government.

                    board wanted Mr Costello to be the next chair with her own claim that Mr Gonski did not make any recommendation about who to appoint? Why won't the minister stop using tricky semantics to obscure the plain fact that Mr Gonski told the government that the Future Fund board wanted Mr Costello to be its next chair?

                       Mr Gonski, as I said, was not asked to make any recommendations, and he did not. He spoke to board members and summarised their views for the department. He has made that clear and I have made that clear. What we have, in the face of the outstanding candidate, Mr David Gonski—welcomed by the other side—is that some of those opposite who still hanker for Mr Costello to have the top job now want him to have a different top job. It was extraordinary. Today we saw former

                         That memo is not a public document. I note that Senator Cormann moved an order for production in this place yesterday. That was not supported by the chamber. Obviously, if there are other proper mechanisms by which people seek to have the document made public, I will make a decision at that time. This government and I, as part of this government, will always, in the face of the sort of politicisation that Senator Cormann is engaging in—and it is interesting that it is Senator Cormann and not other members of the coalition—ensure that we pick the best people for the job for things such as the
