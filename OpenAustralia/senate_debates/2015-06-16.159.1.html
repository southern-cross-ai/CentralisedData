        Perhaps this is a different note to usual, but I note this government is taking some much needed action in the budget to tackle the crisis of youth unemployment and to fund new programs. But I know that the way you tailor and implement the programs and who you work with to deliver the programs are going to be the real keys to success. I believe that the old Canberra based bureaucratic solutions will not work in helping young people become employable and move in to entry-level positions. The job services system, we all know, is not working for many young people in areas of high unemployment.
       </p>
       <p>
        As many people in the public would be aware, I have been involved with the Brotherhood of St Laurence campaign on youth unemployment. One important thing I have learnt from them is that any program that is going to really make a difference in youth unemployment hotspots around the country needs to tap into the resources of those local communities. That extends to tapping into the experienced people and mentors in service and sporting clubs to linking up with school principals and, most importantly, local employers who can provide valuable work experience which can progress to paid work.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know there is a lot of goodwill in the community towards young people and I know young people who want to work. The government needs to support local communities in finding solutions and not tie them up in red tape that dictate processes designed by public servants here in Canberra who so often are far removed from problems in local communities. The current government has committed to removing red tape and unnecessary costs and regulatory burdens for Australian businesses. I would like this commitment extended to the local communities who will play a vital role in ensuring any new programs to tackle to youth unemployment are successful.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not as if the most effective ways of achieving the results we all want are not known or tested. For example, I have visited the Brotherhood's employment programs in my own community in Gippsland, in Moe, and I can see on the ground what can be achieved when you have a program which has a sound method and is flexible on the ground for the challenges of that community, not to mention a highly-reputable organisation delivering it, such as the Brotherhood, which has won the backing from the local community and partners. Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Brotherhood of St Laurence—Tony, Farah and the team at the Brotherhood—who have worked tirelessly on this issue. Their work is so important in ensuring that poverty is not just alleviated, it is prevented.
