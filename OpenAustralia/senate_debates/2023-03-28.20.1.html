        I rise today to acknowledge Ian Quinn, affectionately known as Quinny by those of us lucky enough to have known him. Quinny was a proud Australian and a good man. He sadly passed away earlier this month at 76. Quinny, originally from Swanbourne in Perth, lived the life of an adventurer, described by his family as reading 'like an

        movie script', travelling the world and really living in history. It was a wild ride and a story that only he could tell. With only two minutes I can barely scratch the surface, but it was a good life that led him to his wife, Tou, in Bangkok and then brought them together to the

        in 1992.
       </p>

        In the Territory he bought five acres at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Springs" rel="nofollow">

        , expanded his property and then bought five more at Berry Springs. Quinny continued to expand and set up Tou's Garden, a 400-hectare mango farm at Acacia Gap, 45 minutes south of Darwin, with 65,000 mango trees and processing more than three million pieces of fruit just last year. But the mango farm, although an incredible achievement of Quinny and Tou and a major contribution to the country, is not the only thing Quinny will be remembered for. Quinny will first and foremost be remembered as a loving husband, father, grandfather and friend. He'll be remembered for his commitment to family and for the friendship, love and commitment he offered. He'll be remembered for the things he loved and the impact he had as a surfie, a crayfish hunter, a self-described scuba dive junkie, a farmer and above all, in my mind, a really good mate.
