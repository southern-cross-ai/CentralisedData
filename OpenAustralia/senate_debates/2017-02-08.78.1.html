        My question is to Senator Nash, the minister representing the Minister for Health. Every year dozens of young Australians die or are permanently disabled from meningococcal disease. The Bexsero vaccine against the major strain, meningococcal B, is available privately but the government refuses to list it on the national immunisation program, following advice from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_Benefits_Advisory_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee
        </a>
        . Given the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        and Ireland now offer the vaccine as part of a routine childhood immunisation and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        offers it for free to poorer families, why should not Australia follow suit and offer the vaccine for free through the national immunisation program?

         I thank the senator for his question and for some advance notice of it. The federal government takes the cases of meningococcal very seriously. The nation's chief medical officer is monitoring this situation very closely. We are of course well aware that there are parents who are concerned about this, but I do note that the cases of meningococcal B have declined by about 60 per cent over the last 10 years.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, many in the chamber know that this is a matter for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_Benefits_Advisory_Committee" rel="nofollow">
          Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee
         </a>
         . The government takes the advice of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBAC" rel="nofollow">
          PBAC
         </a>
         very seriously. They are the independent experts. My advice is that this particular vaccine has been before the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee, I think, three times, and each time it was determined by the PBAC that it was not deemed effective enough to be listed. However, having said that, the company is of course able to offer further information if they believe that that further information would provide more evidence of the efficacy of the vaccine.
        </p>
        <p>
         We certainly take the PBAC's recommendations very closely and very seriously, which is evidenced by around $4.9 billion worth of extra investment in the listing of medicines from the PBAC. These are the experts, the independent experts that have that knowledge and, indeed, the expertise to advise government, and it is incumbent on the government to accept that advice and ensure that we make the best decisions for the health of people right across the nation.

           Does the minister accept that the high cost of the vaccine—about $120 per dose on private prescription, with each child requiring between two and four shots—makes it unaffordable for low income families, creating a situation of haves and have nots?

            Not only as a minister, but also as a mother of two children, I genuinely do feel for people who are concerned about their children's health. But the senator is actually asking us to make a political determination here. That would be inappropriate. The role of the government is to take the independent, expert medical advice of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_Benefits_Advisory_Committee" rel="nofollow">

              Providing the vaccine for free through the National Immunisation Program would cost around $100 million per year. Would the minister agree that this is a small price to pay to save children from death or permanent disability?

               Further to my previous answer, the senator is asking me to make a political determination of what is an issue around requiring expert advice in determining which medicines are appropriate to be subsidised through the testing process. Again, I reiterate to the senator that this is a matter for the
