        . I think it is quite clear that the government’s responsibility to lead this nation at a time of great economic challenge has been carried out in an extremely professional, exceptional manner. We delivered a package to this country that kept and underpinned 210,000 jobs in the economy.

       <p>
        We delivered an economic package to this country that has made this country the envy of the rest of the world. We have the lowest net government debt as a share of

Our economic stimulus package has delivered a new approach in this country to long-term planning for schools, for roads, for dealing with black spots, for looking at community projects—

          I will take that interjection—and we have insulated the ceilings and the homes of people around this country who could never, ever have afforded to have their homes insulated. I find it the height of hypocrisy and class distinction that some of those on the other side, who have no problem finding $2,000, $3,000 or $4000 to insulate their roof, do nothing but carp and criticise when it comes to the government helping the ordinary working-class people of this country insulate their roofs. That scheme has delivered a financial saving for ordinary working people that will save them money for years to come. It will mean less greenhouse gas going into the atmosphere. The government has conceded there are issues with that project. What we are going to do is make sure it is fixed and make sure it continues to deliver for working-class people who could not otherwise afford to have their homes insulated—who are not in the same position as you, Senator Bushby, with plenty of money coming into the household and the ability to look after high electricity bills and insulation. Lots of working people in this country cannot do that.
