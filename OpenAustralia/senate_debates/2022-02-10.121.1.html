        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Birmingham. In December last year, the Prime Minister made an unprecedented announcement of the Commonwealth's intention to refuse the application by Asset Energy to drill for oil and gas under petroleum exploration permit 11 off the coast of Sydney and Newcastle. Reading directly from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PM" rel="nofollow">
         PM
        </a>
        's statement, on the day he said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This project will not proceed on our watch … this is not the right project for these communities and pristine beaches and waters.
       </p>
       <p>
        Strong statements were also made on the day by six Liberal MPs on the need to respect community wishes, protect our environment and not put our coastlines at risk.
       </p>
       <p>
        Minister, you would be aware that other communities are fighting against proposals for oil and gas drilling off their coasts, including
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Island" rel="nofollow">

         I thank Senator Whish-Wilson for his—was there a question there? I will do my best to respond and to the highlight the fact around the process issues related to the

          PEP

        </p>
        <p>
         PEP-11 was, and is, regulated, and decisions are made under the joint authority, which comprises the relevant

         minister and the Commonwealth minister for resources. That joint authority approach advised the PEP-11 titleholder of the intent to, effectively, end the permit by not approving the application by the titleholder for a variation and suspension of the work program commitments and for an extension of the permit term. The Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 sets out the process for the cancellation of a permit which ensures a fair process—

             I do know that, of course, nothing would give Senator Whish-Wilson more delight than to cancel projects right across the country. It's the Greens cancel culture. It goes in a range of different directions and 'cancelled projects' is right at the top of their favourite list. From cancelled projects, they like cancelled jobs, as Senator Cash says. Cancel business, cancel outcomes for Australia, cancel growth, cancel projects, cancel jobs: it's very much the Greens way. But the point I was making was that there is a process arrangement put in place in relation to how
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEP" rel="nofollow">
              PEP

             -11 was considered. Those processes were followed, and that's how the decision was arrived at.

                 Thank you, Senator Abetz—very droll. In terms of the appeal processes that may be available to Asset Energy, I will have to take those on notice unless I can ascertain the particularities of the status of that. I do note that estimates are next week, so I'm sure that, in terms of the status of any such appeals, authorities appearing before estimates can probably address those questions. Of course, the Prime Minister, relevant local MPs and others listened very carefully to communities as well and sought to make sure that all concerns were reflected as part of the proper decision-making process.

                   stated last year that, in order to meet our Paris commitment of 1.5 degrees of warming, we needed to leave all new fossil fuels in the ground and stop all new oil and gas exploration. Yet, following that report and statement, your government issued 80,000 square kilometres of new ocean exploration permits to your oil and gas donors. Are you insane? Were you wilfully ignorant, or simply totally corrupted and captured by the fossil fuel industry?

                        Senator Whish-Wilson, resume your seat! I will allow the minister to deal with the question. I believe that, in referring to it generally, towards a political party, it is not out of order; however, the minister can choose to answer the question as he sees fit.

                         . If you're looking for insanity, the policy platform of the Australian Greens offers a perfect model of insanity—economic insanity, job-destroying insanity, the type of insanity from those opposite that would see Australia close down industries and prematurely lose jobs in different sectors and industries whilst other nations would simply grow and fill that gap in different ways.

                        <p>
                         The way we are pursuing net zero and helping the world to get closer to addressing climate change is about making sure we get the technology developed in affordable ways so that other countries have affordable energy solutions. We want Australia to be at the forefront of those affordable energy solutions, but we're not going to shut down the industries we have now while we're still in the process of supporting hydrogen and other sectors to grow and develop. That would be insanity.
