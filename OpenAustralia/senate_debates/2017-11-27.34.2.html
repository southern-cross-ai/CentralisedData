         No, I don't think he is, Senator Chisholm. I know that you were involved in the Queensland election campaign, as was I, so you're the last person to whom I need to point out that the Queensland election campaign was entirely fought on state issues.
        </p>
        <p>
         Now, of course, all state election campaigns have a national dimension, and particularly in a state as big as Queensland. Of course they have a national dimension, but, as you well know, Senator Chisholm, the issues in the Queensland election campaign were state issues. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
          LNP
         </a>
         mounted a critique of the government of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annastacia_Palaszczuk" rel="nofollow">
          Annastacia Palaszczuk
         </a>
         as a do-nothing Labor government—from which, by the way, I don't for a moment resile—and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
          ALP
         </a>
         mounted a critique of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Nicholls" rel="nofollow">
          Tim Nicholls
         </a>
         and his LNP colleagues as being, as they had it, 'under the shadow of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_Newman" rel="nofollow">
          Campbell Newman
         </a>
         '.
        </p>
        <p>
         As you also know, the Adani coalmine was a very big issue in the election campaign, particularly in relation to the state government's attitude towards supporting an application for NAIF funding. And there was the question that the Labor Party prosecuted, with some success I'm bound to say, about the possibility of a hung parliament. I might say we don't yet know whether there will be a hung parliament, and we wait to see whether Annastacia Palaszczuk, in the event that her party does not have an absolute majority of seats, keeps to her word of no deals with any crossbench or minor party.
        </p>
        <p>
         But, Senator Chisholm, as you know, and I don't detect any vigorous dissent from what I'm saying, it was an election fought on state issues. We both know that. It was an election in which the Labor Party did quite well—may I congratulate you; may I congratulate Premier Palaszczuk on her relative success—but to suggest that it was fought on federal issues, as we both know, is fanciful.

            One Nation

            Senator Chisholm, I don't know what the Prime Minister has had to say about the matter. But I'll tell you what I've had to say about the matter, and I will repeat it here: flirting with
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Nation" rel="nofollow">
             One Nation
            </a>
            is poison. Flirting with One Nation is poison for my side of politics. My attitude to One Nation, with whom I deal courteously and professionally in this chamber, by the way, is, nevertheless, that One Nation has nothing to offer the people of Queensland. You make a debating point, Senator Chisholm, but isn't it interesting that if the government of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annastacia_Palaszczuk" rel="nofollow">
             Annastacia Palaszczuk

            is returned with a majority, that majority will be comprised of seats won from the

             LNP
            </a>
            on One Nation preferences—seats like Mansfield, seats like Aspley and seats in Brisbane won by the Labor Party on One Nation preferences.

               Senator Chisholm, you talk about flirting with
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Nation" rel="nofollow">
                One Nation
               </a>
               . I'll tell you what my experience was at the polling booths in Brisbane on Saturday. Regardless of what the Labor Party how-to-vote cards may have said, Labor Party booth workers, obviously under instructions, and trade unionists who were there at booths advancing the Labor candidate's interests were saying to voters as they entered the polling booths, 'Put the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
                LNP
               </a>
               last'—in other words, 'Give your preference to One Nation.' We are very familiar with the Labor Party talking out of both sides of its mouth. Don't worry about what your official position was, Senator Chisholm—your booth workers and your trade union surrogates were saying the opposite.

                     , it is common practice when a point of order on direct reference is raised for reference to be made to the question in order to make the point of direct relevance. I trust you're not suggesting that that can't occur?

                      No, I'm not suggesting that, Senator Wong. I'm suggesting the question shouldn't be restated in a point of order. But a point of order can always draw attention to the question.
