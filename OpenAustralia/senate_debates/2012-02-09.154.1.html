        A probity plan specific to future procurements of air sustainment services to the MEAO has been developed and is attached. A specific instruction will be issued to mandate the development of a probity plan based on this template for all future procurements of air sustainment services to the MEAO. The template probity plan can also be tailored for other procurements undertaken by

        JOC, as required.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        More generally, the necessary Defence procurement policy and operational guidance framework for the creation of a probity plan already exists (see Defence Procurement Policy Manual, 1 July 2011 edition (DPPM) at Chapter 5.4

       <p class="italic">
        Response – Agreed in principle
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Probity advisers will be appointed where it is consistent with the existing Defence procurement policy and operational guidance. The DPPM, Chapter 3.13, paragraphs 14 to 29, provide for the appointment of probity advisers based upon the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Finance_and_Deregulation" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Finance and Deregulation
        </a>
        (Finance) policy that 'the decision on whether to engage an external probity specialist should weigh the benefits of receiving advice independent of the process against the additional cost involved and include consideration of whether or not skills exist within the agency to fulfil the role'.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Based on past experience it is reasonable to assume that the future procurement of air sustainment services to the MEAO would meet the Finance policy requiring the appointment of a probity adviser, and the template Probity Plan referred to above is drafted on this basis.
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Response - Agreed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In the planned 1 December 2011 update of the DPPM, Defence will update Chapter 3.2 to expand the references to probity risk, and cross reference this chapter with Chapter 3.13 on ethics and probity in procurement. In addition, Defence will also release an updated chapter 3.13 as part of the planned 1 December 2011 update.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 2 paragraph 10.9
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that Defence reviews all Defence Instructions and related documents in respect of Reservists, full or part time, to ensure that real and potential conflicts of interest that might arise as a result of past, current or post separation employment are identified, reported and managed appropriately. In particular:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a)   Defence considers whether Defence Instructions
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DI" rel="nofollow">
         DI
        </a>
        (G)

         PERS
        </a>
        25-3 (Disclosure of interests of members of the ADF) should be extended to Reservists who are not engaged in continuous full-time service; or
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b)   if there is no intention to extend the application of DI(G) PERS 25-2 and DI(G) PERS 25-3 to Reservists who are not engaged in continuous full-time service, Defence develops specific policies covering the civilian employment of, and the disclosure of conflicts of interests by, those personnel.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response – Agreed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Defence has incorporated DI(G) PER 25-3 into a revised version of DI(G) PERS 25-6 (Conflict of Interest and Declaration of Interest) which came into effect on 29 March 2011. The revised DI(G) PERS 25-6 applies to a “Defence Member” as defined in section 3 of the Defence Act. This definition of “Defence Member” includes Permanent members of the Navy, Army and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Air Force
        </a>
        , and members of the Reserves who (a) are rendering continuous full-time service or (b) are on duty in uniform.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        DI(G) PERS 25-2 is currently under review and will be revised to include the definition of 'Defence Member' to align with the definition in DI(G) PERS 25-6.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As Defence has agreed to Recommendation 2(a) there is no requirement to develop the specific policies requested in Recommendation 2(b).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 3 paragraph 10.21
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that, prior to the re-tendering of any future contracts for the provision of air sustainment services to the MEAO, Defence ensures that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a)   all Reserve personnel involved in the procurement complete a conflict of interest declaration; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response – Agreed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This recommendation accords with usual Defence procurement practice as set out in the DPPM, Chapter 3.13. In addition, the attached Probity Plan contains a specific requirement in this regard.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b)   commanding officers or supervisors in 1 JMOVGP:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i)   make a risk-based assessment as to which other Reserve personnel must complete a conflict of interest declaration and which personnel do not;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii)   in making a risk-based assessment, give consideration to identifying and obtaining conflict of interest declarations from Reservists who have associations with the commercial air charter industry. Such associations may include:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii)   document their decisions whether or not to require these Reservists
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        to complete a conflict of interest declaration.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response – Agreed in principle.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Standard Defence probity arrangements provide that only those personnel who have a genuine 'need to know' have access to confidential tender information (eg. draft requirements, tenders, and evaluation material). This ensures that personnel who are not involved in the procurement do not access confidential information relating to the process or have an ability to influence the conduct of the process.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Further, if someone in the project team is approached by someone outside the project, an obligation to report such contact has been included in the attached Probity Plan.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Accordingly, it will be the responsibility of the project manager for a future procurement of air sustainment services to ensure that all relevant personnel complete conflict of interest declarations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 4 paragraph 10.22
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends Defence ensures that, in all future procurements of air sustainment services to the MEAO:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        (a)   should be signed prior to the commencement of the tender evaluation process or the development of the request (as applicable); and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b)   include declarations about possible conflicts of interest arising from their employment, prior employment, financial interests in potential suppliers or relationships with persons who have interests in potential suppliers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response – Agreed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This recommendation accords with Defence procurement policy and operational guidance which provides for the identification and management of conflicts of interest (see DPPM, Chapter 3.13). The probity plan templates available from the Commercial Policy and Practice Branch (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPP" rel="nofollow">

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The timing for the completion of the conflict of interest declarations in certain circumstances is covered by the DPPM, Chapter 5.4 Request Documentation, paragraph 63, which states that 'If a probity plan is required, it should be developed and approved before commencement of the tender evaluation' at which point the conflict of interest requirements in the plan would apply (including any requirements regarding the timing for personnel to provide declarations).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

         Senate
        </a>
        committee, a supplementary direction will be issued within 1 JMOVGP that all future MEAO air sustainment procurement activities must have a probity plan approved at the beginning of the procurement process (i.e. not just before the commencement of the tender evaluation).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        1 JMOVGP will also direct that conflict declarations are to be obtained at the beginning of the procurement process. This requirement will also apply to all persons involved in the development of request documentation.

         CPG

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Advance notice of a future procurement of air sustainment services would be provided through Defence's Annual Procurement Plan (

        This recommendation accords with existing Defence procurement policy and practice. For instance, the covering letter that forms the first part of the relevant ASDEFCON tendering and contracting template prompts the user to provide tenderers with appropriate background information about the procurement. This could include the reasons for re-tendering the contract and any key changes to tender requirements from the previous request.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Standard Defence procurement practice is to advise tenderers about the evaluation criteria and the basic rules governing tendering evaluation. In strategic and more complex procurements, the relevant ASDEFCON templates provide greater levels of specificity about how evaluation criteria are assessed, (eg by advising tenderers about what information will be used to assess which criterion). Also, if evaluation criteria are specifically ranked in terms of their relative importance or otherwise weighted, Defence procurement practice would require this order of ranking/weighting to be provided to all tenderers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        However, the detailed evaluation methodology which is used by tender evaluation teams to evaluate tenders is set out in the tender evaluation plan (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TEP" rel="nofollow">
         TEP

       <p class="italic">
        Response –Agreed in part.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Defence procurements do not tend to mandate a preferred solution as this can be seen by potential tenderers as favouring a specific tenderer and may stifle innovation and

       <p class="italic">
        otherwise limit the field of potential tenderers. Instead, and consistent with paragraphs 8.46 to 8.51 of the CPGs, the Defence approach is to analyse its requirements, undertake market research, and use this information to develop requirements/specifications which focus on the expected outcome from the procurement rather than specifying a particular way of meeting the requirement.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If Defence has specific requirements or technical specifications that must be met by tenderers, then Defence policy requires that these requirements and specifications be advised to tenderers. These would normally be included in the draft Statement of Work that is included as part of the request for tender.

       <p class="italic">
        (ii)   intention to consider alternative solutions.

       <p class="italic">
        Response – Agreed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This recommendation accords with existing Defence procurement practice and is reflected in standard Defence Conditions of Tender (for example, see ASDEFCON Complex Materiel Vol. 2, conditions of tender, clause 4.10).

       <p class="italic">
        The issues identified at paragraph 11.15 of the Senate inquiry report are either generally consistent with existing Defence procurement policy and practice, or are being addressed for inclusion within that framework. For example, DPPM, Chapter 5.4 Request Documentation, and our ASDEFCON tendering and contracting templates, provide the guidance and framework respectively for drafting request documentation. The guidance and templates cover all CPGs requirements, including minimum content and format requirements, conditions for participation, essential requirements, evaluation criteria and technical specifications.

        Another example is the current work within Defence to develop Tender Evaluation Better Practice Guides for the assistance of personnel undertaking procurements. Defence recently released the Better Practice Guide: Tender Evaluation in Simple Procurement, and a better practice guide for tender evaluation in more complex procurements is currently under development.

        The committee recommends that in all future procurements of air sustainment services to the MEAO, Defence develops and implements tender evaluation processes for assessing respondents' fitness and propriety to contract with the Commonwealth. Such evaluation processes should:

        Response – Agreed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The necessary Defence procurement policy and operational guidance framework already exists to implement these recommendations (see DPPM, Chapter 3.3 Financial Policy and Advice in the Procurement Process). Defence's existing probity and tender evaluation plan templates, and the ASDEFCON conditions of tender, permit financial statements to be obtained from tenderers and financial risk assessments to be undertaken. The Financial Investigation Service (FIS), DMO Commercial Group, is able to undertake financial assessments for procurement related matters.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The attached Probity Plan also requires suggested financial risk assessment to be undertaken as part of a future procurement process for air sustainment services to the MEAO, and requires the probity adviser to ensure these matters are considered as part of the tender evaluation.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Although the majority of recommendations apply to the procurement of air sustainment services to the MEAO, the committee recommends that Defence consider incorporating the principles and practices underpinning them as part of Defence wide non-equipment procurement policy.

       <p class="italic">
        Response – Agreed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The majority of the principles and practices discussed in the recommendations are either consistent with existing Defence procurement policy, practice or templates (such as the DPPM or the ASDEFCON templates) or will soon be incorporated as a result of the DPPM 1 December 2011 update and the Tender Evaluation Better Practice Guides. These principles and practices apply to all Defence procurement as described in the DPPM.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In relation to training staff in the practical application of these principles and practices, for a number of years DMO, on behalf of Defence, has been working to improve the content of Defence procurement training courses. In June 2011, CPP Branch, DMO Commercial Group, finalised the design and content of the Simple Procurement Refresher course in consultation with representatives from Defence Education and Training Development (DETD). Delivery of this training course is expected to commence in October 2011. CPP Branch and DETD are also finalising the design of the Complex Procurement Refresher course. Improving Defence procurement training courses will lead to more highly skilled procurement professionals.
