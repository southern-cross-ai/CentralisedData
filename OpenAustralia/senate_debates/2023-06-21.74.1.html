         Senator Urquhart, I am very sorry to have to sit you down mid-question. Order on my left! The interjections across the chamber are incredibly disorderly, Senator Henderson. Senator Urquhart, could you begin your question again? Please reset the clock.

          shortage, a bulk-billing system on the verge of collapse and out-of-pocket costs skyrocketing. The Albanese government is investing to strengthen Medicare and improve health services for all Australians. Why is Medicare a priority for the Albanese government and why is the government investing to deliver better healthcare for all Australians?

            President, on a point of order—standing order 73(1)—can I please ask you to review the prelude to the question that was asked there. I'm noticing an increasing use by the government of making statements in their questions. In the rules for questions under 73(1), it says that questions shall not contain arguments and should not contain imputations and lists other factors that they should not contain. Whilst there is a latitude given, the government is starting to abuse that latitude with the extent of arguments that are made in the questions that are put. The opportunity to make those arguments exists in the answers that ministers get to make rather than in the questions asked by those opposite.

              On the point of order, President, whilst you do that, I wonder if you could review with the same lens and by the same principles that this man articulates, the question this senator articulates, all of the questions that the opposition have asked this week, to see if they can meet their own principles.

                 Senator McGrath, I have just called the chamber to order, and you are being disorderly, along with a number of other senators. I would ask senators to reflect on what happened. We had Senator Birmingham on his feet, and it was largely silent in here. Senator Birmingham is entitled to make whatever point of order he does, and he was listened to in respectful silence. Senator Wong is also able to make a contribution on the same point of order, and yet the chamber becomes disorderly. This is not appropriate. Senator Urquhart, I believe you've finished your question? Senator Wong, I'm asking you to respond to Senator Urquhart's question.

                        The evidence is in what we have already delivered as a government or are delivering: tripling the bulk-billing incentives for children, a benefit to all Australian families and the most vulnerable; helping pensioners and concession card holders; cutting the price of PBS medicines, down from $42.50 to $30; reducing the cost of medicines through 60-day dispensing that will save general medicine patients hundreds of dollars a year—also opposed by the 'no-alition'. We are investing in the healthcare workforce and we are delivering a $1.5 billion boost to indexation of Medicare rebates.

It's vital for people, it's vital for Australians, and it's also vital for the healthcare system because, without strong primary health care, emergency departments and local hospitals face extra pressure.

We know that Mr Dutton, in his first budget as health minister, tried to abolish bulk billing. Oh! This side is very quiet now, are they? You tried to abolish bulk billing. That's Peter Dutton's real plan for Medicare. He wanted to abolish bulk billing.
