        I'm very pleased to rise in the Senate and share a special entrance speech from Raise Our Voice in Parliament, Tully Connor from Queensland. Tully had this speech prepared and wanted me to read it out today. She says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        My name is Tully Connor and I am 15 years old, currently residing in the electorate of Ryan, Brisbane/Meanjin.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Previously, I lived in Gladstone, Queensland, where a lack of extracurricular activities (excluding sport, which I am unable to participate in due to health issues.) left me feeling isolated and often powerless.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The voices of regional youth often go unheard, with limited opportunities beyond sports.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Thankfully, my move to Brisbane has opened doors to exciting activities like
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_UN" rel="nofollow">
         Model UN
        </a>
        and advocacy work, transforming my mental well-being and enhancing my resume.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It's unfair and unjust that rural youth miss out on such opportunities, creating isolation and possibly limiting their future prospects.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Regional voices deserve to be heard, and equal access to extracurricular activities can bridge this gap.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For Australia to become a truly equitable and just society, we must ensure that all youth, regardless of their geographical location, have an equal starting point.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Currently, children in major cities have an obvious advantage, which is which integrally unfair.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It's essential that we allocate funding for regional towns to establish extracurricular humanities opportunities for young people.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        By doing so, we can level the playing field and provide access to the same enriching experiences available to their urban counterparts.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This investment not only promotes fairness but also harnesses the untapped potential of regional youth, creating a brighter and more equitable future for all Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        I say thank you to Tully. It was wonderful to speak to you yesterday, and congratulations on your speech. You remind me a lot of myself when I was your age, and one day we might have a Senator Connor from Queensland.
