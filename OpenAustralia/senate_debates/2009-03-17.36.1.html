        My question is to the Minister for Superannuation and Corporate Law, Senator Sherry. Can the minister update the Senate on actions the Rudd Labor government is undertaking to stimulate Australia’s economy during the global financial crisis, and can the minister outline any alternative views that are hindering the government’s actions?

         I thank Senator Wortley for the question. I think most are aware that the world faces the worst financial system and economic crisis since the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression" rel="nofollow">
          Great Depression
         </a>
         and, of course, Australia is not immune from the impact of the various fallouts that we have seen right around the world. The federal Labor government has acted decisively to protect Australia’s economic interests. If we look at the range of actions that have been taken around the world that, in many cases, are coordinated internationally they relate to improving the regulatory and financial services system and, in some cases, particularly in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
          US
         </a>
         and Europe, they relate to bailouts of financial institutions, although, fortunately, not in Australia’s case. Also there are a range of stimulus packages to cushion the economy and to underpin jobs in this very difficult period.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the Australian government’s case we have announced the $42 billion Nation Building and Jobs Plan, which is to help stimulate the Australian economy and protect all Australians from the impacts of the global financial and economic crisis. It is not unintentional that the word ‘jobs’ is in the title of this plan. The Rudd Labor government is moving forward decisively in a number of areas in order to cushion and underpin the economy and jobs in the economy. Regrettably the Liberal-National Party of those opposite have taken the very negative approach of opposing almost every measure at this time of global recession. We know the global recession is causing massive job losses all around the world. It is estimated that up to eight million jobs will be lost over the next two years across many economies.

           As I have said, the Rudd Labor government has acted decisively and I have referred to our latest stimulus package. It is important to act decisively and in the best interests of Australians. As we speak, the first of the stimulus payments are being delivered. Centrelink, from last week, started to deposit the $900 single-income family bonus for those families with a single income, which Centrelink calls family tax benefit B. This will benefit approximately 1.5 billion families across Australia. In addition Centrelink has started to process the $950 back-to-school bonus designed to support 2.8 million school-aged children. Further, the government has started to roll out the farmers hardship bonus for farmers receiving exceptional circumstance incomes support. This is yet another measure that the Liberal-National Party opposes—and I draw the attention of the Senate to the National Party opposing additional support to drought-stricken farmers—

                     . On the point of order, relating to standing order 193(3), I draw your attention to the language that was used. It is unparliamentary, especially coming from a minister of the government.

                       . I ask for your judgment regarding standing order 193(3) and the use by the minister of the term ‘doormat’. I do not think it is becoming of a minister of the Crown. It might be all right for someone to cast it from the back benches, but for a minister of the Crown to use that phrase I think is below him.

                         . As I mentioned earlier, there are a variety of approaches around the world. I particularly want to draw the Senate’s attention to the positive and decisive actions that this Labor government has taken to underpin the economy and underpin jobs. I think what has been telling in this debate is that the Liberal-National Party have only been able to put forward one policy. When it comes to bailouts, they want to bail out the liquor industry. That is the only positive policy they can come up with in these very, very serious economic circumstances. If you look around the world, while there are bailouts of financial institutions in many other countries, the Liberal-National Party is unique in the world in wanting to bail out the liquor industry. Nowhere will you find such a policy advanced anywhere else in the world.
