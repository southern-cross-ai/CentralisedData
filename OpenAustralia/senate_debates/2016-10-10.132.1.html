        Pursuant to contingent notice, I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent me from moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of this Senate, namely the motion under discussion relating to general business notice of motion no. 62 which relates to nuclear weapons.
       </p>
       <p>
        This, today, could have been a very straightforward opportunity. In fact, it could have been a moment for celebration as this Senate completely united and unanimously reaffirmed its commitment to the abolition of nuclear weapons.
       </p>
       <p>
        This motion calls on the government to support moves in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations General Assembly
        </a>
        later this month or very early November to commence negotiations on a binding legal instrument banning nuclear weapons. As far as I know, it is Australian government policy to prevent nuclear proliferation and to promote disarmament. The motion is also consistent, as far as I understand it, with the platform of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Labor Party
        </a>
        . It is certainly consistent with the position of the Greens and I suspect with the aspirations of many on the crossbench.
       </p>
       <p>
        But, in shutting down the opportunity for a clear and unanimous declaration in the Senate, all the government is doing is drawing attention to how it will instruct our representatives to vote in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
         UN
        </a>
        General Assembly later this month. In a few short weeks from now when the nations of the world vote to initiate drafting a legally binding instrument to ban these horrific weapons—and by all accounts that is what is about to happen—on which side of the fence will the Australian government stand and on which side of history will we be?
       </p>
       <p>
        This Senate should have been given the opportunity today to send a strong and unanimous message to the world that we are on board and that we are on the right side of this debate. The government blew it today in denying leave for this motion, but there is still time to make it right later this month when the whole world will be watching.

         The Australian government will support all efforts in the first committee of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
          UN
         </a>
         General Assembly this October or November that will strengthen the global nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament regime and help advance effective and realistic measures towards the elimination of nuclear weapons. Australia's consistent, considered position on a ban treaty is well known. A ban treaty would be ineffective in eliminating nuclear weapons. Proceeding with a ban treaty without the participation of the states which possess nuclear weapons without due regard for the international security environment will not help create the conditions for major further reductions in nuclear arsenals. The government, whether Labor or coalition, deliberately and consistently deny leave in this regard. That is our position. A short speech is a good speech.

          The opposition do not support the suspension of standing orders, consistent with our longstanding approach to motions dealing with complex foreign policy issues which are not capable of being debated or amended. However, we do want to take this opportunity to put on the record Labor's strong opposition to nuclear weapons and our support for nuclear disarmament.
         </p>
         <p>
          Nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation is a profoundly important issue. There is no greater ultimate threat to the safety, security and welfare of everyone on the planet than nuclear weapons. That is why Labor support the elimination and prohibition of nuclear weapons. It is why we have long supported action to reduce the nuclear arsenals built up by the world's nuclear weapon states. It is why we support action to ensure there is no further proliferation of nuclear weapons and to ensure that nuclear materials do not fall into the hands of rogue state and non-state actors. It is why we support safeguards around Australia's participation in the nuclear fuel cycle to ensure Australian uranium is not diverted to non-civilian uses.
         </p>
         <p>
          Labor's position on nuclear issues is set out in our national platform. I commend the document to those listening to this debate who are interested in these issues. The starting point for Labor is that nuclear weapons must be eliminated and prohibited. This is a humanitarian imperative. Given the catastrophic consequences of deliberate or accidental detonation of nuclear devices, Labor support the negotiation of a global treaty banning nuclear weapons. We also support stronger action under the existing nuclear non-proliferation treaty, which is designed to prevent proliferation and commit nuclear weapon states to disarmament.
         </p>
         <p>
          There is a pressing need for the nuclear weapon states to do more to meet their disarmament commitments under the non-proliferation treaty. Article 6 of the non-proliferation treaty requires that nuclear weapon states pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to nuclear disarmament and on a treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control. The nuclear weapon states must negotiate further substantial reductions in their nuclear arsenals. They need to reduce the number of warheads on high alert. They need to be more transparent about the measures they have in place to reduce the risk of accidental detonation of nuclear weapons.
         </p>
         <p>
          Labor also support the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. We want to see its early entry into force. Labor support nuclear-free zones. We want to see new nuclear-free zones created and existing nuclear-free zones strengthened. We are committed to strengthening the work of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency" rel="nofollow">
           International Atomic Energy Agency
          </a>
          and compliance with the test ban treaty, the non-proliferation treaty and other nuclear treaties and agreements. We support deep, verifiable and irreversible cuts in all categories of nuclear weapons and a continuing reduction in their role in national security policy.
         </p>
         <p>
          Labor has a strong, demonstrable track record on these issues. Labor governments have ensured that Australia has led the way in the international community on nuclear disarmament. The Keating Labor government established a
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra_Commission_on_the_Elimination_of_Nuclear_Weapons" rel="nofollow">
           Canberra Commission on the Elimination of Nuclear Weapons
          </a>
          . The Rudd Labor government set up the International Commission on Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament to drive the disarmament process under the non-proliferation treaty. Labor will continue to advocate strongly for a progressive position and practical action to achieve a world that is free of nuclear weapons.
