        Last weekend the Queensland division of Liberal Party met for the annual conference and three new vice-presidents were elected, Gary Spence, John Caris and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Clifford" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        —and congratulations to them. The convention also adopted a motion, which I moved on behalf of the Burdekin branch of the Liberal Party, to introduce a sustainable cull of crocodiles in Queensland.
       </p>
       <p>
        Commercial hunting of crocodiles began in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        in 1945 and continued until 1971 when the species was protected due to the very marked decline in the population of crocodiles. The decline between 1945 and 1971 was assessed by the skins produced during that period. Between 1945 and 1971 the total number of skins from the Northern Territory entering trade was estimated to have been 113,000 but, of those, 87,000 were killed between 1945 and 1958 and only 26,000 between 1959 and 1971. After 1971 wild harvesting of the crocodile stopped but since then the population has increased from approximately 3,000 in 1971 to an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 individuals in 1984.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the Northern Territory there was, in 1980, permission given to begin farming crocodiles where farm stock was derived from wild harvest of crocodile eggs and from a captive breeding program. The industry has managed to ensure that it does not have any detrimental effects on crocodile populations. Since 1966, limited wild harvesting of adults and hatchlings has also occurred. The sustainability of the crocodile industry is evidenced by the continuing increase in the population of wild crocodiles, which in 1984 was estimated to be between 70,000 and 75,000. Wild harvesting of juvenile and adult crocodiles recommenced in 1997. Adult and juvenile crocodiles are harvested for several reasons including the provision of stock for farms, for immediate skin and flesh production and for the production of souvenirs. The crocodiles are allowed to be killed and used directly for skin and meat production or captured and used as stock in crocodile farms. The homing instincts of crocodiles and the expense of transporting and handling crocodiles does mean that many crocodiles taken from populated areas are not relocated.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Queensland intensive harvesting of wild crocodiles began after the return of soldiers from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
         Second World War
        </a>
        . The majority of these crocodile hunters were land based and over the years thousands of skins were exported and many juvenile crocodiles were hand caught to supply what was called the stuffer trade. The intensive harvesting severely depleted the population of wild crocodiles in Queensland and raised concerns about the long-term viability of the population. The species was fully protected under a Queensland act in 1974 and that remains the position as of today. Scientists have, however, estimated—and it can only be an estimate—that there are currently anywhere between 100,000 and 250,000 crocodiles in Queensland, the Northern Territory and the north-west of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        In recent times, crocodiles have been seen much more often in more populated areas. A couple of weeks ago every day on the front page of the
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townsville_Bulletin" rel="nofollow">
          Townsville Bulletin
         </a>
        </i>
        there were reports of crocodiles being sighted off the Strand in Townsville.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Strand" rel="nofollow">
         The Strand
        </a>
        is a very popular tourism destination, a great place for locals to go swimming. There is a rock pool there and they do have stinger nets in season but the Strand beach is very popular and lots of parents take their children down there and let them run fairly unsupervised because it has always been known to be a very safe place. But the appearance of crocodiles off
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kissing_Point" rel="nofollow">
         Kissing Point
        </a>
        caused some real problems and the beaches were shut for three days at a time. In addition to this, crocodiles have been sighted in the Mackay boat harbour. They are now regularly seen in the delta creeks of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burdekin_River" rel="nofollow">
         Burdekin River
        </a>
        . I used to fish quite a lot in the delta creeks years ago. I do not go quite so much these days, although in the last 12 months I have had a bit of an opportunity to go down a bit more.
       </p>
       <p>
        I remember that 20 or 30 years I would drag a bait net through the creeks at midnight, up to my chest in water, but it is something I would not do these days. Back 20, 30 or 40 years ago it was possible to do that because there were very few crocodiles in the area, but I barely get out of the boat to pump yabbies at the present time without being very cautious of crocodiles that might be around. I know that in Cairns crocodiles are often seen along the foreshore of the creeks close to the city. It does seem that crocodile populations are moving more into areas which are inhabited by human beings.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just yesterday at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Tribulation" rel="nofollow">
         Cape Tribulation
        </a>
        , north of Cairns, a tourist—who was being a bit silly, I must say—tried to attract a crocodile to get a better photograph and was bitten by the crocodile and lucky not to have been dragged into the water, submerged and hidden for food to be eaten later on. It demonstrates the point that there are now more and more crocodiles in the same areas as human beings. Some would say, ‘Crocodiles were here first, they are entitled to be here and human beings shouldn’t be here.’ But, of course, the reality is that human beings are going to go to Strand Beach, Cape Tribulation or Mackay boat harbour or go fishing in the Burdekin creeks. I make a simple distinction: when it comes to the question of whether you protect the crocodile or the human being, I will always go with the human being.
       </p>
       <p>
        I think this is now a time when we can cull crocodiles in Queensland and the rest of Australia. It is already happening to an extent in the Northern Territory. It can be done sustainably. I think we are clever enough these days to be able to manage wildlife populations. I only need to refer senators to the culling of kangaroos in Australia to demonstrate that point. Each year, we slaughter tens of thousands of kangaroos for meat production. Kangaroo meat is very tasty and healthy and is very much in demand overseas. I think it is sold a lot in Germany. I would like to eat more but my wife refuses to eat it. She says she will not eat the national emblem, and I know there are many Australians like that. But kangaroos are sustainably harvested and it is a real industry that creates employment out in western Queensland.
       </p>
       <p>
        I think there is nothing wrong with sustainably harvesting Australia’s native wildlife. I think the same could apply to crocodiles as with kangaroos. With crocodiles, it is not so much a question of harvesting them for meat or for their skins as one of the safety of the general public. I think there is a place for crocodiles but it is not in the same place as humans congregate. Many may say it is a pity humans are in those places, but that is the reality. They are there and I think the time has come when we need to sustainably cull crocodiles for the safety of human beings.
