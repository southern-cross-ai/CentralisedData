        I thank senators who have contributed to the debate on this bill. This is the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security" rel="nofollow">
         Social Security
        </a>
        and Other Legislation Amendment (Self-Employment Programs and Other Measures) Bill 2022 and the substance of this bill seeks to amend the social security law and related elements of the veterans and family laws to make it clear that the law operates in the same way for people assessing self-employment assistance programs through the new enterprise scheme.
       </p>
       <p>
        As many have said earlier in their contributions, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEIS" rel="nofollow">
         NEIS
        </a>
        is a proud Labor legacy that was introduced under the Hawke government in 1985 and the program has supported unemployed people to establish their own small businesses. Since the program's inception, it has helped almost 200,000 people to start a small business, and it's testament to its success that it has lasted as long as it has through multiple changes in government. Some of the people who made contributions in the debate shared success stories, and you can appreciate the important contributions this program provides for people who might not be able to find a job in the traditional sense but have been given the skills and opportunity to take that leap and start a business as a result of this program. The bill makes clear that the provisions for NEIS payments also apply equally to self-employment assistance payments, as has been the policy intent.
       </p>

        I was at a community function in Caboolture on Saturday and I met Rebecca, who talked to me about her partner, who was a veteran out of the armed forces who was participating in this program and actually talked to me about this legislation. I can report, Rebecca, that this legislation is before the Senate this week. I again thank senators who contributed on this legislation and commend the bill to the Senate.

         The question is that the bill be read a second time.

         Question agreed to.
