         I thank Senator Williams for his question and his very real interest in what is an important matter for the nation. No matter where I go across the country families and communities are incredibly concerned about the impact of drugs in their communities and, indeed, right across the nation. This government is of course against all forms of illegal drugs and has a tough on drugs policy, and that is how it should be. We are continuing to work with both health and law enforcement organisations across all states and territories, and I note that on Sunday the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         government announced a very comprehensive package to combat ice out in the community, including new laws to make more ice dealers face life in prison. That is really important and I think it shows the very real commitment that the New South Wales coalition government has to what is an issue concerning so many across the country.

         , Troy Grant, announced that new measures would include increased roadside drug testing by police, mandatory state-wide online reporting of pseudoephedrine sales in pharmacies and more funding for treatment and rehabilitation services, which I understand has been very well received a right across the state.

         Federally, this year we have committed around $200 million to front-line treatment services, for drug and alcohol treatment and for research and education across a range of areas. In particular, at the end of last year I reshaped the Australian National Advisory Council on Alcohol and Drugs so it could more effectively report to government. It has membership from a very wide range of areas—health, justice, Indigenous, mental health, research and policy areas—and I have tasked them, as their first priority, to look at the issue of ice, of methamphetamines, and report back to government on what is a very important issue.

           The issue of methamphetamines, particularly ice, is one I am deeply concerned about, and I know that people right across our community are very concerned about it as well. My colleagues from right across the spectrum have raised this issue with me and I particularly want to note the work Senator Bridget McKenzie has done in Victoria. I took the opportunity at the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
            UN
           </a>
           to raise this issue of methamphetamines, and Australia proposed a resolution calling on the UN member states to cooperate and share research, data, experiences and treatments relating to the international fight against ice. It is very interesting to note that the motion was co-sponsored by the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
            UK
           </a>
           , Japan, Germany, Turkey, Israel and Columbia, and that indicates that this drug is emerging not only in Australia as a serious issue but globally, and we will have to fight this drug not just domestically but internationally as well.

            , I ask a further supplementary question. Will the minister advise the Senate of feedback she has received from regional and rural areas about the devastating impact of ice on local communities? It is even being used in shearing sheds. This is really concerning.

             I can report to the Senate that this drug is having a devastating impact across rural and regional communities everywhere. As Senator Williams has indicated, it is shearing sheds, it is football clubs, it is communities and it is families on the ground. There are no restrictions on when and where this drug is hitting—it is young people, middle-aged people, old people; people that you would least expect are having their lives touched by this devastating drug. Over the last three years, the proportion of methamphetamine users using ice has increased from 22 per cent to 50 per cent. That is an exponential increase and that is why this government is so focused on making sure that we have a strategy that is going to deal with this and put this drug where it needs to be—out of reach. Particularly for young people we need to ensure there is an education campaign. We want our young people to never, ever be involved with this drug.
