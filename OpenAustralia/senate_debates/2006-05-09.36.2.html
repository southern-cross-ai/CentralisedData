            1 800 nuclear physicists, including many Nobel Laureates, have joined in a petition opposing the ‘new US nuclear weapons policies that open the door to the use of nuclear weapons on situations such as Iran’s’,

            petitioners argue that ‘using or even merely threatening to use a nuclear weapon preemptively against a non-nuclear adversary tells the 182 non-nuclear-weapon countries signatories of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty that their adherence to the treaty offers them no protection against a nuclear attack by a nuclear nation. Many are thus likely to abandon the treaty, and the nuclear non-proliferation framework will be damaged even further than it already has, with disastrous consequences for the security of the United States and the world’;
