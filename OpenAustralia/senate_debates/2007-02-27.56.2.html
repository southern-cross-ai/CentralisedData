         Introduction

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia has one of the best systems of cancer care in the world. In comparison to other developed countries, Australia has relatively high cancer incidence rates but comparatively low cancer mortality rates, indicating that cancer survival in Australia is relatively good. The health system in Australia is performing well in lengthening survival through early detection and in the treatment of cancer.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Commonwealth Government provides significant resources in relation to the prevention and treatment of gynaecological cancers. Advances continue to be made in gynaecological cancer research; during 2000-06 the

         The Government
        </a>
        has invested heavily in screening for female cancers, notably breast and cervical cancer. The National Cervical Screening Program (NCSP) has been so successful in detecting and following up pre-cancerous abnormalities that the incidence of cervical cancer has fallen by 57% and mortality by 58% in the past ten years.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government also funds a national ovarian cancer program through the National

        </a>
        ). The NBCC has developed evidenced based guidelines, endorsed by the NHMRC, for the management of women with epithelial ovarian cancer. It is now focussing on assisting with enhancing treatment through the development of a guide for health professionals on multidisciplinary cancer care meetings.

         Burden of Gynaecological Cancer in Australia
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Each year in Australia an estimated 462,000 people are diagnosed with cancer. Approximately 374,000 of these cases are less threatening types of skin cancer – namely non-melanocytic skin cancer. Over 88,000 people will be diagnosed with other types of cancer and approximately 36,000 people will die per year from cancer. Cancer accounts for 31% of male deaths and 26% of female deaths in Australia per annum. As a group of cancers, gynaecological cancers are the third most common form of cancer for Australian women, and the fourth most common form of cancer mortality in Australian women.

        During 2000-06 the NHMRC provided more than $44 million for research into gynaecological cancers. In 2006, the NHMRC awarded more than $98.5 million for new cancer-related research for over 190 new grants, awarded for periods of up to 5 years. This included research on the causes and treatment of cancers and research that focuses specifically on cancers of particular concern or common in the Australian population: ovarian cancer ($5.7 million) and breast cancer ($12.9 million). Not all of the cancer-related research funding target a particular type of cancer. Some of the research looks at the common mechanisms in cancer, thus having relevance to all forms of cancer. Guidelines, which have either been approved or endorsed by the NHMRC, have been developed for all eight priority cancers, and for the psychosocial care of adults with cancer.

         <p class="moved">
          That the Senate take note of the document.
         </p>
         <p>
          I want to say how much I welcome the government’s response to this report and its careful consideration of our 34 recommendations. Right at the start I would like to say that this is a very clear example of Senate women coming together to work on an issue. All of us saw this issue as being above party politics, an issue important to all women in Australia and their families, including their husbands, their brothers, their fathers and their children. For the first time that I can remember, committee members, under the careful chairmanship of Senator Gary Humphries, were able to come together and, with the aid of some expert advice from some of our very highly trained gynaecological oncologists, put together a report which identified, perhaps for the very first time, some of the gaps in the opportunities for information to be given to the women suffering from breast cancer who have not had their own organisation to cope with the difficulties of gynaecological cancers.
         </p>
         <p>
          I would also like to say at the outset that the work that Helen Zorbas and the National
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_Cancer" rel="nofollow">
           Breast Cancer
          </a>
          Centre have done in taking care of this issue since the year 2000 has been absolutely fundamental to and instrumental in making sure that the work done in Australia has been done to the best effect possible. However, I was disturbed to see this week, Natural
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_Cancer" rel="nofollow">
           Ovarian Cancer
          </a>
          Awareness Week, that in fact large numbers of women still do not understand that Pap smears will not identify ovarian cancer. There are many tests available for various forms of cancer but, unfortunately, research teams, both here and overseas, have still not found an early warning test for ovarian cancer and, as a result of that, more than a thousand women are diagnosed every year with it.
         </p>
         <p>
          I think that more than anything this report is an indication that when there was a serious women’s health issue and all of us realised that all of our women—never mind what they might do every three years at the ballot box—wanted it dealt with and wanted expert advice and wanted to have a voice, we all got together. That is why we called our report
          <i>
           Breaking the silence
          </i>
          , because we believed that it was time to break the silence on this issue.
         </p>
         <p>
          I would like to acknowledge the government’s commitment to establishing a national centre for gynaecological cancers under the governance of Cancer Australia. This is of course what the committee strongly recommended. We wanted to provide a national focus for gynaecological issues and, importantly, to increase the education and awareness of medical and allied health professionals. I think I also speak for other members of the committee when I say that we could not have done this work without people of the eminence of Professor Neville Hacker, the Director of the Gynaecological Cancer Centre at the Royal Hospital for Women in Sydney, who gave freely of his time and acted as a mentor to all of us. Getting across this issue was not easy—it is quite technical; some of the medical material is quite difficult—but he was always available and always patient. I know he helped all of us, so I would like to acknowledge him and some of the members of his gynaecological oncology team.
         </p>
         <p>
          The issue of education in this particular area, of both women and the broader community, was a recurring theme during the inquiry, with many submissions and witnesses telling the committee that a targeted approach was needed to deliver information. I also welcome the announcement that, as we recommended, the government will provide a million dollars in seed funding to support the establishment and initial operation of the centre. That is in addition to the nearly $13.6 million over the six years to 2009 that the government has invested in programs for women’s cancers, over half of which has been used to deliver breast and ovarian cancer programs through the National Breast Cancer Centre, through Helen Zorbas and her talented team.

          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCC" rel="nofollow">

          </a>
          has a vital and highly regarded role that is being played in the absence of anything else that is available for us in the gynaecological cancer area. But increasingly we were consistently told in evidence that when women are looking for information on ovarian cancer or any of the other gynaecological cancers they do not automatically understand that they need to go to the NBCC. Now we will have a dedicated area and for the first time we will actually be able to direct them to a specific site. I know, from all the work that they have been doing, that Helen and her people will work closely with the new gynaecological cancer centre and Cancer Australia to make sure that we deliver the fantastic service that they already deliver on breast cancer.
         </p>
         <p>
          I would also like to thank

          . He can relax now; I will stop pestering him. I must say that, right from the start, Tony was receptive to our position. He was patient in understanding where we were coming from. I think that one of the issues that really swung it for us was the fact that every single gynaecological oncologist in Australia argued together as a body to implement this national centre. Not only were the women together; the gynaecological oncologists were together. I congratulate Tony and his department for the way in which they have been receptive to these recommendations.

           I also wish to make some comments on the government response. I welcome the government’s response to our inquiry into gynaecological cancer, and I also note that the government response came in a very timely fashion—within a six-month period. In my short time here, I think that is unprecedented. Also unprecedented is a government response which has been so largely positive to the 34 recommendations the committee put forward. Some of that must be brought home to the amazing efforts of Senator Jeannie Ferris. She said in her contribution that she was going to cease bothering the minister. I think the senator could be misleading the Senate with that particular statement. I hope she is, because I think that her passionate support of the women who are working through this process, their families and the extraordinarily talented and dedicated professionals who work in this area, and her particular method of bothering the minister have been instrumental in making sure that the government response has come forward.
          </p>
          <p>
           We had no recommendation rejected by the government, amazingly enough. We referred several recommendations back to the states and territories—quite rightly, I think, because so much of the health and education process and the involvement of people in their health journeys must be a cooperative response between the patients, families, medical practitioners and governments at both state and federal levels. In many ways, that was the message of this particular inquiry: people must work together, because the only way that we will achieve what we hope to achieve in this area is for governments to work together and for us to be genuinely woman-focused—because this particular form of cancer is a woman’s cancer.
          </p>
          <p>
           In many ways the response today is a testament to the extraordinary women who gave of their time and experience and came forward with their evidence to our committee. They also came forward with their expectations, because they told us that they expected their governments to respond. Now we have a level of response at the first round from the government and I say, ‘Come forward, Cancer Australia.’ More than half of the recommendations refer to the actions we must now take with the effective implementation of Cancer Australia. We know that can occur, but we will be watching. Indeed, there must be a focus on hearing people’s voices on their treatment and on ensuring that there are effective research dollars given. We now must work together so that the horror of gynaecological cancer is faced, identified, researched and cured. That outcome can be achieved.
          </p>
          <p>
           I think that as a parliament we must now ensure that the work that has been put forward is fulfilled. I know that there is goodwill. There were a number of recommendations on combining services and putting forward effective research. It came out consistently that the research dollars available in this area had not reflected the need. We will now have a focus for our efforts: there will be a centre whose major activity will be around issues to do with gynaecological cancer—those issues will no longer be lost or dismissed amidst all the other arguments that come forward when we talk about cancer in our community—and it will work within the auspices of Cancer Australia. We have the expectation that this will succeed. We will work together to ensure it will be done and we will be able to look to the women who came forward and say, ‘We’ve heard you. Your voices have been heard and there will be a move forward.’

           Awareness Week, which is this week, and Senator Ferris mentioned the importance of awareness and education. I want to place on the record, because I promised them that I would, my support for the women from the Lymphedema Network. I think there is much more work to be done in that area. I believe that the government response, which looks at a limited number of treatments being covered by Medicare, does not go far enough. But we will be able to continue the pressure to ensure that we can go forward. As Senator Ferris quite rightly said, this is a start. We have the process to move forward.

             and her supporters need to be acknowledged. Once again, this is not the end. We have had the government response. There were 34 recommendations and not one was rejected. I would like to have that on record over and over again. There is money—$1 million in seed funding. I have to admit that, when the committee was meeting on this issue, we wondered whether in fact we would be able to achieve that, but it has been achieved. We have it in black and white: the government accepts this recommendation of $1 million of seed funding money. Through the processes of this place we will be making sure that the money is spent well, that Cancer Australia maintains the activity that it began quite recently and that the women of Australia will be feeling more confident when they have this issue brought before them.

              I am also very pleased having seen this response to our report. I cannot recall seeing a government response which has been so accepting of recommendations. I congratulate the government on its response and, again, say how pleased I am. It was a great honour for me to be a part of this process. A great deal has already been said about the women who were involved both in the parliament and beyond. This response sends an important message to people that signing a petition can make a difference. It has often bothered me, in fact, that so many petitions do not go on to be investigated and looked at in detail, but this one did and I thank the Senate for its indulgence in doing that and the committee itself for accepting that petition and for taking action on it.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is a huge step forward for women’s health. As I said, it is a great credit to the many women who have been involved in the process. This is a hidden and very life-threatening set of cancers. It is a very important step forward. Of course, the first recommendation—the most important, in my view—was to set up a centre for gynaecological cancers within the auspices of Cancer Australia. That centre will give a national focus to these diseases; it will improve the coordination of existing health, medical and support services, and community projects. What we are really asking is for this very serious condition to have a national focus, to have attention paid to it, in much the same way as breast cancer does. Throughout this inquiry we were constantly made aware of the great success in the testing and treatment of breast cancer and the terrific work that has been done in the past on that. This will hopefully save lives. This will make the lives of many women much better and allow them to cope with their disease more adequately. As I said, the most important thing is that it will save lives. We can be proud of that. Of course, we cannot know how many lives will be saved—we will never know that, but that is what we are here for.

              I also pay great respect to Senator Jeannie Ferris, whose role in this inquiry was inspiring for us all. We were touched by what she was going through at the time. Her role in the inquiry process was a brave and difficult one—we all understood that at various times—but, nonetheless, I do not think we could have done it without Senator Ferris. I thank her for those efforts.
             </p>
             <p>
              The government should be on notice that we will not put this away and forget about it. We will be following up all of the recommendations and will ask the questions. Has it happened? When are we going to see some results from this? So our work is not yet done. Senator Moore, Senator Ferris and others, we need to press on. As has been said, there are some areas where recommendations have perhaps been shifted to the states, and we might need to add some pressure to the states and the federal government to coordinate those efforts. One of those areas concerns women who travel great distances to have cancer treatments and often have very long periods of time when lymphedema very significantly affects their lives. That is a bit of unfinished business, and I make a commitment here and now that we will still be on that case. I thank the government for their response. We really look forward to watching how Cancer Australia handles this and, hopefully, we will have a vibrant and effective centre of excellence for gynaecological cancers as a result. I seek leave to continue my remarks.
