        My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig. Can the minister update the Senate on the reconstruction effort in Queensland after the floods and cyclones of 2010-11? Can he also indicate how the government is progressing the rebuilding of Queensland?

         I thank Senator Furner for his question, as a good Queenslander supporting flood recovery. We are approaching the two-year anniversary of the floods and cyclones that ravaged Queensland.
        </p>
        <p>
         When disaster first hit, the Gillard government said that we would stand shoulder to shoulder with Queensland every step of the way to repair, recover and rebuild. I can advise the Senate that the Gillard government has done just that, and continues to do that. The rebuilding of communities right across Queensland is a top priority for this government and, you would hope, Queensland.
        </p>
        <p>
         Across Queensland we have delivered more than $3.5 billion in reconstruction works, and there is another $3.4 billion under construction or out to tender. In just four months, from June to September of this year, over $1 billion of reconstruction was completed. Every damaged school, coalmine and port has been reopened, and only a few national parks still remain closed because of the nature of the damage. More than 92 per cent of damaged state roads have been restored and more than 96 per cent of damaged rail lines have been restored. We have fully reconstructed almost 3,000 kilometres of roads, with another 1,800 kilometres under construction.
        </p>
        <p>
         I can also report that while we are rebuilding Queensland we are achieving value for money for taxpayers by having the Commonwealth Government Reconstruction Inspectorate in place assessing projects. We have created around $600 million in value. This value for Australian taxpayers is of an order that has never been achieved in past reconstruction efforts and is a testament to the work of the inspectorate in overseeing the work to ensure that we do get value for money. Measures to support councils and their labour costs, particularly in rural and remote areas, will benefit communities and also create a benefit to the Commonwealth of up to $180 billion.

           I thank Senator Furner. Unlike those opposite, he continues to work with Queensland to rebuild. In hundreds of communities across Queensland the reconstruction progress is taking place, from the

           , which is undergoing major work. We are getting on with the job.
          </p>
          <p>
           I can inform the Senate that the reconstruction work is continuing each and every day; it is continuing as we speak. I am happy to announce that the local boating pontoon at Balgal Beach, just outside of Townsville, has been completely replaced and was reopened this afternoon. The 11-metre pontoon damaged by Cyclone Yasi has been reconstructed, in the original position, next to the boat ramp. The facility will have real benefits for the safety of the fishing and boating enthusiasts. I wishâ€”

             I thank Senator Furner. This government believes that rebuilding Queensland is a top priority. Right across the state there was billions of dollars of damage and thousands of families and communities affected. But I have been surprised that this has not had bipartisan support, as we have heard from the interjections opposite. Firstly, the Liberals and Nationals voted against the rebuilding by opposing the modest levy which went to the reconstruction of things like the pontoon in Townsville. Secondly,
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_Newman" rel="nofollow">
              Campbell Newman
             </a>
             began a secret plan to dismantle the Queensland Reconstruction Authority, until he was shamed into a backflip. Finally, when the Newman government released its top priority document last week, not a single mention was made of rebuilding Queensland. They have abandoned Queensland just like the Liberals did when they did not support the flood levy. It shows the Liberals and Nationals are just doormats, doormats, doormats. They do not care aboutâ€”
