         My thanks to Senator Crossin for the question and for her ongoing support for action on climate change. The government's plan is clear. We have a plan in which polluters pay, Australian pensioners receive increased payments, Australian families get tax cuts and Australian families get increased family payments. It is a plan to cut pollution, to create clean energy jobs and to move to a clean energy economy. But again I say: pensioners receive higher payments and Australian families get tax cuts and increased family payments.
        </p>
        <p>
         What we saw on the weekend was the shadow Treasurer not only boasting that he was going to be Treasurer in a few months time but being clear that the opposition's relentless negativity even extends to the increased pension payments and the other benefits under the carbon package—the clean energy package. So let us be very clear: the policy that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Hockey" rel="nofollow">
          Mr Hockey
         </a>
         has signed those opposite up for is lower pensions, higher taxes and lower family payments. That is the policy you have signed up for: lower pensions, higher taxes and lower family payments. That is the policy of the coalition. I hope Mr Hockey took that through shadow ministry because those opposite are going to have to campaign to Australian pensioners at the next election on why they do not deserve an increase in the pension. They will have to campaign to Australian families on why they do not deserve increases in family payments. And they will have to campaign on why people in this country do not deserve an increase to the tax-free threshold, because that is now the coalition's policy.

             , the opposition leader keeps saying he is committed to the target, although I notice some reports in the paper over the weekend that indicate members of the coalition are concerned that Mr Abbott will in fact walk away from the five per cent target—very interesting. There might be a reason for that. The reason for that is the cost. Because what is clear from the Treasury modelling which has been released is that the 'subsidies for polluters scheme', which is Mr Abbott's policy, will cost almost five times the stated coalition policy—some $48 billion out to 2020 and an extra $1,300 in tax paid by Australian households every year. That is $1,300 more in tax. Not only do they stand for lower pensions; they stand for higher taxes for Australian households.

               In answer to the first question, the government's plan has been fully costed. In answer to the second question, it is quite clear that the alternative approach put forward by the opposition has not been properly costed and will lead either to a massive blow-out in the budget or to a massive hike in taxes on Australian households. They are the only two alternatives. Those on the other side have a subsidy-for-polluters model, which involves either a massive blow-out in the budget or a massive hike in the taxes on Australian households. Those on the other side want to hide their costings. That is why they do not want the Parliamentary Budget Office. That is why they do not want to have to put forward their costings. They know their costings do not add up and their policies do not add up. What we do know is that those opposite stand for ripping away the pension increase, a massive tax hike on Australian families—

                <p>
                 The Treasurer made an announcement yesterday. I am sure that Senator Bernardi, being a hardworking frontbencher, unlike some of the ones that Senator Vanstone was referring to, would have read the Treasurer's Economic Note, which makes clear that the Treasurer will be releasing updated modelling this week that shows the impact of the carbon price on the entire economy. Some additional figures were released on Sunday. I remind the good senator that the household assistance package, as I previously indicated to the Senate, was based on the $23 per tonne carbon price.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If the Senate is concerned about the impact on Australian households, if the senator is the fiscal conservative he professes to be, then he really should be speaking to his leader and his shadow Treasurer, who are putting forward a policy which will mean a massive tax hike for Australian households. It is as simple as that. Those on the other side, by virtue of the policies they have put forward, are proposing a $1,300 tax hit on Australian households, a policy which will cost $48 billion out to 2020, more than double the economic cost of the government's package. The coalition have also signed up, as I said earlier, to clawing back from Australian pensioners the increase this government will legislate and to increasing the tax applied to Australian households and Australian families. Those opposite oppose the tripling of the tax-free threshold and, of course, the family payment system, which they will also claw back. If Senator Bernardi cares about the economic cost of his policy, I suggest he perhaps rock up to a shadow ministry and have a chat to his economic team.

                  , I ask a supplementary question. What extent of international action to reduce or limit emissions of greenhouse gases has Treasury assumed in its newly released carbon tax modelling? Specifically, what emissions reductions are assumed in the modelling?

Can the minister explain how spending $3.5 billion of taxpayer's money, which will be raised in the form of higher electricity charges to purchase foreign credits, amounts to cleaning up the Australian economy, as claimed in its advertising campaign? Given the nature of this, when will the government withdraw its misleading and expensive advertising campaign to do with this carbon tax?
