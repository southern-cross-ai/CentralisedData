        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries And Forestry, Senator Sherry. Can the minister advise the Senate on challenges facing Australian farmers? Is the impact of climate change on our farming communities an issue that needs to be addressed?

          As I am sure all those opposite and those listening are aware, in the past 12 months the world has faced a very difficult global recession, the likes of which we have not seen for some 75 years. But of course that is not the only major issue that this Rudd Labor government is focused on. The physical climate of our globe has been worsening. Indeed, the climate has been worsening for a number of years. I do not think there is any sector in Australia, including the primary industry sector and the farming sector, that does not recognise that. Farmers in particular recognise the impacts of climate and have to deal with the impacts of climate in this world. They are vulnerable to the impact of climate change. They are faced with drier climates, more severe storms and shifts in distribution of weeds, pests and plant diseases. There is no doubt that farmers in our community well understand the effects of climate change.

              The Rudd government is committed to tackling the issue of climate change through the introduction of a carbon pollution reduction scheme. We saw just last week on the ABC that those opposite have been quite vocal in their denial of the very existence of this very important issue and its detrimental impact on Australia’s farming community. Over the weekend, my colleague sitting here with me, the Minister for
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
               Climate Change
              </a>
              and Water, Senator Penny Wong, announced as a sign of good faith that the government will agree to exclude agricultural emissions from coverage under the

               CPRS

              indefinitely. However, despite the National Party in particular having called for this exclusion, they met it with ridicule.

                 CPRS
                </a>
                , and yet when it happens all they can do is ridicule that position. Unfortunately for the National Party—they have been so keen in recent years on crawling out from underneath that Liberal Party doormat and the dust cloud is rising—they do not know what a yes or no answer is. They cannot identify a clear policy position even when they have called for it themselves. That is how lost the National Party is on this and many other issues. As part of a positive agenda for assisting Australia’s farmers—

                   There is an additional important factor which I actually suspect at least some members of the Liberal Party do understand on this issue—that is, the issue of business certainty: the need to provide businesses with a given decision and to provide that certainty. Again, it is absolutely vital for our farming community to have certainty. The Rudd government has strived to provide this certainty to business with every single decision it has made, and nowhere is it more important than in this area in particular. The businesses of Australia, and in particular the farming sector, do need certainty in order to move forward, to be constructive on the various issues and to adapt to the various changes that are required given the seriousness of climate change. This government is absolutely committed, and it has shown its commitment in the rural sector.
