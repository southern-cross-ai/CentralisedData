        asked the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, upon notice on 25 June 2012:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        With reference to media reports that the company Seafish Tasmania Pty Ltd (Seafish) is seeking to bring the 'super trawler' Margaris to Tasmania, to be docked at Devonport in order to fish in the Commonwealth Small Pelagic Fishery:
       </p>

        ) for this fishery; if so, when and by how much.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) What data did the Commonwealth rely upon to increase the quota and when was this data last updated.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) Is the data reviewed according to the precautionary principle before there are any alterations in the TAC.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) Have there been any written or verbal discussions between the Tasmanian and Commonwealth governments regarding this company, its trawler proposal and the TAC in the fishery.

       <p class="italic">
        (5) Have there been any discussions between Seafish and the

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (6) Have Seafish or AFMA consulted with commercial or recreational fishers in Tasmania about the trawler proposal; if so, what was the outcome.

        (7) Has modelling been done on the impact of the trawler on Tasmanian fisheries.

         The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) The combined total allowable catches in the Small Pelagic Fishery for 2012-13 are
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         36 300 tonnes; an increase of 6 000 tonnes from the 2011-12 combined total allowable catches of 30 300 tonnes. The total allowable catch for some species increased while others decreased. The biggest change was jack mackerel east which increased from 4 600 tonnes in 2011-12 to 10 100 tonnes.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) The total allowable catch for jack mackerel east was increased on the basis of the report 'Application of daily egg production to estimate biomass of jack mackerel' by the Institute of Marine and Antarctic Studies,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Tasmania" rel="nofollow">
          University of Tasmania
         </a>
         (2011).
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) Data is reviewed by the Small Pelagic Fishery Resource Assessment Group before it recommends total allowable catches for species and regions each season. The Small Pelagic Fishery Harvest Strategy, which is used in the catch setting process, is precautionary taking into consideration both species productivity and broader ecosystem impacts. The total allowable catch for jack mackerel east was set at less than 7.5% of the estimated spawning biomass for the 2012-13 season. If the total allowable catches for all species and regions are taken in full in the 2012-13 season, at least 90 per cent of the estimated spawning stock biomass will remain for future years.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4)
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFMA" rel="nofollow">
          AFMA
         </a>
         regularly communicates with state counterparts about routine fisheries management issues. State representatives are invited to attend meetings of resource assessment groups and management advisory committees which provide advice to the AFMA Commission. A permanent observer from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmanian_Government" rel="nofollow">
          Tasmanian Government
         </a>
         attended the meeting of the Small Pelagic Fishery Resource Assessment Group where the allowable catches for 2012-13 were considered.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (5) Seafish Tasmania has discussed with AFMA the possible operation of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FV" rel="nofollow">
          FV
         </a>
         Margiris in the Commonwealth Small Pelagic Fishery. I have been briefed on the discussions AFMA has held with Seafish Tasmania. I note AFMA is yet to receive an application and AFMA has not made any undertakings in regard to the Margiris operating in Australian waters.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (6) AFMA meets with recreational fishers and commercial fishers often on a number of matters. It is not the role of government to comment on commercial consultations.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (7) Catches of commercially targeted species in the Small Pelagic Fishery are limited to total allowable catches which apply regardless of the size of vessels used in the fishery. Therefore, should the Margiris operate in the fishery it will not be able to take catches greater than the total allowable catches set each season. In addition should the vessel operate in the fishery it will be subject to all domestic fishery management arrangements imposed by AFMA. These include catch limits, requirements for carrying AFMA observers to monitor fishing activities and the use of bycatch mitigation equipment, such as seal excluder devices.
