        In regard to a joint media release issued on 6 July 2011, stating the Government's commitment to provide 'fair and appropriate supplementation' to help support any phased in pay increase, as a result of the Social and Community Sector equal pay case, will the Minister confirm that the Government will only provide a supplementation and not fully cover any costs of employers.

         The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The Australian Government is committed to achieving pay equity for Australian workers.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
          The Government
         </a>
         's funding commitment in the equal remuneration case for social and community services (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SACS" rel="nofollow">
          SACS
         </a>
         ) workers was clarified on 10 November 2011 when the Prime Minister announced that the Government will provide over $2 billion, phased in over a six year period, to fund its share of any wage increases awarded by Fair Work Australia (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FWA" rel="nofollow">
          FWA
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         In announcing its commitment to provide supplementary funding, the Government has encouraged State and Territory governments to commit to funding their share of the cost flowing from any wage increase awarded in this case.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The Prime Minister also announced that the Government would put a joint submission with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Services_Union" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Services Union
         </a>
         (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASU" rel="nofollow">
          ASU
         </a>
         ) and other applicant unions to FWA on appropriate pay rises for SACS workers. The joint submission was filed on 18 November 2011. If FWA agrees to this submission, it will deliver very significant pay rises for the SACS workers covered by the equal remuneration application.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The phased introduction proposed in the joint submission recognises the complex funding arrangements in the sector, which involve local, state and territory governments, not for profit organisations, commercial providers and the Commonwealth.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         This will allow community sector organisations delivering Commonwealth-funded programs to pay the new rates, without reducing services to the community. The Government will also increase funding under Commonwealth-State agreements that cover social and community sector employees.
