        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, Senator Ludwig. Given community concerns arising out of the story on
        <i>

        on the ABC last night highlighting alleged rorting of a payment scheme relating to the forest peace deal in Tasmania, I have questions about the other tranche of the

         TFA
        </a>
        funding relating to the $100 million economic diversification package.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am aware of the ministerial advisory council process under which
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDA" rel="nofollow">
         RDA
        </a>
        Tasmania and the state's regional reference groups consider such development opportunities. However, my question is: was there an application process and what procedures were put in place to ensure TFA funding allocation is going to be transparent and provide equitable access to all applicants?

         One of the important objectives of the IGA is to achieve conservation outcomes through a community led process. The programs delivered by the government through the IGA are aimed at achieving those conservation outcomes while still ensuring that the forest industry in Tasmania remains viable and continues to provide jobs.

          , I rise on a point of order. My question was not in relation to the conservation outcome or the money paid to the forestry industry; it was very clearly in relation to the second tranche of payments under the economic diversification package and my question was, again: was there an application process for funding—in other words, were people invited to apply for funding—and what procedures were put in place to provide transparency and equitable access to that funding?

            As part of the Tasmanian Forestry Intergovernmental Agreement, the Commonwealth did commit to and has committed $120 million for economic diversification over 15 years—at 2012, $24 million in funding assistance for a range of economic diversification projects, including the Tasmanian Innovation and Investment Fund, with $8 million for 28 businesses, creating 267 jobs, and a further $16 million for 10 projects.
           </p>
           <p>
            Building on that work, in May the Prime Minister asked Mr Albanese to draw together a jobs and growth plan for Tasmania that focuses on the things that Tasmania and Tasmanians do best. On May 17, the Prime Minister announced that the government would increase the economic diversification fund to $100 million, to be delivered over four years. And, as discussed with the Tasmanian economic diversification consultation group when Minister Albanese was in Tasmania the week before last, the project that the government is looking—

              I thank Senator Whish-Wilson for his question. I know he supports the jobs and growth plan, because it is targeted at new opportunities that build on the government's significant investment in Tasmania since 2007 such as putting Tasmania first in the rollout of the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
               NBN

              , providing significant infrastructure and transport investment, and delivering skills and education for the Tasmanian people.
             </p>
             <p>
              There is—unlike what Senator Whish-Wilson has put, because I reject the premise of his question—ongoing consultation with the Tasmanian government, an economic diversification task force and three regional reference groups to determine suitable projects which will maximise local economic and community benefits and which represent value for money. Contrast that with those opposite. Here is what we know so far. Mr Abbott will cut Tasmania's

                Just to be clear, the consultation process occurred on 6 and 7 June, and it was done jointly by the Tasmanian minister and Minister Albanese. That consultation actually set out the criteria for jobs and growth projects. As for the money, it has been available since the Prime Minister's announcement on 17 May. Again, this is well understood by the consultation groups in Tasmania. It is surprising that Senator Whish-Wilson is not aware of this, being a senator for Tasmania. But I am happy to take that part of the question on notice to make sure that information on this very issue that is on the record can also be made available to Senator Whish-Wilson. But it is clear that there are ongoing consultations with the Tasmanian government, and there is an economic diversification task force and three regional reference groups—
