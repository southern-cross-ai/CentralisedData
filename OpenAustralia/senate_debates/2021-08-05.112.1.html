        The care a community provides for its elders is a mark of that community, and I rise to give due respect and hearty congratulations to volunteers and staff at aged-care facilities, particularly those in our regions and smaller towns. I recently had the pleasure of attending the Warrina aged-care facility in Innisfail, just south of Cairns, where I opened the site's new 64-bed See Poy Roberts building. Warrina Innisfail started operations in 1970 and has a stellar reputation for providing quality, dignified care, and this new building is outstanding in its comfort and care for residents and improved workplace safety for staff.
       </p>

        As announced in the recent federal budget, the Morrison government will deliver a $17.7 million package of support and once-in-a-generation reform to aged care to deliver respect and dignity to our senior Australians. Also, as part of the 2021-22 budget, the Morrison government is investing $125.7 billion in Medicare over the next four years, an increase of over $6 billion from last year's budget. There's an election coming soon and if anyone says the Morrison Government is cutting Medicare it's just not true. Senior Australians built our nation. They're our parents and grandparents, our founders and protectors, and they have contributed so much to our communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        I always make a point of visiting aged-care facilities because of the tireless work by staff and volunteers, such as that of Warrina patron Claire Richardson. I'm glad to represent the

        , which realises the importance of regional aged care and walks the walk when it comes to providing funding and training to the sector. It is so important, because regional aged care allows families to stay in the regions. Well done to Warrina Innisfail president Chris Kahler, the board of directors, staff and volunteers.
