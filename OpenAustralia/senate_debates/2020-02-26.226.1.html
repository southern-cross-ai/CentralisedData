       <p>
        On behalf of the Chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, I present the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity on the examination of the annual report of the Integrity Commissioner 2017-18, together with the
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee. I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the Senate take note of the report.
       </p>
       <p>
        It should be noted by this house that the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity has increased its jurisdiction in terms of the number of law enforcement members who are covered by the ambit of its role from 16,000 to 23,000 law enforcement members, and this has occurred over the last three or four years. So the commission has been going through a consolidation phase, dealing with legacy work over this period of time. It has also introduced a triage process whereby a focus is put upon the most serious and systemic allegations of corruption in those law enforcement agencies.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Mr Michael Griffin AM, who served as the Integrity Commissioner during this process of consolidation and the introduction of various triage measures. I would like to also congratulate the new Integrity Commissioner with respect to her appointment as well. That is Ms Jaala Hinchcliffe. The committee looks forward to working with the new Integrity Commissioner.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I just place on the record the committee's thanks to the secretariat, who provided such good service in the preparation of this report.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
