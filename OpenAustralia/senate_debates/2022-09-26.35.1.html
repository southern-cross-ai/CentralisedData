        It was announced in May this year that an Albanese Labor government would provide $4 million in funding to the Clifford Craig research hub based at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launceston_General_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Launceston General Hospital
        </a>
        . This funding would allow for a boost in research performed by the Clifford Craig Foundation, which will lead to improved health outcomes for northern Tasmanians. The Clifford Craig Foundation, based in northern Tasmania, has been at the forefront of medical research in Tasmania. This funding will ensure that a world-class, fit-for-purpose facility can continue to develop the foundation's stellar reputation. The facility will operate as an all-encompassing hub to harness medical research but also attract the best doctors and clinical staff to northern Tasmania, so that we can improve the general health outcomes for all Tasmanians.
       </p>
       <p>
        This funding will also benefit Tasmania's health system, particularly in the areas of clinical research and education and training. As well as having the full support of the Clifford Craig Foundation, the proposed hub has the support of St.LukesHealth, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Flying_Doctor_Service" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Flying Doctor Service
        </a>
        and the Launceston Health Hub. This $4 million commitment from our government will ensure that the capital works of the project are completed.
       </p>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Liberals" rel="nofollow">
         The Liberals
        </a>
        have dragged their feet and refused to invest in the health of Tasmanians for too many years. It's evident that the Liberal government didn't care when they were in office. What they did, in fact, was cut health services to regions in Tasmania. When Tasmania was in the middle of the omicron wave of the pandemic, they cut the psychological support that Tasmanians badly needed. Labor built Medicare and will ensure that it is protected.
       </p>
       <p>
        Going forward, we have a strong record of investing in medical research as well as direct services to benefit all Tasmanians, and we will build on that record, because Labor cares about our health.
