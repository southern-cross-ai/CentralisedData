       </p>
       <p>
        My question was regarding the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWB" rel="nofollow">
         AWB
        </a>
        debacle and this government’s miserable performance in relation to AWB. Despite the confected rage of this government—and of Senator Minchin, in particular, in answer to my question—there can be no hiding from the fact that this government has effectively been an effigy of the three wise monkeys in relation to AWB. They have heard no evil, they have seen no evil and they have spoken no evil. In fact, when they have had an opportunity to actually do something, they have put their hands over their ears and closed their eyes. They have done everything possible to avoid taking action and disclosing to the public—or to themselves, for that matter—just what AWB was up to.
       </p>
       <p>
        In June 2003, when the American wheat industry was talking about corruption and suggesting that bribes were taking place, I put out a press release that said, ‘We haven’t seen any evidence, but Mr Vaile and Mr Truss should investigate this matter.’ What did they do? Nothing. Of course, when the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_Export_Authority" rel="nofollow">
         Wheat Export Authority
        </a>
        was exposed, by a Senate committee on which the government had a majority, as a paper tiger with limited power—limited power that Mr Truss and Mr Vaile had known about—we found that the government had known about the difficulties since the year 2000 and had done nothing. So, when the game was over, they were prepared to act.
       </p>
       <p>
        Did they, when they had the chance, do anything about the Wheat Export Authority, which has been exposed by their commission of inquiry as absolutely useless? No. They left it in power.

              McGauran
             </a>
             has had a lot of trouble in that regard. The point has been made that, since Senator McGauran joined the Liberal Party, they have done worse in Victoria than the National Party has—whose vote has actually gone up. But let us not touch upon that. What we are talking about is the absolute incompetence of this government. It is no excuse to say that the nobbled Cole commission of inquiry, with its limited terms of reference, could say anything about the incompetence of this government. Of course it could not.

             <i>
              Australian
             </i>
             yesterday where he says that, because the government has control of this Senate, they are not going to be asked the questions that they should be asked. They could not have been asked those penetrating questions at the Cole commission of inquiry because the commission had no power to investigate how incompetent this government was, what they really knew and what they did about it. In fact, when the three wise monkeys of this government appeared before the inquiry, there were very great limitations on the questions that could be asked of them. We now know that, certainly in respect of Mr Vaile and Mr Downer, they made sure that they saw no evil, because they would not read anything; and they heard no evil, because they would not listen to anything; and, of course, they did not say anything that had anything to do with the wheat export corruption, because they claimed they knew nothing about it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Time will tell whether or not that is true, but the fact is that the Cole commission of inquiry was nobbled from the start. It could not do its job because its terms of reference were limited. In effect, what Commissioner Cole said was that he could not inquire into matters other than those specifically contained within the terms of reference. It was immaterial whether the government was incompetent or not; that was beyond the terms of reference of the inquiry. So here we have a government that is prepared to hide behind its own nobbling of a commission of inquiry. It is prepared to try and attack the opposition and say how terrible we are for attacking this government for incompetence. But everyone in the public knows that this government, in relation to
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWB" rel="nofollow">

              The Labor Party is trying to trivialise and drag down what has been a very serious and important inquiry into one of the greatest scandals that has ever involved Australian business. It is a very sad thing that this has occurred, and I think that the Labor Party is behaving in a very irresponsible and quite disreputable manner in attacking the government in this way. The truth of the matter is that Labor has not been able to substantiate accusations of misdemeanour by the Prime Minister, other ministers, the

                would be engaged in corrupt practices. Nobody believed that because we believe that Australian businesses act in an ethical way. There is no doubt at all that the findings of the Cole commission of inquiry exonerate the government. AWB systematically misled not only the Australian government but also the

                . The Volcker report unveiled corruption throughout the United Nations oil for food program involving no fewer than 2,200 companies from 66 countries while

                  had done. That has been done through the Cole commission of inquiry, and now the government will move on into a second phase of dealing with the outcome of the Cole commission of inquiry.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  One of the approaches Labor seems to use is that this is the end of the matter—that the government has closed the book on this issue. In fact, the tabling of the report is just the end of stage 1 of this matter. The Howard government will establish a task force of relevant Australian government agencies to consider, in consultation with the
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Director_of_Public_Prosecutions" rel="nofollow">
                   Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions
                  </a>
                  , possible prosecutions. Furthermore, the government will introduce legislation and seek its passage in this sitting fortnight to facilitate access by the task force to the many documents held by the Cole commission of inquiry so as to enable prosecutions to proceed.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Commissioner Cole has recommended a number of changes to strengthen Australian enforcement of
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
                   United Nations
                  </a>
                  sanctions and the conduct of future commissions of inquiry. The government will move speedily to consider those recommendations of Commissioner Cole. Like Commissioner Cole, the government is disappointed that a major Australian company could be involved in such inappropriate conduct. Australia, let me say, does not tolerate corruption—here or in any other part of the world. That is something we as Australians have every reason to be proud of.

                 <p>
                  Let us look at Labor. We have been told that a couple of Labor MPs told the

                  that in private, in the Labor Party caucus room,

                   Kim Beazley
                  </a>
                  conceded that he did not expect the opposition could claim any government scalps. So this is just a beat-up by the Labor Party. It is a fairly disgusting exhibition of gutter behaviour and of larrikins in the street trying to besmirch a very responsible commission of inquiry and a very responsible government. I think you should all be ashamed of yourselves. You should respect the outcome of this inquiry and the integrity of the government in dealing with this matter so speedily.

                   . He is surveying the wreckage around him and his response is: ‘I wasn’t there. I didn’t do it. Nobody told me. I didn’t see it. It wasn’t my fault.’ But this issue is far more serious than that.

                   Senator Eggleston has just attacked the Labor Party again. Let us remember that it is this Liberal-National coalition that is in government and has been in government for 10 years. It is this Liberal-National Party coalition government that determined to send our troops into Iraq. You can talk all you like about the other 65 countries, and you can say as much as you like about the fact that you set up an inquiry, but the fact of the matter is that this government, the

                   They were happy to make decisions to send troops into Iraq and they were happy to assert that there was evidence of weapons of mass destruction, but now they are saying: ‘We did not know. No-one told us. We were kept in the dark about the greatest corruption scandal in the history of governance in this country.’ Yesterday in question time, Mr Howard said, in answer to a question:

                     was not really the enemy. Whilst this government had the stewardship of trying to ensure honesty and integrity in the export marketing of our wheat, we had a situation where it was full of scandal. The share price of AWB has collapsed and the company effectively is going to have to be wound up or disappear or whatever because the administration of the wheat export industry is a joke. We actually recommended to this government back in 2003 that the
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_Export_Authority" rel="nofollow">
                      Wheat Export Authority
                     </a>
                     should be wound up because the growers had no confidence in it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     This is a scandal of monumental proportions. I have sat in this parliament now for 10 years. I heard members of the now government when they were in opposition—and they still do it today—try and blame the Labor Party because when we were in government there were some scandals, such as the meat substitution situation with
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AQIS" rel="nofollow">
                      AQIS
                     </a>
                     or the Midford situation with Customs. On those occasions the Labor Party took responsibility. We said, ‘Yes, these things happened on our watch and we have to fix them up.’ But what is the position of the government now? They conveniently want to ignore the history of this scandal up until Commissioner Cole’s report on Monday. They now somehow want to claim some credit, some high moral ground, and award themselves a medal, as Senator Eggleston said, because they established an inquiry. The fact of the matter is there would never have been the need to have an inquiry if the
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" rel="nofollow">
                      Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
                     </a>
                     and Minister Downer had been doing their job. Mr Cole himself acknowledged that when he said:
                    </p>
                    <p class="italic">
                     The critical fact that emerges is that
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFAT" rel="nofollow">
                      DFAT
                     </a>
                     did very little in relation to the allegations or other information it received that either specifically related to AWB, or related generally to Iraq’s manipulation of the Programme. DFAT’s response to the information and allegations was limited to seeking AWB’s assurance that it was doing nothing wrong.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     They asked the question: ‘Is anything corrupt going on here?’ AWB said no, and they said, ‘Oh, well, that’s all right; we’ll accept that and go off.’ But that sort of scrutiny was totally inadequate. It is not the sort of scrutiny that even this government have applied to other issues, but why did they apply it to this issue?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     We know now that the ‘best friends’ that Mr Howard talks about may be people like

                     , a person who has a long history of association with the National Party and is even a former candidate for the National Party. For once I actually agree with Mr Tuckey in his criticisms. The government cannot escape responsibility. It was under their stewardship that this gross scandal occurred. The fact is that the Liberal and National coalition parties are not the best friends of the wheat growers; they are the best friends of the best friends that Saddam Hussein ever had.

                     <p>
                      I want to correct something quite reprehensible that the previous speaker, Senator Forshaw, said. He said that
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWB" rel="nofollow">
                       AWB
                      </a>
                      would be wound up. That is totally incorrect. Let me put it into some perspective, because it is very important that this sort of information about Australian companies is not given any sort of credibility. The AWB wheat arm—the selling arm, the overseas export arm—is small by comparison with the rest of the assets and businesses of AWB. For instance, Landmark in AWB is by far its biggest employer. AWB is also concerned with finance, with the large retail sector, with farming and with other industries.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Senator Forshaw’s erroneous comment only adds to the misinformation that the Labor Party has been peddling over this very important issue. It seems to be an integral part of the Labor Party that it does not matter what you say as long as you say something that some people are going to believe. I think the only people who will believe the words that Senator Forshaw uttered this afternoon will be the Labor Party people who are going to vote for him anyway. The other people are going dismiss and find quite abhorrent the comments that Senator Forshaw made here today.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      We must remember that the most decent, moral and hardworking people in the world are Australian farmers. No group of people in any other industry have the moral backbone that Australian farmers have. All those words that have been spoken here this afternoon on the other side, trying to bring down AWB as a company, only have a bad effect, a negative effect, a disastrous effect, on farmers in Australia—and significantly, I must say, in
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                       Western Australia
                      </a>
                      . The biggest shareholders in AWB are farmers.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      There is something else I want to say in the very short period I have left—the time always seems too short in these debates on motions to take note of answers to questions. Labor said that there is no joy with the ministers or the Prime Minister. What Commissioner Cole found is that no blame whatsoever can be pointed at the Prime Minister or at any of the Prime Minister’s ministers, either cabinet ministers or outer ministry ministers. No blame can be pointed at them. There is no question that I would rather take Commissioner Cole’s words—his printed words, the words of an eminent judge, a man who has given his life to the law—over the words of those people on the other side who have given their lives to the trade union movement, as commendable as they think that might be. You cannot speak against someone who has that authority and respect and who is an integral part of the system of Australia, which props the whole of Australia up.

                      Do you know that Mr Beazley actually had briefings on AWB sometime ago, Mr Deputy President? Did the opposition blow the whistle then? Of course they did not. Mr Beazley had the same briefing as the government had on this. Was the whistle blown then by anyone in the Labor Party? No, it was not. They sat on it. They as an opposition sat on their hands, and now we are suffering because they failed as an alternative government. They failed the people of Australia. They failed abysmally.

                      I think back to those days in the late eighties of the piggery. Remember the piggery scandal? What about that? What was that? The Prime Minister of the time was mixed up in one with of the greatest scandals leading to self-profit of any Prime Minister of Australia. That was absolutely disgusting. I think again of

                       Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I ask that that statement ‘you ripped money’, meaning the members of this side of the parliament, be withdrawn. That is a gross misrepresentation. I also remind the Senate that there were two royal commissions that found that there was no case to answer by the Labor Party.

It is clear to me that the minister is still shaken by the heated meeting in the government party room yesterday and that his nerves have not quite recovered. You can understand why his nerves would be so shaken, given the considerable tension within the government ranks over this issue.

It is possible that in their haste to spill their guts to the media the National Party leakers may have got the exact wording of the exchange mixed up. The report then went on to say that Senator Joyce offered to take the conversation with Mr Schultz outside, until that renowned gentleman and peacemaker, Senator Heffernan, intervened. I have to be honest with you: for what it is worth, I would have had my money on Senator Joyce. After all, you can imagine that Senator Joyce is a bit sensitive about the prospect of so many of his National Party stooge mates facing jail.
