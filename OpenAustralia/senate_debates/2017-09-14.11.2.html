          Omit "23 October 2017", substitute "27 November 2017".

         <p>
          This amendment would simply extend the reporting date from 23 October 2017 to 27 November 2017. There has been a similar amendment circulated in the chamber with the actual date, but I acknowledge that this is now an amendment to Minister Fifield's amendment. The simple argument on this is that this is a significant package of bills. The Economics Legislation
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee" rel="nofollow">
           Committee
          </a>
          is a busy committee. These are contested changes; we already know that. There will be the need for hearings and submissions for these bills. We believe that a November reporting date is a much more realistic timetable for inquiry into these superannuation bills and report back to the Senate. I hope the Senate can support my amendment.
