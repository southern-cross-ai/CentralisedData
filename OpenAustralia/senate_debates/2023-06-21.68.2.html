         Senator Scarr, when you asked questions about this the other day, I made the point that I am surprised that nearly two weeks after this whole alleged scandal started the opposition, including you, continue to ask questions that are predicated on court documents that were leaked to the media and were only available to a very small number of people. I saw the reporting on these court documents in the
         <i>
          Australian
         </i>
         when it was first reported, and I remember it saying that the documents were held by a very small number of people. A couple of names were given, and I am not going repeat those names here. But a couple of names were given in that article as to people who had access to that documentation. It also said that the government, as in the Albanese government, had access to the documentation. I fail to see how it was in the interest of the Albanese government to leak to the media private court documents that are now being pursued by the opposition.

            <p>
             Senator Scarr 's defence is that court documents are in the public domain. I wonder how that happened. The settlement was in the public domain. I have also seen all sorts of speculation by members of the opposition as to the quantum of that settlement, which has never been revealed. Do you know why? It is confidential because settlements between parties in a mediation, as you well know, Senator Scarr, are confidential. And, despite your legal experience and the legal experience of the shadow Attorney-General, you continue to come into this chamber and ask questions about a settlement that is confidential between parties. You should know that, and you should know better than that.

                 As I said the other day when I answered questions from Scarr about this point, and as we have said consistently—as Senator Gallagher has said consistently and others have as well—the claim that we are talking about from an alleged rape victim that is the subject of these questions was managed consistently with the Commonwealth's obligation under the Legal Services Direction 2017. I am shocked that the opposition continue to ask questions about this matter, but I guess we cannot expect any better.

                    As I've said, Ms Higgins's claim was managed consistently with the Commonwealth's obligations under the legal services direction. The terms of settlement and the claim were managed in accordance with legal principle and practice and informed by external legal advice. The parties agreed that the terms of the settlement and that settlement process, including mediation, are confidential, and it would appear the only people who can't respect that principle are members of the opposition who continue to ask about this. As I said, I cannot believe that nearly two weeks into this we continue to have questions from the opposition.

                      No, it's not all about me. It's all about an alleged survivor of rape. That's who it's actually about. That's who it's about. And you people don't have the decency to respect that. You come in and use question time day after day to trawl over these documents that were leaked to the media by someone who had access to the documents and text messages—leaked by someone who had access to the text messages.

                                     I have no doubt that people will look back on the last two weeks to judge the relative character of the government and the opposition and the way they have dealt with these matters. There are any number of questions that the government could have asked of the opposition over the last couple of weeks, given the way things have turned out. How many of them have we asked? Not one. That's because some of us in this chamber have some decency; some of us in this chamber have some character, but, unfortunately, it doesn't look like there's a lot of it over there.
