        My question is to the Minister for Communications,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Technology" rel="nofollow">
         Information Technology
        </a>
        and the Arts, Senator Coonan. Will the minister advise the Senate of any developments in the delivery of mobile phone coverage in rural and regional areas and how the government will continue to ensure existing coverage and services are protected? Further, is the minister aware of any alternative policies?

         I thank Senator Nash for the question and for her ongoing interest in ensuring that rural and regional Australia does have world-class communication services. Mobile phones have now become an essential communication device for most Australians. There are now almost as many mobile phones as there are people in Australia, with close to 19 million subscriptions. The government recognises the importance of reliable mobile phone coverage, especially in rural areas. The $180 million targeted funding has already extended mobile phone coverage to 98 per cent of the population. The quality of services in regional areas is being transformed once again as Telstra’s new 3G mobile phone network,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_G" rel="nofollow">
          Next G
         </a>
         , is rolled out across Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         Telstra is to be congratulated for this important investment, which provides both improved mobile phone features and a wireless broadband service. However it is important that, when the existing
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDMA" rel="nofollow">
          CDMA
         </a>
         network is eventually switched off in 2008, there is no deterioration in mobile phone coverage in Australia. To that end, I have sought and obtained an assurance from Telstra that rural and regional areas will enjoy the same, or indeed better, coverage and services under its replacement network, Next G.
        </p>
        <p>
         Furthermore, coverage audits of both networks by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Communications_and_Media_Authority" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Communications and Media Authority
         </a>
         will help to verify both the quality and reach of coverage. Unlike Labor when in government, which shut down the old analog mobile network without a replacement rural network in place, this government and Telstra have a process in place to ensure a successful transition.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACMA" rel="nofollow">
          ACMA
         </a>
         ’s field testing will assess voice coverage of more than 80 sites, including city and regional centres, but will focus more heavily on rural areas. The field tests cover a representative selection of sites, including flat, mountainous and average terrain over several states.
        </p>
        <p>
         ACMA released a request for tender on 19 October to obtain expert assistance in conducting field testing. I am very pleased to inform the Senate that ACMA has today appointed the independent auditor Zamro International. While ACMA’s audit process has already begun, the actual testing of coverage in the field, with the assistance of Zamro International, will commence next month and continue into 2007. It is very important that the people concerned about getting mobile coverage know that this government is committed to achieving a smooth transition to the Next G network and these coverage audits of course will help assure both the government and mobile phone users that a seamless transition to the new network is being achieved.
        </p>
        <p>
         I was asked about alternative policies. One certainly sticks out. As Senator Nash would recall, we only need to compare this government’s approach with the kind of treatment rural mobile phone users got under the last Labor government. The previous Labor government simply decided to close down the old analog network leaving rural phone users absolutely stranded with not a plan in place and leaving it up to this government to put in place a new network. Unlike Labor, this government will not leave consumers stranded without a mobile phone. We are committed to providing quality communications services to all Australians irrespective of where they live. We can deal with the new technology and we can implement it for the benefit of all consumers.
