        My question is directed to Senator Faulkner, the Minister for Defence. Is the minister aware of the government’s commitment to acquire the F35

        ? Can the minister inform the Senate of steps the government has taken to implement this commitment?

         I can confirm that the government has approved the acquisition of the first 14

         s and the infrastructure and support required for initial training and testing, for delivery commencing in 2014, at an estimated cost of some $3.2 billion. This decision was underpinned by an unprecedented level of analysis and evaluation by Australia, the United States and the seven international Joint Strike Fighter partners. Australia’s air combat capability is of course of immense importance to our national security. That is why the previous Minister for Defence commissioned the air combat capability review early last year. The review informed the 2009 Defence white paper commitment to acquire around 100 F35 Joint Strike Fighters to replace the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA" rel="nofollow">
          FA
         </a>
         18 Hornets as the core of our future air combat capability.
        </p>
        <p>
         The next batch of aircraft, to provide three operational squadrons and a training squadron, will be considered in 2012 and will fulfil our white paper commitment to acquire three operational squadrons comprising not fewer than 72 aircraft. Australia’s first operational squadron will be ready for operations in 2018. All three operational squadrons are planned to be in service in 2021. An additional operational squadron, bringing the total number of aircraft to around 100, will be considered at a later date.

Defence will maintain close and regular contact with the United States in its ongoing reviews. Outcomes and information from reviews to date have been factored into our planning to ensure that we can deal with all realistic risks. Of course, cost and schedule risks will remain as the joint strike fighter is developed. However, any risks will be carefully measured, mitigated and managed to ensure that the
