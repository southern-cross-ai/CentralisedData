            the further statement by the Minister for Justice and Customs (Senator Ellison) on 27 November 2006 in response to Senator Ray’s question without notice on 7 November 2006, asking the Minister when he first became aware of a potential breach of 4QA of the Customs regulations in regard to the importation of goods from Iraq without the written permission of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) or his delegate,
