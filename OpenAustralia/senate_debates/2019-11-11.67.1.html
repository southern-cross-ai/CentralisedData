         I thank Senator Van for the question. Just on indulgence, I'd like to acknowledge the tremendous effort that went into ensuring that 140 residents were safely evacuated from the Carramar aged care facility on Friday 8 November. These senior Australians took refuge from the bushfires at the evacuation centre, their local library and nearby facilities, at Kabara Hostel and the Arcare facility. They were able to return to their homes yesterday, Sunday 10 November. I know that other facilities had prepared themselves ready to evacuate as well, including Japara Noosa. I'd like to particularly thank staff for their tremendous work, as well as volunteers, families, emergency workers and the senior Australians themselves for the part they played in responding so well at such a difficult time.
        </p>
        <p>
         Back to your question, Senator Van. I acknowledge your interest in issues of aged care. Our government has been investing more than ever before to support older Australians, but we recognise, following the release of the interim report of the royal commission, that additional investment will be required to ensure that all Australians have access to high-quality care as they age. It's worth noting that, when those opposite left office, funding for aged care was at $13.3 billion, and it's growing every year, from close to $22 billion this year to over $25 billion at the end of the forward estimates.
        </p>
        <p>
         We know that senior Australians are increasingly choosing to remain in their own homes longer, and the government is committed to supporting this choice. There were 60,308 aged-care packages under Labor in 2012-13. This will grow to 157,154 in 2022-23 under the current settings—an increase of 161 per cent. Over the same period—

            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">
             Royal Commission
            </a>
            into Aged Care Quality and Safety handed down its substantive interim report on 31 October 2019. At this point in time, I would particularly like to pay tribute to Commissioner Richard Tracey, whose work the report predominantly was. Tragically, he passed away recently after a very, very short period of time with a very aggressive cancer. The report is largely his work, and I would acknowledge the work that he did on the report, because it is a significant one and important for Australia's older Australians.
           </p>
           <p>
            Establishing the royal commission was one of the Prime Minister's first decisions as the new leader of the government. As the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PM" rel="nofollow">
             PM
            </a>
            said at the time, we had to brace ourselves for some difficult stories arising from the royal commission, and clearly that has occurred. The interim report of the royal commission has put us all on notice: it has put governments on notice, it has put providers on notice and it has put the community on notice. We must all learn from the stories that are in the report. We must confront them honestly—

               Our track record in improving aged care since the royal commission is extensive. We've done a lot. We've invested $2.2 billion into homecare packages. We've released 14,275 new residential care packages. We've established the new Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission. We've implemented new consumer focused Aged Care Quality Standards. And we've put in place a new single Charter of Aged Care Rights.
              </p>
              <p>
               We've implemented new provider requirements to minimise physical and chemical restraint, and there's further work to do on that. We've introduced a new mandatory national quality indicator program. And we've provided $21 million for research into 13 research projects that will focus on risk reduction, prevention and tracking of dementia, which is now Australia's second-leading cause of death.
