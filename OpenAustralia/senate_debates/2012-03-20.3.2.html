        It is my privilege to deal with these bills on behalf of the coalition and in the absence for personal reasons of Senator Birmingham. This is a very truncated debate today. I notice that because of the guillotine by the Labor Party and the Greens, we have already breached standing orders once this morning, Mr
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairman" rel="nofollow">
         Chairman
        </a>
        , because the standing order guillotined through by the Greens and the Labor Party showed that debate on these bills was to start no later than 11 am and would conclude at 11.30 am. It did not start until one minute 30 seconds past the hour of 11. It seems in this chamber that if you are the Greens you have one set of rules and if you are the opposition you have a different set of rules.
       </p>
       <p>
        Yesterday the Senate gave leave to Senator Faulkner to speak about a very gracious lady in Australian history, Mrs Whitlam. That 30 minutes was given by leave of this Senate, but outside of the rules of the guillotine passed by the Greens political party and the Labor Party. Mr Chairman, I know this Senate does not run to any particular system to assist people in their own personal issues, although I suspect with Senator Faulkner and his very strong connection to the Whitlams that perhaps it was personal.
       </p>
       <p>
        I had an issue last night where I wanted to make a speech while some 80-year-olds were in the gallery to commemorate the 55th anniversary of the crash of an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF
        </a>
        aircraft at Duntroon, involving my brother, the pilot of that Dakota aircraft, and other crew members. The surviving members were sitting in the gallery last night. Two of them are well over 80 and unlikely to be able to come back into this chamber at any time in the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank the members of the Labor Party who agreed this morning to allow me to start this session by special leave to give my speech that I was going to deliver last night on the 55th anniversary of the plane crash that took my brother's life and the lives of the relatives of those people sitting in the gallery last night. Of course, when it comes to these sorts of things, we are inflexible. When it comes to Senator Faulkner speaking about Mrs Whitlam—and she was a very gracious lady and a very important person—the rules seem to be allowed. I thank the Labor Party senators for agreeing to allow me to do that.
       </p>
       <p>
        I put on record my disgust and detesting of the Greens political party for their refusal to allow me this personal indulgence. I give it out and I take it. I have no regard for the Greens.

             . If what has been reported to me about the Greens' attitude is incorrect, then I will apologise. I can only indicate what was indicated to me: that the Labor Party were agreeable but the Greens had a problem.
            </p>
            <p>
             As I say, this is a personal issue and personal issues should not involve and interfere with the running of the country. It is typical of the actions of the Greens political party and particularly their leader that this sort of indulgence is given to the Labor Party but not to others. You have the leader again interrupting because he cannot take it.

                , I do not. I am actually speaking on the bill before the chamber. Senator Brown, as usual, is completely wrong. He is never in the chamber, so he does not understand what is happening. We are in fact dealing with the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill and related legislation. What I am saying in my contribution to this committee stage is that, although this is a complicated bill, because of the guillotine put in place by Senator Brown and his party we have 30 minutes to discuss these very important bills. I know Senator Fisher wants to say something on this. I want to say something on this but, in 30 minutes, what chance are we going to have to debate anything at all relating to the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill, which I am speaking upon, and which Senator Brown as usual does not understand and has no interest in? It is rare to see him in the chamber. He is here only when, it seems, he is asking questions about issues that certain donors have—

Unless it seems to be a question relating to something that is relevant to a substantial donor of $1.6 million to the Greens political party, Senator Brown does not seem to have any interest.

                   On a point of order, I again ask you to have the senator address the question. You know he is not addressing the question and it is time you got him to address it.

                   The CHAIRMAN: Senator Macdonald has been relevant, but he has just started to stray from the relevance of the bill. Senator Macdonald, I remind you of the question before the chair.

                    I am talking about this legislation and that the consultation in relation to the universal service obligation reform is deficient. There are a lot of other problems with this legislation—things that should be addressed in debate in this chamber, but they are not being addressed because the Greens political party and their leader have combined with the government to curtail debate on this and other important legislation. As I mentioned, when it comes to giving leave to vary these rules when it relates to the Labor Party the Greens fall over themselves to agree, but when others seek the approval of the Senate to digress slightly the Greens are not at all interested.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    How can we address the issues in this particular legislation in what is now 20 minutes? I repeat: while I always appreciate prayers at the beginning of the day it is contrary to the strict letter of the motion that actually dealt with the time for discussion. We are not even having 30 minutes for this legislation; we are having 29 or fewer minutes.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The coalition questions the need for an entire new bureaucracy to administer the universal service obligation. I would like to question the minister at length about the need for that bureaucracy but are we going to have a chance? We have now 18 minutes left to deal with every aspect of this particular legislation, thanks to the Greens. I know Senator Ludlam makes a contribution to this area of law. Is he happy with the fact that he is going to—

                      Do not tell me to hurry up, Senator Ludlam. You should have thought about this before you agreed with the Labor Party to curtail debate on this legislation to less than 30 minutes. Do not give me the hurry up signal; you should have thought about that before. With the way this chamber is now run in a little coterie of Labor Party and Greens senators we have these sorts of difficulties and these sorts of unfortunate aspects. Senator Conroy, I can well understand why you, as the relevant minister, do not want much scrutiny and do not want much debate on this because this debate—

                                  The Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill is an important bill. We would like to question Senator Conroy at length on why we need an entire new bureaucracy to administer the universal service obligation. Are we going to get an opportunity? We will probably have Senator Conroy talking for the next 10 or 15 minutes and then the debate will be finished. I note Senator Ludlum has wisely left because he is not going to get an opportunity to question the minister about this important piece of legislation. I know that Senator Fisher, who is very, very skilled in this area and who has a real interest in the Telecom­munications Universal Service Management Agency Bill, is barely going to get an opportunity to raise some of the particularly important issues that are relevant to this bill.

                                 <p>
                                  The Australian Communications and Media Authority has been administering the universal service obligation for some time. We would have thought that it has the expertise to continue doing so, even if the universal service obligation moves to a contractual model from the current regulatory platform. The government has not justified the need for a new entity to administer the public interest telecommunications services, and I want to question Senator Conroy about that particular aspect. He will give an answer, I assume, but it will be, like most answers given by the Labor Party, total spin. I will then want to question him further after he responds to my question.

                                  I understand that the government, with the connivance of the Greens, is going to be moving amendments to its own legislation before the chamber. Have we heard about them yet? Certainly, the amendments have been distributed, but it is very difficult to understand what those amendments are about. These are amendments to the govern­ment's own legislation. We are now going to have some 12 minutes for the minister to answer our questions and the questions of the Greens on this legislation and to deal with government amendments that have been circulated in the chamber but which have not been debated at all. What way is that to run the

                                  ? What way is that to allow legislation to be properly scrutinised, debated and, hopefully, improved? Whilst the coalition generally supports the bills before the chamber there are amendments and improvements that could be made and there are different issues that need to be addressed. But are we going to have time to do that in the next 10 minutes?

                                  What I highlight in my very short contribution to this debate is that the way the Labor Party and the Greens run these chambers means that we are rapidly becoming like the totalitarian regimes of yesteryear Europe. There is no opportunity to debate serious legislation because the Greens and the Labor Party say, 'No, we know what's right; we know what's best for Australia,' and they forget that parliament is about allowing the representatives of the Australian people to question, to propose and to amend legislation of the government.

                                   Thank you. Minister Conroy, as my good colleague Senator Macdonald indicated, the government has circulated some amendments to the Telecommunications Universal Service Management Agency Bill 2011 and related legislation. As best I can work out in the limited time available it seems that the entirety of them—and they occupy some four pages—have to do with what is called the facilitation of the voice customer migration policy objectives. I presume that is all about facilitating the movement of voice customers during the transition to the

                                   Given that these amendments have been circulated and that this issue has been raised by the government well after the original bill was introduced in the Senate and well after the Senate committee inquired into the bill, can the minister please explain to the chamber why the government has now seen fit to introduce this raft of amendments on the one topic when, as best I can tell, that topic has not been the subject of previous legislative consideration, nor indeed inquiry by the Senate Environment and Communica­tions Legislation Committee or consultation with industry—to the extent that that was ever facilitated in any way by the government?

                                    I thank Senator Fisher for her question. None of the amendments that are being put forward are controversial. In fact, the first two groups of amendments were recommended by the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee in its report on the bills. They were actually recommended. So they were discussed by the Senate committee, which is the proper place for it to happen, and we have taken up some of the recommendations.
                                   </p>

                                    The first group of amendments will enable TUSMA, the new statutory authority set up by one of the bills, to disclose information to the Telecommunications Industry Ombuds­man, the Regional Telecommunications Independent Review Committee and the secretary of the department; the second group of amendments provides that the TUSMA board must include a person with knowledge of consumer affairs; and the third group of amendments relates to the role of TUSMA in managing the migration of voice-only customers from the Telstra copper network to the

                                    . The migration of these customers will be helped if the service pro­viders of those customers provide customer information to TUSMA. To do so at the moment, however, may breach the statutory privacy and confidentiality obligations. These amendments enable the provision of information and overcome those issues. A related set of amendments permit disclosure by service providers of information to TUSMA where this may assist TUSMA in carrying out any of its functions or exercising any of its powers. These are similar to arrangements that currently allow information to be disclosed to the

                                    Once again there was a bit of colour and movement on that side of the chamber, with suggestions that it was not discussed or debated, yet two-thirds of these amendments were actually recommended by a Senate committee that examined this at some length—which I am sure you were involved in, Senator Fisher. Possibly you may not have been, so I may be doing you a disservice. I appreciate that you did have some time off, so you may not have participated all the way through that committee. But this was certainly canvassed by a Senate committee.

I think it is fairly free-ranging if I am responding directly to comments that were made by Senator Macdonald. I think, to be fair to you, Senator Fisher, you were not here, and I do not think Senator Fifield was, but Senator Macdonald is a guilty party. He voted to privatise a vertically integrated monopoly and create the mess that we are cleaning up; this is the final part of the legislation to clean it up. The government, for the first time, are making a contribution towards the costs of the universal service obligation for those in our community that have the worst access to telecommunications services. We are not the party that voted for privatisation that meant that Telstra's mobile phone network did not reach all the places it should. We are not the party—

                                        Thank you. As I said, they were considered by the Senate committee. I did not suggest that the third was, but what I have been arguing is that this is a mess you made. If Telstra wanted to close a phone box in this country, Telstra put a sticker on it and closed it down. We are now taking away the capacity for Telstra to unilaterally rip phone boxes out of the ground—literally rip them out of the ground, as they have been doing around this country—and get rid of them. We now have a different regime so that they are not able to do those things. We have an agency that will have funding from the government for the first time. You never put a cent in.
                                       </p>
                                       <p>
                                        How was the universal service obligation fund previously done? Telstra would say it does not pay for all the costs of providing the universal service agency, and there is an existing levy on telcos. How was this figure devised? I think one of the former communications ministers from those opposite used to add his mother's age, divide by his shoe size and just make a number up. I know this because I have inherited it. Every year it comes across the table: 'What amount do we want to charge for the universal service obligation levy?' All we have done so far is roll it over, because trying to fathom the way that Senator Alston calculated the universal service obligation levy was actually comical. Nobody in the parliament, the bureaucracy or the industry has ever to this day been able to tell us what the formula was for creating the levy.
                                       </p>
                                       <p>
                                        We stepped up and said it is time we had a new agency to make the calculations and to look at this levy arrangement. More importantly, for the first time—it did not come from the National Party or from the rural Liberal Party members that Senator Macdonald so proudly boasts of regularly—we have said the government will make a contribution to protecting the telecom­munications services in dollar terms. We are putting money in: $100 million each year into the future. We are putting that forward to the costs of the universal service levy to make sure Telstra cannot just rip phone boxes that people still use out of the ground. We are proud of that and we will not back away from that. This agency allows us to have a role in protecting telecommunications services for the first time. Those opposite, who privatised a vertically integrated monopoly and who were interested only in fattening up the cow for privatisation in the past, should hang their heads in shame and, as you are going to do in a few minutes, vote for this legislation, because it will be the absolute ultimate shame if you oppose an agency that will guarantee the protection of telecommunications services into the future for regional and rural Australians.

                                         Can the minister confirm that, of the amendments that the government has circulated, the amendments from (3) onwards—occupying the bottom of page 1, page 2, page 3 and page 4 of the government amendments—each concern facilitation of the voice customer migration policy and do not concern either of the first two-thirds of the amendments, which the minister properly indicated were the subject of consideration by the Senate committee? Can the minister (1) confirm that and (2) confirm that the only ones of the government's amendments that were considered and recommended by the Senate committee were in fact amendments (1) and (2) of the amendments circulated, occupying a third of page 1?

                                           On a point of order, as I understand the motions dealing with 'time management', this bill was supposed to start at 11 am. It did not start until about two minutes past. I know Senator Fisher has some other questions she would like to ask. Are we allowed to have the extra two minutes, or what is the ruling where there is a specific time when this bill is to start and it did not? Do we just ignore those two minutes or is this something that the movers of the motion did not contemplate? I am curious as to how we have not started in accordance with the motion agreed to as to time?

                                            Senator Macdonald, my understanding is that the order passed by resolution of the Senate fixing the hours for today also incorporates the existing standing order of the commencement of the day where prayers take place. I do not believe there was any scope for additional time to be added. You have raised that matter. If anything else needs to be added, the President or I will report back to the chamber.
