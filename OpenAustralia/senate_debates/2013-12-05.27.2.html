        , I was waiting for this from the Clerk but it came during the selection of bills debate, which obviously happened after the notices of motion. I seek leave to put in a notice of motion, if I could.

            I move:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent me from giving notice of a motion today.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
             Mr President
            </a>
            , I think it is a little unnecessary that I have been stopped from being able to give notice of a motion that would have taken no time in this place whatsoever. If this is the attitude of this new government that every time, because they do not get their own way, they decide to behave like absolute thugs, then I tell you we will do everything we possibly can to try to restore some order in this place that shows a little more decency, a little more respect, a little more basic courtesy to our fellow senators.
           </p>
           <p>
            After six years of seeing this group over here take liberties wherever they possibly could and often having to seek leave for different things—wanting to hijack the Senate's agenda—there has always been an ability in this place to show a little courtesy to each other. Yet the thugs on the other side of the chamber now think that just because they have the numbers in the House that means that somehow they want to ram through things here in the Senate. Well, it just is not the case.
           </p>
           <p>
            The notice of motion that I was going to give this morning is in relation to a private senator's bill that will be on the table for debate next week. If others on the other side are not happy to allow a little bit of courtesy, despite the fact that the bill was meant to be given notice of today in order for it to be introduced on Monday, it does not leave much time for proper scrutiny within the Senate process. This is the entire attitude of this government. This is all part of the secrecy, the sneaking around, all then covered with: 'We'll tell you what we want you to hear; we will make sure that we decide what you want to hear and when you want to hear it.' This is absolute thuggery from this government.
           </p>

            Question agreed to.
           </p>
           <p>
            I give this notice:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            That on the next day of sitting I shall move that the following bill be introduced: a bill for an act to amend the Migration Act 1958 and for related purposes.
            <i>
