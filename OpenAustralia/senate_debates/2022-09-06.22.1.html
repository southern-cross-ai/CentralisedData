        Australia is a committed and longstanding partner of the

        , Tuberculosis and Malaria, and it's now time for Australia to again play its part in the new replenishment round which is currently underway. The replenishment will happen on 19 September, and I know Australia is busily preparing to make its pledge later this month. The Australian government is indeed working closely with the global fund on implementation of their new strategic priority beyond 2023 to 2028. The global fund has saved millions and millions of lives—some 44 million—and lifted many, many more out of health poverty. More than 17 million lives have been saved in our own region, so it's time now for Australia to reinvest in this important multilateral.

        The global fund pulls funding from donor countries, from philanthropic organisations, from the private sector and, importantly, from developing countries themselves. With every dollar given by Australia, we see $31 in health gains and economic returns. I'm really pleased to say that people with lived experience have always been at the heart of the global fund's activity, working with the private sector and governments to design, implement and monitor grants and really to address these health impacts in AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria on the ground. The global fund is asking Australia for an increased commitment of some $450 million over the next three years. I know that we're working very closely with them, and a strong commitment will get Australia and the world on track to defeat AIDS,

        and malaria.
