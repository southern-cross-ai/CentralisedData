        My question is to the Minister for Finance, Senator Birmingham. With the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHO" rel="nofollow">
         WHO
        </a>
        declaring omicron a COVID variant of concern, which could lead to further restrictions and has already led to border closures, Australia's live music and entertainment industries are again in chaos. Concerned that they don't have the insurance to cover them in the upcoming seasons, they've issued an urgent call to your government and the Prime Minister to step in and fund a government insurance scheme for them. When will the Prime Minister do this? Why is the Prime Minister risking these small businesses and this economy simply because of your refusal to act?

         I thank Senator Hanson-Young for her question. At the outset, as I think I've said on every day so far this week, I urge caution in relation to some of the commentary around the omicron variant of COVID-19. There are still things that are not yet known about it, which is why some precautionary steps have been taken, such as the two-week deferral of Australia's reopening for movement of students and other particular visa-category holders. Many experts are highlighting that perhaps some of the concerns around this variant are less than were first thought in the initial couple of days when we became more aware of it publicly. Nonetheless, we take the matter seriously.
        </p>
        <p>
         We've also taken quite seriously support for the creative economy. The creative economy COVID support package was originally $250 million. Since then, we have increased it to over $475 million. That's in addition to some $730 million provided to the creative and performing arts subdivision of industry through JobKeeper, and about $119 provided in cash-flow payments to creative and performing arts organisations. Altogether, we can see that the COVID support has been well in excess of $1 billion through a range of different measures. That's in addition to the business-as-usual funding provided to the arts sector of around $750 million per annum from the government, along with other additional support. So I don't accept the characterisation from Senator Hanson-Young in relation to an absence of support. Support has been significant, extensive and expanded throughout the course of the pandemic.

           My question was specifically in relation to an insurance support program—a guarantee for insurance. There is a market failure. Other countries have recognised this.

           have all put in place insurance schemes to fill this market gap. That is the role of government. Why won't you act?

            program—the Restart Investment Sustain and Expand fund—delivers on some of the objectives that Senator Hanson-Young is precisely asking about. It supports programs and initiatives to be able to restart. When events are postponed due to COVID restrictions, we've been working with funding recipients to assist them in relation to the rescheduling. The funding is there to provide that support and that underwriting to ensure that an event can proceed even if there are concerns and doubts that exist around that. But it and the Commonwealth government's programs don't operate in isolations. They operate alongside many state government ventures, and it is not unusual for many of these major events to be operated by state government agencies and instrumentalities too.

It is why more than $1 billion of additional COVID-19 assistance has been provided to the creative industries, the live-performance industry being a key part of that. But, in addition to all of those funding principles, the work in the national plan to help drive reopening is a key part of that and is something that our government has led, and encouraged the states and territories to follow, to make sure these sectors can get back to business, which I know is what they want to do most.
