        , Senator Sherry. Can the minister inform the Senate of the state of the economy since the chamber last sat, before the general election? In particular, how have the government’s economic policies supported Australia’s small businesses during the global recession and how will the government continue to support this vital sector of Australia’s economy?

        <p>
         Thank you for the question. Small business obviously is a major part of our economy. It is a vital sector. There are some two million small businesses, employing some 4.8 million Australians and making up 96 per cent of all businesses. The Gillard government appreciates the very important contribution that small business makes to our economic prosperity and supporting jobs.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have introduced a range of measures over the last three years and will introduce a range of measures over the next three years to support small business. For example, our tax plan for the future provides tax relief and less red tape for small business, instant write-offs for assets of up to $5,000, simpler depreciation rules and an early cut to company tax. There are a range of other initiatives: the business enterprise centres across Australia; the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Business" rel="nofollow">
          Small Business
         </a>
         Support Line, which is assisting small business owners to access information; the referral services on matters such as obtaining finance and hardship counselling; and the Small Business Online program, which is helping small business owners to go online and engage in the digital economy.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have also recognised the crucial role of skills training in the context of small business. Our introduction of the Apprentice Kickstart directly assists and enables small and medium enterprises to take on apprentices. We have also made dealing with and selling to government easier for small business. We have implemented consistent and simpler procurement processes and an on-time payment guarantee to ensure small business contracts will be paid within 30 days. There will be a report released shortly giving an update on that particular initiative. During the global financial crisis, it was small businesses and the thousands of people that they employed—

                   As I have indicated, the actions of this Labor government in providing a decisive and timely stimulus—opposed by those opposite—saved tens of thousands of small businesses in this country. But in the next three years we intend to provide further support for small business. There will be major cash flow boosts through special tax breaks and significant tax relief: as I have indicated, the $5,000 instant tax deduction—opposed by those opposite yet again; they are not going to support it—and the ability to depreciate all other assets at a single rate of 30 per cent. This is significant help for small business which is again going to be opposed by those opposite, the wreckers. Time and again, they oppose positive initiatives for small business. Some 720,000 small businesses will get an early start to the reduced company tax rate of some 29 per cent in 2012-13.
