        My question is to the Minister for Communications and the Minister representing the Minister for Sport, Senator Fifield. Over the weekend, Australia took on England in a historic day-night women's Ashes test match. Does the minister agree that the event was of a kind the televising of which should be available free to the general public? If not, why not?

         I think all colleagues welcome great Australian sporting teams and great Australian sporting triumphs. As colleagues—who I know are very keen followers of Australian media law—are aware, it is ultimately a matter for Australian media organisations as to the broadcast rights that they purchase. Obviously, that is qualified to the extent that we have what's known as the anti-siphoning list. The anti-siphoning list is not there to guarantee that certain events will be free to air; it is there to give free-to-air broadcasters—commercial broadcasters—the first rights to purchase those events. I should point out that the anti-siphoning list doesn't mandate that free-to-air commercial
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">
          TV
         </a>
         has to purchase particular events, it doesn't prevent them from onselling them and it doesn't make it mandatory that they in any way seek to acquire those events. I just thought I'd provide that context for the way sporting rights operate in Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         Colleagues would be aware that recently a majority of us in this place together moved to update and reform Australia's media laws. Part of that was to have a sensible renovation of the anti-siphoning list.

                   I will ask colleagues, as I have over the last three days, to show some courtesy to those senators who have requested less noise so they may hear questions and answers. Senator Fifield, have you concluded your answer?

                      The minister went nowhere to answering my last question, but I will try again. Given that officials have confirmed in estimates that the minister had not sought any advice from them on the grant, isn't it clear that the grant had nothing to do with supporting women's sport and was nothing more than a $30 million taxpayer funded gift?

                       In the context of the preparation of the budget, government receives a range of sources of advice as inputs to the decision, but can I just point out, by way of contrast, that, while it is true that the budget determined that there would be $7½ million per annum over four years to Fox Sports, the public broadcasters receive in excess of a billion dollars a year, and that is an important contribution which the public broadcasters, for example, can use to purchase any sporting events that they think are appropriate for their particular mandate and charter. These are the facts.
