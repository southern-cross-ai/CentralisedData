        My question is to the Minister for Emergency Management and National Recovery and Resilience, Senator McKenzie. Can the minister update the Senate on what arrangements the Liberal and Nationals government has in place to ensure we are well prepared for bushfires, floods and other natural disasters this high-risk weather season.

         I thank Senator Molan for his question and for his longstanding interest in emergency management matters. The Australian government is well prepared to respond to disasters that may occur during the upcoming high-risk weather season. We have been working closely with states and territories to ensure that all levels of government are ready to respond quickly and effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since September this year, our government, through
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Management_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Emergency Management Australia
         </a>
         , has led a national preparedness program with states and territories, industry and not-for-profit organisations so that we can practise our responses to crises. On 5 September, we announced additional funding to support preparedness for the upcoming season, including $2 million for the national community education and engagement program for the Australian Warning System due to commence this week, $44 million to the Australian Aerial Firefighting Centre to fund the lease of a large air tanker, over $20 million to implement the Australian Fire Danger Rating System to give clear and consistent fire danger information across Australia, and $23 million to enhance
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMA" rel="nofollow">
          EMA
         </a>
         's national situation room to have the most up-to-date information to hand in a crisis. We know that these severe weather events are inevitable and that's why we're even better prepared to respond to disasters once they've happened.
        </p>
        <p>
         We've put in place a new streamlined process for activating the disaster recovery funding arrangements. That's the primary way we fund recovery following disasters here in Australia. These arrangements are co-funded in partnership with jurisdictions and delivered by the state or territory that has requested that assistance. They provide much-needed assistance for immediately after a natural disaster.
        </p>
        <p>
         We're not just focused on immediate response and recovery; we're also focused on developing resilience because we know the money spent on building community resilience before a disaster will provide more long-term value than money spent on recovery.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our government has invested heavily in disaster risk reduction with the $600 million Preparing Australia Program. On 8 November, I announced the release of the grant opportunity guidelines for round 1 and I look forward to applications. (

            This year the Australian government, through
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Management_Australia" rel="nofollow">
             Emergency Management Australia
            </a>
            , has worked with the states, territories and industry to agree the COVID-19 Interstate (Fire, Emergency and other Essential Services) Deployment Protocol. The protocol will facilitate cross-border movement for emergency support specialists and technicians not only for that immediate response in the middle of a crisis but for the all-important work associated with cleaning up and rebuilding after a disaster occurs.
           </p>
           <p>
            The updated protocol came into effect on 8 November with endorsement from state and territory emergency chiefs as well as the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee. It will mean we can ensure that essential workers required to repair critical infrastructure assets like telecommunications, power, energy and health, can go where they're needed to restore these essential services to Australians. It will also apply to tradespeople, where rebuilding is required, and insurers to make it easier for people to access the support they need to repair their homes and get their businesses back up and running after a disaster.

               Severe weather events, like we've seen over
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
                New South Wales
               </a>
               over the past week, are always distressing for those who experience them. That's why our government is committed to supporting communities impacted by natural disasters. The recent severe weather event in New South Wales caused damage to critical infrastructure and residential properties, while the very heavy rain has caused flooding to occur and has damaged crops right across New South Wales.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Australian and New South Wales government funded disaster assistance will provide a range of practical assistance measures to help councils, individuals, primary producers, small businesses and charities to recover and get back on their feet. The assistance will help to cover the costs associated with the operational response and repair to damaged essential public assets. Additionally, individuals will receive support to get back on their feet, including grants to replace essential household contents or repair structural damage to homes, because our government is ready to stand side-by-side with these communities and ensure that they recover.
