        Senator Cadell, of course it's got worse in two years. You've probably seen the vision on your screens, whether that was a phone or a television screen, but try living it out in everyday life and seeing it right before your eyes. Everywhere in Australia there's been an increase in domestic and family violence. There are little children in

        throwing big rocks and wielding big, metal bars and young girls and boys in violent fights in the middle of the day in plain sight in schoolyards and on streets, footy fields and public transport.

        and Queensland. It's impossible to ignore, and the statistics—that's right—the data, the evidence back it up. That violence sparks retaliation. Youth crime is out of control, and so is violence. Shame on you, every single one of you, for thinking this is a race issue. This is about children's futures—little children's futures.
