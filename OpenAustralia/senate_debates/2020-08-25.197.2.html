        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the Senate take note of the interim report.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is of course an interim report because the work of the committee has been disrupted by the pandemic, as have so many other things. But, tragically, as we are mourning the lives that have been lost to COVID-19, there are also lives which have been lost simply by travelling on our roads: people going to and from work, visiting family or coming home from a sporting event.
       </p>
       <p>
        Even in these pandemic times, there have been times as a bike rider when I have had cars and trucks come scarily too close to me and driving past way too fast. I know how dangerous and scary that can be. So, sadly, even as the pandemic slows down so much of our daily lives we're still seeing cycling deaths. And in the context of road safety I want to acknowledge here the death of cyclist Carolyn Lister and offer my condolences to her family and friends. She was a nurse and a cyclist who lived in Brisbane. Her life was cut tragically short in June of this year. She was a strong rider and had recently taken up racing with the Hamilton Wheelers Cycling Club. She was excited to win her first race last year.

         Senator Rice, could you just give us a moment while we get some technical assistance? You've dropped out. I think that Senator Rice may need to request leave to continue her remarks on Thursday.
        </p>
        <p>
         Leave granted.
