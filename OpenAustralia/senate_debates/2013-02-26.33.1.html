        My question is to the minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Conroy. I refer to the newspaper ads that appeared in Victorian newspapers over the weekend with respect to hospitals funding. Did the Independent Communications Committee review and/or approve the advertisements relating to Victorian hospital funding that appeared in Victorian newspapers over the weekend? How much did the advertisements cost to prepare and publish?

           The Gillard government has announced a $107 million rescue package for Victorian hospitals, following Premier Ted Baillieu's failure to properly manage the state's health system. The cash injection will be paid directly to local hospital networks, which will distribute the money to ailing Victorian hospitals, and it will not pass through the hands of the Baillieu government.

                     On government advertising, the government continues to spend more than $100 million less than the $254 million spent by those opposite in 2007—$254 million of taxpayers' funds spent on your previous government's advertising. We continue to be $100 million less. On the specific issue of the process of those ads, I am happy to take that on notice to see if there is any further information that is available.

                           Those ads absolutely accurately describe the situation that for the last two years Premier Baillieu's blatant disregard for the welfare of Victorian patients has seen reductions in health care. This funding injection will go directly to front line hospital administrators so that they can immediately restore services shut down by the Baillieu government in recent years. Despite significant increases in Commonwealth health funding and additional

                           revenues paid to Victoria, health results in Victoria have been going backwards for almost two years. Commonwealth funding will increase by over $900 million over the next four years, and we expect the Victorian government to lift its game.

                            , I ask a further supplementary question. Will the minister correct the record and concede that instituting retrospective funding cuts for procedures and treatments performed up to 17 months earlier was misguided and that the advertisements in Victorian newspapers were profoundly misleading by claiming these cuts were the result of anything other than the decision by this Labor government—by Treasurer Wayne Swan?

                             , you will see that documents show the extent of the incompetence and cynicism of the Baillieu government. The Baillieu government pulled on a fight with the Commonwealth government to act as a smokescreen for the effects of their own $616 million worth of cuts. Elective surgery waiting lists have reached a record high of 46,131—that is 7,000 more than when the government came to office. New documents show that, thanks to Premier Baillieu's cuts, he was planning for even greater blowouts this year. The

                               is providing Victoria with significant additional funding under the National Health Reform Agreement, which I am sure Senator Ryan would agree with. In 2012-13, the federal government provided $3.6 billion in total health funding to Victoria. In 2015-16, health funding will rise to $4.5 billion. It will rise to $4.5 billion. This means the Victorian public hospital system will receive over $900 million—$900 million—in additional funding from the Gillard government over the next four years.

                                 On top of this, the federal government last week announced a $107 million rescue package to be paid directly to Victorian hospitals. Why? Because we are acting to ensure patients can access the services they need by delivering this $107 million cash injection to the Victorian hospital system so that it can immediately restore services that have been shut down by Premier Baillieu's government. This is in stark contrast to $616 million that Premier Baillieu's government have slashed from health care. They took $616 million out of health care. Senator Ryan should be writing to Premier Baillieu and demanding where that $616 million went, because they have slashed funding for patients, and patients are suffering as a consequence of those severe cuts.

                                     I thank Senator Marshall for his first supplementary question. The Victorian government once again have displayed their complete and utter contempt for Victorian patients. They do not seem even to be able to manage their own healthcare system. Like Mr Abbott and Premier Newman, all they can do is cut health spending. They do not want to invest in patient care. They do not want to invest in future hospitals. The Victorian government have slashed $616 million from the Victorian health system and, importantly, they have not even released the elective surgery data since the June quarter last year. They have not even provided that data. The Victorian Minister for Health needs to stand up and release that data so that we can compare and have a look at what that data provides. However, last night some other data was leaked and published on the front page of the

                                       I thank Senator Marshall for his second supplementary question. This year the Gillard government is providing over $13.3 billion for Australian public hospitals, and this figure will continue to grow in the future as we continue to invest in hospitals and health reform. The Minister for Health in Victoria, Mr Davis, is not as good with his cuts as the opposition were when they were in government: he has only managed $616 million from his budget. But those opposite cut $1 billion when they were in government. Mr Abbott cut $1 billion—twice as good as Mr Davis, but twice as bad.
