        My question is to the Assistant Minister for Health, Senator Nash. Can the minister advise the Senate about the good work that the National Centre for Farmer Health is doing in my home state of Victoria and how the government has supported the national centre?

         I thank Senator McKenzie for her question and for her dedicated representation of regional communities. I would be very pleased up update the Senate on the government's commitment to provide $375,000 to the National Centre for Farmer Health. This is in conjunction with the Victorian government's commitment of $250,000â€”and want to thank the minister,

         , and particularly the member for Lowan,

          Hugh Delahunty

         , for their tireless work on this. We were able to provide total funding of $625,000.

         In operation since 2008, the National Centre for Farmer Health's work will continue to build on the industry, government and academic partnerships developed initially through the Sustainable Farm Families Program. The National Centre for Farmer Health will bring together university research, service delivery, government and education, by focusing on five key areas including professional training and education, applied research and development, web-based information and services, agri-safe clinics and the Sustainable Farm Families programs.
        </p>
        <p>
         The National Centre for Farmer Health is an expert in a unique and growing discipline of agricultural health and medicine and, in partnership with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deakin_University_School_of_Medicine" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         , deliver the only postgraduate agricultural health training available in Australia. Recent analysis of past students showed over 80 per cent working in rural settings. The Sustainable Farm Families initiative is an award-winning, proactive program that creates a bridge between health services and farm families who do not independently seek out health professionals and information. The program contextualises health, mental health and safety in a business framework, and lets farmers recognise their health and wellbeing as their most important asset. Indeed, over 2,525 farmers from 120 different locations have participated.

             It is this government that understands the importance of farm safety and farmer health, and directing funding to organisations that actively work on prevention. It was those opposite who ignored the pleas of the Victorian state government and the National Centre for Farmer Health to keep it operating. Apparently, their requests fell on deaf ears. The Victorian Minister for Health,

            </p>
            <p>
             Labor cried crocodile tears for the centre while refusing to fund it. As a farmer, I understand the need to fund these vital organisations and how important they are in focusing the minds of our agricultural communities and our farmers in ensuring their health, safety and wellbeing. It is this government that will focus on rural and regional communities and this government that will support them to have a viable future.
