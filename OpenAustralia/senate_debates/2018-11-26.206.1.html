It simply condemns the behaviour and the radicalisation of young Muslims in our country. We've seen recent events again. We know some of these institutions are hotbeds of radicalisation.

                    I'll respond to that interjection. I did put you on notice that it's a special this week at Ronald McDonald's—two for one: if you try and silence me, I'll silence you twice, and we'll go until there are no motions debated on the floor of this Senate, if that's what you choose to do. There is absolutely no blink in me. This has been going on over a period of time, where we've tried to put significant, important issues to the floor—

                    I'll tell you what: there's a hell of a lot of noise coming out of them now. There wasn't much noise when we were talking about rape and sexual assault on members of their political party. Their heads were down. They were absolutely silent at that time because they condone it. Denial of formality here suggests to me that they are not against the idea of radicalisation of young Muslims affecting the national security of this country. There is no other conclusion to be drawn. You should go back to being silent. That's when you make your best contribution.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The fact of the matter is that these are significantly important issues, and it goes all the way back to the first denial of formality that started this race to the bottom, which has been going on for couple of months. It started this race to the bottom and stopped people having a voice in one of the most important chambers in the country. What we say here and how we attach ourselves to a question and whether we support or don't support a particular issue is significant. Australia watches us. They do watch. I'm surprised at how many people don't have a hobby and spend their afternoon watching question time and now general notices of motion.

                    I'm happy, at any given time, as soon as I see a white flag anywhere—a hanky will do—to allow every motion to go to this floor to challenge each of us to determine how we will vote and support it. To deny people the ability to put serious motions about national security, about late-term abortions—

It's the fuel in my tank, because I will tell you what: it brings up the bile in my throat that you would deny this chamber the opportunity to criticise sexual aggression, complaints of rape that were not dealt with by each and every one of you, if the media reports are correct. This is about freedom of speech. This race to the bottom will continue. I'm happy to make a very significant contribution until we're allowed to debate questions of importance to our nation.

                     Here they go up again, biting again and again and continuing to chime in. I'm surprised they don't want do have a discussion about radical Islam because normally they're very happy to talk about how the rest of Australia is racist—because they believe that Islam is a race—or the fact that we are over-egging a threat.

                     on 11 September 2001. This is the delusional character who purports to speak on behalf of Muslims in this country. He is an out-and-out nut job—I make no bones about that—and his brand of Islam is nutty. It is chaotic; it is dysfunctional. And the Greens will not allow it to be condemned. They've joined up in the past. They've joined up with Iranians, as the Iranians are persecuting their own citizens and hanging homosexuals. It's like a bizarre sort of red-green alliance. They've defended this sort of nonsense for far too long. Now they're denying formality to this chamber, which is their right. But they are denying formality for this chamber to pass a motion, a statement of intent, condemning the ideology of the rabid feral dogs who are out there trying to butcher Australian citizens.

                     This is the disgrace. I note the huffing and puffing from Senator McKim over there. He's huffing and puffing as, just last week or the week before, we had one of these radical converts stabbing people and taking lives in the

                     </a>
                     Mall, as referenced in this motion. Where were the Greens condemning that? They weren't. They are shameless. Now they're denying formality to this chamber to pass a resolution, which is absolutely sympathetic. It is in keeping with what is important to the Australian people: a safe and orderly society. They will welcome people from all over the world, but they will have no time for the extremists who are seeking to radically overthrow, overhaul or damage the Australian citizenry and our way of life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     There is no more radical and dangerous ideology in this chamber than what is sitting in the Greens, because we know they are prepared to cover up the slights against the Western world, if it supports their goals. We know they are prepared to cover up the misogyny, the misandry, the sexual abuse, the rape allegations and the complaints against their own organisations, if it will further the global Greens cause. We know that they have no regard for truth or fact. They are prepared to peddle any fiction in the name of growing their own support base.

                    <p>
                     Denying formality on such a significant motion is another example of just how out of touch this radical and extreme Greens movement is with what the Australian people expect. For those who say we pass too many motions in this place, very few, if any, are more serious than this. This is not a platitude. This is not just a spurious political stunt. This is about our national security and it is about uniting the Australian people—uniting this chamber—and yet we find it fosters division because of the radical elements that are at work here.

                     is a dangerous ideology, just like the radical Greens movement is a dangerous ideology. I'm amazed. They always like talking about identities and they love talking about the alphabets, Muslims, vegans and everyone else who is apparently marginalised in society, but when it comes to sticking up for the rest of Australia—for those people who entrust this place and this government and successive governments with their national security—where do they go? They go missing. They deny formality. It is an indictment upon them.

                      I want to be clear that the Labor Party did not deny formality, but we would oppose this motion. Firstly, I want to reflect on the concerns, or reservations, many senators have about how formal business is being managed in this place. I understand, on this occasion, the government will support this suspension of standing orders. It's their business agenda. If they want to allow it to be diverted in this fashion, who are we to necessarily compromise that? But, in relation to this motion, I want to make it clear that Labor firmly believes that the Muslim community is already providing valuable cooperation with security and enforcement agencies. The security agencies themselves say that this cooperation is one of the most important tools they have in the fight against extremism and terrorism.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Labor abhors violent extremism in all its forms. Singling out one community is rarely helpful. This motion is a sad attempt at a stunt. Division gives terrorists and those who wish to do us harm exactly what they want.

                         I don't want to talk so much about the substance of the motion, although I can't understand why anyone would oppose a motion that calls upon the Islamic community in Australia to continue—continue—to condemn radical Islam in speech and deed and reaffirm its commitment to working alongside Australian security agencies to address radicalisation in all its forms. In spite of what Senator Collins just said, I can't understand why anyone in this chamber would not want to support at least that aspect of the motion. I also note in passing that it calls upon Sheikh Omran to publicly retract his criticism of police and intelligence services and to denounce all radical Islamic speech and jihadism. Again, whilst that may cause some concern to some, I would think that most couldn't really object to that call to action in this motion.

                         , also supporting the words of Senator Bernardi, is that this again demonstrates the hypocrisy of the Greens political party. It's interesting to note that the Labor Party denied that they were the ones who denied formality.

                           is that it demonstrates, yet again, the ultimate hypocrisy of the Greens political party. I'm not sure that I particularly supported Senator O'Sullivan's previous motion highlighting the sexual harassment and misdeeds of the Greens political party. I hadn't seen it before and I hadn't formed my opinion on what we should do. But I do think that these things should be allowed to be put to a vote. But the Greens had a no problem in that instance in denying—

                                exercise that opportunity here every day in this section of the parliament. They always bring up motions that most of the rest of us have got better things to do with our time than to deal with. The Greens will further delay the Senate knowing that they don't have the numbers, but they will continue to call divisions when they know they have clearly lost the motion they have put forward. Why do they do that? You can ask them, but I guess it's again for crass political reasons, for their own small band of followers they have—a band of followers, I might say, that is getting smaller. But the way the Greens will always deny others the opportunity to speak doesn't apply to themselves. If anyone ever should deny them the opportunity to speak, there is absolute and abject outrage. The hypocrisy of the Greens political party knows no bounds. I would certainly support Senator O'Sullivan's right to put this motion as a formal motion and have the Senate determine it accordingly.

                                  Because there's been, I believe deliberately, a significant misinformation placed on the record about what's happened this afternoon, I just want to be clear about what has actually happened in the last half an hour in this Senate. It was the

Do you see how easy this game is to play? Is it becoming clear to you now how easy it is? You see? That's the problem that we have here.

                                                  The point I am of course making here is that you shouldn't tarnish a large group of people because of the sins of a few members of that group. You shouldn't do it. And that's what this motion seeks to do to Muslim people. That's what it seeks to do. We are saying very clearly that of course there are Muslim people who do bad things. Of course there are Christian people who do bad things. Of course there are atheists who do bad things. There are people in most groups in our community who do bad things. You shouldn't tarnish the reputations of an entire group of people because some members of that group do bad things.
                                                 </p>
                                                 <p>
                                                  We're going to stand up for reason in this debate. We are going to stand up for facts to be placed on the record. And we are going to stand up against the ongoing demonisation of Australia's entire Muslim community by people like Senator Bernardi who believe it is in their political interests to do that. That's what we are standing up for here today: for fairness, for an acknowledgement that every group of people that has a reasonable number of people in it is going to contain people who do bad things. But we shouldn't be tarnishing those entire groups of people because of the actions of a few. That applies to the Christian churches that ran protection rackets for paedophiles as much as it applies to any other group. So I urge members to let motions be debated, to put facts on the record rather than making stuff up—like Senator Macdonald has and like Senator Bernardi has—and not tarnish large groups of people because of the actions of a few.
