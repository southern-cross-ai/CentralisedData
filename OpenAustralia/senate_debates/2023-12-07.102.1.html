        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. The last 18 months of the Albanese Labor government has seen the Labor Party spend $450 million on a failed referendum that unnecessarily divided Australians and was never going to achieve any practical outcomes to benefit
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
         Indigenous Australians
        </a>
        or to close the gap. Does the Albanese government accept that all it has achieved to date is leaving Indigenous Australians more divided and further behind? Isn't it clear that Labor's priorities have been completely wrong, and will you finally give a straight answer on whether Labor is now pursuing a nationwide treaty?

         First, in relation to the referendum, I appreciate that you took a different view to many in the Australian community. I would point out—you may say it was wasted—that we went to the election after having consulted with many Indigenous leaders who took a different view to the one you've outlined, and, having looked at and considered closely the Statement from the Heart and the process which led to that, we made a commitment to the people of Australia that we would hold a referendum, and we did. Obviously there was a result that we accept. We recognise that that requires a different path, and, as Ms Burney has said, that will be something this government continues to consult on—the way forward. I hope that one of the things that we did come to in that referendum campaign is, while many people did not agree with a particular constitutional proposition, that—

            Fifteen out of 19 Closing the Gap targets are not on track. Systemic disadvantage continues, including tragic child and family violence. Given the policies of the Albanese Labor government are failing so miserably, will Labor finally agree to support the coalition's call for a royal commission into the sexual abuse of children in Indigenous communities?

               As others have said in this place, every child has a right to grow up safe and healthy. This has been said by many inside and outside of this place. We don't need another royal commission to tell us that concrete action is needed. The government's focus is on the immediate issue of keeping women and children safe, of ending violence against women and children in one generation, and we have provided, in the 2023-24 budget, some $589 million to support women and children's safety, including $262 million for

                 Labor's policies see about $32 billion in annual Indigenous related funding, underpinning hundreds of organisations, from land councils to specialist organisations. Given the policies of the Albanese Labor government are failing so miserably, will Labor finally agree to support the coalition's call for an audit of all Indigenous policies and programs?

                  or Indigenous community organisations and entities. Of course, all of us want to make sure that money is spent where it is most useful and that we get change on the ground.

                 <p>
                  What I would say is that we already see audits having been put in place, and we will continue to work with communities to ensure—
