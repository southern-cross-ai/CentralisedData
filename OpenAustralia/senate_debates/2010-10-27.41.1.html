           Yes, I am sure Senator Bernardi would carry that information around in his head. I would make a number of points about this, Senator Ludlam. You asked: what is the government proposing to do? The government made clear before the election and now that we believe a carbon price is an important economic reform. It is also demonstrably one of the key ways in which you ensure that the environmental cost, the cost of the effect on the climate, of pollution is factored into economic decision making. This was a key part of the very lengthy debates we had in this chamber on the

                 He gets all hot and bothered, says Senator Carr—that is quite a good interjection. My point is that we have had a number of debates in this chamber where I and other government ministers and senators have put very clearly the government’s view that we do need to price carbon. We need to do so to ensure that the costs of climate change are factored into economic decision making. We are keen to work through the multiparty committee, on which your political party is represented, Senator Ludlam, about the best way to put in place that important economic reform.

                  , I ask a supplementary question. Minister, if you are not aware—and I guess I would expect you would not have it with you—of the precise proposed emissions coming from these new plants by 2016, would you take on notice the question of whether our estimate of around 80 million tonnes by 2016 is correct? Does the government intend to require high greenhouse gas emitting

                   In relation to the first, I am happy to take that on notice and refer that question to Minister Combet. In relation to the second, that is a question that goes to the discretion that the environment minister, who now has a much longer title, holds under the

                   Act. It is not the practice of this government—and I have made this clear in this chamber on previous occasions—to be interfering in that statutory discretion, and I do not intend to commence doing so now. We have said very clearly as a government that we believe that a carbon price is the most efficient way for us to ensure that businesses and the whole of the economy take into account the costs of climate change. We believe it is an important economic reform. We are working through processes to ensure that this can be achieved in a way that reflects common ground in this parliament and, hopefully, in the Australian community.

                    , I ask a further supplementary question, which goes to the question of liability. After establishing a dangerous precedent last year in making federal and state taxpayers liable for future leakage from sequestered emissions from the Gorgon project, will the government commit to now making companies responsible for any future sequestration projects liable for leakage as opposed to Australian taxpayers?

                     As a matter of courtesy to the senator I am rising to respond, but this is now the third portfolio he has traversed in his question, his supplementary and his second supplementary. The issue of sequestration and the legal liability associated with that was in Minister Ferguson’s portfolio—from memory.

The previous question related to Minister Burke, not to Minister Combet. I understand the senator is making a political point, but he is traversing three portfolios with this question and possibly it might be best to ensure—

                       : it is the responsibility of those who ask questions in this place, as we saw with the first question asked here today, to identify the portfolio in which they wish to ask the question and ask it within that portfolio. Then of course the minister will be responsive to the question, either in their individual capacity as a minister or in their capacity as representing another minister in the other House. But it is not a point of order to rise and complain about a general question in question time that the whole of government should answer.

                        : it is very simple. The fact is that the question was clearly principally in the minister’s domain. If there are matters where the information could better be got from another minister, she ought to take it on notice and provide the Senate with that information. It is a very simple process on a matter where it is not complicated to get information to the Senate. Unfortunately, no information at all has been forthcoming to the Senate on the valid questions asked by Senator Ludlam.

                          Order! Peace seems to have broken out, but, in spite of peace breaking out, the matter raised by Senator Ludlam is not a point of order. I can only expect a minister to answer those parts of the question that relate to their portfolio, as I indicated with the first question that was asked in question time today. As I have heard the answer, the minister has been responding to those parts of the portfolio that are under her control, and I believe that the minister has indicated that there are other ministers involved in the questions that have been raised by Senator Ludlam. The minister has 20 seconds remaining to answer the question.
