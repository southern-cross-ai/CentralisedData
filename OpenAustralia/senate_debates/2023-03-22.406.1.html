        Labor has backflipped on its pet permit implementation bungle after being grilled about its dog act by the Nationals in Senate estimates. We recently received some great news about Maximus and Henry, two dogs trapped as a result of this implementation farce by the Labor Party on coming to power.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to read some of the comments from some loving dog owners who are so stoked with the backflip by Labor: 'We want to share the fantastic news with you that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAFF" rel="nofollow">
         DAFF
        </a>
        yesterday issued permits for both our dogs, Maximus and Henry, for the 10 days quarantine. This is the best news we could have hoped for and we wanted to pass on our thanks to you and your team. We also understand from others that DAFF have indicated in correspondence to them that they will honour the 24-month RNATT for applicants prior to 1 March 2023 with 30-day quarantine. This small win will be very welcome news for many families who were applicants prior to 12 January, in particular, who were impacted by this change and just need to get to Australia and who were willing to accept 30 days. For those still stuck in the

        </a>
        who are still unable to do this, it remains an ongoing issue.
       </p>
       <p>
        'DAFF did point out to us: "Please note that the assessment and outcome was specific to your dogs and the information provided and assessed. This outcome is not guaranteed in every instance for every applicant." DAFF has not, to our understanding, publicly indicated that they may be willing to review information to support ID checks from applicants most impacted on a case-by-case basis, and we're reluctant to share the outcome of our own assessment due to perception of favouritism.'
       </p>
       <p>
        This is unacceptable. The Labor Party made a mistake in the implementation of what is good biosecurity practice, and there are hundreds, if not thousands, of dogs, families, expats impacted by this. As we know, 6½ thousand dogs and cats came into Australia in 2022 alone. Many of their owners had put in applications to return their beloved pets to Australia under the pre-existing regime, only to be caught short by the implementation disaster under Labor, which was uncovered in Senate estimates.
       </p>
       <p>
        I really want to say thank you to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Johnson" rel="nofollow">
         Michelle Johnson
        </a>
        , who was willing to speak out on this issue. That allowed us, as the National Party, to prosecute this in Senate estimates. We're stoked that Maximus and Henry are home with Andrew and Shona, and we look forward to that family being reunited at home here in Australia, whilst we're also keeping our biosecurity issues in place, like our strong borders. We want to keep Australia safe and free from disease, but it's important that Australians, whether they're here or overseas, have confidence in our biosecurity system.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under Labor's new rules, pet owners overseas must now take their animals to official government vets for identity checks: Who actually is Maximus? Who actually is Henry and others? This is like classic—what's that show on the ABC?

          yet. We've got potentially thousands of expats in the US and in the UK who want to return home with their pets but are unable to because the actual system the Labor Party set up doesn't exist. They can't have their pets identified in the UK or the US. Hats off to everybody over there.
         </p>
         <p>
          Thankfully, they've given an exemption for Maximus and Henry to come home. I'm calling on the Labor Party not to make that a once-off but to ensure that all cats, dogs, llamas, mice, gerbils, whatever—family pets, one and all—can, within a strong biosecurity system, come home with appropriate systems in place to protect our strong borders on biosecurity, but also to ensure that pets are reunited and stay with the families that love them. Thank you Andrew and Shona. It's been our pleasure.
