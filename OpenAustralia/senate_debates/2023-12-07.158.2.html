          Gerry Hand
         </a>
         represented a new generation of the Left in the Labor Party. He was, in the words of his successor as the member for Melbourne,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindsay_Tanner" rel="nofollow">
          Lindsay Tanner
         </a>
         , 'a unique amalgam of passion and pragmatism'. He played a crucial role in the return of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Left" rel="nofollow">
          Labor Left
         </a>
         from the fringes of influence inside the party and the labour movement to the very centre of decision-making. Ultimately, Gerry Hand's politics prioritised, above all else, improving the lives of the poorest, most disadvantaged in our society. For him, that was the responsibility of government and the Labor Party's core reason for being. A politician of conviction, he advocated passionately for the overwhelmingly working-class and migrant communities he represented in the parliament.
        </p>
        <p>
         Gerry elevated the status of Indigenous issues within both the Labor government and the country's political dialogue. As the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, he introduced the legislation to enable the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_and_Torres_Strait_Islander_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission
         </a>
         ,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATSIC" rel="nofollow">
          ATSIC
         </a>
         . He remained stoic in the face of sometimes-harsh criticism that came from implementing tough immigration policies, and he championed Australian multiculturalism as the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Multicultural Affairs from 1990 to 1993.
        </p>
        <p>
         Gerry Hand was born and raised in Warrnambool, in south-west Victoria, the eldest of seven children. The son of shopkeepers, Gerry worked first in his family's tobacconist shop before taking up full-time work in the Warrnambool woollen mills. It was there, on the shopfloor, that he developed his political consciousness, as so many have done before and so many have done since. He went on to establish the South-West District Trades and Labour Council in 1972. He served as the council's first secretary and drove its growth in size and influence throughout the Whitlam years.
        </p>
        <p>
         In 1979 Gerry Hand sought preselection for the federal seat of Wills, in Melbourne's inner north—a safe Labor seat. Hand was a strong candidate put forward by the party's
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Left" rel="nofollow">
          Socialist Left
         </a>
         faction. Hand sought to move from organising within the labour movement and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
          ALP
         </a>
         , as he had done remarkably successfully throughout the 1970s, to making a broader contribution in Canberra. Unfortunately for Gerry Hand, though, another trade unionist had set his sight on Wills, and Gerry lost preselection in 1979 to none other than
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Hawke" rel="nofollow">
          Bob Hawke
         </a>
         . It was an at-times-bitter contest between the two men, one which encapsulated many of the roiling ideological and personality conflicts of that era of Labor politics.
        </p>
        <p>
         Gerry Hand did not have to wait long to enter the parliament, though. He gained preselection for the seat of Melbourne at the 1983 election—a community he would represent for a decade. He described his inner-city electorate as a rich melting pot of modern Australia, from a substantial Greek population in Richmond, an Italian influence in Carlton and a mixture of nationalities in Brunswick to poverty-stricken communities who occupied high-rise estates in Richmond, Fitzroy, Collingwood,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Melbourne" rel="nofollow">
          North Melbourne
         </a>
         and Kensington, and more affluent groups moving into the area.
        </p>
        <p>
         What was most striking about Gerry Hand in his early parliamentary contributions was his strident progressivism. A self-proclaimed democratic socialist, he was unabashed in his calls for a dramatic redistribution of resources to create a fairer society. He championed the Hawke government's commitment to eliminate poverty and gross inequality, and he saw delivering on this commitment as the responsibility of government—a responsibility that he believed should be met through generous social services, from child care and unemployment benefits to support for the sick, widowed and those with disability.
        </p>
        <p>
         Gerry Hand was elevated to the position of Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in the Hawke government, serving from 1987 to 1990. His vision of Aboriginal affairs prioritised self-determination for our country's
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Peoples" rel="nofollow">
          First Peoples
         </a>
         . He was the minister with carriage of ATSIC, an initiative designed to ensure the place of the Indigenous peoples of this country in the decision-making processes of government. Indeed, it was remarked of Gerry Hand that, in his role as Aboriginal affairs minister, he prioritised listening to, rather than lecturing at, Indigenous communities. This is, of course, the approach the Albanese government has pursued both in advocating for constitutional recognition through a voice to parliament and in determining the path forward, since that referendum did not succeed. As we well know, the vital work of reconciliation continues so, in Gerry Hand's words, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians can 'take their rightful place as full and equal participants in the richness and diversity of this nation'.
        </p>
        <p>
         As the Minister for Immigration from 1990 to 1993, Gerry Hand didn't shy away from difficult decisions. He advanced tough policies on immigration detention while stressing the importance of compassion for refugees and those seeking asylum. As the Minister for Ethnic Affairs and the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Multicultural Affairs, he promoted Australian multiculturalism, bringing his famous enthusiasm for people to his engagement with multicultural communities. Some politicians may have shied away from portfolios as challenging as Aboriginal Affairs, Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. For Gerry Hand, these were the only portfolios he wanted, because, in his words, they were 'people portfolios'. To him, they were areas where politics and politicians could make a real, tangible difference to improve people's lives. In these roles, Hand engaged extensively with and advocated for the most disadvantaged in our community. He lived his commitment to challenge injustice and to fight the national shame of poverty.
        </p>

         A journalist profiling Gerry Hand in 1985 wrote:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Nobody who has spent more than a few minutes with Hand doubts the sincerity of what he is up to—working through the party to improve the lot of the poor and disadvantaged.
        </p>
        <p>
         Sincere, committed and passionate—may Gerry Hand long be remembered this way. On behalf of the government, I would like to again express our condolences following the passing of the Hon. Gerry Hand, and we once more convey our sympathies to Faith, Michelle, Vicky, Leigh and Lorcan; his wider family; and all those beyond who knew him well.

          and to associate the opposition with the remarks made by Senator Watt. Best known as Gerry, he was a product of working-class Australia, a proud member of the Labor left and a politician passionately driven to better people's lives.
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerry_Hand" rel="nofollow">
           Gerry Hand
          </a>
          , born on 30 June 1942, was the eldest of seven children to Les and Sheila Hand. Growing up in the south-west of Victoria in the Warrnambool area, as a young man, Gerry worked in the family tobacconist and as a driver, a milkman, a grass cutter and in a fish-and-chip shop. Then for eight years he was a textile worker and a shop steward with the Warrnambool woollen mill.
         </p>
         <p>
          Gerry was a worker and a worker's man with a go-get-em attitude and, as it turned out, a natural talent for organising. In 1972, he established the South West Trades and Labour Council and later became secretary of the Warrnambool branch of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
           ALP
          </a>
          and a researcher for Senator Cyril Primmer—all of which drove him to pursuing his own path in politics. After moving to Melbourne, Gerry used his experience as a springboard into his first battle for preselection in Wills. As Senator Watt has said, Gerry was somewhat up against it in that preselection battle. He was up against, as the
          <i>
           Australian
          </i>
          put it at the time, 'the most popular political personality in the country'—namely,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Hawke" rel="nofollow">
           Bob Hawke
          </a>
          . It was right faction against left faction, and, actually quite remarkably, Hawke only defeated Hand by a relatively small margin. But it would only be two short years before Gerry Hand was preselected in the neighbouring seat of Melbourne, winning the seat in 1983 and holding it for almost 10 years until his retirement.
         </p>
         <p>
          We know what made Gerry Hand tick, because he was a straight talker. He never shied away from espousing his left-wing political beliefs or asserting his principles. He took pride in being branded a socialist, and he openly acknowledged his very strong views about the redistribution of wealth. In his maiden speech to the House of Representatives, Gerry spoke with compassion about the working-class families and migrants who helped shape Australia, the suburbs, and the need to improve the quality of inner urban life. On show was a man who cared deeply about widowed women, the elderly, the unemployed, the homeless and those from various ethnic or Indigenous backgrounds. Gerry felt a calling to improve services for those Australians who needed the most, whom he saw in his words as having been thrown onto the economic scrap heap. An article in the
          <i>
           Herald
          </i>
          of June 1985 said:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Nobody who has spent more than a few minutes with Hand doubts the sincerity of what he is up to—working through the party to improve the lot of the poor and disadvantaged.
         </p>
         <p>
          In government, the preselection rivalry between Hawke and Hand was set aside and, despite their differences, they grew very close. Gerry served in the Hawke and Keating governments dutifully, especially as the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and as the minister for immigration. He felt passionately about those portfolios and particularly about improving Indigenous lives. Angered by the deaths of Aboriginal people in custody and frustrated by the ineffectiveness of federal programs and funding, Gerry pushed forward with different reforms, including the 1989 establishment by the Hawke government of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_and_Torres_Strait_Islander_Commission" rel="nofollow">
           Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission
          </a>
          .
         </p>
         <p>
          In his hometown and electorate, Gerry saw firsthand the positive impacts of Australia's managed migration program. It was for that reason that Gerry Hand, though very committed to immigration but also was clear in his sense of justice, adopted a hard stance against illegal migration, which he said 'blows to pieces a fair system'. Gerry oversaw new measures to deter, detect and deport illegal migrants, and he implemented Australia's system of mandatory detention, which remains integral to managing migration to this day. It's a sign that, despite all of his beliefs, there was a strong commitment there to systems operating with fairness and to recognising that sometimes governments need to do hard things to ensure those systems operate with that appropriate fairness and effectiveness.
         </p>
         <p>
          It's right to say that for the portfolios that Gerry held he left an indelible mark, as did his commitment to his electorate. His eventual predecessor,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindsay_Tanner" rel="nofollow">
           Lindsay Tanner
          </a>
          , would recall instances of Gerry leaving a significant factional meeting to go and help a local pensioner. It was this desire to help that was biggest in Gerry Hand's approach. In his valedictory address, Gerry said:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          It is a great privilege to come here and to try to help people. You only get one shot at it. I have had my shot. I am very proud to have been here.
         </p>
         <p>
          In those words, Gerry Hand expressed a sentiment felt by virtually all, I'm sure, who serve anywhere in this parliament, regardless of time, regardless of politics. And, with Gerry Hand, it is very clear that he lived up to that ambition, taking his shot and working to help people.
         </p>
         <p>
          On behalf of the opposition, we thank Gerry Hand for his service and contribution to Australia and offer our deep condolences and sincere thanks to Gerry's family, friends and loved ones, and his Labor colleagues.
