         The speech read as follows—
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill proposes a straightforward solution to a growing problem affecting millions of Australians, across the breadth of the country and its many different communities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It does exactly what its title suggests: incentivising companies to donate surplus food to food relief charities by providing them with a tax offset in relation to the expenses they incur.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We know too well that the nation is grappling with a protracted cost-of-living crisis, driven largely by inflation, which has seen a sharp rise in household expenses—from rising rents and mortgages to energy and groceries.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Food is, of course, among the most pressing of these issues for Australian families struggling to manage their financial commitments.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As a result, Australians who have never before experienced food stress are joining what is now a deeply concerning statistic.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The most recent Foodbank Australia Hunger Report found that in the 12 months to July 2023, 3.7 million households in Australia experienced moderate to severe levels of food insecurity.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Many Australians are experiencing this significant challenge for the first time, with Foodbank reporting in 2022 that 59% of those presenting to the charity for food assistance had a job, and nearly a quarter had a mortgage—neither had previously been a characteristic of their clients.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This spike in food insecurity is, unfortunately, taking place amid a culture of widespread food dumping and wastage.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia domestically produces enough food to feed the country three times over, yet it is reported that 7.6 million tonnes of food are being wasted each year.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This both costs the economy an estimated $36.6 million annually and deprives those in need of what is largely edible food.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In fact, about 70% of discarded food is fit for consumption, but is generally being thrown away because it is cheaper than finding other alternatives—including donating it to food relief charities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That is precisely why this Bill, which makes relatively minor amendments to the
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_Tax" rel="nofollow">
          Income Tax

        and
        <i>
         Income Tax (Transitional Provisions) Act 1997
        </i>
        , is being introduced.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The model was initially developed by Foodbank Australia and its partners and was subsequently modelled for its economic impact by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KMPG" rel="nofollow">
         KMPG
        </a>
        , whose recommendations were published in reports from 2020 and 2023.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It has subsequently been built upon in close consultation with Australian charities and other impacted sectors, but still closely resembles the original model with a view to efficiency and simplicity.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To be eligible for a tax benefit, companies must be constitutional corporations engaged in donating or selling food to registered charities, or providing services to charities in relation to food donation, and have a receipt from the charities concerned.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Where payment is received by a company for its food donation activities, only the shortfall between the payment and costs incurred is claimable.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The tax offset covers the costs incurred by the company in its food donation activities in an income year.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The tax offset is capped at the lower of $5 million or a percentage of the food donation costs.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The percentage is based on the company's aggregated turnover.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For those with a turnover of less than $20 million, it is a refundable offset of 45% of costs incurred.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Companies with a turnover of $20 million or more but less than $50 million are eligible for a non-refundable offset of 40% of costs incurred, while those with a turnover of $50 million or more are eligible for a non-refundable offset of 30% of their costs.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill is specific about what can be claimed regarding food donation-related expenses, including food production, storage and transport costs—and what cannot, including business overheads, insurance, visas or work permits, and marketing for the food donation activities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It also contains a suite of integrity measures, among them limiting the claimable amount for goods and services purchased from entities not at arm's length from a company to their market value.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Importantly, this is a temporary measure, capable of being extended if needed based on both economic circumstances and efficacy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It contains a sunset clause at three years, at which time an independent review of the benefit of an extension or not must be ordered by the relevant Minister and tabled in Parliament.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There is a genuine need for an incentive of this type that presents suppliers with a viable option to donate food, rather than disposing of it.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Unsurprisingly, it enjoys wide support across all relevant sectors.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Foodbank Australia has received endorsements from the other major

        , National Retailers Association, Anglicare and Catholic Social Services Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This is a simple, proactive policy, introduced on behalf of Australian households struggling with food insecurity and the food relief charities working to support them through the cost-of-living crisis.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is a Bill for our times and circumstances, representing a practical solution to a crisis presenting very real challenges for many Australians.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I commend the Bill to the Senate.

        I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
