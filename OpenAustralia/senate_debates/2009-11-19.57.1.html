           I ask to what degree this situation can be attributed to climate change. I also ask the minister whether scientists have called for a 25 to 40 per cent reduction in greenhouse emissions by wealthy countries to offset the prospect of dangerous climate change.

            I think there are two quite distinct questions there and I will deal with the first one first. Yes, I am aware of the heatwave in Adelaide. It was something my mother was complaining about when I last spoke to her—how hot and unseasonable it had been. I note Senator Minchin interjected on your question, suggesting that this was not a record and that these temperatures had been observed in 1961. I do not know whether that is true or not. I certainly know it is very hot for November in Adelaide, particularly for this length of time.
           </p>
           <p>
            As you know, Senator Brown, because you do have an interest in this issue, I have previously said the key issue when one looks at climate is to look at trends rather than the weather over a short period and, if you look at the trends, it is very clear that the weight of scientific evidence demonstrates that the earth has warmed and that since 1950 the warming rate has accelerated to nearly double what it was in the first half of last century. We also know that 13 of the last 14 years have been the warmest on record. We know that the climate scientists at our own
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
             CSIRO
            </a>
            and the Bureau of Meteorology have linked the reduction in rainfall in south-eastern Australia with global warming. These are all scientific facts.

The second part of my question was: is the opinion of leading scientists on climate change in Australia and around the world that the wealthy countries like Australia should reduce greenhouse gas emissions by between 25 and 40 per cent of 1990 levels by 2020 to offset the prospect of catastrophic climate change?

               <p>
                The overwhelming scientific opinion is that to avoid what you describe as catastrophic climate change we need all countries in the world to reduce emissions either across their economies or against business as usual. We need a global reduction in emissions in the years to come. That is what the overwhelming scientific opinion says. As you know, that does require both reductions from developed nations and a commitment to action by developing nations to reduce their emissions over time. As I have previously said, in this case it is not possible for developed countries alone to achieve the sorts of reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that the globe requires. It requires both developing and developed countries to work together, and that is why the government is working so hard through the Copenhagen process to achieve a comprehensive global agreement to tackle climate change.

                 n experience as the worst springtime heatwave on record. I again ask the minister: is her response that Australia can contribute to the necessary reduction in greenhouse gases by less than 25 to 40 per cent of 1990 levels by 2020 and contribute, in the way scientists require, to that outcome of avoiding catastrophic climate change?

                 <p>
                  The government’s view is that we need to start reducing our emissions and we do that through passage of legislation which for the first time will set a limit on and reduce Australia’s carbon pollution. I note that the Greens’ view appears to be that if the target is not what we want to be we would rather have Australia’s emissions rise. That appears to be the position of the Greens—if we do not commit to a 40 per cent reduction then the Greens would rather see Australia’s carbon emissions rise than fall with us starting the work that we need to do. I do not believe that is a responsible position to take. I do not believe that is responsible for Australia. I do not believe it is responsible for the climate.
