        My question is to the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator Carr, following reports today about the production of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holden_Commodore" rel="nofollow">
         Holden Commodore
        </a>
        possibly ending in Australia. Why did the government demand in 2008 that Holden open its books and sign a letter of commitment about its Australian investment plans for the next decade when it broke $1.8 billion worth of promises to the car industry less than three years later, in an act that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Jones" rel="nofollow">

        of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMWU" rel="nofollow">
         AMWU
        </a>
        described as 'abject betrayal'? Why are the commitments this government makes to the car industry never kept?

         I thank the senator for the question. I do enjoy the Liberal Party asking me questions about the automotive industry, given that in the debate for the establishment of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATS" rel="nofollow">
          ATS
         </a>
         they actually said it was a waste of money. And they have a current policy position to take a further $500 million out of the ATS. This is a party that has campaigned against the automotive industry for many years. This is a party that masquerades around as having great sympathy for manufacturing workers.
        </p>
        <p>
         We all know in politics that sincerity is a key commodity. As
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Wilde" rel="nofollow">
          Oscar Wilde
         </a>
         said, 'Once you can fake that you've got it made.' And that is exactly what you are about. You are about faking your sincerity and your commitment to the automotive industry. You have absolutely no leg to stand on in this regard.

                   The Green Car Innovation Fund was a tremendous success: $500 million or thereabouts was committed, and it attracted some $2 billion in co-investment. We were obliged to take action as a result of the floods in Queensland. Not in any respect, in any way, have we removed our commitment to the automotive industryâ€”unlike the policy of those opposite, which is to destroy the automotive industry. They have a policy right now to remove $500 million of support from the Automotive Transformation Scheme. This is an opposition that has absolutely no sympathy for Australian manufacturingâ€”

                         We have a series of enterprise negotiations currently underway in the auto industry in Australia. You will from time to time get comments being made. I am not going to comment on the argy-bargy that goes on in terms of that position. What I can say is that the government works very closely with this industry to secure its future. What workers can be absolutely certain of and have absolute confidence in is the commitment of this government to the future of their jobs and to the future of this industry. Unlike those opposite, we actually stand ready to defend this industry and to ensure the prosperity of manufacturing in this country. You have a policy of ending waste in the automotive industry. That was a policy you took to the last election. You have now got a position of withdrawing further support to the automotive industry. So if ever we had a case of crocodile tears we have it here today. Senator Fawcett, it would be a really good idea if you sent back this sort of rubbish to the tactics committee.
