        , Senator Farrell. When asked on 28 July 2022 if the government is intending to remove compulsory income management from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory

        , you told the senate no. The instruments that give effect to the operation of compulsory income management via the BasicsCard are due to sunset this Friday. Can you confirm that the government will not let these instruments sunset this week and will extend the operation of compulsory income management?

           No, we haven't been rolled. No, I don't get rolled. I'm simply making the observation that the statement I provided to the Senate on the last occasion that I was asked this question was the correct answer. I think the difficulty that the opposition is having with this whole cashless debit card issue is that there's a lack of understanding that, although you had this sort of policy that you were all committed to and you believed it was working and successful in the communities that you'd applied to, all of the evidence that has now come out—

            <p>
             On a point of order, I believe the senator on this side of the chamber was asking a very specific question around the extension of instruments that relate to income management in the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
              Northern Territory
             </a>
             . The minister seems to be referring to the cashless debit card, which is not the subject of the actual question. Do you think you could perhaps ask the minister if he could address the issue about the proposed extension of income management via the BasicsCard in the Northern Territory?

                      for her question and her interest in this area. All of the places that you've just outlined are places where we are making changes to the operation of the cashless debit card. I think the first and fundamental point—and, again, I hate to lecture the opposition—is that the Labor Party took this policy to the last election. We went to the people of Australia and we said: 'We don't believe that this system of income management,' that you had established in an ideological fashion, 'is working, and we intend to change it.' And that's what we're doing. So, today and tomorrow, that's exactly what we're going to be doing in this chamber.

                         . In March 2020, your then government committed $49.9 million in additional funding to alcohol and other drug related treatments. So you committed the money, but what happened? How much of that $49.9 million was spent on dealing with alcohol issues in Indigenous communities?
