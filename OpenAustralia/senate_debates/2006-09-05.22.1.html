        Yesterday, Senator Stott Despoja asked me, in my capacity as the Minister representing the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_and_Ageing" rel="nofollow">
         Health and Ageing
        </a>
        , a number of questions relating to pregnancy counselling services. I informed the senator that I would get back to her with further information.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
         Mr President
        </a>
        , I seek leave to have this further information incorporated in
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        , not just for the benefit of Senator Stott Despoja but also for the Senate as a whole.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.

        The answer read as follows—

       <p class="italic">
        In answer to Senator Stott Despoja’s request for me to confirm whether the item number will apply to all pregnant women or only those with an unintended pregnancy or who are unsure about whether or not they want to continue with that pregnancy;

       <p class="italic">
        Question (2)
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Senator Stott Despoja asked me to outline the timeline of the tender process for the government’s pregnancy support telephone hotline and whether the hotline is still due to begin operating by the end of this year. She also asked me to elaborate on my comment regarding the provision of non-directive pregnancy counselling information.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Answer (2)
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Department of Health and Ageing is developing the Request for Tender documentation for the National Pregnancy Support Helpline, under the guidance of a specialist advisory committee comprising relevant experts in the field of telecounselling, counselling, reproductive health and primary care. The Department is working towards an end of 2006 deadline.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Department of Health and Ageing has received advice from the Pregnancy Counselling Expert Advisory Committee that non-directive (or client/patient-centred) counselling is based on the understanding that in many situations, people can resolve their own problems without being provided a solution by the counsellor. The counsellor encourages the person to express their feelings but does not suggest what decision the person should make. By listening and reflecting back what the person reveals to them, the counsellor helps them to explore and understand their feelings. With this understanding, the person is able to make the decision which is best for them. In relation to pregnancy, this includes:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         proceeding with the pregnancy and raising the child;
        </li>
        <li>
         proceeding with the pregnancy and adopting; and
        </li>
        <li>
         terminating the pregnancy.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Counselling, whether it is directive or non-directive, is about supporting decision making—it does not necessarily involve continued support or specific referral to a specific service after a decision has been made. In directive counselling, the counsellor actively participates in the decision making process; non-directive counselling leaves the responsibility for the decision with the client.
