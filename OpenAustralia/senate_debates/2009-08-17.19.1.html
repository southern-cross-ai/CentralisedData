         I thank Senator Farrell for his question. The presidential and provincial council elections will be held, of course, on 20 August, which is this week, and they will be an important step for Afghanistan’s developing democracy. This is the first time that the Afghan authorities have taken responsibility for election security since the fall of the Taliban, and it demonstrates a growing capacity for self-governance. It is important that the elections are credible, secure and inclusive. Afghan authorities and the international community are working together to ensure that in fact is the case.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Australian government is making a substantial contribution to support the elections including an infantry company of approximately 120 troops to assist the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_National_Security_Forces" rel="nofollow">
          Afghan National Security Forces
         </a>
         with election security; additional military airlift capacity to help provide logistic support during the course of the election; as well, $9 million in financial assistance to support the conduct of the elections including funding for election observers from regional countries; and a small team of three Australian civilian observers who will contribute to ensuring the polls are conducted properly.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am concerned that the days ahead are going to see a continuing escalation of violence. Afghanistan is a dangerous environment and, of course, the election makes it more so.

             If no candidate receives a majority in the first round of voting on Thursday, a run-off election will need to be held. If required this is likely to be held in early October. In the event that there is a run-off, our election support force will continue to provide security support.

             are responsible for providing security for the elections with international forces providing back-up support. Australian forces have been mentoring and supporting their Afghan counterparts in providing security for the elections. This includes training Afghan National Security Forces to actually provide security around the polling booths.
