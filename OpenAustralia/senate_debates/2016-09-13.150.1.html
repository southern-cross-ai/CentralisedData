        This evening I rise to acknowledge that last week was National Child Protection Week. It was terrific to see so many community groups, early childhood organisations and education centres work to raise awareness throughout the week and, in particular, to see the significant commitment they have to protecting the nation's children and to the promotion of evidence based programs and policies that work. The wellbeing and interests of children, particularly our most vulnerable children, have always been personally important to me. I have worked to play a role in these issues as a state member of parliament and indeed as a federal member, doing things like reviewing the state of Western Australia's Adoption Act. Now I have an opportunity to make a new contribution as the shadow assistant minister for families and communities, with particular responsibility for child protection, and to make a difference to children who are experiencing or at risk of child abuse and neglect.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have recently had the opportunity to meet with and work with some terrific organisations in the Kimberley and other parts of Australia that are working to prevent child abuse and neglect by supporting families who are experiencing a wide range of family stresses that leave children vulnerable. These can range from economic stress, domestic violence, drug abuse to just plain family misfortune. I want to give a special shout out to some of the organisations who are doing a terrific job supporting these vulnerable families and children. One which I met last week is Helping Minds in Broome. They offer a range of early intervention programs to families in the Broome area to help support them through difficult times and connect them with services. That can be as simple as referrals to financial counselling, domestic violence or health services. It can also be getting families from A to B so they can get to appointments. I also want to give a special shout out to the Broome Youth and Families Hub, the Secretariat of National Aboriginal and Islander Child Care—SNAICC—and Feed the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Children" rel="nofollow">
         Little Children
        </a>
        . These are all organisations that—in their own very diverse ways, whether they are lobbying or directly delivering services—are focusing on the needs of vulnerable children in our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        We need in our country to place more of a priority on children. We need children to be seen and heard in our neighbourhoods, schools, social groups and throughout the community. We need supportive environments where our children are cherished, valued and listened to. So it is really important that as a community and as parents we take time to talk to our children, support their learning and value their unique qualities. Tonight, in recognition of National Child Protection Week, I call on members of this place to turn their attention to the needs of children in their communities. We can add value to lives of children—particularly those at risk—by addressing social exclusion, identifying and addressing risk factors for vulnerable families, and ensuring that we have well targeted, relevant programs for those families in need. I look forward to continuing to work on these important issues.
