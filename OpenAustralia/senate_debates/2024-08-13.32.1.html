        It is with a heavy heart that I reflect on the sudden passing of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Carter" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Her loss has shocked and deeply saddened me and many people in this place who have worked with her. I had the privilege of knowing her through our work, meeting her early in my term, and the joy of joining her on one of her many expeditions to foreign countries. In my case, it was to Fiji.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sarah was a person of extraordinary energy, compassion and drive. She devoted her enormous energy and talent to raising awareness of the challenges facing vulnerable women and children around the world. She was a passionate advocate for community wellbeing, the arts, culture and gender equity. As a three-time former mayor of the

        and with 16 years on the council all up, her contributions were vast and impactful.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite coming from different sides of politics, Sarah and I shared a friendship and the ability to work together towards common goals. We both had a passion for projects in the Pacific, and I fondly remember the trip to Fiji, where I witnessed firsthand how she could bring people together to demonstrate the absolute value of the aid that Australia was delivering. For a decade, Sarah poured her heart into the work at Save the Children, where she raised awareness and drove change for local and international communities. She drove the Australian Regional Leadership Initiative with the same passion and commitment she brought to all her endeavours.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sarah's passing is a terrible loss to the community and to the country. She was committed to making a real difference in this world, and her absence will be deeply felt by all who knew her. Vale, Sarah.
