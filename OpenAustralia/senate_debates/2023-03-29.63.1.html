        Last week a group of brave women in Victoria gathered to protest men using their bathrooms and dominating their sports, and, as sure as night turns to day, the activist media and the leftist political hacks of this nation described it as an 'ugly, evil, harmful gathering', never even seeking to distinguish between the nitwits who showed up in black and the genuine female protesters. This is just emotional manipulation designed once again to shut down debate. If the Left actually cared, they'd consider the reasons for the higher rates of mental health problems, rather than using it as a threat to shut down and silence women.

        Have they ever entertained the possibility that telling children that they can change their gender might be dangerous to their mental health? These people claim to care about safety but care nothing about the harms being caused to women and children, with increasing reports of women in prisons across the world being sexually abused by men who identify as women. Where's the outrage for them? Where's the outrage from the Left over the biological man who rushed the stage at the Let Women Speak event in

        and threw tomato juice at Kelly-Jay Keen? Where's the outrage from the Left over the church shooting in Nashville, where a radical trans activist shot and murdered, amongst others, a three-year-old girl?
       </p>
       <p>
        Pay close attention to the way in which the term 'harm' is weaponised. The activist state and their allies in the censorship industrial complex are gaslighting you. It's time the sycophants of the Left started to consider the impact this is having on women and on people who are trying to raise their kids, with the activist state trying to divide families and sexualise our children.
