        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Farrell. Australia is a proud sporting nation, and I'm sure senators right across the chamber are closely watching the performance of the Australian team at the Birmingham

         I thank Senator Green for that question. I know she's an avid sports fan and will be looking forward to the Olympics in her great state of Queensland in just under 10 years' time. Yes, I can give you some good news there, Senator. Australia is leading the medal board at the Birmingham games.

         There are too many medallists to name them all today, but I'll just go through a few highlights. Emma

         Now, Senator Birmingham—how could you say that! 'Birmingham'—Birmingham Commonwealth Games!

        <p>
         Our oldest team member and national treasure, 63-year-old lawn bowler Cheryl Lindfield, has made a remarkable Commonwealth Games debut at that age, winning the silver medal with her partner, Serena Bonnell.

         We wish the remaining participants all the best for the rest of these games and look forward to greeting them triumphantly when they return to Australia—which, hopefully, will be very soon—to a glorious reception.

           athletes owe their success to previous investment by Australian governments in grassroots sports. Can the minister outline the importance of proper investment in grassroots sports for the success of our Commonwealth Games teams?

            Thanks once again for that very incisive question from Senator Green. Yes, I can tell you a little bit about the matter that you raised. Grassroots sport investment has been a feature of Australian governments at both federal and state level, and certainly was so under Minister Colbeck, who is probably now very proud about our achievements in Birmingham.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sporting clubs promote and train junior athletes, who are the future representatives of our country. Those future sports stars rely on the changing rooms, ovals and lighting that sporting grants programs have provided in those sporting clubs that have put their faith in government to provide unbiased funding through a fair system across the board. I'd like to acknowledge our new sports minister, Anika Wells, who took over from me.

               Thank you, Senator Green, for that question. Look, I'm disappointed to go back in time, but who could forget the sports rorts affair of the former government and the so-called colour-coded spreadsheets, which we still haven't yet got an explanation for? Despite an inquiry that was conducted by Assistant Minister Chisholm, we still haven't got answers to what went on there. And all of the electorates—
