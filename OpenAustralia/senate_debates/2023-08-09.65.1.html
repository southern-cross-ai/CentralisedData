        These Greens amendments, circulated by Senator Steele-John, address the key request of CleftPALS that has been requested for many, many years for speech pathology services to be covered under Medicare.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greens" rel="nofollow">
         The Greens
        </a>
        support this amendment, CleftPALS support this amendment and Speech Pathology Australia support this amendment. I note the government saying they are not going to be supporting this amendment because, basically, there's got to be a process to consider it. There has been so much evidence prepared, there is no reason why we need to further delay having these essential services covered under Medicare. The evidence is very clearly there. To quote CleftPALS: 'Affordable access to speech therapy is pivotal for children with cleft lip and palate conditions. It substantially improves their communication skills, boosts their self-esteem and enhances their overall quality of life.' Regrettably, the current exclusion of speech pathology services from the Cleft Lip and Cleft Palate Scheme creates undue financial hardship for families already grappling with the realities of the condition.
       </p>
       <p>
        Consider the experiences of Janeane Wolfe, whose son, Jack, has undergone multiple operations due to his cleft lip and palate. Wolfe highlighted the struggle saying:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        You're weighing up, do you pay your mortgage, put food on the table and pay your bills. Or do you spend this money on something that you really can't afford?
       </p>
       <p>
        In support of the Greens amendment, CleftPALS wrote, 'The proposed amendment by CleftPALS New South Wales, CleftPALS Victoria and Greens Senator Jordon Steele-John offers a lifeline to families by including speech pathology services in the existing Medicare cleft scheme. It's not uncommon for children affected by cleft lip and palate to undergo over 10 surgeries across 25 years to facilitate their mouth and jaw development. Depending on the severity of the condition, these children may need multiple rounds of intensive speech therapy to communicate effectively.' In a change.org petition, which collected over 14,000 signatures, Jessica Beckman, the parent of Ethan who is affected by cleft lip and palate, shared:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        My son Ethan is affected by cleft and palate. Not having a palate makes speech, language and communication difficult, as this affects his development and behaviour. This affects me because speech pathology services are not free and
