         I thank Senator Sheldon for his question and for his terrific work as
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Envoy" rel="nofollow">
          Special Envoy
         </a>
         for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster_Recovery" rel="nofollow">
          Disaster Recovery
         </a>
         . As you know, Senator Sheldon, since our election 12 months ago the Albanese government has worked hard to ensure that Australia is better prepared for future natural disasters. The years of 'I don't hold a hose' and 'It's not my responsibility' ended on 21 May last year when we had a government elected that was prepared to take responsibility and ensure that Australia is better prepared for what lies ahead.
        </p>
        <p>
         We know that, by investing in projects that prevent the impact of natural disasters, we can keep communities safer. Every dollar spent on resilience and mitigation saves on recovery. In fact, every dollar spent on resilience and mitigation delivers a return on investment to governments and households nine times over. That's why last week I announced the first round of the Albanese government's new Disaster Ready Fund. This is the biggest ever long-term investment from federal, state and territory governments working together in boosting Australia's preparedness for natural disasters.
        </p>
        <p>
         With co-contributions from states, territories and councils that investment will reach up to $2 billion over the next five years in disaster mitigation. Through that we're investing in hard infrastructure, like seawalls, drainage improvements, cyclone shelters, flood levees and runways. We're improving telecommunications and digital connectivity, subsidising home retrofitting and funding research to better understand community risk. A large number of these projects will address issues that communities have wanted fixed for years but were just not dealt with by the former coalition government. For example, the upper
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Hill_Creek" rel="nofollow">
          Brown Hill Creek
         </a>
         in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         has been identified as an area of concern for over a decade, and I know that flood mitigation projects in areas including
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaspe_Shire" rel="nofollow">
          Campaspe Shire
         </a>

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         will also be welcomed by these communities still recovering from last year's devastating floods. While we can't change what they've already experienced, we can help to reduce their risk into the future, and that's exactly what the Disaster Ready Fund is doing

           The Disaster Ready Fund is obviously up and going. We know that building resilience and preparedness in disaster-prone communities is critical to reducing disaster risk. What has been the response to the Albanese government's commitment to build a more resilient Australia?

              I know taking responsibility is a foreign concept for the opposition, but we've finally got a government who will do it. The Australian Local Government Association President, Councillor Linda Scott, said about the Disaster Ready Fund:

             <p class="italic">
              We strongly advocated to the Government for this funding in the lead up to last year's election and were thrilled when it was announced and later enshrined in legislation.

              Programs such as these can help keep insurance affordable and accessible as it reduces risk.

                Under the former Morrison government, the Emergency Response Fund failed to build a single disaster mitigation project in three years, while earning them over $800 million in interest. Minister, how is the Albanese government's Disaster Ready Fund operating differently to the former government's Emergency Response Fund?

                  Thank you, Senator Sheldon. I know Senator McKenzie is particularly touchy about this because, of course, she was the emergency management minister who did not build a single mitigation project using that Emergency Response Fund. Who can forget that fund? It came to light after those terrible floods in Lismore last year. The former government's failed Emergency Response Fund, nearly $5 billion in funding, did not build a single mitigation project in three years. In fact, all it did over that time was earn the former government over $800 million in interest. Rather than keeping Australians save, the coalition put the money in a safe and earned interest on it rather than helping Australians. It was another example of a government that loved an announcement but was terrible in delivery.

                  In contrast to that, the Albanese government, in just our first year, has committed up to $1 billion over five years.

                     I haven't even said 'colour coded spreadsheets', so I don't know why Senator McKenzie is so vocal at the moment! In October last year, we committed up to $1 billion over five years to the Disaster Ready Fund in our first budget. In November, we enshrined the Disaster Ready Fund in legislation.
