        My question is to the minister representing the Minister for Defence, Senator Bob Carr. I refer the minister to this year's budget, which saw a cut to Defence spending in real terms of around 10 per cent, taking government spending on Defence as a proportion of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
         GDP
        </a>
        down to 1.56 per cent, the lowest level since 1938. There is now widespread concern about the impact these cuts will have to fund
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Defence Force
        </a>
        2030, outlined in the 2009 Defence white paper, or even to sustain the existing force. Is the minister aware that the government is in the process of hollowing out Australia's Defence Force and does he understand why the Secretary of the Department of Defence said in a recent speech to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Strategic_Policy_Institute" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Strategic Policy Institute
        </a>
        that the 'maxim about matching dollars to strategy must perpetually ring in our ears'? Can the minister explain to the Senate why this government has been unable to retain the service of Major General

              Well, it was presented here as a revelation. A speech given on 23 August was presented as a revelation. It is the first time it has been raised in the Senate. The fact is that most savings being made in the Defence portfolio are being achieved by deferring Defence acquisitions and adjusting the Defence capital equipment program, but also by delivering further operating efficiencies. There will be no adverse impact on operations—they are all fully funded. There will be no adverse impact on military numbers in the navy, army or air force. There will be no adverse important implications for kit for forces about to be deployed or in deployment. There will be no reductions in conditions or entitlements for servers—

               , I ask a supplementary question. I refer the minister to the fact that during the recent keel-laying ceremony of the air warfare destroyer, the Labor government announced further cuts to Defence spending under the guise of smoothing work for industry. Does the minister recognise that the Gillard government in fact has created gaps in workflow through their recent budget decisions and deferrals? Does he understand that the one-year extension will not even come close to bridging the gap in ship-building work, given the government's procrastination over the last three years in making a decision on the future submarine project?

                On the contrary, projects to be progressed in 2012-13 include the replacement of Caribou transport aircraft; the approval of the Growler airborne electronic attack capability, which only we and the United States will have, that is how advanced it is; the acquisition of medium and heavy trucks; and upgrades to Orion maritime patrol aircraft,

                aircraft and Anzac class ships. A number of projects will be progressed to enhance the availability and capability of the current Collins class submarines. The government have also approved $214 million for further detailed studies and analysis to inform the government's decision on the design of Australia's next submarine. Continuing to approve new projects to enhance ADF's capability will remain an important focus for government over the upcoming financial year.

How does it represent support for industry to retain a skilled workforce?

                  , the first of the destroyers—marking the start of the consolidation phase of the project. Two keel blocks are now joined on the hard stand at the common-user facility in Adelaide. From this point on—
