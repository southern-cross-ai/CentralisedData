        My question is for the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Payne. Three weeks ago you stated you were seized of the matter of urgently processing visas for Afghan civilians who put their lives at risk working for the Australian government, including the Defence Force, Foreign Affairs and AusAID, during Australia's longest war, in Afghanistan. Since the ADF's departure from southern Afghanistan in 2013, at least nine of the local civilians who worked for AusAID's flagship stability and development project in that province have been murdered by the Taliban. Australian civilians were targeted for working on it and Afghan civilians are being murdered for it. Will the government approve visas and conduct emergency evacuation for Afghan contractors and their families whose lives are in terrible danger from Taliban reprisals?

         I thank Senator Lambie for her question. As you are aware, Senator, through you

         , this program has been underway since 2012. A special humanitarian visa program has seen over 1,400 visas offered since the program began. Referring to your more recent questions in relation to the last period of time, we have granted over 186 visas since April this year, so in the last six or seven weeks. It is absolutely a priority for the Australian government to support those locally engaged employees who have supported Australia's mission in Afghanistan, as you have said. Many of them have given an enormous amount, and they have worked under very difficult circumstances. We are working swiftly across agencies—it involves the

           Just yesterday, your department rejected the visa application for a site manager of this project, who is now in hiding and receiving constant threats from the Taliban. They've already made multiple attempts on his life. What kind of danger does he need to be in in order for his life to be considered worth saving?

            Each case is examined and considered in terms of the individual's experience in the role they held with Australian forces and Australian staff. Each locally engaged employee has a number of factors taken into account. There are a number of things that need to be considered in what are difficult circumstances: identity, the accuracy of their claim of employment, the risk to the individual and, for my part as the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the advice that the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" rel="nofollow">

            </a>
            provides to me on the validity of the application. Then, if they are agreed, I am in a position to certify that the application should be considered by

              It is absolutely shameful. Your coalition has had seven years to get this job done. The world is watching how we treat our mates here. What kind of message does it send to the rest of the world that when you work with the Australian government you're taking your life into your own hands?

               I understand that these are issues which are deeply felt, including by you. Over the last number of years, as I set out in my first response, more than 1,400 visas have been issued since the program began. In terms of applications that have been received in the recent period, 186 visas have been granted since April of this year. There are a number of other locally engaged staff and families who have applied for visas. They are in the process of being certified and assessed, and they will be assisted if they qualify under the regulations. This is a very, very important process. We take it very seriously. We deeply appreciate the support provided to us by Afghani locals both in the context that you have raised and in terms of assistance to the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
                Australian Defence Force
               </a>
               . That is why 1,400 visas have been issued since the program began and it is why we are continuing this process as of right now.
