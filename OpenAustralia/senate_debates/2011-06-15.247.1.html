         The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) In December 2010, Housing Ministers' agreed to six core elements of a new regulatory system:
        </p>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <p class="italic">
         The national regulatory system is being developed by officials out of session of the Housing Ministers' Conference. A Blueprint is being negotiated which will include an agreement committing all jurisdictions to the development and implementation of the system.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blueprint" rel="nofollow">
          The Blueprint
         </a>
         will also include governance arrangements, system specifications for the legislation and a national regulatory code.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chair" rel="nofollow">
          The Chair
         </a>
         of the Housing Ministers' Advisory Committee has written to key stakeholders inviting them to participate in a consultative forum to provide expert advice on the development of the national regulatory system.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) All Housing Ministers' have agreed to the development of a national regulatory system through legislation to be enacted in one state and either applied or adopted by other states and territories.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The Blueprint is intended to commit all jurisdictions to the development and implementation of the national regulatory system, governance arrangements, system specifications for the legislation and regulations, and a national regulatory code.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) In May 2010, following the release of the Commonwealth's Discussion Paper, more than 280 people participated in public consultation sessions held in all capital cities as well as Newcastle, Wollongong and Cairns. Workshops were held with Indigenous community Housing Organisations, church groups and the banking and development sectors. In addition, 65 written submissions were received.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         A consultative forum of key stakeholders is being established. It will consist of representatives from the not-for-profit housing, finance and property development sectors, and tenant advocates. This group will discuss the principles and objective of the system and provide expert opinion on system specification issues. Wider consultation will commence during the second half of 2011.
