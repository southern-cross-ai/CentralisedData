        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Indigenous Affairs, Senator Ruston. I note that it has been nearly 30 years since the

          , and I thank Senator Siewert for her question. Unquestionably, as a government we have made it very, very clear that we want to work with the states and territories, who have responsibility for the justice system, to make sure that we deliver better outcomes for
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
           Indigenous Australians
          </a>
          , and, particularly, to deal with the issue of incarceration and improved justice and community safety outcomes. We also want to make sure that we work with Indigenous Australians, the peaks and Indigenous people to make sure that we are delivering the outcomes that they so desperately want. There is no question that Aboriginal and
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
           Torres Strait Islander
          </a>
          peoples are overrepresented in our adult and youth justice systems, both as offenders and as victims. This is seen upstream, particularly in the child protection system. But we also need to remember that Indigenous Australians are less likely to die in custody than non-Indigenous Australians. As the

             I remind senators that when questions contain lengthy preambles, assertions and, particularly, language that can be challenged, the minister is entirely in order and has more discretion in being directly relevant in answering the question. Senator Siewert, that was part of your question following a preamble. Senator Ruston is in order.

                 Thank you, Senator Siewert, for your follow-up question. It is quite clear that all Australians would like to see lower levels of Indigenous people in incarceration. In fact, we would like to make sure that we have a system that encourages people not to encounter the justice system in the first place. That's why it is so important, particularly as it relates to
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
                  Indigenous Australians
                 </a>
                 , that we, as governments—not just the federal government but state and territory governments around Australia—engage with the peak organisations in Indigenous communities to make sure that we can define and clearly articulate targets and then work towards those targets to make sure that we do close the gap. Rates of youth detention, in particular, as we all know, are tremendously high, but we should address not just youth detention but also adult incarceration. It is so important that we address this issue.

                   Australia is left to track deaths in custody? Why doesn't the government have a centralised mechanism in place for keeping track of deaths in custody nationally? Why aren't you doing it?
