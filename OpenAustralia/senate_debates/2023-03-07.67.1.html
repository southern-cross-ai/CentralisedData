          Senator White
         </a>
         for her question about jobs and manufacturing. We on this side understand that one of the major pressures on our economy is disrupted supply chains. As the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">
          Reserve Bank
         </a>
         has said, supply chain issues are responsible for up to two-thirds of inflationary pressures in the economy. To relieve this pressure we need to be a country that can make things here and stand on our own two feet. That is what the National Reconstruction Fund is about. It is a fund that represents one of the biggest ever investments in Australian manufacturing capacity, revitalising Australian manufacturing, creating secure Australian jobs, making things here, investing in new industries like critical industries and seizing opportunities for renewable energy. The National Reconstruction Fund is good for jobs, good for manufacturing and good for the economy.
        </p>
        <p>
         I suppose it makes sense that that is why those opposite would oppose it. Because these are the parties that neglected our supply chains and failed Australian workers, but they are very good at saying no, just like they said no last year to providing families and businesses with relief from energy prices. They're more interested in the same old negative politics.

          You don't like the truth, do you? You don't like it. It's really amazing, isn't it? They vote against stuff in here and they don't like to be politically accountable for the things they vote against. I have never seen an opposition actually vote against price relief. Who would have thought? Always negative, always on the attack, even if Australia loses. They said no to the Housing Australia Future Fund. I know those opposite don't like it, but that is additional housing for women and children, including those escaping domestic violence. You are accountable for that decision. You may say no to making super stronger for the future and no to anything climate—

             I'll take the interjection from the expert on the other side, Senator Scarr, who talks about debt. Isn't that interesting? He doesn't want debt associated with a fund that's about investment, but he's happy with debt that's associated with a tax break for people with $3 million in super. There you go. Thank you for being very clear about your political priorities. He's entitled to those views. I don't think they're the views that most Australians share.
            </p>
            <p>
             But I return to the question. Thanks to a decade of neglect and failed policies from the Liberals and Nationals, we do not have the manufacturing capacity to do what we need to do and we saw that during the COVID pandemic. We couldn't make enough

              PPE
             </a>
             to protect ourselves. Our fund is about building a more resilient, more diversified economy with more jobs in regional Australia so we don't have to rely so much on other countries for some of our critical supplies and to ensure we have the jobs and skills we need for the future.

               <p>
                The biggest obstacle, of course, is those opposite. One wonders why they'd be so opposed to revitalising Australian manufacturing, why they'd be so opposed to securing our economy. Why don't they support Australian manufacturing? Why is it? Why don't they support economic sovereignty? Why don't they support Australian jobs? We see a coalition that simply wants to say no. We have a plan to address the key challenges facing Australians and the Australian economy—relief, repair, restraint, investment in Australian capacity, investment in Australian jobs.
               </p>
               <p>
                Those opposite have no plan. They left us with a trillion dollars in debt, a massive skills shortage and a hollowed out manufacturing sector, and now they're standing in the way of the solutions to the very problems they created.
