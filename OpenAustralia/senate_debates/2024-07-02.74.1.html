        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Housing and Homelessness, Minister Farrell. I refer to the Albanese Labor government's recent budget and its new investment in housing measures. How is the government, through its Homes for Australia Plan, working to address the nation's housing challenges? And how will the focus on boosting housing supply help put downward pressure on house prices and rents and provide relief to households facing cost-of-living pressures?

         I thank Senator O'Neill for her ongoing interest in the issue of housing and homelessness. Our government understands that too many Australians are facing serious cost-of-living challenges, and many are struggling to buy a home or afford the rent. After a decade of inaction by the Liberals and the Nationals, it's clear that Australia doesn't have enough homes, and we haven't for a very long time. That is why the government has a goal of building 1.2 million homes by the end of the decade through our Homes for Australia Plan. That's a plan which experts say will improve affordability and reduce cost-of-living pressures for renters and homebuyers.
        </p>
        <p>
         I'm just about to tell you, Senator Cash. The budget includes $6.2 billion in new investment to build more homes and support Australians, bringing our government's new housing initiative to $32 billion. I will repeat that—$32 billion. And as a part of this, we have committed $1 billion to get homes built sooner. Homes for women and children fleeing family violence—

           and, Senator Cash, for young Australians. We know we need more tradies to build more homes, so we're investing in more fee-free

           places in the construction industry. We're also boosting the supply of social and affordable housing through our Housing Australia Future Fund, the Housing Accord and the Social Housing Accelerator. Together these investments will build more homes for Australians who need them and reduce cost-of-living pressures for renters and homebuyers.

             Thank you, Minister, for giving such a hopeful answer to Australians. It always surprises me how upset they get about that. Thank you for outlining what the Albanese Labor government is doing to improve housing affordability through its Homes for Australia plan and outlining the more than $6 billion in new investment in the recent budget. Can the minister please outline what is standing in the way of further support for the government to get housing prices down and help more Australians purchase an affordable home of their own?

              Again, I thank Senator O'Neill for her interest in this topic and for her first supplementary question. Our government believes that Australians should be able to realise the dream of owning their own home. We have expanded the Home Guarantee Scheme, which, under our government, has already helped more than 110,000 Australians into homeownership. We're now working with states to deliver our Help to Buy shared equity scheme. Sadly, of course, the coalition and the Greens have once again teamed up to delay legislation that will help 400,000 low- and middle-income families stop paying rent and purchase a home of their own. For the coalition and the Greens, it's always about the politics but never, ever, ever about the people.

                 I thank Senator O'Neill for her second supplementary question. We are delivering significant new action to help Australian renters. We've led the way on renters' rights, securing a better deal for renters. We're easing cost-of-living pressures in the budget with the largest increase in rent assistance in decades. We're also offering new incentives to boost the supply of rental housing by encouraging build-to-rent accommodation, and once again, the coalition and the Greens are standing in the way. They stood in the way of more social housing by delaying the Housing Australia Future Fund. Now they're standing in the way of more help for homebuyers, and they know they are standing in the way of more help for renters.
