         As Senator Johnston would be aware, it would be difficult, at this stage, to implement all the security upgrades at all Defence bases, because of the amount of work that would be required to achieve such an outcome. It is true that, following the government’s direction, Defence has conducted a review of security at all its bases and key locations. That followed, of course, the recent arrests of individuals allegedly planning an attack on the Holsworthy Army base. I can say to Senator Johnston and the Senate that the review that was conducted was a very rigorous review. It was conducted in a short time frame—a matter of weeks. It has made a series of recommendations to enhance security and respond to the changing nature of potential threats at bases and key locations.
        </p>
        <p>
         I can also say to the Senate through you,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
          Mr President
         </a>
         , that the government has accepted the findings of the review. It has directed Defence to implement the enhanced security measures consistent with the review, and I can assure Senator Johnston that the enhancements are underway.
