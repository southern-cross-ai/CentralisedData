        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Faulkner. Can the minister provide the Senate with details of the current situation in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
         East Timor

         I thank Senator Crossin for the question. The Australian government, of course, deplores, as do all senators, the shocking incidents in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
          East Timor
         </a>
         on 11 February in which President Ramos-Horta was shot and wounded and Prime Minister Gusmao’s convoy was fired upon.
        </p>
        <p>
         The President is currently in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Darwin_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
          Royal Darwin Hospital
         </a>
         ’s National Critical Care and Trauma Response Centre, where he is being well cared for. The President’s condition remains serious but stable after he underwent further surgery yesterday to remove a final fragment of a bullet. A member of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timorese" rel="nofollow">
          East Timorese
         </a>
         military was also seriously wounded in the gunfire in the vicinity of the President’s residence. The East Timorese government, with assistance from Australian officials, arranged for the soldier to be evacuated by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CareFlight" rel="nofollow">
          CareFlight
         </a>
         to Royal Darwin Hospital yesterday. The soldier has bullet fragments in his skull and injuries to his leg and elbow but is in a stable condition.
        </p>
        <p>
         As the Prime Minister has said, Australia will stand resolutely in support of East Timor at this difficult time. I inform the Senate that investigations into those responsible for the attacks are proceeding. Warrants for the arrest of 13 of Reinado’s men have been issued by the Prosecutor-General. We hope that those identified can be detained as soon as possible in accordance with East Timorese law.

          The Senate

         would be aware that Australia will provide, at the request of the East Timorese government, a substantial and immediate reinforcement of troops and police under the auspices of the

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">

         has deployed an additional 70 officers.
        </p>
        <p>
         The security situation on the ground is currently assessed as stable but could deteriorate without warning. Last night the East Timorese parliament approved a 10-day extension of the state of siege under which all public gatherings and movement between 8 pm and 6 am are prohibited. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
         </a>
         updated the travel advice for East Timor on both 11 and 12 February to note that the President had been shot and to advise Australians to exercise extreme caution at this time, to avoid unnecessary local travel and to note that a state of siege had been declared. The overall level of advice remains the same—that is, it continues to advise Australians to reconsider their need to travel to East Timor because of this fragile security situation and the risk of violent civil unrest.
        </p>
        <p>
         I can report, of course, that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Smith" rel="nofollow">
          Mr Smith
         </a>
         , the foreign minister, visited Darwin on Tuesday, where he was able to convey the government’s support directly to the family members of the President. He also discussed recent developments and Australian assistance with the foreign minister of East Timor, Mr de Costa, and is looking forward to making further close contact with Mr de Costa next week, when he will undertake an official bilateral visit program. Of course, the Prime Minister has announced that he will visit East Timor shortly. I can say in conclusion—and I am sure all senators would agree—that Australia remains ready to provide further assistance to East Timor if needed.
