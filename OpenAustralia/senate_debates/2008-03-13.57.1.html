        My question is to Senator Conroy, the Minister representing the Treasurer. Can the minister outline for the Senate the challenges confronting the domestic economy? Can the minister advise the Senate of what action the government is taking to meet these challenges?

         The Rudd government has set about modernising the economy and increasing its capacity so that we can meet the big challenges, withstand international turbulence and deliver for Australian families. The truth is that the Rudd government inherited an economy shackled by poor productivity and capacity constraints, which have fuelled high inflation. These are facts—not political opinion. They are cold, hard data produced by the ABS and the

          RBA
         </a>
         . Fact 1: when the government was elected, inflation was running at a 16-year high. The RBA is projecting inflation to remain elevated until 2010. Fact 2: when the government was elected, interest rates had risen 10 times. That is right. Interest rates had risen 10 times in a row, and were the second highest amongst major advanced economies. Fact 3: average annual productivity growth over the last five years has been lower than in any equivalent period in at least the last 16 years—lowest in the last 16 years. In the last year of the Howard-Costello government, productivity growth was zero. Zero! Fact 4: since 2004-05, Commonwealth spending has grown, on average, at around four per cent per year in real terms—more rapidly than in any other four-year period in the past decade and a half. Fact 5: at the time of the election, despite the best terms of trade in 50 years, we have generated 5½ years of monthly trade deficits—the longest sequence in Australia’s economic history. When it comes to the opposition’s economic legacy and the challenges that we face, the speech made by the shadow Treasurer shows that he is in a state of denial. In his uncontrollable arrogance, he reckons—

          , I rise on a point of order. The minister is clearly just reading from his computer. I suggest that he simply send an email to Senator Webber, who does not seem to be listening to his answer, so that she can read it.

            is wrong about the Liberal’s failure to invest and the AiG is wrong about poor productivity growth. The shadow Treasurer is so out of touch that his only policy for inflation, productivity and skills is to do nothing. That is no way to run a modern economy. That is a risky and dangerous approach that gave us the highest inflation and the worst productivity in 16 years. This government is putting in place infrastructure, like the high-speed broadband fibre-to-the-node network, to deliver—
