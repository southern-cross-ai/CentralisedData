        My question is to the Minister for Families and

         Social Services
        </a>
        , Senator Ruston. I refer to reports that the Liberal-National government is targeting Townsville flood victims as part of its robo-debt program. When was the quarantining of Townsville flood victims from Centrelink's welfare debt recovery scheme lifted? Why was this decision made? Who made the decision? And, if not the minister, when did the minister first become aware?

         I thank the senator for her question. My understanding is that there has been no debt recovery in the Townsville area, recognising the fact that Townsville is still being impacted on in its recovery from the floods that so devastated the community a number of months ago. So I can confirm that there has been no debt recovery undertaken in the Townsville area.

           Townsville flood victims are displaced from their homes, have had property and records destroyed, are in the process of fighting for compensation from insurance companies, and are suffering the mental stress of unprecedented levels of flooding. Why is the Liberal-National government subjecting those who are still fighting to recover from the unprecedented levels of flooding to its robo-debt program, as reported in these reports?

            Thank you very much, Senator, for your follow up question. I refer you to my answer to the previous question and that is that no debt recovery has occurred in Townsville. But if there are any particular instances the senator is aware of where somebody who has been impacted by these absolutely devastating events in Townsville, where we saw people displaced from their homes and extreme amounts of damage as a result of the floods that happened earlier this year, I would be more than happy to take on any information. Obviously I am not prepared to discuss in this chamber specifics of individual cases, but I would be more than happy to take on any individual issues that you believe have occurred, because, to the best of my knowledge, there has been no debt recovery commenced in Townsville.

              Townsville Mayor Jenny Hill has said:

             <p class="italic">
              I'd urge the federal government to review the recommencement date of the recovery of these debts because there could be a very real human impact on a community that is already hurting.
             </p>
             <p>
              Will the minister listen to Ms Hill's plea and agree to not recommence the quarantined robo-debt recovery action until the people of Townsville are back on their feet?
