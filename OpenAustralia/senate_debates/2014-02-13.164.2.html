        I thank the Senate for the opportunity to take note of the report of the Environment and Communications References Committee,
        <i>
         Recent trends in and preparedness for extreme weather events
        </i>
        . This was an inquiry undertaken in the life of the previous parliament and I was pleased to be the chair of the committee during the time that this report was undertaken. It is very important that we have appropriate procedures and protocols in place in relation to responsiveness and management relating to extreme weather events. Just recently we have seen across Australia—whether they be cyclones in the north or bushfires in the south—the real threat that can be posed by such events. I am pleased that, as a government, we are delivering increased financial support for the employment of more forecasters in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Meteorology" rel="nofollow">
         Bureau of Meteorology
        </a>
        to make sure that we can give the best possible advice and information to communities, to those potentially affected by these extreme events and, in particular, to our emergency services personnel who provide such important assistance and service to those who are affected by them.
       </p>
       <p>
        This final report in many ways touched on how we make sure we provide the right level of coordination of services in many different circumstances of extreme weather events and how communities respond to them. Australia is a country that faces different threats at different times. It is important that we work closely at the national level with each of the states to ensure a clear and coordinated response. We have seen through numerous events over the last few months federal agencies moving quickly to provide the type of assistance the community expects to receive. In providing that assistance, they have been integrated with local emergency services and local social services. I know in Minister Payne's portfolio area that her officers from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Human_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Human Services
        </a>
        , Centrelink and those agencies have provided through some of the bushfire affected regions of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        mobile teams that have gone from location to location to ensure the right assistance is provided in the most timely way possible. So in the issues around extreme weather events it is a case of both how we best prepare for them and how we best respond to them.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is unfortunate that in some circumstances we see the politicisation of some of these events as well. The report in question looked at the science and scientific arguments around increased frequency or otherwise. Of note, I know some have highlighted issues around cyclones. It is interesting to note that there is not a clear scientific consensus around cyclones and the increased or otherwise frequency of extreme weather events at present. In relation to cyclones, there is still significant debate and uncertainty about how they will be impacted by any changes to the climate that could be happening. So I think it is important that we always keep a sense of perspective about the fact that each of these events are things that occur at times, just as they have many times before through our nation's history.
       </p>
       <p>
        But there are arguments as well that suggest we will face potentially increased risk from these extreme events and increased consequences in the future. Some of those consequences can potentially be attributable to changing weather and climate patterns, but some of them, importantly, are attributable to changed population patterns. Those changed population patterns are that our population has grown, we have more people living along coastlines, we have more people living in areas close to bush settings and we have a greater number of people at potential risk from extreme events. More property, more businesses, more public infrastructure and more lives are at stake and at risk as a result of increased growth of population spread across areas that are at risk of floods, bushfires, cyclones or other extreme weather events.
       </p>
       <p>
        That is why it is very important that we ensure insurance arrangements are as appropriate as possible and as accessible as possible to people who are at risk of these extreme events. One of the areas of particular significance this report touched on was in relation to impediments, especially cost impediments, to insurance in Australia. We have a situation where insurance at the state level is taxed through the imposition of stamp duties on insurance premiums, a cost that simply makes insurance that bit more expensive for people to take out. We should be doing everything we can across every level of government to encourage people to self-insure. Whether it is self-insuring in relation to their health care, their property, income loss or any other areas, self-insurance is very important because the government cannot be there to pick up all the losses that will inevitably occur from these types of events. We desperately need to make sure that we have as much participation in the insurance industry as possible. Greater participation spreads the risk and makes the insurance sector far more effective in its financial operations.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee urged state governments to look at ways they could remove those stamp duties on insurance. I repeat that urging of the committee tonight. I urge state and territory governments to look at where their decisions have driven up the cost of insurance and, in driving up that cost, are making insurance that little bit less accessible to people who should be taking it out. I realise that states, just like the Commonwealth, have serious budgetary problems at present and are in no easy position to withdraw or reduce their revenue opportunities. Nonetheless, it is critical that those states have a look at the impact their policies have on insurance premiums and consider any means to bring them down to ensure that we actually do have the most accessible insurance arrangements in Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have particular portfolio responsibilities for the Bureau of Meteorology—a key agency in delivering information to the public at times of crisis, at times of natural disaster and during these types of extreme weather events. I want to use the opportunity this evening to extend my thanks to the officials and personnel in the bureau for the work they have done through a sequence of events during my time in the portfolio to date. It has, sadly, been a very busy time for them during the cyclone season and the bushfire season—from the bushfires in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        late last year through to the bushfires we have seen in Western Australia, the numerous cyclones during the season and the fires more recently across other southern states, such as my home state of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        and Victoria.
       </p>
       <p>
        Often the Bureau of Meteorology will redeploy staff from one state to another. Often their staff will be required to work extended hours. Often their staff will have to put in many, many shifts consecutively to give the type of extra resource and extra assistance required to allow emergency services personnel to do their jobs effectively. The bureau's staff are sometimes unheralded workers in emergency situations. We rightly acknowledge the work emergency services personnel on the ground and we thank those who fight the fires and those who help respond to cyclones. We should also thank those who arm those services with the best information possible to fight those fires and undertake those responses. I record my thanks and I am sure the thanks of all senators to the bureau staff who are called upon at short notice to give the valuable assistance required.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend to the Senate the report into extreme weather events. I am pleased that the government has taken note of it and will be acting on a number of the recommendations, in particular providing support for extra forecasting services that will be so very important in the future.
