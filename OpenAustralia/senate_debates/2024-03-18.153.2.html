        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Farrell. In January this year UNWRA sacked multiple staff members for alleged involvement in the horrific 7 October terrorist attacks, and funding for UNWRA was paused on the basis that alleged involvement by its staff in those attacks must be investigated. I note that these investigations continue and have not yet concluded. Will the government release the advice it received which underpinned its decision to reinstate funding to UNWRA ahead of the conclusion of investigations? Can the minister outline what verifiable undertakings have been secured to guarantee Australia taxpayer dollars are reaching those in genuine need and are in no way accessed by extremists or by terrorists?

          That's the extent of my Filipino, after 40 years of marriage. I'm sorry about that! We want to ensure that all aid that we provide as a government to any organisation in any country gets to the people it's intended to get to. We are strongly of the belief that that is the case with these contributions. As you rightly say, we did suspend the forwarding of aid to
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA" rel="nofollow">
           UNRWA
          </a>
          when issues were raised, particularly about the people who were working in that organisation. Australia has contributed, I think it's a total of $52.5 million in humanitarian assistance in Gaza since the terrible crisis—

            The point of order on relevance. I asked about whether the government would release the advice it relied upon to reinstate funding to

             UNRWA

                             I thank Senator Faruqi for her question. Of course the Labor Party doesn't want to see anybody starving, and that's the case in respect of Gaza. That is why Australia has committed $52.5 million in humanitarian aid, and it is why Australia has resumed its contribution towards

                                 With respect, Senator McKim, there was evidence that resulted in this government making the sensible decision to review. But we have resumed the contribution, so I do find it very difficult to understand the point that you're making, Senator Faruqi, when we have restarted the contribution and, as I said, when that contribution totals $52.5 million in humanitarian aid to Gaza.

                                     Israel is intent on a ground invasion of Rafah. After forcibly displacing Palestinians in Gaza to Rafah, having murdered over 31,000 Palestinians, Israel is now starving children to death and their genocide is leading to mass hunger and famine. Yet the Labor government continues to support Israel's genocide in Gaza. Minister, when will the Labor government stop supporting and arming Israel?
