        I understand that earlier in the adjournment debate it was alleged that I had misled the Senate. I understand Senator Abetz made some claims and selectively quoted from the
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        to sustain his claim that I had misled the Senate. This is the result of a conversation that occurred in question time today, when it was proposed by Senator Macdonald that I had said that the coalition wanted to drown children and you,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
         Mr President
        </a>
        , said to me that if that had been said, it needed to be withdrawn. I said that it was not said and that what I said was that it was coalition policy. When I saw the
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        this afternoon following question time I read it carefully—it is important to ensure that we do not act improperly in these matters—having acted on my firm recollection of what had been said. I found these words:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There was a great risk of drowning as a consequence of their deliberate policy to ensure that unseaworthy boats be pursued—
       </p>
       <p>
        Then there were various disputes and I said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is a remarkable feat that you think that drowning people at sea is a question of respecting human rights.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no question about what I advised you, Mr President—that I used the word 'policy' in reference to the Liberal govern­ment's approach to the pursuit of unseawor­thy boats. It is a policy that Mr Abbott further articulated at the last election—a policy that they were going to turn the boats back by towing them out to sea. That was the position I put in question time today, and clearly the use of the word 'policy' was consistent with the assurance that I gave you, Mr President.
       </p>
       <p>
        Senator Abetz has sneaked in here without any reference whatsoever to me, not pursuing the normal courtesy of advising a senator that you are going to make a vicious, sly and totally underhanded attack during the adjournment debate the way he has. It is somewhat beneath even Senator Abetz's pathetic standard to undertake such behaviour, particularly when the evidence is so clear. For him to play this sort of game in a desperate attempt to direct attention away from the remarks that Senator Macdonald had made concerning Nazi leaders, in refer­ence to Senator Conroy, is truly pathetic.
       </p>
       <p>
        The proposition that I advanced was simply that it was gross hypocrisy for the coalition to discover the question of human rights particularly given their appalling record in government.

        was detained in Baxter—and she was a perm­anent resident. I recall also that this position taken by the conservative govern­ment cost the Commonwealth considerable sums of money because of the compensation that had to be paid.

        was deported to the Philippines—an Australian citizen. We had the children overboard affair. We had a policy which sought to use the
        <i>
         Tampa
        </i>
        in a way that was totally inconsistent with our human rights obligations. For the coalition to make this claim that somehow or another they have moral superiority I think is to stretch the truth beyond all credulity.
       </p>
       <p>
        What I said was that the coalition was crying crocodile tears on human rights, given that their policy was 'to tow boats back to sea , the consequence of which was that they risk ed people drowning at sea ' . That is a direct quote from
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        this afternoon. Further, I had indicated that it had been a policy position of the ir government to tow boats back to sea. I believe that to be absolutely consistent with the assurance I gave you, Mr President, and the assertion that I have misled the Senate is totally wrong.

         , now that you are in the chamber: Senator Carr scooted around all aspects of what he said during question time today. Those parts that he quoted are absolutely correct. What he did not quote to you, Mr President, are these words:

         It is a remarkable feat that you think that drowning people at sea is a question of respecting human rights.

          Senator Abetz, this was referred, as you know, without my presence in the chamber before. The matter has been referred. The
          <i>
           Hansard
          </i>
          will be looked at closely and I certainly intend to come back with a statement.
         </p>
         <p>
          Senator Carr has exercised his right to put his view. I am not making a judgment one way or the other. I will look at the process and, as you asked for the matter to be referred, the matter is now being taken into consideration. I certainly will be dealing with it.
