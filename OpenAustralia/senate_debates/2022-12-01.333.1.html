        My question is to the Minister for Trade and Tourism, Senator
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farrell" rel="nofollow">
         Farrell
        </a>
        . As we come to the end of 2022, the tourism sector is hoping for a Christmas that sees Australians able to travel in a way they haven't been able to in recent years. Can the minister outline the steps the Albanese Labor government has taken, since being elected, to support small and medium-sized tourism businesses recover from the impact of the global pandemic?

         I thank Senator Sterle, who is very interested in the topic of tourism and comes from that great state of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         . Yes, the Albanese Labor government is supporting the tourism and travel sector's recovery in a way that the former Liberal-National government never, ever did. We know the vast majority of tourism businesses are small and medium sized. They collectively make a significant contribution to employment and our economy. To support this sector, we are delivering on our commitments, including through our $48 million investment over four years, and we're directly engaging with industry to address the challenges that they face.
        </p>
        <p>
         In August we held a tourism jobs summit to hear from industry about the challenges they face. We've launched a visitor-economy disability pilot. We're working on a project to better connect workers and employers in the industry. In October I hosted a Tourism Ministers' Meeting in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         , with state and territory counterparts, to collaborate on support for the industry, and I look forward to the next meeting, which will include the tourism minister from the re-elected Andrews Labor government. In October we launched the Come and Say G'day campaign to get international tourists back to Australia. Already, Senator Sterle, it's attracted 122 million views, which translated to a 74 per cent increase in traffic on Australia.com.
        </p>
        <p>
         No, I'm going to come to the Bellarine and Mornington—don't worry, Senator Henderson!—not in this question, though. And last month we launched the Caravan Parks Grant Program to help park operators upgrade their facilities. The Albanese Labor government understands the challenges we have faced in tourism and travel, and we are committed—

            Yes, I can. In August we held a tourism jobs and skills summit to hear directly from industry about labour and skills challenges. You never held one.

            , we announced $3.3 million to establish a visitor economy disability pilot to help people living with disability secure sustainable jobs in the tourism industry. The pilot will address barriers identified by small and medium tourism businesses in recruiting, retraining and progressing staff with disabilities. We are working with the industry on a project to provide a one-stop shop showcasing career pathways, connecting employers with prospective workers and providing workers with information on jobs and upskilling opportunities. We want to see tourism workers return to the sector, after they were forced to find work elsewhere under the previous

              Minister, in your earlier answer, you touched on the Caravan Parks Grant Program to support businesses to improve their caravan parks. Can the minister outline how park operators, whether on the Mornington or Bellarine peninsulas, or in tropical North Queensland or, more importantly, outback WA, will benefit from this program?

               FARRELL (—) (): I can outline that, Senator Sterle. Thank you for your great interest in this topic. The Albanese Labor government is committed to supporting tourism businesses, including caravan park operators, to recover, grow and thrive. I know that Senator Sterle—

              <p>
               and potentially even Senator Henderson will be pleased to hear that applications are currently open not just for caravan parks across the Mornington and Bellarine peninsulas. Applications will be open not just in tropical

The $10 million Caravan Parks Grant Program will provide grants of between $10,000 to $100,000 to help eligible park operators upgrade their park facilities. As we move to the holiday period, I wish all those working in the tourism industry—
