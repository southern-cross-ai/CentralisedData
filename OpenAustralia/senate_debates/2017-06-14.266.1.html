        My question is to the Minister for Defence. Minister, it was drawn to my attention that in February 2015 Imam Saleem of the Religious Advisory Council to the Services signed a joint statement which defended Hizb ut-Tahrir, a radical Islamic group which has called for the overthrow of democracy and the imposition of a global Islamic caliphate under sharia law. How can the minister justify the continuing employment of Imam Saleem with the Australian defence forces, given his support for such un-Australian and anti-democratic principles?

         I thank Senator Bernardi for his question. As we all know, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Defence Force
         </a>
         is committed to providing support to its members and seeking out information on non-Christian faiths, in the very broad, to improve our cultural understanding. Of course, more broadly, any Australian citizen and permanent resident eligible for Australian citizenship can apply to join the ADF. We are also committed to providing support to members of all faith groups, therefore—including the Muslim faith. Diversity and inclusion are fundamental elements of modern Australia and of the ADF. Employing personnel and advisers with different cultural and linguistic backgrounds does increase Defence's capabilities and, therefore, its combat power—quite literally. Through diversity we gain additional skills and varied perspectives which are needed to conduct our effective operations in the modern combat environment. We are literally doing that every day at the moment in Iraq in particular, and in Afghanistan as well.

         Sheikh Saleem, who is a Muslim member of the Religious Advisory Committee to the Services, was appointed on 5 June 2015—an appointment which precedes my commencement in this role. It is not—and I think it is important to make this clear—what has been misconstrued in certain areas as a Defence Imam. That is not a position that exists. The Religious Advisory Committee to the Services serves as the link between the Australian Defence Force and the governing bodies of churches and denominational groups on religious matters. It is comprised of non-uniformed representatives at Bishop or equivalent levels, depending on the faith, and they do not speak on behalf of Defence. While the religious advisory committee plays an important role—

           My question was not about the role but about the person holding the role and the suitability of that person, given their views. I would ask the minister to address that question. Also, given that Sheikh Saleem has previously advocated for a system of Islamic sharia law to operate in parallel with Australian family law, I ask the minister to explain how this view is compatible with Australia's fundamental democratic principle of equality before the law?

            It is fair to say that the religious advisory committee is, as I said, made up of representatives of a number of different faiths with considerable breadth of opinion. I do not agree with the opinions of every member of the religious advisory committee. It plays an important role in advising the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
             Department of Defence
            </a>
            . It does not provide chaplaincy or play any role in Defence policy formulation. Some of the commentary that has been disseminated has considerably misrepresented Sheikh Saleem and the appropriateness of his appointment, it is fair to say. When the decision was made, I am advised that it was a considered decision by the Australian government to expand the size and diversity of the religious advisory committee. Sheikh Saleem is a well respected leader in the Victorian Islamic community who is well known not just to the Commonwealth government but to the Victorian government as well. He is a member of both the

              Sheikh Saleem supports Hizb ut-Tahrir, has defended Hizb ut-Tahrir, supports Islamic sharia law and was previously associated with an organisation that opposed support to forces fighting Islamic state, an enemy of Australia. Will the minister agree that Sheikh Saleem's views and beliefs are wholly incompatible with those of the

               What I was saying, in response to Senator Bernardi's previous question, is that indeed Sheikh Saleem may support views that are expressed by the organisations of which he is a member. He has some of his own. Clearly, I do not necessarily agree with them all, and Defence does not necessarily agree with them all. We, of course, support his right to express those views, but we do not always agree with them. He is not a member of the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">

               If there is any further information that Senator Bernardi wishes to bring to my attention, then I am, of course, very happy to hear it, but it is part of the diversity of the system that ensures that we have a representation broadly across all faiths in Australia that the religious advisory committee fulfils.
