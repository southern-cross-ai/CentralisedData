         I can indicate to the Senate that I did direct the department to remove the website. The website had been inadvertently placed. The food ministers' forum that met last December is working on the process for the front-of-pack labelling. The health star rating is not yet in place. It would have been extremely confusing for consumers had that website been allowed to remain in place. We on this side of the chamber are not going to allow consumers to be in a position whereby they are placed in a very confusing situation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Also, a cost-benefit analysis was agreed to unanimously by the members of the forum last December, which would take place in a more expansive way than had previously been decided, to ensure that we would have the appropriate rigour in terms of the impact on industry, and indeed the full cost-benefit analysis. That process has not yet concluded.
        </p>
        <p>
         Unlike those on the other side of the chamber, the government are going to be rigorous in terms of the policy process and in making sure that our decision-making is formed. We think it appropriate to wait for the results of that cost-benefit analysis before moving to any further steps in the process.

          , I asked the minister to answer one part of the question. She did not answer what role her chief of staff played in the removal of the website. I also ask a supplementary question. Have the minister and her chief of staff read and understood the ministerial and ministerial staff standards, which require that ministers and their staff act with integrity and in a manner unaffected by considerations of private advantage or disadvantage? What action has the minister taken to comply with these standards?

            , I ask a further supplementary question. I refer the minister to Ms Tracey Ann Cain's role as the owner of a lobbying firm that represents Cadbury, Kraft and the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Beverages_Council" rel="nofollow">

            , all of which have a commercial interest in food-labelling policy and which have expressed opposition to healthy star ratings. Can she outline to the Senate her chief of staff's relationship with the lobbying firm and Ms Cain? When did her chief of staff declare this relationship to the minister, her department and the Prime Minister's office?

             It is quite unworthy of those on the other side to pursue this line of questioning. The
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition_in_the_Senate" rel="nofollow">
              Leader of the Opposition in the Senate
             </a>
             knows full well that Ms Tracey Cain is the wife of my chief of staff, which she could have indicated to the chamber rather than ask me the question. There is no connection, whatsoever, between my chief of staff and the company Australian Public Affairs. My chief of staff has no connection with the food industry and is simply doing his job as my chief of staff. This side of the chamber—those in government—will continue to apply rigour to all our processes, including policy decisions and policy making, which those on the other side of the chamber clearly did not do when in government. We will continue to make sure that appropriate decisions are made in the best interests of the nation.
