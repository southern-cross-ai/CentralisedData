        My question is to the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the

         Digital Economy

        , Senator Conroy. Does the government believe that regional Australia deserves access to the same standard of postal services as metropolitan Australia?

        <p>
         The government is committed to all of the existing regulations. So, yes, we do believe that, just like we believe that in telecommunications and broadband everybody should get the same standard at the same price. This is a principle that the Gillard government is very committed to.
        </p>
        <p>
         But my intuition suggests that we may perhaps get a question about the situation in Launceston, which has been canvassed. What those opposite are well aware of is that I have met with and spoken with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Post" rel="nofollow">
          Australia Post
         </a>
         in recent times to clarify what was evolving in Tasmania. My understanding is that the guarantee on all outward bound has been maintained and that there are ongoing discussions to see how Australia Post can continue to maintain its guarantee on the inward bound.
        </p>
        <p>
         I do not want to pre-empt your questions, Senator Colbeck, but we have already met with and discussed with the management and board of Australia Post; we have clarified where there was a fair bit of misinformation. I think it was important to clarify what actually happened in Launceston around Express Post. There is no suggestion whatsoever that the next business day guarantee would not be available for outbound Express Post items from Northern Tasmania to metropolitan centres on the mainland.

          I thank the minister for his answer. His anticipation is pretty close to the mark, but it is not just about Tasmania and northern Tasmania; it is a national issue, he should understand. Does the government take any responsibility for the dislocation suffered by a business that has invested millions in infrastructure based on

          ’s next day service promise nationally—a business that is providing a vital agricultural and analytical service for the agricultural sector all over regional Australia that has had their business model trashed by this decision—or for the hundreds of farm businesses that stand to lose access to this vital analytical service?

           As I said, I have also been speaking with
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Post" rel="nofollow">
            Australia Post
           </a>
           about the inbound from the mainlands, and I will continue discussions with Australia Post about the next business day guaranteed services into Launceston, with a particular focus on the needs of local businesses. As a government business enterprise, Australia Post is required to perform its functions as far as practical in a manner consistent with sound commercial practices. I remind the Senate that Australia Post provides the Express Post network in competition with other couriers, that this market is fully open to competition and that decisions are made based on Australia Post’s ability to guarantee delivery. That goes to the nub of the circumstance in Tasmania. I understand that, even where an area is not covered by the next day guarantee, articles sent by Express Post will travel with priority. The Express Post network will continue to provide faster service than regular parcel post deliveries.

            This business is not in Launceston; it is in Devonport. So it is in a different location to the one that you are talking about. But why is it that operators relying on

            ’s next day delivery service promise, such as one of the largest users of the service in Tasmania, find it so difficult to get a return phone call from Australia Post to explain what is actually going on?

             I understand the frustration. A whole week went by—at least a week—during which it was very hard to get the facts about this set of circumstances. That is why last week I sought a meeting at the first available opportunity with
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Post" rel="nofollow">
              Australia Post
             </a>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             I think it is fair to say that there was a great deal of confusion because of some information—which was inaccurate—being passed to some individuals and then being circulated publicly. So I do understand and share the frustration of the business you are referring to. As I said, we are in ongoing discussions with Australia Post about ensuring that all of that service can be guaranteed. There are practical issues relating to airline delivery schedules involved and it is not something you can fix overnight. There have been changes in schedules which have had knock-on effects. We are working with Australia Post to ensure that the outbound service can also be guaranteed.
