The LNIC has spent approx $790 000 on new Time Domain Multiple Access Satellite equipment and another $2 million on network integration gateways and tropospheric scatter beyond line of sight radio bearers . These will be tested and assessed for suitability to support the ODEN network, in addition to broader network architecture and systems integration trials in support of Army further developing the Land Network Architecture .

These positions will work in direct support of realising Army's networking objectives by delivering additional staff capacity to the Directorate of Network Enabled Warfare at AHQ, the G6 Branch of HQ FORCOMD and the Land Network Integration Centre. All of these positions are active to be posted against from Jan 12.
