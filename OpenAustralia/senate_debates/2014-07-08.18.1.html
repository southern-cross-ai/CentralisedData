         I am delighted to take that question from Senator Williams, a senator who is genuinely concerned for his constituency and can see the benefit to all Australians in this new economic partnership agreement, which will be signed this afternoon by the Prime Minister of Australia and the Prime Minister of Japan. It would be fair to call this agreement historic. Indeed, those opposite might like to reflect on the fact that their former trade minister,

          Craig Emerson

         , has taken to Twitter and described the new agreement as 'the best Australia could have achieved'.

         The former
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">

         assistant secretary of state for East Asia described it as 'a massive victory' and went on to say that 'Europe and the United States have been trying to get this kind of agreement from Japan for 30 years'â€”and here we are, after only nine months in government, with the great assistance of Minister for Trade Andrew Robb, able to deliver this agreement for the Australian economy. We are proud of the fact that we have been able to achieve this agreement, which shows that you can achieve things if a government is willing and determined to roll up its sleeves to get the sorts of achievements that will be of great benefit to all areas of the Australian economy.

           Rolled over again? Even Tim Harcourt, Labor's favourite economist, described this is a huge opportunity. People on your own side, Senator Cameron, are lauding this as a good agreement. Show some grace and do the same!

             This is a great agreement for Australian farmers and for the Australian rural community. We are the first major agricultural producer to conclude a substantial trade agreement with Japan. As with all such deals, you do not get everything you ask for but clearly this is the best agreement we were able to secure with Japan and it is the best agreement that any country has achieved with Japan. The beef industry alone is set to see gains of $300 million to $400 million per year. But it goes a lot further than just the beef industry. It might be of interest to Senator Cameron that tariffs have been eliminated on more than $16 million in nut exportsâ€”macadamias, almonds and walnuts. Tariffs will also go immediately on carrots, potatoes, and indeedâ€”

               Senator Williams asks a very important question as to the process to be now adopted in relation to treaty making in this country as a result of the changes made by the Howard government. The agreement will be tabled in parliament next week. It will be accompanied by a national interest analysis. However, the full text will be available on the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFAT" rel="nofollow">
                DFAT
               </a>
               website after the signing in less than two hours. Tabling will trigger an inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, which includes members from all sides of politics. The joint standing committee then has some 20 days to make a report in relation to this treaty and can conduct public inquiries if it so determines. The government will consider the committee's report before taking action to bring the new agreement into force.
