        My question is to the Minister for Immigration and

        </a>
        , Senator Vanstone. Will the minister advise the Senate about the benefits of skilled workers to the Australian economy? Is the minister aware of any policy alternatives to filling labour shortages in Australia?

         I thank Senator Fierravanti-Wells for the question. There has been some recent publicity—and it has been raised in this chamber—on the issue of 457 visa holders working in restaurants in Canberra. Senator Lundy has shown a particular interest in this and has been quite outspoken on it. In my view, she attempted to score some cheap points on this matter in the Senate on 8 February when she said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         ... the Howard government seems to be encouraging exploitation.
        </p>
        <p>
         It was all our fault, apparently. We investigated the claims—we said we would. Where they were proven, some people or companies are being prosecuted. It is true that there were problems with the salaries of seven Filipino chefs. We sanctioned the employers who were in breach. We found new sponsors for the majority of the Filipino chefs who wanted to keep working, and they are now working in Canberra keeping Canberra businesses up and running.
        </p>
        <p>
         But Senator Lundy and the Labor spin machine and their union mates claim that 457 visa holders are responsible for driving down pay and conditions for Australians. The facts are that the Labor Party wants to deal in fear on these matters and what we want to deal in is the facts. This issue being raised meant that the office of workplace safety wanted to conduct a broader audit of Canberra restaurants. It is a bit like the matters of Rau and Alvarez, where I said, ‘If there is one problem, there might be more; let’s go and have a look and clean it up.’ The office of workplace safety in Canberra said, ‘Let’s go and have a look.’ So they did.
        </p>
        <p>
         They found 48 restaurants in Canberra underpaying or not providing appropriate entitlements to employees. But how many of these 48 restaurants had 457 visa holders on their books? Only six of the 48 restaurants that were underpaying in Canberra had 457 visa holders in them. How many employees did the audit find were being underpaid? There were 164. How many of them were 457 workers? Absolutely none. Why is that? It is because the Filipino 457 visa holders had the courage to raise the issues in a way that others did not. Because it was investigated and because they were not indentured, this audit was undertaken.

            Senator Lundy, who has been a bystander and a parasitic commentator in this matter, said that without the involvement of the union and of federal Labor in parliament, these vulnerable workers—these poor Filipino people who could not do this themselves—would have remained unrepresented, underpaid and exploited. That is not true. The government began investigating this matter because the visa holders raised it with the government—not because the Labor Party raised it; not because the union movement raised it; but because the workers raised it. Seeing a good story, Senator Lundy, in a parasitic fashion, jumped on. She wanted her moment in the sun.

               What has happened is that, because we had some Filipino workers who did have the courage to go and dob in employers who were doing the wrong thing, a further audit has been done. And what have we found? In the restaurant and catering trade—guess what? Australian workers are being underpaid. What did the union movement do about that? Why, when workers in restaurants in Canberra were being underpaid, did Senator Lundy not raise the issue of Australian workers?

                  , I rise on a point of order. Twice Senator Vanstone has referred to Senator Lundy as parasitic. I am not usually very sensitive about these issues and neither is Senator Lundy, but, given that you are concerned about uproar in the chamber, it seems to me that that might explain why there is some uproar. You have twice chosen to ignore that. As I said, I do not generally raise points of order about descriptions, but you might think about how they might impact on behaviour in the chamber.

I noticed that while you were on your feet, trying to call the chamber to order, you had some trouble catching Senator Vanstone’s attention, as she was clearly not addressing the chair. You were on your feet for some five or 10 seconds, waiting until Senator Vanstone actually started to address the chair. My point of order is: could you ask the minister to address the chair.

                                 I will indeed explain. There are alternative policies that seek to focus on foreign workers. The meaning of ‘foreign worker’ is other people, not us. For a multicultural, immigrant country to talk about foreign workers instead of skilled migrants is to use a pejorative. It is in fact racist. This is the old Beirut, Bombay, Beijing attitude coming back—none of the Blackpool, Birmingham and Bristol. Nobody minds if you come from Blackpool or Birmingham or Bristol, but if you come from Bombay, Beijing or Beirut then you are in real trouble.

                                   There is no way that this government will change its non-discriminatory immigration policy and its skilled migration policy, which brings into this country the skills Australia needs. You brought people in to put them on welfare queues. We bring them in to build Australia.
