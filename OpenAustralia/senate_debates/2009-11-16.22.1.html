        My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Evans. Will the minister outline to the Senate precisely what was offered to the suspected asylum seekers on the

         I thank Senator Cash for the question. Firstly, I advise her that the people on the boat are not suspected asylum seekers; they have all sought asylum. They sought asylum when they boarded the

         after the rescue at sea. As the senator would know, we assisted the Indonesians by rescuing the asylum seekers in the Indonesian search and rescue zone, and under international law we transported them to Indonesia. There have been no inducements offered to persons to disembark from the
         <i>
          Oceanic Viking
         </i>
         . As part of the agreement between Indonesian officials and Australian officials, there was a process agreed to determine the means by which we would disembark the passengers once they agreed to disembark. We made it clear that they would not be disembarking in Australia, as was their wish, but that they would be disembarking in Indonesia. The agreement with the Indonesian government provided for their disembarkation, their assessment by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
          UN
         </a>
         HCR as to their refugee status and agreements around the time frames and conditions which would be applied to those persons. Those arrangements were codified in a document that was provided to the people on the boat.

           In fact, Senator Abetz, that document was released publicly days ago. You may not have caught up with it, but it was released days ago. Senator Cash, I am happy to see if I can get you a copy of the document, but the document has been public for some days. That sets out the conditions which would be applied to those who disembarked from the

             I can advise that the time frames for resettlement out of Indonesia depend on individual circumstances and the time in which the

             HCR has made assessment, but it is true that this government, like the previous government, has sought to assist the Indonesian authorities with quicker settlement of persons out of Indonesia. Under the previous Howard government, in the order of 500 persons were resettled out of Indonesia. What we agreed with the Indonesian government in recent times, as part of the negotiations between the Prime Minister and the Indonesian president, was that we would assist them to improve the processing time for those found to be refugees in Indonesia. That work has started, and we have resettled more people this year as a result of that. We continue to try and assist Indonesia with resettlement.

               that appropriate authority is the

                UN
               </a>
               HCR. They will make the assessment as to whether these people are refugees. I will not be making it, you will not be making it and the

                Sri Lanka

               n representative to the United Nations will not be making it. You may well have a bias or a view, but it is not one based on knowledge. Those persons will be processed according to the same rules that applied under the Howard government and that apply internationally, and the arrangements in Indonesia are processed by the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNHCR" rel="nofollow">

               </a>
               . They will make the decision as to whether those persons coming off the ship are refugees or not and in the same way we do, which is why when we found people not to be refugees we returned them, as we did on the weekend, where we returned another six people to Sri Lanka after they were found not to be refugees.
