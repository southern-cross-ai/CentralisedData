           Before proceeding to establish yet another committee, we should be very mindful of the current workload and carefully consider the pressures it places on committee secretariats in particular. As of yesterday, the Senate references committees have had a total of 64 inquiries referred to them, 37 of which are current inquiries. It should also be noted that in the 45th Parliament there have already been eight joint and Senate select committees established, six of which are still ongoing. A practical way to help ensure the future of public interest journalism would be to support the government's media reform package to strengthen Australia's media industry. Australia's media industry does not need more inquiries at this time; it needs action.
