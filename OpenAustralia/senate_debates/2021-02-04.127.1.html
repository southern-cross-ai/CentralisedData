        I would like to ask the minister some questions. I do intend to move my amendments, but I do wish to ask some questions first. I will try and be as quick as I can, but there are some issues that I do want to quickly seek confirmation about. Has the addendum been circulated? I don't seem to be able to find it.

           That would be very helpful if possible, thank you. I'm just checking it's the one that I think it is. Why have falls been left off the definition of a serious incident?

            Falls will be reportable under the Serious Incident Response Scheme where they are caused by unreasonable use of force towards a person, result from neglect by the aged-care provider or result in unexpected death. Where the fall is not reportable aged-care providers will still be required to identify, record, manage and resolve the incident; provide support to ensure the health, safety and wellbeing of the person; and assess the incident and take necessary remedial action to prevent future incidents.
           </p>
           <p>
            The next point I will make goes to the management of the entire aged-care system as a whole. As of 1 July this year, under the national mandatory quality indicator program, residential aged-care services will be required to report all care recipient falls, so when you bring these two things together—

                I'm happy to repeat it. From 1 July this year, under the national mandatory quality indicator program, providers will be required to report all care recipient falls. So we have two things working in concert: we have the quality indicator program and we also have the Serious Incident Response Scheme. They will be required to report all falls, including those which result in major injury, to Health through My Aged Care. So we have two systems working together. All falls will be reported under the quality indicator program, and that will then flow through to the rating system that providers get under the reporting of the quality indicators, which are also publicly reported.

                 I thank the minister for his answer. My concern is that it's then up to a provider to determine what neglect is, if the fall has resulted as a matter of neglect, and some of the other issues that you raised are then subject to a provider making that call. I understand the point you've just made about the quality indicators, but this is an extremely important issue. I still don't understand why all falls are not treated as a serious incident, because the nature of a fall, whether it's caused by someone being a little bit adventurous or by neglect, can lead to premature death and other serious implications.

                 <p>
                  I think I understand the question, but the point we're making is that all falls will be reported as a part of the quality indicator program. The question then becomes how you actually define a serious incident. Our view on that is, as I've explained to you in response to your question a moment ago, in those three circumstances that I've explained, it does require providers to make those assessments because all falls will be reportable under the quality indicator program. So there will have to be a process whereby providers make those assessments to consider those things. Of course, those things are also assessed as a part of the provider's ongoing accreditation process because all of the documentation that's gathered as a part of providing care is assessed as part of the provider's ongoing accreditation process.

                    You're right, Senator; it is different, but there also needs to be some balance in the amount of work that goes into the administration of each of the various schemes, and that's why we've made the decisions that we have. All of the falls will be reported. The provider will be required to do an assessment as a part of that, as I've indicated to you, but that's the assessment that's being done through the scoping study, and particularly through the learnings that we've had by assessing other schemes, including the one that operates through the

                     If someone is receiving respite care at a residential aged-care facility and they experience a serious incident, will providers be required to record and investigate that incident under the scheme?

                      My understanding is that, given they are in the care of the provider, that would fall under the requirements of the providers approved-provider status and therefore would be within the parameters of the Aged Care Act, which then brings in these particular requirements.

                            There are two elements to that, and they come to the two elements which we've discussed before. I think the other point I should make is in reference to where we sit in the overall scheme of things with respect to the royal commission and where we go out of the back of that.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            Clearly, the requirements for reporting—the requirements which I indicated before for falls in both categories under the mandatory quality indicator program and also under the serious response scheme—are going to require providers to assess the fall and the reasons for the fall. Quite frankly, a good quality system has a continuous improvement element as part of it. So that's one of the objectives of the Serious Incident Response Scheme—the assessment of the fall, the reasons for it and then the corrective actions that are put in place to deal with that. That would be my expectation of what would occur.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            With respect to the data: I would agree with you with respect to the amount of data that is available and that exists in the aged-care sector right now. That's something that we clearly need to improve. That will be part of the work that we do post the receipt of the royal commission report in just three weeks time. It is clearly something that we need to do to improve the visibility of this information, not only for consumers and for the community but also for the department and for the quality regulator. This is clearly a direction that we will continue to move in and it is certainly part of our policy discussions at this point in time.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            So the operation of a good quality system will do exactly what you've asked it to do because continuous improvement is one of the elements of a good quality system.

                              I'll have to come back to you on any particular cycle of evaluation of the scheme, but, from my perspective, a regular cycle of doing that actually informs continuous improvement. I understand where you're coming from and I agree with the concept that you're discussing.

                              We are currently doing some additional scoping work on the Serious Incident Response Scheme. A number of colleagues have acknowledged the fact that it doesn't include home care. We're doing the scoping work for home care right now, so that answers the issue that has been raised in relation to home care. But we believe that it was important to get the scheme up, running and operating, particularly in residential care. The bringing forward of the commencement of the scheme was part of our response to the royal commission's COVID report, so we're clearly responding in that sense, but it is something that we will need to continue to monitor, and my view would be that that should form part of our reform process that we'll embark on off the back of the royal commission.

                                 These amendments relate to the comments that I made in my speech in the second reading debate, and that is to include the use of all restraints as reportable incidents, not just those outside the care principles; to deal with falls as reportable incidents under this scheme rather than as the government's current intention is; and also the referral of families and residents to advocacy services. Under the legislation, as I articulated in my second reading contribution, providers are required to provide support to those affected. What we are putting in here is a requirement to ensure that they're referred to advocacy services, because a lot of people want independent support if a serious incident occurs. We're not mandating the services; we're saying they should be referred to some advocacy services. There are some very good services out there.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                 The amendments also include the publication of reportable incident data, which is why I was asking that previous question. At the moment, they're not being provided in the manner that counsel assisting recommended, which was, as I articulated in my second reading contribution, about making sure there was global-, provider- and facility-level reporting of these instances in a timely manner so there's true transparency and accountability and the community and families have a very good understanding about what's going on. We don't see why this data could not be provided in this manner. I heard what the minister said in answer to my question: he agreed. I thank the minister for acknowledging the need for greater transparency and accountability, but we know this is needed in the serious incident report, so I don't see why that could not be done now. We don't need the royal commission to tell us again that this needs to happen. We know it needs to happen. We know it needs to be at that level. So I don't see why the requirements for the provision and reporting of that data cannot be included in this particular piece of legislation.

                                  The government won't be supporting the amendments moved by the Greens, largely for the reasons that we've already stated through the discussion during the earlier parts of the committee stage. We don't believe that all uses of restraint should be reportable incidents. There is considerable work being done with respect to restraint anyway, and I think the Greens would certainly acknowledge that. There's some more information that I'll be able to provide to the Senate very shortly with respect to some work that I had done last year, so that will be available to the parliament shortly.
                                 </p>

                                  I think I've adequately put our position with respect to falls. As I indicated, we're about to embark on a very significant reform process with respect to a number of elements of the aged-care sector, off the back of the royal commission. I would differentiate at this point, not knowing what the royal commission is actually going to report as opposed to what counsel assisting has said. I would acknowledge that that gives us a good direction as to where the commission might go, but, with respect to those elements, the final report is three weeks away. We will then be very intently commencing a significant reform process for the entire sector. Part of that will be the reporting of a range of information and data that could be improved, in providing better public confidence in the aged-care sector.

                                        As I discussed in the second reading debate—I won't talk for too long; I'm just reminding the chamber—this amendment is simply about making staffing ratios, and the qualifications of staff, available to people who may wish to put themselves into an aged-care facility. It may also assist relatives making choices in terms of putting people into facilities. It is a no-cost option, but it is informative to the users of the system. I'm hopeful that the Senate will support it.

                                         The government won't be supporting the amendment. I think it's fair to say that this is a subject where the royal commission will have some very specific recommendations to make. We've seen some preliminary advice through counsel assisting, but also some very good evidence from a number of sources. I don't agree, Senator, that it's a no-cost option. It will incur costs. It will incur costs to providers, and that means it incurs a cost to government as the funder of the aged-care system. This will be one of the issues that will receive significant consideration from the government once we receive the report in three weeks time. So we won't support the amendment at this stage.

                                          , just for clarification, is Senator Patrick moving both these amendments at this time or just one amendment? Is he moving the amendments on sheet 1186 or is he moving amendments on sheets 1186 and 1191?
