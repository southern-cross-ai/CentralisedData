         The Chief

        of Army is available to provide an oral briefing to the Defence sub-committee on the current status of these initiatives.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Hardened and  Networked Army (HNA) program is based on the philosophy of the combined arms approach to combat, whereby infantry, armour, artillery, aviation and engineers work together to support and protect each other while defeating their adversary.  It will optimise the capabilities delivered within the Army under the Defence Capability Plan (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DCP" rel="nofollow">
         DCP
        </a>
        ).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The utility and strength of the combined arms approach continues to be proven in current operations.  A combined arms approach enables the ADF to provide the right level of mobility, protection and firepower to support the functions of a team and sustain and rotate those capabilities appropriately.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        HNA was to have funded the establishment of a mechanised battle group in Adelaide by converting the parachute-enabled Third Battalion, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Australian Regiment
        </a>
        (3
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAR" rel="nofollow">
         RAR
        </a>
        ), based in Holsworthy, to a mechanised infantry battalion and includes the building of a new base facility and personnel costs.  However, the conversion of 3 RAR has been superseded by the introduction of the Enhanced Land Force (ELF) program.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This program was announced in August 2006 and expands the capacity of the ADF, and the Army in particular, to support regional stabilisation operations as well as Australia’s other interests.  It will raise two additional infantry battalions with their essential battle group and joint and Defence enabling capabilities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        ELF is being implemented as one program, although it was funded in two stages: with Stage 1, which funds the first of the new battalions, approved in December 2006 and Stage 2, which funds the second battalion, approved in October 2007.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The first additional battalion will be raised by:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         accelerating the raising of a second mechanised battalion (announced under the HNA), the 7th Battalion, the Royal Australian Regiment (7 RAR), from January 2007 in Darwin, with operational capability as a battalion by 2010 and subsequently relocating the unit to Adelaide not before 2011; and
        </li>
        <li>
         as a result, retaining the 3rd Battalion, the Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR) as a light infantry battalion, instead of restructuring as the second mechanised battalion as previously announced under the HNA. 3 RAR remains in Holsworthy until relocating to Townsville not before 2011.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        It should be noted that, once 7 RAR relocates to Adelaide, it is funded under the HNA program. Facilities for the Adelaide base are also provided under HNA.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The second additional battalion will be raised by re-raising the 8th/9th Battalion, the Royal Australian Regiment (8/9 RAR) in south-east Queensland from October 2007, with operational capability by 2010 and being fully deployable by 2011.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The decision to locate 8/9 RAR in south-east Queensland is based on a number of capability, cost and personnel factors that together make this region the best location for the battalion, even though  8/9 RAR is likely to utilise the Rockhampton area (Shoalwater Bay Training Area) as a major training location.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The additional battalions will be supported by a range of essential combat support, combat service support and joint and Defence enablers, including additional

        While personnel growth is currently strong in ELF capabilities, it currently consists of a significant component of relatively easy to grow trades such as infantry.

In the Army, the training target was increased from July 2007 to meet a five-year ‘surge’ to grow the Army to its combined HNA, ELF and ADF Gap Year Scheme targets. Performance is matching the number of personnel being recruited, with several hundred more personnel trained than in the equivalent period in the previous year.

          House of Parliament
         </a>
         <i>
          if this reporting of compliance does not occur.
         </i>
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government does not support this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Introducing a legislative requirement will provide greater clarity to the Parliament and the community when legislation is tabled as to compliance by the relevant department or agency with the Governments best practice regulation requirements.  However, as is noted in the JCPAA report, the best practice regulation requirements themselves are administrative not legislative.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Currently, under the Government’s best practice regulation requirements, departments and agencies are required to table the Regulation Impact Statement (RIS) or Business Cost Calculator report (a report quantifying compliance costs) prepared for the decision-making stage.  This is generally in the explanatory memorandum when the regulation is tabled.  However, the Office of Best Practice Regulation (OBPR) assessment of the RIS is not made public until the OBPR releases its Best Practice Regulation Report.  This may be up to 18 months after a proposal has been tabled.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Changes currently under consideration by the Government will lead to RISs prepared under the enhanced arrangements being made public before regulations come into effect.  Similar changes are proposed to make the OBPR’s assessment of compliance public when the RIS is made public.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This could have a significant impact on the development of tax proposals.  By publishing RISs when policy decisions are made, the Government will be providing information on its assessment of the likely impacts of regulatory change when elements of the policy have been settled but before details of the implementation arrangements have been determined.  Stakeholders will therefore be better informed earlier in the process than currently.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is more likely, however, to have quite limited impacts – as the JCPAA point out, the Australian tax system is one of the most complex in the world.  Accordingly most (if not all) of the ‘changes’ to tax law introduced in any particular year have very narrow impacts.  Such changes, more often than not, fall under the ‘significance’ thresholds for requiring a RIS or Business Cost Calculator report.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Placing a legal obligation on departments and agencies to report their compliance with the best practice regulation requirements when tabling legislation may work against the self-assessment system introduced as part of the enhanced best practice regulation requirements.  Agencies self-assess the impacts of all regulatory proposals and where they determine that the impact is nil or low, no further analysis is required.
        <sup>
         1
        </sup>
        When faced with a legal obligation, agencies may stop ‘self-assessing’ in favour of obtaining confirmation from the OBPR that only a preliminary assessment is required, with consequent resource implications for the OBPR.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        While proposed changes to bring forward the OBPR’s assessment of RISs to when the RIS is made public will enhance transparency, the Government is not convinced that adding a legislative requirement to report on compliance in explanatory material will necessarily increase transparency.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government does not believe it is necessary to introduce legislation to require a summary of the requirements of the Best Practice Regulation Handbook in all explanatory memorandum accompanying a regulatory proposal.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Best Practice Regulation Handbook provides
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Government
        </a>
        agencies with comprehensive guidance on undertaking regulatory impact analysis and the best practice regulation requirements.  This Handbook and related guidance material is publicly available on the OBPR website and on request.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Noting the low number of instruments for which RISs may be required, the OBPR does not see a need to duplicate this information in all explanatory material.  Further, where an agency self-assessed and no further analysis was required, including such a summary in the explanatory memorandum may potentially be confusing.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As discussed above, the OBPR independently reports on compliance with the best practice regulation requirements and it is likely that this will occur at the same time the RIS or Business Cost Calculator report is made public in the near future.  Therefore, it is unclear what will be gained by requiring the relevant minister to explain why compliance reporting has not occurred.
