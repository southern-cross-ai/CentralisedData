        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. I note that the Albanese Labor government's No. 1 priority is helping Australians with their cost of living in every way we can and addressing inflation. Can the minister please tell the Senate how the government is delivering cost-of-living relief for all Australians?

         I thank Senator Grogan for her question. The senator has spent so much of her working life in so many roles advocating for working people and for disadvantaged Australians. She understands very acutely that people are doing it tough and what this government can and should do to ensure that we ease the cost of living for Australians. Of course, our cost-of-living tax cuts will deliver a better tax cut, a bigger tax cut, for more Australians. That's every single Australian taxpayer, not just some. Eighty-four per cent will be better offâ€”90 per cent of women and 98 per cent of young people.
        </p>
        <p>
         We know, unlike those opposite, aspiration isn't just something that belongs to the top tax bracket. We on this side want Australians to earn more and to keep more of what they earn. This week, the government will make its submission to the Fair Work Commission's annual wage review, and we will recommend that the commission ensures that the real wages of Australia's low-paid workers don't go backwards. The alternative, of course, is those opposite, who want Australians to work longer for less. That wonderful quote machine, Mr Barnaby Joyce, said raising the minimum wage was 'window dressing'. What sort of out-of-touch perspective is someone who reckons that a wage rise for the lowest paid workers in Australia is window dressing and doesn't matter? You have to really be pretty out of touch to think that that is the case.
        </p>
        <p>
         Those opposite have spoken with pride about keeping wages deliberately low, claiming it's a feature of their economic policy.

           Yes, seriously, Senator Ruston, that is what you have said. That is what your leader and finance minister said. I was sitting across the table. Seriously, where are you when it comes to low-paid workers?

                , as is her wont, it might be good for everyone to remember all of the campaigns she's been for which were about making the cost of living worse for Australians. Senator Grogan, we take a different view on this side. I know you take a different view. That's why we are investing in Medicare. We are investing in bulk-billing and in cheaper medicines.
