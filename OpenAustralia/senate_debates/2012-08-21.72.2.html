         I was pleased to see the progress that Solomon Islands has made. With the help of

         —the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands—since 2003 we have seen domestic revenue collected by the Solomon Islands government grow at an annual approximate average of 20 per cent between 2006 and 2011, allowing essential services to continue. There has been improved debt sustainability, measured by debt to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
          GDP
         </a>
         ratio, from 23 per cent to 18 per cent, seeing it well below the accepted benchmark of 30 per cent. Over 2,500 public servants have trained in the last three years in better administration and financial management. The country is stable, the economy is growing, people's lives are getting better—this could be a description of Australia under the present government. I know that is the view the opposition is forming as I rehearse these encouraging figures—and many challenges remain, but the Solomon Islands and its people have more opportunities and brighter prospects for its future.

           countries have contributed personnel and shared its success. Based on the firm foundations of its achievements, RAMSI is now in transition. In consultation with the Solomon Islands and our regional partners, we are planning for the withdrawal of RAMSI's military component in the second half of 2013. Civilian activities will transition to Australia's bilateral aid program and the program of other donors. A robust RAMSI police presence will continue, building the capacity of the Solomon Islands Police Force. Australia's strong commitment to our bilateral partnership with Solomon Islands will continue. As I said at the weekend, we will be there as long as the people of Solomon Islands need us.

             Our development partnership with the Solomon Islands is strong. Over 2012 to 2013, Australia's aid to the Solomon Islands will: firstly, help over 150,000 children stay at school by supporting tuition-free basic education; secondly, will improve access to clean water and sanitation for 15,000 people in rural communities; and, thirdly, will build over 370 kilometres of road to improve access to markets and generate employment. This builds on our success to date. Australia's aid has helped to ensure that 86 per cent of women now deliver their babies with a skilled birth attendant present. It has reduced malaria to 46 cases per 1,000 people in 2011, down from 199 in 2003. More than 140,000 young Solomon Islanders got an education in 2011.
