           Sorry—Senator Macdonald. I am sure he does not mind the affectionate term. The possible proposal that may come forward and may be part of an inquiry that may be supported by the people conducting the inquiry that one day may be considered by the government is something that probably would fall into the hypothetical category on most days. But I am happy to say what I have said all along on a whole range of these issues. We put forward broad terms of reference and will look at a range of issues. We welcome the inquiry and we welcome the input from Senator Macdonald, Senator Brown and anybody else who wants to put in a submission. We will see what the inquiry puts forward. But the government reserves its right to consider that amongst all the other evidence and considerations at the time.
          </p>
          <p>
           We are not prejudging any of these issues. We note the point that Senator Macdonald makes. But we will see what the inquiry brings forward and then we will give it due consideration at the time. That is not ruling anything in or anything out of the hypotheticals that you are asking me to rule in and out.

             Australian Greens

            support the proposal for tax deductible status for not-for-profit journalism enterprises'? Will the minister give an assurance and a commitment that the government will reject any such recommendation from the independent media inquiry?

             I will do my best with this question. Again, the senator is asking me to rule out a hypothetical that may or may not happen. As I said, we are waiting to see the inquiry completed, we are waiting to see the report of the inquiry and we are waiting to consider the report of the inquiry. This is something that has been discussed in the sector for some considerable time. It might be new to Senator Macdonald and exciting for him to suddenly discover that some academics support it and that Senator Brown and the Greens support it. Surely even Senator Bernardi may benefit from this particular tax deduction, with all of his web sites that we learnt about recently. So perhaps even Senator Bernardi may want to put in a submission supporting this particular proposal. He has a myriad of web sites. He can hardly keep track. How many is it, Senator Bernardi? I lost count.

              , I ask a further supplementary question. The minister deliberately misinterpreted the point, so I will ask him this directly: is it appropriate for the Greens political party to advocate a measure to the independent media inquiry that would provide multimillion-dollar tax breaks for a $1.6 million donor to their party? Did Senator Brown disclose this massive conflict of interest in his submission? Will the minister give a commitment that the government will reject any such recommendation?

                   , I rise on a point of order on relevance. You cannot allow the minister to continue to disregard standing orders to have a rant of his own. I particularly asked for his view on the conflict of interest of Senator Brown and the Greens and I require his answer.

                     The only further thing that I will add is that Senator Macdonald is once again asking the government to predetermine the outcome of an inquiry that is underway. As I have said, it is an independent inquiry. It has independent terms of reference. It is working through its processes. We look forward to receiving that report and to the debate that will ensue.
