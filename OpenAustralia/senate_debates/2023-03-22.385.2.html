         With the luxury of a brief additional period of time, I'll put the Greens' position on the record in relation to this amendment. We support participatory democracy. Politics can't work for people without listening to their voices rather than the voices of big donors and corporations. However, the proposal from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Nation" rel="nofollow">
          One Nation
         </a>
         sets the threshold for triggering a big and expensive review of our constitutional framework at just two per cent of voters in the majority of states. That is a big change, and we think it needs more consideration, particularly about what an appropriate threshold will be. We will not be supporting the amendments, but we will continue to call for reforms that increase democratic participation and give politics back to the people. This could include a range of things such as citizen juries, reforming question time, mechanisms to allow the public to petition for a key issue to be debated in parliament, a range of reforms to get big money out of politics and ensuring that the maximum number of people get to vote in elections and referenda, something that our amendments, which, sadly, were not supported by this chamber, sought to achieve.

             I thank Senator Hanson for her contribution. I agree that this is a very interesting proposal. I have not had time to look at it properly. Whilst generally supportive of participatory democracy, should this come to a vote, I will abstain.

              Before I put the motion: because of the nature of the number of motions in relation to the placement of business, we can't, at this point in time, have divisions. I'm in the hands of the leaders here. We can actually record our positions, or we can move further motions to amend that position. We can put the question for that division, but the division will be deferred. I'm in the hands of the chamber. Before I put the question, I'm happy to reflect the will of the chamber.

               It seems there are two options before us to try to conclude tonight. One is that, as you just expressed, the parties can individually express their positions, and that avoids the need for a division to be called. The other is that, if we report out of the committee again, with the leave of the chamber and no disagreement across the chamber, we could move that divisions also be allowed if that is the will of members. But, if somebody called a division on that, that division itself would have to be deferred until tomorrow. Depending on the will of the people to easily get the job done, the simplest path would be for people to express their opinions and for those to be recorded.

                    I think the suggestion from Senator Birmingham is a good one and I feel that the goodwill in the room was to that intent. We should move forward in that vein.

                        To confirm that: do you want to record the votes without calling a division? Obviously, if I wanted to call a division, I have the opportunity to call a division for this if I have the two voices. Is that correct?

                         You could still call a division, but it would have to take place tomorrow. One of the options on the table is that we report progress—I go up to the chair—and then we allow divisions and just proceed.

                              would like to be able to complete this tonight, if we can. I feel like there's goodwill in the room to do it. If we don't need divisions and all parties are willing to put their position on the record, that is fine. We are also relaxed about the idea of having to go back to the Senate if need be. I feel as though we now have consensus around the room—something the Greens are quite good at—to make sure that we can move forward.

                               I'm going to summarise the mood of the room and then you can all pull it apart. I feel that the mood of the room is to stay in committee and proceed. If someone wishes to record their position, they can do so. I'm going to proceed. I now put the question that the amendment on sheet 1874 moved by Senator Hanson be agreed to.

                               I think, Senator Hanson, you would like it recorded that you supported that amendment—and Senator Babet and Senator Roberts.

                                This amendment would remove the restriction on people in prison being able to vote. Denying people in prison the right to vote is like adding punishment beyond their imprisonment. It treats people in prison as if they are not members of the Australian community and as if their views on constitutional reforms that impact the way we live our lives don't matter. Restricting the right of people in prison to vote is a form of disenfranchisement, which heavily affects already marginalised people.

                                people means that disenfranchisement disproportionately affects Aboriginal communities, which are already neglected by political processes. Some 0.6 per cent of Aboriginal people in Australia are disenfranchised by restrictions on voting from prison, compared to 0.075 per cent of non-Aboriginal people. We know that many people removed from the electoral roll while in prison may not re-enrol after their release, which just compounds the disenfranchising impact of the restriction.

                                   will not be supporting this amendment. Senator Waters said that people in incarceration should have the right to vote. I'm sorry, but they shouldn't have the right to vote. They have committed crimes against society and lost their rights, and one of the rights is the right to vote. If you don't commit crimes—and be a citizen—then you will have those rights.

                                      Our amendments do two things. They lower the disclosure threshold to $1,000, the level the Greens have long advocated for all donation disclosures to be set at and the level that it is in fact set at in most states and territories. The amendments also require far more regular disclosure so that people aren't finding out who funded the 'yes' and 'no' campaigns many months after the referendum is done and dusted.

                                      Disclosure isn't a complete solution.

                                      will continue to call for caps on donations in all elections. But regular disclosure of all donations above $1,000 would give people a better insight into who is providing the information that they rely upon when they decide how they will vote.
