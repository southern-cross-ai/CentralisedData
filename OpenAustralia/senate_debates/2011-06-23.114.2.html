        My question is to Senator Evans, the Minister representing the Prime Minister. Can the minister confirm that at the current Prime Minister's first press conference 12 months ago, having stabbed the previous Prime Minister in the back, she promised three things: to establish a community consensus on climate change, to fix the mining tax and to stop the boats? Can the minister also confirm that, 12 months later, there is no community consensus on climate change, the mining tax is not fixed and the boats keep coming? Given that after 12 months the Prime Minister has achieved none of her priorities, can the minister tell the Senate: what is the difference between the incompetent government led by Ms Gillard and Mr Rudd's incompetent government?

         That was a very predictable question from Senator Abetz. No doubt we will have more political rhetoric and more desperate attempts to re-argue the last election campaign as they fail to come to terms with the fact that this government was re-elected. We were able to form a govern­ment with the support of minor parties and Independents in the lower house because we had an agenda for Australia, a program of work to build Australia—its economy, its education system and its environment. We have set about that agenda and we have been very successful in making the parliament work to pass legislation for the betterment of this country.
        </p>
        <p>
         So, while Senator Abetz may not like it, that is the reality. This government is committed to continuing to provide progressive, stable government for this country that allows us to tackle the major challenges that confront us. We are happy to stand on our record of a record increase in the pension for all pensioners in this country. We regard that as a great thing. Pensioners around Australia have a much higher standard of living as a result of that decision.

         Actually, Ms Gillard was the relevant minister, Senator Abetz. It shows how little attention you pay to detail or policy. You pay no attention to policy; just rhetorical flourish and three-word slogans. This government is getting on with governing for all Australians and investing in the future of all Australians. I encourage the opposition to take an interest in policy and the future of Australia rather than just engaging in rhetorical abuse.

          was unable to point to any benefits in the change of leadership. I refer the minister to the litany of Labor lemons, ranging from the 2020 Summit right through to its latest debacle over the handling of live cattle exports. Will the leader now confirm that, after 12 months in the job, the only positive thing the Prime Minister can claim is that there has been a seamless transition from the incompetent Rudd government to the incompetent Gillard government?

           I thank Senator Abetz for his totally inane, low-brow question—because quite frankly, it adds nothing to parliamentary debate and reflects the fact that he has no interest in the issues that Australians are interested in. They are interested in climate change. They are interested in a proper policy debate about it, and that is why we will bring legislation before this parliament to facilitate a proper discussion and give the parliament a chance to vote on the issue of climate change.

           In terms of achievement, I am happy to take you through again the ones in my own portfolio. We have 80,000 more students at universities as a result of this government's policies; we have more students from low

           Ms Gillard did do it actually; again, those were her policy changes. She was the relevant minister. We are driving that home. There are thousands more kids who can now go to university, get a good education and get higher paid, higher skilled jobs. We are very proud of that.

             Again, I think Senator Abetz does himself no favours with the sorts of questions he asks. Ms Gillard is providing strong leadership as Prime Minister of this country. She is talking about and investing in the issues that are of concern to Australians. My colleague Senator Sherry said just before, 'Tell them about job creation.' That is a good suggestion: 700,000 jobs have been created since this government came to office. The best thing you can do for Australians is give them a chance to get work, earn their living, provide for their families and gain self-respect. We have had 700,000 more jobs created. We have low unemployment and through the budget we are creating more job opportunities for disadvantaged people. We are very proud of the record we have and we are very proud of investing in the future of Australia.
