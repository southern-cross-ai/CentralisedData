        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Conroy. Can the minister provide the Senate with an update on Japan following the devastating earthquakes and tsunami?

         I thank Senator Wortley for her question. Firstly, let me put on record the Gillard government’s and the Australian people’s thoughts and best wishes for the people of Japan as they work through and recover from the devastation of the earthquakes and the tsunami.
        </p>
        <p>
         Secondly, can I say that this tragedy has seen a clear demonstration of cross-party support by members of parliament for the work undertaken by Australia’s consular staff and search and rescue support teams in assisting both Australian and Japanese citizens in the affected areas that they have been operating in. Today the Prime Minister announced that the Australian government will make a $10 million donation to support the recovery efforts in the wake of the devastating earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan. The donation will be made to the Red Cross Japan and Pacific Disaster Appeal on the advice of the Japanese government.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our most up-to-date consular statistics confirm that there have been no reports of Australian casualties, that 4,836 Australians in Japan have been confirmed as safe, including 438 who are in tsunami and quake affected areas, and that 10,772 calls have been received in Canberra. While these statistics are pleasing, we still have five Australians unaccounted for at this stage. We must, however, remember in our thoughts the many thousands who have lost family, friends and loved ones.

           The Australian government currently has over 230 officials in Japan working on the Australian response. This includes over 130 Australian-based and locally engaged staff providing consular support, including a team of three in Sendai, and liaising with Japanese authorities. We encourage all Australians in the areas affected to contact

           </a>
           if they require assistance to depart. In addition, the Australian government also initially provided a 72-strong urban search and rescue team, though they have now begun their withdrawal and are all due back within the next couple of days. At the request of the Japanese government, Australia donated the team’s 76-person tented accommodation facility, incorporating shelters, generators, beds, food stocks and water to local authorities while medicines and medical equipment were given to the local hospital.

             Understandably, the devastation in Japan is likely to have a short-term effect on Australia’s exports. It is still too early to predict the full economic consequences. Australian exports could feel the pinch in the coming months. As identified by the Treasurer recently, there is likely to be a short-term impact on some of our exports in coming quarters. Japanese demand for steelmaking inputs could fall in the near term following the closure of several large steelmaking plants and the disruption to Japanese manufacturing. However, demand for our energy products, including
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNG" rel="nofollow">
              LNG
             </a>
             and thermal coal, could increase. We must all remember that given the scale of the devastation in Japan economic conditions will remain unpredictable for some time. The Gillard government have every confidence that Japan, a tremendously resilient country, will rise to this challenge.
