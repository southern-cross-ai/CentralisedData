         I rise to speak today to commemorate the passing of Don Goninon, a long-time member of the Tasmanian Branch of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Labor Party
         </a>
         . He passed away on Anzac Day this year, aged 85. Don joined the Australia Labor Party when he began working, at the age of 14, thanks to the influence of his Uncle Cecil and much to the dismay of his father. Don was a strong trade unionist and a member of the Labor Party for a remarkable 70 years. As a branch member, he tirelessly campaigned for the Labor Party behind the scenes, never seeking any personal glory. Don had a hard childhood; his mother died when he was just nine months old. All photographs and other reminders of his mother were placed under the house, and Don and the other children were never allowed to mention her name. His father remarried when he was two, but it was his older siblings who provided the love and support he needed.
        </p>
        <p>
         Don joined
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Davis_Limited" rel="nofollow">
          Charles Davis Limited
         </a>
         , a Tasmanian hardware business, as an apprentice and spent six years there. However, Don understood the power of education and asked to train as a teacher—which he did by studying at night while still working during the day. As a teacher he spent over 40 years educating students in Hobart, primarily in woodwork, metalwork and technical drawing. Generations of students were taught by Don Goninon, and all were left with a lasting impression. For a large portion of his career he taught in Tasmanian state government schools, before becoming a senior master at the Hobart private school Hutchins.
        </p>

         Don was well known for having a beautiful singing voice, and he had a great love of music and singing. Unfortunately, due to family circumstances he never had the opportunity to take singing lessons and was unable to take up the offer made by a talent scout who recognised his natural ability at a young age. At home or in the car, he would often sing for the enjoyment of his children. He spread that enjoyment widely, often singing at weddings, funerals, birthdays and other special occasions. At the age of 80 he fulfilled a lifelong goal by recording a CD. Fittingly, the music at his memorial was a recording of Don singing—with Don's favourite singer,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Sinatra" rel="nofollow">
          Frank Sinatra
         </a>
         , providing a little help as well.
        </p>
        <p>
         Don was a very giving man and sought to serve his community wherever he could. Despite having a hip operation at the age of 83, he returned to volunteering three days a week with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Mission" rel="nofollow">
          City Mission
         </a>
         until just five weeks before his passing. Don had a lovely sense of humour. Fittingly, one of his favourite lines was: 'No-one gets out of life alive.' Don was a great inspiration to his children. Even after his death he continued his habit of giving to others by donating his body to science and requesting that, in lieu of flowers at the service, donations could be made to the Hobart City Mission. My condolences go to Don's wife, Marguerite; his children, Wayne, Karen, Paul, Catryna and Richard; and his many grandchildren and great-grandchildren. He was particularly proud of the contribution made in this place by his daughter, Senator Bilyk.
        </p>
        <p>
         I now turn to the passing of Noreen Clarke, another life member of the Tasmanian Branch of the Australian Labor Party. Noreen was an outstanding contributor to the Tasmanian Branch of the Australian Labor Party. She held very strong and passionate views about equality and making sure that people who need a helping hand are given a strong voice. Noreen typified what a life member of a political party is all about. In her electorate of Lyons, no matter which candidate was running she was there to give some advice and support. Over the many years I have known Noreen, I found her to be a charitable, giving and caring person. She was a credit to her family; she raised five children. One of Noreen's grandchildren,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Clarke" rel="nofollow">
          Adam Clarke
         </a>
         , is sometimes a bit of a pain in the butt to me. Nevertheless, he is very politically motivated, and I am sure Noreen was very proud of the contribution he makes to the Tasmanian branch.
        </p>
        <p>
         Noreen used to work on polling booths. In those days it was from 8 am to 8 pm, and at many elections she was the only person working on the booth. With her generosity, her inspiration and her openness to support any candidate who came forth and wanted her support, she was always there. She is going to be sadly missed by the West Tamar Branch and its members and indeed by all who knew her and loved her for the contribution she made to the great Australian Labor Party.
