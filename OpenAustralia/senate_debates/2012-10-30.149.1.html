          The Defence
         </a>
         portfolio receives a large number of Questions on Notice from both Houses of Parliament and Committees, including pursuant to Committee hearings. Many of these questions relate to complex, highly technical national security issues which require significant effort to address.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         It is important that responses to these questions provide correct information. Accordingly, it is important to take the necessary time to ensure the answers are correct.

        <p class="italic">
         In relation to Questions from Committees or arising from Committee hearings, Defence took on notice 49 questions on the day and 222 questions in writing from Senators following the 2012 Budget Estimates hearings in May, for a total of 271 questions. In total, these 271 questions compromised 569 sub questions.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p class="italic">
