        May I just point out to the chamber that there is now an amendment to an amendment that has been circulated in my name that I will be moving on behalf of the opposition: the amendment on sheet 2115, of which the government is aware. I just want to make sure that it has been circulated around the chamber. It's simply a technical amendment to an amendment. But in the meantime I do have some questions for the minister that I would like to get on the record. The first one of those is really about the appointment of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">

        of the new PWSS and exactly what the process will be around the appointment of that CEO.

         Thank you, Senator Hume. I appreciate the sum of the discussions that we've had in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLT" rel="nofollow">
          PLT
         </a>
         on this. We would hope and envisage that it would be a consultative process around the appointment. There has been some early testing of interest or gearing up, but the formal recruitment process hasn't started. We're happy to work across the PLT with any views that you may have over that. It will be an important position that an individual will be recruited to, and it's important that that individual has the support of the parliament.

          Thank you, Minister, for that. I agree that the concept of consultation in the appointment of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
           CEO
          </a>
          , particularly the first CEO, is just so fundamentally important to the success of this body. So, for the benefit of the committee, perhaps you could describe to us how that consultation on the appointment will be conducted. Will be done in writing, for instance? Will you write to those that you're consulting with? What will the timing of that consultation process be?

           I'm happy to take views, particularly those of the

            PLT
           </a>
           , on that. I'm happy to consult in writing if that's the preference. I would expect that people may have some views on the selection criteria for the position to help shape those. I'm very happy to work with you and others on that. We all have a vested interest in making sure this is a successful appointment, not least for the person that will be ultimately successful in that appointment. In terms of timing, the reason we're trying to have passage of these bills today is so that it can be operational in October, which doesn't leave a huge amount of time. So I would expect we need to really move on this in the next few days.

            Again, thank you, Minister, for that full response. I want to understand: if the consultation does occur and occurs in writing, will you wait for a response to that consultation before making the appointment?

             Yes, I would expect so. Again, if there's a particular interest, I'm very happy to work with everyone on how the recruitment process works in practice for this position. It's just that timing issue. I would expect that, even when there were the final candidates, there would be some discussion and a consultative way of working through that in a confidential and professional way.

              ask you just a little bit more? Without breaking any confidences, of course, is this an appointment that will be considered by cabinet? If so, will that consultation with cabinet or discussion with cabinet occur before or after the consultation with other interested members around the workplace?

               I haven't got confirmation of this, so I stand to be corrected, but I imagine this appointment would be taken to cabinet. I would hope that if Senator Farrell or I take that appointment, it is done with the ability for us to recommend to the cabinet that this is a position that has been consulted and supported.

                           determines a mandatory policy or procedure, the CEO must consult with the PWSS Consultative Committee and must have referred the mandatory policy to the PWSS Advisory Board. The PWSS Advisory Board must have been taken to have approved the mandatory policy or procedure or the advisory board must have notified the CEO that it has approved the proposed mandatory policy or procedure. The PWSS must also publish a policy or procedure determined under this section on its website. That gives the board the ability to tick it off and then return it to the CEO.

                            ask the minister how she envisages the consultation on those mandatory policies and procedures will occur before they're made mandatory? I understand that the advisory board will be part of that process, but how do you actually see that back-and-forth happening in real life? In particular, how will the opportunity be given to staff to consult on proposed mandatory policies and procedures? Will it be given at all? If so, will that go via the board?

                             It does need to go to the PWSS consultative committee. That is the forum for consultation. In terms of the advisory board and its considerations with the

                             , I imagine that would be between the advisory board and the CEO, but the consultative forum would be the appropriate place for the consultations to the board. Before the CEO determines a mandatory policy or procedure, it must consult the PWSS consultative committee about that policy or procedure, and I would imagine the PWSS advisory board would have to consider that as part of its consideration.

Under the explanatory memorandum, which deals with this, the minister may make rules prescribing codes of conduct, details of a matter that must or must not be included in a public report, under clause 22, remuneration and allowances to be paid to the

                                         These are some amendments we have negotiated with the opposition to ensure that the administering minister is the Special Minister of State and that, when it comes to tabling public reports, those are done by the presiding officers, which is in line with entities like the

                                          The opposition will be supporting these amendments. They've been made to give certainty and clarity to the legislation for staff and for parliamentarians. The first part ensures that the legislation will be managed by the minister who's traditionally the minister responsible for matters relating to our workplaces, expenses and resourcing, and that's the
                                          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Minister_of_State" rel="nofollow">

                                          . This is appropriate in that it will ensure that the matters that relate to us as a workplace are managed together in a holistic way.

                                          The second is a small but important amendment. In the original drafting of the bill, the PWSS would have been required to provide reports through the minister before they were tabled in parliament. This amendment will mean that the bill will be provided directly to the chambers in such a way that no member of the ministry determines the timing of publication and that there's no perception of politicisations of these reports, particularly those reports that relate to noncompliance with the PWSS mandatory policies and education. In respect of the Parliamentary Workplace Support Service Bill 2023, I move opposition amendment (1) on sheet 2115:

                                          This amendment corrects an error in the drafting following the government amendment. It will change a now outdated reference to section 23 to reflect the changes made in the amendments in

This gives more than enough time. The IPSC will be up and running, and it will be the body that does the investigations following its establishment.

                                             The opposition will also be supporting this amendment. It's an important marker for all of us, including our staff and our workplaces. It places a time limit on the functions of the PWSS in relation to reviews, which is a function that will ultimately rest with the new independent parliamentary standards commission. The sunsetting clause means that this parliament will need to act before this function ceases. It will keep us honest to our commitments. The government has placed a time limit of two years on getting this other body established. Even though the opposition has asked for 12 months—that's when we asked for it to be created—we'll support this amendment because it will at least create that time limit.
