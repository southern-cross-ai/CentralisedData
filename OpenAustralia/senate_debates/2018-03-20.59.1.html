         I thank Senator Molan for his question.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN" rel="nofollow">
          ASEAN
         </a>
         came into being with a vision of peaceful development in the region, and Australia's hosting of the ASEAN-Australia Special Summit demonstrates our commitment to that long-held vision. It was the first meeting of its kind in Australia and an historic point in our engagement with ASEAN. There is no regional grouping of countries more important to Australia's security and prosperity. ASEAN as a group is our third largest trading partner, with two-way trade worth over $100 billion in the last financial year. As we noted during the special summit, we have the potential to do more, especially in investment.
        </p>
        <p>
         The summit itself brought together business and government to create better conditions for stronger growth, to our mutual benefit, including through an initiative for ASEAN and Australia to develop and increase the use of digital trade standards to promote digital trade and inclusive growth; a smart cities initiative providing education, technical assistance and support for innovation to help ASEAN develop cities in smart and sustainable ways; and programs to help address the region's infrastructure needs more broadly. We are also working with ASEAN countries to keep our region safe. The foreign minister signed a counterterrorism memorandum of understanding with the Secretary-General of ASEAN, and the summit focused significantly on the region's evolving strategic environment. During the deliberations we conveyed Australia's support for the speedy conclusion of a China-ASEAN code of conduct for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China_Sea" rel="nofollow">
          South China Sea
         </a>
         that is binding and consistent with the norms, practices and laws. The summit particularly demonstrates the Turnbull government's commitment to working with our ASEAN partners to promote economic growth and to strengthen the international rules based order.

            We have a long and proud history of defence cooperation with
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN" rel="nofollow">
             ASEAN
            </a>
            member nations and we're very committed to strengthening our defence engagement with our regional partners to both build capacity and improve interoperability. We are also very committed to building people-to-people links within our region. As a result of the special summit, we're establishing a new ASEAN-Australia Defence Postgraduate Scholarship program, through my department, which will see one person from each ASEAN nation awarded a scholarship to study here as part of a cohort. Commencing in early 2019, the program is designed to foster cooperation and equip ASEAN practitioners further in the field of regional defence engagement through a two-year Master of Strategic Studies postgraduate degree in Australia. This exemplifies the new era in our defence partnership with ASEAN and strengthens our substantial and practical contribution to regional security and prosperity, a number of aspects I saw in action last year in my visit to a number of ASEAN nations.

                ASEAN

               nations, and we are very committed to continuing to strengthen those economic and security ties in particular. On Friday of last week the foreign minister and I hosted the Australia-Indonesia 2+2 defence and foreign affairs ministerial meeting on the eve of the special summit itself, with Minister Marsudi and Minister Ryacudu. Both Australia and Indonesia are strongly committed to a region of peaceful development in line with ASEAN's vision. We had productive discussions on cybersecurity, on counterterrorism and on maritime security in particular. We also signed a Maritime Cooperation Plan of Action, which will drive increased cooperation across a number of areas, including economic development, maritime security and combating illegal fishing, to name just a few. So, whether it's bilaterally or through multinational forums such as ASEAN, we are absolutely committed to our efforts to promote economic growth and stability and security across our region.
