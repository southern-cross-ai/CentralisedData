        Every student has the right to study in a safe, respectful environment without fear of being sexually harassed or assaulted. Every student deserves safety, yet far too many uni students come to experience sexual violence, especially women, non-binary people, people with disability and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations

        people, with hundreds of students reporting harrowing experiences of sexual assault and harassment every week.
       </p>
       <p>
        These are not just numbers but people. Their traumatic experiences of sexual violence can totally upend and ruin their lives. No-one should ever have to experience this. I stand in solidarity with the tireless campaigners, such as End Rape on Campus, Fair Agenda and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Union" rel="nofollow">
         National Union
        </a>
        of Students, who have bravely shone a light on sexual violence on campus and who are holding universities to account and calling for action.
       </p>
       <p>
        Governments and universities have failed to act, despite knowing for years about the shocking prevalence and damaging effects of sexual violence on campuses. It is disgraceful that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universities_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Universities Australia
        </a>
        shelved a $1.5 million sex education program because of the outdated, prudish views of a minority of vice-chancellors who thought it was too explicit. Why is Universities Australia avoiding this issue while students continue to be unsafe? Rather than take meaningful action, Universities Australia could only serve up an expensive report which largely rehashes existing materials. We need more than reports; we need action that actually makes students safe.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's clear that universities cannot be left to regulate themselves to address sexual assault on campuses. We need an independent authority with powers to monitor and evaluate universities on their work to end sexual violence on campuses and we must impose serious consequences when universities fail to provide a safe learning environment for students.
