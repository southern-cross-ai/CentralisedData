        , Senator Evans, I move:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent me moving a motion to provide for the consideration of the matter, namely a motion to give precedent to a motion to vary the hours of meeting and routine of business today.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government has signalled its intention for the
        <a href="http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:legislation/billhome/R4496" rel="nofollow">
         Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (National Broadband Network Measures—Access Arrangements) Bill 2010
        </a>
        to be completed this week. We finalised the program and circulated that in the chamber, and that indicated that it was essential to have this bill dealt with in this week. Having now had a number of hours for the second reading debate and the committee stage, it is time to ensure that we complete the bill before we rise this evening or—if people require additional hours—by the end of the week. It is necessary to ensure that we put additional hours in the program to allow that to occur.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition, there are significant amendments that need to be progressed. We are currently in the committee stage in relation to that bill. In dealing with the committee stage, if any amendments are passed here it will be necessary for them to go over to the House for the House to deal with those amendments. If there are any messages returned, the Senate will then need to deal with those. In giving the proposed motion precedence, we seek the support of the Senate to ensure that we can finalise this bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        If you look at the program over the last 12 months, the government has endeavoured to gain the cooperation of the opposition to ensure that we can get our legislative program dealt with in a reasonable way. The opposition have not been completely reasonable, if I can use that phrase, in ensuring that the government had sufficient time to deal with its legislative program. There are two indicia which highlight this. The first is that government business for the year to date runs at about 40 per cent of Senate time. It usually runs at about 50 per cent. Therefore, there has been about 10 per cent less government time in which to deal with legislation. The second is that the opposition have increased the number of urgency motions and matters of public importance from something in the order of between seven per cent and 15 per cent to 38 per cent. That has meant that the amount of available time for the Senate has significantly reduced.
       </p>
       <p>
        We all know that at the end of the session it is not unusual to seek additional hours to ensure that we can deal with the legislative program. In this instance, there is but one bill that we are now pursuing with vigour to ensure that we finalise the legislative program of the government. The opposition have indicated, clearly, that they are not supportive of this approach. Therefore, the only recourse that the government had to ensure that we can proceed was to move this motion. We need the support of the minor parties and the Independents. It would be much better to have had the opposition arrange—like we have done in the past—time for a full debate and for the debate to be continued in respect of this. The opposition have indicated time and again that they do not want to debate this bill. They are seeking to frustrate the ability of the government to finalise its legislative program and frustrate the ability of the government to finish this bill. The opposition have that right. The government also has the right to pursue its legislation as outlined.

          <p>
           Thank you for that clarification. At the outset let me say this opposition has been one of the most cooperative oppositions in the history of this Senate. We have helped and assisted this government. The government claims that only 40 per cent of the Senate’s time has been taken with government legislation, but that is because of one simple reason: they had no legislation to put before us. They introduced the Afghanistan motion, they introduced all sorts and manner of things, and were more than happy for private members to be given time to discuss and ventilate issues because they did not have, and still do not have, a genuine agenda to prosecute in this chamber—until now.
          </p>
          <p>
           We had an unseemly performance last night on national
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">
            TV
           </a>
           from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, fresh from his debacle about the

            NBN
           </a>
           not being mentioned in the legislation that is before us, being wrong about that not once, not twice, but 62 times. He then went on national TV last night to tell us that there are some ‘arcane practices’ in the Senate which are delaying process of his legislation. You know what the arcane practices are: that there are still some senators gutsy enough crease the back of the legislation, to crease the spine of the explanatory memorandum and actually read them. If the minister had done that he would not have made that monumental error that Senator Joyce so ably exposed on national TV. Also, the assertion was made that this legislation has been on the
           <i>

           </i>
           since June 2009—in fact, 15 June 2009. That is just completely and utterly incorrect and it goes to show the misinformation that Labor continually peddles and that is unfortunately regurgitated by friendly elements in the media.
          </p>
          <p>
           The simple fact is the government did not do a deal with Telstra in relation to these matters until 20 June this year and then they only presented the new legislation—significantly different from that which was tabled on 15 September 2009—when they tabled it on 20 October. We have only had five days when it has actually been on the

             Senator Macdonald corrects me; each time we look at it, it goes up. That is why it is so vitally important that this legislation not be rushed. I simply remind the Greens and the minors in this place that they, in their rush to assist the government in relation to the so-called stimulus package, share the responsibility of the house fires in the pink batts debacle. They share the responsibility for the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_the_Education_Revolution" rel="nofollow">
              Building the Education Revolution
             </a>
             debacle. They share the responsibility for the green loans scandal. And they will share the responsibility for the huge burden, at over $2,000 per man, woman and child, that is being placed on the shoulders of not only this generation but the next generation as well. That is why we say it is wise for us not to proceed in an inappropriate, indecent, hasty manner because they should have learnt the lesson of pink batts,
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BER" rel="nofollow">
              BER
             </a>
             , green loans—and the list goes on. But, no, they are willing to airbrush all that from their memory and say, ‘Sure, we have mucked up three or four times; let’s do it again, but with a lot bigger sum of money’—$43-thousand-million or, indeed, $50-thousand-million.
            </p>
            <p>
             The summary of the business plan that we were given will be ventilated in an extensive manner by the coalition at least. To my friend Senator Xenophon, who put out a press release saying ‘Government agrees to publicly release full
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
              NBN
             </a>
             summary’, I say that that is like saying, ‘I’ve got a full half glass of water.’ With great respect, this is accepting and adopting government spin, which is not good enough when you are dealing with a $43-thousand-million or $53-thousand-million project. As a result we will be opposing the motion.

                  Senator Abetz has mentioned Christmas. He said last night that there should be more sitting hours. I am in the mood that we should sit till Christmas if necessary. I am looking forward to the opposition being called on this. They might be changing a few pre-Christmas events.

                      Poor Senator Macdonald is gagging, he says. That is up to him. There should be time for the debate on this. We should be enlightened by what the motion is. We will be supporting this motion so that, in the commonsense way of the Senate, it can be looked at and properly dealt with.

                      The opposition seem to have left the chamber—so much for attention to detail with regard to Friday morning! They are all missing except for the obligatory two senators—so much for attention to this important matter. I look forward to seeing what the government have to put before us. We support this motion, and we will support a full debate on it, if necessary, so that everybody can come to a proper arrangement for us to sit here today and, I presume tomorrow, in order to deal—
                      <i>
                       (Quorum formed)
                      </i>
                      So the opposition, having vacated the chamber, call for a quorum. As you know,
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
                       Mr President
                      </a>
                      , that is about as irresponsible an action as an opposition can take at this stage of the game. I presume more quorums will be called during the day because the opposition are absent from the chamber and unable to properly take part in the debate. That is fine too. As I say, they should get ready to sit through until Christmas if we need to; I am quite happy to. I support the suspension that is inherent in this motion.

                       I have to admit that I never bought the new paradigm. I always suspected that this parliament would resemble far, far too closely the previous parliaments. When there is talk of new paradigms, a new political culture and a new way of operating, you will forgive me if I am a little cynical. We saw the first episode of that last night when Senator Brown sought to gag debate in this place.

It is an alliance against accountability; it is an alliance against transparency, and that is what we saw last night. We are seeing another instalment of that today, with Senator Ludwig seeking to suspend standing orders to introduce a motion to vary the order of business today. There is a well-established pattern of business in this place, and it is the government’s obligation to manage their program within that established program, which it has failed to do.

                          Alongside that, we on this side of the chamber are not prepared to be party to any rush of consideration of the telecommunications legislation, which has taken up part of this week. That legislation actually has not received significant scrutiny. It is not for any lack of trying on this side of the chamber. It is because the parliament and the Australian people have been denied basic information which they need when assessing something of this magnitude—when assessing a $42 billion or $43 billion government program. We wanted the business case but that has been denied. We have been given an abridged version of it but that is not adequate; it is not sufficient. We have argued time and again that something of this magnitude should go to the

                          program at least gets the scrutiny of the hapless Mr Orgill. Even that program gets a modicum of objective assessment. But for something that will cost $42 billion this government seeks to deny even the most basic elementary scrutiny. We are not minded to support—and we will not be supporting—the suspension of standing orders to consider a motion to vary the hours in this place—

                            It is still being written as we speak, as Senator Abetz points out. This legislation does deserve proper scrutiny. In my own portfolio of disabilities, just the concept—it is a good concept—of a national disability insurance scheme, which probably goes to a dollar figure of $3 billion to $5 billion, is being examined by the

                            referring to the processes of this place, this chamber of which he is a member, as ‘arcane’. But there is nothing arcane about good old-fashioned scrutiny. There is nothing arcane about having sunlight, having the spotlight, put on government legislation. We heard a lot about Operation Sunlight, as colleagues would remember. It sounded like a

It is all right if you do not pretend to be as pure as the driven snow, but they do. They are all part of this process and they are going to do you over today, Australia. They are going to let you down. They are going to hide, they are going to prevaricate and they are going to guillotine. This crowd are not good for their word. They are not transparent. They are not the arbiters of light. There is no light in this. This is all tinea. That is we are getting in this show. There is no light in this place. This is what we get.

There are a hell of a lot of amendments to be dealt with and they need to be properly scrutinised, so I again emphasise to the parliament that both Senator Brown and Senator Xenophon have guaranteed a full, open and accountable debate, which means that neither of them will be moving the gag motion and neither of them, nor their parties and followers, will be supporting the gag debate at any time during the debate on the NBN. I want to emphasise that. Thank you, Senator Brown, and thank you, Senator Xenophon, for indicating there will be a full and open debate, which means you will not be moving and you will not be supporting a gag motion.
