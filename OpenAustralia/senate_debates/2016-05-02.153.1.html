         Act 1986
        </i>
        toincrease the Medicare levy low-income thresholds for singles, families and seniors and pensioners in line with increases in the consumer price index. These changes will ensure that low-income households who did not pay the Medicare levy in the 2014-15 income year will generally continue to be exempt in the 2015-2016 income year if their incomes have risen in line with, or by less than, the consumer price index.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition to providing a concession to low-income households, the Medicare levy low-income thresholds ensure that people who pay no personal income tax due to their eligibility for structural offsets — such as the low-income tax offset or the seniors and pensioners tax offset — do not incur the Medicare levy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The changes to the thresholds mean that no Medicare levy will be payable for individual taxpayers with income under $21,335 in 2015-16 (increased from $20,896). Single seniors and pensioners with no dependants who are eligible for the seniors and pensioners tax offset will not incur a Medicare levy liability if their income is less than $33,738 (increased from $33,044).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Couples and families who are not eligible for the seniors and pensioners tax offset will not be liable to pay the Medicare levy if their combined income is less than $36,001(increased from $35,261). Couples and families who are eligible for the seniors and pensioners tax offset will not be liable to pay the Medicare levy if their combined income is less than $46,966 (increased from $46,000). The thresholds for couples and families go up by $3,306 for each dependent child (increased from $3,238).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The increase in thresholds will apply to the 2015-16 year and future income years.
