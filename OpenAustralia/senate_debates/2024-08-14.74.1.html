        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Sport, Senator Gallagher. Australians have been glued to their
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">
         TV
        </a>
        s, sometimes in the early hours, watching our athletes compete on the world stage in Paris to achieve a record-setting medal haul at the Olympics. From the pool to the track, the rapids to the velodrome, our athletes did us so proud, finishing fourth on the medal tally. Can the minister please report to the Senate on the success of the Australian Olympics campaign and how the Australian government is supporting our athletes?

         I thank Senator Green, who is a mad sports fan, for the question and for the opportunity to reflect on the success of the Australian Olympic team.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia sent 460 athletes to Paris for the 2024 Olympics, and it is an honour to be able to celebrate their success here in the Senate today. Across 33 sports, our athletes gave their all for their sport and their country and, back home, we gave our sleepless nights and early mornings in front of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">
          TV
         </a>
         cheering them on. As the

         </a>
         said when he greeted our athletes this morning, 'Every single one of these athletes has done us proud.' Not everyone had a medal around their neck, but every single one of them was worth their weight in gold; every single one of them has done our country proud.

         represented Australia with pride at the opening ceremony as flag bearers. Jess secured her place as the undisputed queen of the rapids, winning two gold medals and being elected to the International Olympic Committee's Athletes Commission and the Brisbane 2032 board. Noemie added to the Fox family medal hall with gold in the canoe slalom. Our Dolphins absolutely dazzled in the pool, with lots of silver, gold and bronze, with incredible team spirit in the relays and fearlessness from Moesha Johnson, who swam 10 kilometres up and down the river.

          I would have thought that this would have received more bipartisan support, frankly.

          was amazing as our chef de mission. I am sure she would not play favourites, but I have no doubt that she would have been proud of our cyclists and gold in the men's team pursuit. Anna's defence of our breakdancer, Raygun, showed the world Australia's unique brand of loyalty—and Australia's dance floors will never be the same again. Australia now has a couple of weeks to catch up on sleep and get ready for the Paralympics.

             Of Australia's 18 gold medals, 13 of them were won by women. The women at this Olympics were incredible. Of our team, 55 per cent were women—a huge improvement on the zero women that were taken to the 1924

             and Arisa Trew, a Cairns local, ruled from the skateboard. I can't wait to see these two Queenslanders at Brisbane 2032. Seven of the gold medals were won in the pool and six of these medals were won by women. Emma

               Thank you, Minister. Our athletes have done us proud and they are an inspiration to the next generation. In the lead-up to Brisbane 2032, how is the government supporting our athletes?

                I thank Senator Green for the supplementary. All of those athletes that attended and represented the country on Australia's behalf at the Olympics started their sport at a young age—and we often saw photos of them on the

                 TV

                during coverage of their event. That is why it is important, as Senator Green said, that we make sure that we are continuing to support grassroots sport, because this is where young kids get involved and supported on their way to becoming elite athletes or just enjoying participation in the sport of their choice.
