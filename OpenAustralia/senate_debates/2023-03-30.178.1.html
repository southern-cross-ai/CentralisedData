        , Takayuki Ueda, spoke at an event hosted by the Minister for Resources, Madeline King. Ueda-san said in his speech about the government's gas market policies: 'We are concerned that market intervention will only compound the situation of price challenges. Price intervention is likely to discourage investment in exploration and production while simultaneously driving up demand. The energy policy environment in Australia today appears to be driven almost by ideology and domestic concerns that the investment climate in Australia appears to be deteriorating.' I ask Senator Farrell, as the minister responsible for investment: how much does the government believe its interventions reduce investment in Australia? Does the Albanese Labor government accept responsibility for the deterioration in Australia's reputation?

           No, zero impact on our relations. Seriously, zero is the answer. It won't have any impact on our international reputation or our reliability or our stability as a supplier of, amongst other things, gas. I've followed the

           story in Australia very closely for a long period of time, since my great friend Mr Paul Henderson shook hands with Mr Kitamura all those years ago to start the process of building one the great Japanese investments in this country. To sit and watch those gas ships go out of Darwin harbour, on their way to supply something like 10 per cent of Japan's gas needs, is a wonderful thing. I can recommend it to anybody.

          <p>
           I've met with the gentleman that you referred to, and I have met with Mr Kitamura. In fact, I had the privilege late last year of awarding Mr Kitamura an Order of Australia at the Australian embassy in Tokyo. We're a democracy just like Japan, and companies in Japan can express points of view that don't always agree with the government of the day or, in fact, other—

                   Thank you for that protection from Senator Canavan. We were left with a situation where the potential was that, as a result of those 10 years of neglect in the electricity sector by the former government—

                    A point of order on direct relevance. The question actually related to the gas market interventions. Particularly the question went to the observation by one of the largest foreign investors in this country as to whether those interventions would increase demand for coal. I ask you to draw the minister to the question.
