         Leader of the Government in the Senate
        </a>
        , Senator Wong. Minister, the following are your words from 2021, directed at the coalition government: 'A serious crime was covered up.' 'It's a cover-up.' 'The cover-up is unreal.' In an estimates hearing that year, Senator Gallagher stated: 'It is a cover-up of the cover-up of the cover-up. It's like a triple cover-up.' You followed that with, 'You'—the government—'should be ashamed of yourselves.' In a relevant recent Federal Court judgement, Justice Lee found, when examined properly and without partiality, the cover-up allegation was objectively short on facts and long on speculation and internal inconsistencies. He further stated that the publication of the cover-up component caused:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … confusion, and did much collateral damage—including to the fair and orderly progress of the underlying allegation of sexual assault through the criminal justice system …
       </p>
       <p>
        Do you now accept that no cover-up occurred and that the politicisation of this matter caused much collateral damage?

         Senator Scarr, I will advise you that statements made by senators before they were a minister are not relevant to their role as minister. I will invite Senator Wong to answer your question with the caveat that I've just explained.

          I am surprised at that question. There were quite a number of findings made by the judge, and can I indicate my personal sympathy for Ms Higgins, who the judge found was raped in the minister's office. Other than that, I think there has been much said in many contexts about this, and, unlike some on that side—

                   <p>
                    In 2021, you stated about my friend and colleague Senator Reynolds:
                   </p>
                   <p class="italic">
                    … Senator Reynolds did not lead by example, and she let a woman down badly—a woman to whom she had a duty of care.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    So I ask this: what are the consequences for Senator Reynolds? I ask you, Minister: what should be the consequences for your inaccurate accusation and politicisation of this matter?

                     Once again, Senator Scarr, I remind you that this question is not in order. It was made while the member was in opposition, so that caveat applies. I'm going to ask Minister Wong if she wishes to make a contribution, and I'm asking all senators to listen in respectful silence.
