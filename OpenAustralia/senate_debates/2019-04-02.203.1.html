        . The Bill will provide medical treatment to eligible members of Australian Civilian Surgical and Medical teams who worked in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Vietnam" rel="nofollow">
         South Vietnam
        </a>
        from October 1964 to December 1972 under the

         Southeast Asia Treaty Organization
        </a>
        aid program.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        During the Vietnam War Australian Civilian Surgical and Medical teams were engaged by the then
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_External_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Department of External Affairs
        </a>
        to provide medical aid, training and treatment to local Vietnamese people in South Vietnam as part of Australia's contribution to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization aid program.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This measure was to be introduced in 2020, however, Australian Civilian Surgical and Medical team members raised concerns that waiting another 18 months was not ideal for an ageing group, some of whom have serious health issues.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Government has listened to these concerns. We are committed to ensuring this small group can access medical treatment as and when they need it, and so we have decided to bring forward this measure to 1 July 2019.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill recognises the fact that Civilian Surgical and Medical teams working in South Vietnam had a unique role in working for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Government
        </a>
        in a conflict zone where they were exposed to hazards and dangers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill also recognises that the teams provided invaluable aid to Vietnamese citizens, often in difficult and traumatic circumstances.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill will provide eligible Civilian Surgical and Medical team members with access to medical treatment through a

        </a>
        Gold Card.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        DVA is aware of approximately 200 surviving members of Civilian Surgical and Medical teams that will benefit from this Bill.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Civilian Surgical and Medical team members can already receive compensation and treatment for medical conditions related to their employment in South Vietnam under the
        <i>
         Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988
        </i>
        administered by Comcare.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill would increase the level of medical assistance available to Civilian Surgical and Medical team members by extending medical treatment to any injury or disease including those unrelated to their work performed in South Vietnam.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Civilian Surgical and Medical team members will also be eligible to receive a pharmaceutical supplement and payment for travel costs related to receiving medical treatment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill will mean improved range and access to medical treatment for Civilian Surgical and Medical team members as and when they need it.

        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill will make necessary amendments to related Acts, to ensure that Civilian Surgical and Medical team members will be able to receive medical treatment and pharmaceutical supplement resulting from their eligibility under the Treatment Benefits (Special Access) Act 2019.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill will also ensure that members of Civilian Surgical and Medical teams will be exempt from paying income tax on payments made to them, under Part 3 of the

         Treatment Benefits (Special Access) Act 2019,
        </i>
        fortravelling expenses and payments of the pharmaceutical supplement under Part 4 of that Act.

        The Bill contains transitional provisions which will ensure that Civilian Surgical and Medical team members eligible for medical treatment under the
        <i>
         Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988
        </i>
        will not be left without the ability to access medical treatment while transitioning to receive treatment under the
