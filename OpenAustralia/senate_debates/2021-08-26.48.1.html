           I remind senators, as I have in the past, of page 485 of
           <i>
            Odgers
           </i>
           , which says that back in 2009 'the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_Committee" rel="nofollow">
            Procedure Committee
           </a>
           recommended an understanding that there should be no more than three select committees in existence at any time'. There are currently seven select committees. This motion will take it to eight. I point out that a stipend is paid by the public in relation to these committees. A chair receives an additional payment of $23,240 and the deputy chair receives $11,620. This is a cost to the taxpayer of $34,000. At the same time we're paying stipends to references committee chairs and deputy chairs, and those committees seem mostly unutilised. I won't support a select committee here, but I would support it going to a references committee.

              opposes this motion. Paragraph (1) is the key paragraph. Within that, in regard to clause (a), the answer is already known, but it's not surprising that members of the parliament are not aware. For clause (b), the core issue is decades of shoddy governance and lack of parliamentary accountability. Our inquiry into the use of taxpayer money on disaster recovery funding would start to address these issues. My dissenting report to the Northern Australia Agenda inquiry itemised many concerns, including the need for comprehensive tax reform for practical industrial relations reform to protect workers and small businesses. Clause (d) is largely known and understood. This would be a waste of money, and it is not sincere.
