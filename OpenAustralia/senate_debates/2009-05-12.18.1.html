         As senators would be aware, Australia has been very concerned about Pakistan for some time. Pakistan is, of course, one of the world’s most strategically important countries and a country facing a number of acute challenges. The threat of terrorism and extremism in Pakistan has become so grave that President Zardari has described it as a threat to Pakistan’s very existence. Regrettably, the Afghanistan-Pakistan border regions remain a hotbed of international terrorism. This affects not only the safety of our troops in Afghanistan but also the safety and stability of the region and beyond.
        </p>
        <p>
         Tensions continue to escalate in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swat_Valley" rel="nofollow">
          Swat Valley
         </a>
         as fighting between government forces and the Taliban intensifies. The army says it has deployed around 15,000 troops against up to 5,000 militants in the Swat, and the Australian government is watching the situation very closely. While we welcome the Pakistan army’s actions to push back the Taliban’s advance, it is vitally important that the Pakistani government makes every effort to protect the welfare of civilians who are caught up in the conflict.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Pakistani government must ensure that its international human rights obligations are respected, including for women and children. It is important that Pakistan take a comprehensive approach to dealing with extremism that includes strategies to combat extremism, to promote stability and to foster economic development. The Australian government does not underestimate the complexity of the challenges facing the democratically elected government of Pakistan.

           I thank Senator Collins for that supplementary question and acknowledge her concern about this issue. I can say that the humanitarian crisis in the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swat_Valley" rel="nofollow">
            Swat Valley
           </a>
           is worsening. An estimated 1.2 million people have been displaced by the conflict and the military has ordered all civilians to leave the Swat area. Pakistani authorities are coordinating humanitarian assistance with international aid agencies but
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Vision" rel="nofollow">
            World Vision
           </a>
           has warned of the conditions that exist in camps.
          </p>
          <p>
           Last month the government announced it would provide $3 million to help Pakistan meet the urgent humanitarian needs of people displaced by the rising conflict in the North-West Frontier Province and federally administered tribal areas. This is in addition to $3 million provided in October 2008 after the fighting began.

             group. At the Pakistan Donors’ Conference in Tokyo last month the Minister for Foreign Affairs announced that Australia would significantly increase its development assistance to Pakistan. Our aid program to Pakistan will rise to $120 million over two years. Part of this aid will be directed to the border areas. We will increase our aid to these regions in response to humanitarian need and to help improve basic services such as health and education. Our aid program will also focus on improving rural livelihoods, strengthening standards of democratic governance and protecting internationally recognised human rights standards.
