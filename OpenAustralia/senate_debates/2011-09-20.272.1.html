        <p>
         The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATO" rel="nofollow">
          ATO
         </a>
         has premises across Australia, with sites in all state capital cities. There is a significant presence in metropolitan and key regional centres. Smaller outpost sites are maintained to support the remote taxpaying community.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) A full list of ATO occupied premises is attached. See Attachment A (available from the Senate Table Office).
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The ATO also has an agreement in place (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorandum_of_Understanding" rel="nofollow">
          Memorandum of Understanding
         </a>
         ) with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Human_Services" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Human Services
         </a>
         to provide ATO services to the community from Department of Human Services premises. A list of these premises can be found at Attachment B (available from the Senate Table Office)..
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) The ATO rents all of the property it occupies and does not own any property.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) The actual amount of space in square metres at each of the ATO premises is included at Attachment A.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) The ATO can only provide information regarding the amount of space occupied by the ATO.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Where the ATO and other Commonwealth agencies have leases in the same building, the ATO does not have the lease details of other Commonwealth agencies, as each agency enters into separate lease agreements with the lessor.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Two Commonwealth agencies sub-lease premises from the ATO:
        </p>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <p class="italic">
         (5) The ATO does not own any property.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (6) Current lease terms of each ATO premises are included at Attachment A.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (7) Rental review dates and determination of any new rental rates are included at Attachment A.
