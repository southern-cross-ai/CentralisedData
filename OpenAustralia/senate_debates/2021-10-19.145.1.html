        If you want net zero emissions by 2050, build the Tully-Millstream hydro-electric scheme and build it now. Today, I am joining Counsellor Andrew Cripps and my colleague Senator Canavan and, I presume, Senator McDonald and anyone else in Queensland, especially those who understand regional Queensland has long wanted action on the Tully-Millstream hydro-electric scheme.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite technical studies and consideration in the 1980s, it is now time for the Liberal-National government to re-evaluate the project in light of changing demand in our national energy, water and economic security. If we are to adopt net zero emissions by 2050, than the Tully-Millstream hydro-electric scheme must be part of the Prime Minister's plan. To many North Queenslanders the project stacks up. The original proposal involved the construction of two weirs, two dams, and a pumping station. It was originally estimated to have a maximum capacity of 600 megawatts. However, in light of this government's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowy_Hydro" rel="nofollow">
         Snowy Hydro
        </a>
        scheme, there is much more to be explored in enhancing its generation capacity. So Tully-Millstream must be built as part of the plan towards 2050.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Tully-Millstream hydroelectric scheme, as previously proposed, included creek diversions from the Tully and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_River" rel="nofollow">
         Herbert River
        </a>
        basins into dams. The proposal utilises underground tunnels devised to minimise environmental and agricultural disruption and to transfer the water to the eastern side of the range, where the electricity generation will occur. The 600-megawatt station has been proposed to be constructed underground between the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koombooloomba_Dam" rel="nofollow">
         Koombooloomba Dam

        and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tully_River" rel="nofollow">
         Tully River
        </a>
        . The proposed station would provide significant benefits to the local region.
       </p>
       <p>
        So I am renewing this call on behalf of many
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         Far North Queensland
        </a>
        ers and other Queenslanders who have strongly campaigned for this project for decades. I really want to call out Councillor Andrew Cripps, Tully born and bred, who was campaigning for the Tully-Millstream hydroelectric scheme long before anyone thought about zero emissions. As our economy continues to recover from COVID, it is time for us to have a serious look at the feasibility of nation-building projects like the Tully-Millstream hydroelectric scheme.
       </p>
       <p>
        As it stands, there are clear reasons why the project stacks up. The reliability of rainfall in the Tully region and the elevation of the proposed site combine to provide a sound technical proposition for a hydroelectricity project. In a changing energy market, as our nation moves towards 2050 through technology, not taxes, it is crucial that we focus on adding greater diversity and reliable baseload options into the energy grid. The Tully-Millstream hydroelectric scheme provides viable renewable energy solutions to Far North Queensland that will reassure the supply into the national energy grid.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, this is one of the many nation-building projects that we need to invest in to kickstart our economic recovery and ensure water and energy security. Not only will the construction of the project create jobs in northern Australia, but the operation of a hydropower station will create permanent local jobs, opportunities and investment in the region and across Queensland. If anything, while there is strong justification for another feasibility study, it's time to get building. If you want net zero emissions by 2050, build the Tully-Millstream hydroelectric scheme and build it now.
