         Before I start this line of questioning, because it is going to be quite a technical line of questioning in relation to the better off overall test, I want to remind the chamber that the questions I asked last night and I am going to proceed to ask today are very deliberate questions. In particular they aim to enable us, to the extent possible, due to the significant uncertainty about how this legislation could be interpreted, to get clear and concise answers to provide guidance to those interpreting the government's legislative intent. For that reason, and just for the benefit of the
         <i>
          Hansard
         </i>
         record, I remind the chamber and the minister that the official records of parliamentary debates include questions in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_of_the_Whole" rel="nofollow">
          Committee of the Whole
         </a>
         stage. For the benefit of those in the gallery, that's exactly what we are doing now. We are in the Committee of the Whole stage, asking questions in relation to Labor's industrial relations legislation. They are a vital source of information when it comes to statutory interpretation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Minister, I now want to turn to a line of question in relation to the better off overall test. I will set the scene by referring to the comments of the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations in the second reading speech in the House of Representatives, on Thursday 27 October 2022. In relation to simplifying the better off overall test, the minister stated:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         We'll make the better off overall test simple, flexible and fair.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         There's consensus that approval requirements for enterprise agreements are onerous, complex and unnecessarily prescriptive.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         We'll make key changes to fix this.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         First, the concept of 'prospective award covered employees' is removed for enterprise agreements that are not greenfield. For the majority of proposed enterprise agreements, the test will be applied in relation to actual workers, and patterns and types of work that are reasonably foreseeable.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The bill will restore the original intent of the test as a global, rather than line-by-line, comparison against the modern award.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         And, thirdly, if there is a common view that the employer and union have that the agreement passes the test, the commission will give primary consideration to that view.
        </p>
        <p>
         In particular, I go to these comments:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         First, the concept of 'prospective award covered employees' is removed for enterprise agreements that are not greenfield. For the majority of proposed enterprise agreements, the test will be applied in relation to actual workers, and patterns and types of work that are reasonably foreseeable.
        </p>
        <p>
         That was from the minister's statement in the House of Representatives on Thursday 27 October 2022 when he was referring to the bill that was tabled at the time. If one was to go to that, in terms of a matter of statutory interpretation, it would appear at this stage that the concept of 'prospective award covered employees' will be removed.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_I" rel="nofollow">
          If I
         </a>
         then go to the regulation impact statement, in terms of the better off overall test, it states:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         As well as the concern over the genuine agreement requirements, employers have consistently raised issues about the application of the Better Off Overall Test …
        </p>
        <p>
         It goes through the Coles decision, and then it says:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Employer groups are strongly of the view that the broader decline in enterprise agreement coverage across the labour market is, in part, referable to these changes in the application of the test and the uncertainty it has resulted in.
        </p>
        <p>
         There appeared to be consensus about the changes proposed by the government in relation to the better off overall test and, in particular, to quote the minister, 'the concept of the prospective award covered employees being removed et cetera'.
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to the bill that was tabled, before the amendments last night were tabled, could I go through that with you now to understand, in particular, what happened in relation to the prospective employees and the hypothetical employees. What was the change originally intended to do?

          (—) (): Thank you, Senator

           Cash
          </a>
          . It's good to be with you again on an important piece of legislation. In general terms, can I say that the government's motivation in reforming the better off overall test is that I think pretty much anyone involved in the workplace relations system in Australia at the moment accepts that it's not working as it was intended. What we're trying to do is remove uncertainty that currently attaches to the better off overall test, by allowing the Fair Work Commission to only consider patterns of work that are reasonably foreseeable, meaning the commission will no longer be able to consider unrealistic scenarios. Of course, there are Senate amendments that we put forward that will clarify that the Fair Work Commission must consider whether reasonably foreseeable employees would be better off overall. These changes will ensure that the better off overall test is simplified, while providing strong protections to ensure no worker is worse off. You will remember, Senator Cash, that at the jobs summit both employers and unions agreed that the better-off-overall test is not operating in the way it was intended. As I said, that's why we are making these changes. The amendments clarify that, when applying the better-off-overall test, the Fair Work Commission must undertake a global assessment. It must also consider the views of the parties and give primary consideration to any common view about whether the agreement passes the better-off-overall test as expressed by the employer and bargaining representatives that are employee organisations.
         </p>
         <p>
          In terms of our amendment that provides that the Fair Work Commission will consider reasonably foreseeable employees, I have already addressed that, but the Fair Work Commission would also have regard to patterns or kinds of work or types of employment only if they are reasonably foreseeable. A further government amendment would provide that, in making this assessment, the commission must have regard to the nature of the enterprise or enterprises to which the agreement relates. If a view is expressed by a reasonable employer, employee or bargaining representative as to whether a working arrangement is reasonably foreseeable, the Fair Work Commission must determine the matter. If the Fair Work Commission makes an amendment to an enterprise agreement to address a concern about meeting the better-off-overall test, the amendment must be necessary to address the concern and the Fair Work Commission must seek the views of the relevant parties. Additionally, the bill includes a reconsideration process to allow employees, employers or their representatives to seek a reassessment of the better-off-overall test where particular working arrangements were not considered by the Fair Work Commission when the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BOOT" rel="nofollow">
           BOOT
          </a>
          was first applied, either because they weren't being engaged in or by omission. If the Fair Work Commission has a concern that an agreement doesn't pass the better-off-overall test as part of the reconsideration process, it must amend the agreement with retrospective effect if it considers it necessary to address the concern. However, penalty orders won't be available for any contraventions that arise only because of a retrospective variation. Hopefully, that clarifies the intent behind these amendments.

             I want to focus on employers welcoming the changes to the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BOOT" rel="nofollow">
              BOOT
             </a>
             and, in particular, the fact that, going forward under the original clause that was tabled, the better-off-overall test would not apply to the hypothetical or unlikely work. I will shortly take you through the Officeworks case study and the Prouds retail employees enterprise agreement because, as you know, they are not hypotheticals but actual cases that were decided. There appears now to be some inconsistency in what you have just advised the chamber of and the press release that was issued on 27 November 2022 by
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Bandt" rel="nofollow">
              Adam Bandt

            </p>
            <p>
             On one hand, we had the government allegedly working with employers following the jobs and skills summit. There was an agreement that there needed to be changes to the BOOT within reason. Those changes were reflected in the first draft of the legislation that the minister tabled and spoke to, as I stated, on 27 October. On 27 November 2022, after the deal was done with Senator
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pocock" rel="nofollow">

             attempted to remove prospective workers from being considered under the Better Off Overall Test when agreements are approved, something the Greens were concerned could have led to prospective workers being worse off. The Greens have ensured that the test in the existing s193 will remain. Further, the bill will be amended to clarify that when applying the BOOT—
            </p>
            <p>
             this is the important bit—

            <p class="italic">

             will still have to apply the existing tests and assess any work patterns the employer, union or employees consider foreseeable…
            </p>

             This is where the concern has been raised. We have a statement by the minister in relation to the original bill. We have the explanation that you've just given to the Australian Senate. We have the amendments in front of us, and we will go through them in detail, but at the same time we have a statement from the Australian Greens that basically says all bets are off in relation to considering potential work patterns of current or future employees, and the Fair Work Commission will still have to apply the existing tests and assess any work patterns the employer, union or employees consider foreseeable. Seeing that was probably the biggest win that the employers have, I need to genuinely understand—again this is statutory interpretation. There is a press release here. It appears to not be consistent with what you've just said. Is the press release correct? It says:
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             …the bill will be amended to clarify that when applying the BOOT and considering potential work patterns of current or future employees, the FWC will still have to apply the existing tests and assess any work patterns the employer, union or employees consider foreseeable…

              You would be drawing a long bow to argue that a press release issued by a non-government party would somehow be used by a future court to interpret the meaning of this legislation—

How they want to characterise things is a matter for them. What I can tell you is—and this is from the supplementary explanatory memorandum, from paragraph 24 onwards, on page 5:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              New subsection 193A(6) provides that when applying the

              This amendment amends subsection 193A(6) to provide that in considering what is reasonably foreseeable, the FWC must have regard to the nature of the enterprise or enterprises to which the agreement relates.

             <p>
              Then it, importantly, says at paragraph 27:

             <p class="italic">
              The FWC must have regard to the reasonably foreseeable patterns or kinds of work, or types of employment, for both existing award covered employees and foreseeable employees…
             </p>
             <p>
              It does refer to the Coles case, which I assume is the same Coles case that you're referring to. So the Fair Work Commission would no longer be required to consider hypothetical working arrangements that are not reasonably foreseeable.

                I'm not going to sit here and assess, on a one to 10 point scale or by any other means, whether what the Greens say on any matter is correct. What I'm telling you is what the government's position is and what the law is. The core change we are making here is to require the Fair Work Commission to only have regard to patterns or kinds of work or types of employment that are reasonably foreseeable.
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Senate" rel="nofollow">
                 The Senate
                </a>
                amendments will not change this. In the Senate what we are seeking to do is simply to clarify that the Fair Work Commission must consider whether reasonably foreseeable employees would be better off overall after considering the views of the parties and the nature of the business. This capacity is relevant where there are no employees actually employed under a particular classification in an agreement at the time of approval but they are realistically likely to be in future. Any working arrangements considered by the Fair Work Commission, whether for current or future employees, must be reasonably foreseeable. It's a matter for the Greens what they want to say about this debate. I am not here to say whether they're right or wrong. That's for them to say.

                   <p>
                    In relation to your political comment, Senator Watt, I would say that you have done a deal with the
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
                     Australian Greens
                    </a>
                    to get this legislation through. That is in the public. Therefore it is appropriate I ask questions in relation to the deal that has been done so we get an understanding as to the impact of the deal on the legislation. Given the press release and your statements, and given the concerns that have been raised by employers—as I said, there is the original draft; there is the agreement with employers in relation to the better off overall test changes; there are the statements made by Minister Burke in his second reading speech. Then jump forward to but a few days ago, and there is an announcement of a deal. Employers have expressed their disappointment. In particular, there didn't appear to be statements made by Mr Burke in relation to the deal struck that had been with the Australian Greens but for the press release issued by Mr Bandt. Based on the Greens' statement, the issue of prospective employees would remain. I'm still struggling to understand. You're saying they're wrong and you're right. If we could perhaps turn to two case studies, I think the case studies will take us through what actually will be in and out.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The first case study is in relation to the 2019 Officeworks case. I know the department and the ministerial advisers will know the Officeworks case. The 2019 Officeworks enterprise agreement provides a compelling example of where process prevails over substance. After objections were lodged by one union, the Fair Work Commission asked Officeworks to provide undertakings of a cold work allowance and a liquor licence, despite the fact these have nothing to do with the Officeworks business. This is for an agreement which was voted on by more than 80 per cent of eligible employees, with 97 per cent voting in favour of the agreement.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    This is one example of what had become too common when seeking to have enterprise agreements approved. I think that would have been raised with you by employers, because the Officeworks case is one of the most famous cases when it comes to being asked to provide an undertaking about a cold work allowance and a liquor licence, despite the fact that it had nothing to do with your business, the fact it was voted on by more than 80 per cent of eligible employees, and of that 80 per cent 97 per cent voted in favour. Would the changes proposed by the government to the

                      Well, thank you, and there is, and that is why I asked the question. Based on the new test that you are applying, and looking at the Officeworks enterprise agreement and the 2019 case, you've just said you can't rule it in or out, and that's the issue that I have. The explanatory memorandum looks like it rules it out. You're saying you can't, that it's at the discretion of the Fair Work Commission. This is actually one that you own. It is in your own explanatory memorandum. On that basis, my understanding is that you would no longer need to give an undertaking in particular about, for example, the holding or a liquor licence and work in a cool room despite the enterprise not serving liquor or having a cool room. On that basis, we could all agree that the Officeworks case would be decided differently.

                       I think it would be reasonable to expect that it would be decided differently, because the explanatory memorandum says that the types of undertakings that were required in that decision would no longer be needed. I'm not going to predict what the Fair Work Commission will decide on any matter, but I think it is reasonable to expect that the Officeworks decision would be decided differently because of the clear wording of the explanatory memorandum.

                        I'll go through another case study, and then I have a few questions on prospective employees, and then obviously I will cede the call to Senator Pocock for what time she needs.

                        In relation to—and again, this is not a hypothetical; these are actual cases—the Prouds retail employees enterprise agreement, in May 2019, 86 per cent of voting employees voted to support the agreement, but the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association, the
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SDA" rel="nofollow">
                         SDA
                        </a>
                        , argued that the agreement should deal with outlets that employ more than 15 employees per week, despite the fact that Prouds never employs more than 15 employees in any one of its stores on a regular basis. It took 16 long months from the date of lodgement with the Fair Work Commission to have that agreement finally approved. The issue the business had with that was that it took them away from creating jobs and left employees worse off while arguing about completely hypothetical situations. Again, similar to the Officeworks case, they had to provide undertakings to the commission in relation to a cold work allowance and a liquor licence, despite that having nothing to do with their business.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        We've now confirmed—Officeworks will be very happy to know—that that's been ruled out. That is very good. But this is now another agreement and it is in relation to very similar outlets that employ more than 15 employees per week despite the fact that Prouds never employs more than 15 employees in any one of its stores on a regular basis—16 months longer; at that time the business literally says it stopped them from creating jobs and left employees worse off. The whole point there was that they actually had to argue about completely hypothetical situations that did not exist. When we look at clause 28 on page 5 of the supplementary explanatory memorandum, again, does the Prouds retail case now fit within that?

                         Again, I'm not going to say what the Fair Work Commission will decide on a particular matter; that is always a decision for them. The entire point of this amendment is to eliminate hypothetical working arrangements that are not reasonably foreseeable. The entire point of this amendment is to speed up the process and avoid the sorts of protracted matters such as the one you're referring to. I don't think I can be any clearer than to say that, in any matter Fair Work Commission will consider, they won't be required to consider hypothetical working arrangements that are not reasonably foreseeable.

                            This will be my final question if I can get an answer from you. In relation to the original bill that was tabled and the amendments I now have in front of me: I need you to take me to what are the key differences in terms of inserting back in 'reasonably foreseeable employee'. My understanding is that, under the bill that was tabled that the minister spoke to, the concept of 'prospective award', 'covered employees' and 'reasonably foreseeable employee' was removed. We're now adding that back in by way of section 524B, with section 12, and all the subsequent sections that add back in 'reasonably foreseeable employee'. I just want to make sure I've got the key differences absolutely certain.

                                has implied there's some kind of inappropriate or nefarious discussion or negotiation underway and that that's somehow illegitimate. I want to reassure people at home who are watching that, since coming here as a senator less than six months ago, I've seen nothing but discussion, compromise, negotiation and often improvement in things; there's nothing untoward about it. Anyone who wants to know what values or issues the Greens took into those discussions with the government can look on our website. There's nothing secret about what we did. Our vote increased at the last election because people want an end to things like pay secrecy. They want a group of senators in here who are making sure that those low-paid retail and hospitality workers don't fall through the bottom of the

                                . I think it's very important we have been in discussions to improve the test, making sure those young employees who are very powerless are protected. Our sole focus has been on those protections in relation to the BOOT. We've sought to preserve the essential elements of the BOOT, so that new workers, or foreseeable working conditions, don't move workers backwards.

                                I want to follow that statement with a question to the minister. You've clarified the questions of 'reasonably foreseeable circumstances' and the way in which the BOOT will operate to protect those low-income workers, many of whom are young. I wonder if you could say a little about the reconsideration process and how that will work to also make sure that those workers—young workers, low-paid workers—don't fall through.

                                 , but you're quite correct that the bill includes what's known as a reconsideration process to allow employees, employers or their representatives to seek a reassessment of the better off overall test, where particular arrangements were not considered by the Fair Work Commission when the better off overall test was first applied, either because they were not being engaged in or by omission.

                                 The fundamental point here, of course, is that the government does not want to see workers left worse off. If the Fair Work Commission has a concern that an agreement does not pass the better off overall test as part of the reconsideration process, it must amend the agreement with retrospective effect, if it considers it necessary to address the concern. However, penalty orders won't be available for any contraventions that only arise because of a retrospective variation. Really, the intention of the reconsideration process is to permit adjustments to the bargained outcome only to the extent necessary to address a concern about the better off overall test because of a working arrangement that was not initially considered. The intention is not to interfere with the working arrangements for employees who are not affected by the concerns or unnecessarily disrupt the operations of the enterprise.

                                   Section 186, which you refer to, falls within the part of the bill that deals with enterprise agreement approvals. Overall, what we're seeking to do is simplify the process and remove unnecessary complexity for workers and employers by simplifying the agreement preapproval requirements. As to why we're doing this, there's consensus that the preapproval requirements for enterprise agreements are onerous, complex and unnecessarily prescriptive. This can be a disincentive to bargain and can sometimes have significant consequences for employers and workers where an agreement was been reached but cannot be approved because of a procedural error during the course of the bargaining process.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                   As to what the amendment involves and the proposal involves, it would replace certain preapproval requirements with a broad requirement that the agreement has been genuinely agreed to by relevant employees. A government amendment retains the existing requirement that employers must take all reasonable steps to ensure that the terms of the agreement and the effect of the terms are explained to employees in an appropriate manner, taking into account their particular circumstances and needs. The Fair Work Commission must also be satisfied that the employees requested to approve the agreement by voting for it have a sufficient interest in the terms of the agreement and are sufficiently representative having regard to the employees the agreement is expressed to cover. The Fair Work Commission will issue a statement of principles on genuine agreement to provide guidance to employers on how to ensure an enterprise agreement has been genuinely agreed to by employees.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                   I suspect that might be something of interest to you and the people who've been in touch with you as to what genuine agreement amounts to, and that's something that the Fair Work Commission will issue a statement of principles on. That document, when it's issued, will play a significant role in ensuring the changes do not erode employee safeguards. A government amendment also provides that, before an employer requests employees approve a multi-enterprise agreement by voting for it, the employer must obtain written agreement to the making of the request from each bargaining representative for the agreement that is an employee organisation. The government wants to ensure that employers are not unreasonably prevented from putting agreements to a vote, and that's why a further proposed government amendment would permit the Fair Work Commission to order, on application by a bargaining representative, that an employer be permitted to put a multi-enterprise agreement to a vote where employee organisations' failure to provide their agreement is unreasonable in the circumstances.

                                          No, thank you. Obviously, as I said, these are very genuine questions. This is a new section. There's a section in the act that says, currently, 'Approval of enterprise agreements' by the Fair Work Commission. Section 186, 'When the Fair Work Commission must approve an enterprise agreement—general requirement', sets out the basic rule. It then says currently under186(2):

                                          The point of the line of questioning is that, if I look at the amendment, the amendment says we're now swooping in above that and what we're now saying is that:

                                          The bit I'm struggling with then is, you're now saying:
                                         </p>
                                         <p class="italic">

                                           , in suggesting you might know that there's extensive case law. I was recognising your experience in this area. What I can also direct you to in the revised explanatory memorandum is in, I think, the next paragraph from the one you were reading from. So, paragraph 1119, about halfway down, it makes the point that 'protected industrial action taken by the employers/employees during bargaining for the agreement would not amount to coercion. The employer, having requested its employees to vote to approve the agreement, could be taken into consideration as could any unprotected industrial action taken by the employees.'

                                             , my limited recollection of the case law on coercion is that simply proposing to take protected industrial action does not amount to coercion. I mean, whether we're talking about employers or employees, given that the current legislation that your government presided over allowed for protected and industrial action to occur, albeit with significant constraints around it, the mere fact that that is provided for in the legislation would suggest pretty strongly to me that that does not amount to coercion. What the explanatory memorandum is trying to say is that coercion could, for example, be unprotected industrial action, unlawful intimidation or threats. I've been reminded that the leading case on the meaning of coercion in this context is the Esso decision, and that found, essentially, that coercion needs to involve negation of choice and the use of unlawful, illegitimate or unconscionable means.

Just so you're completely aware, whenever you say that you don't insult me, but you do insult former Prime Minister Gillard and former Prime Minister Rudd, because it is your regime. No-one here is insulted by the comments that you are making. We didn't have the numbers in the previous Senate. We relied on you. You opposed everything, including our changes to the

                                               The fact that we are putting forward amendments to this legislation indicates that the Albanese Labor government does think that the Fair Work Act needs improvement. Yes, the Fair Work Act was introduced by the Rudd-Gillard governments. As time goes on it needs improvement, just like every piece of legislation. The point I'm making is that over the course of this debate, both last night and today, you have suggested that there are things in the amendments that we're putting forward that are wrong or immoral or will do this or that, when in many cases they are picking up concepts that were contained in the legislation that existed when you were the minister. You did attempt to make amendments to the Act while were you the minister, many of which would have actually made workers' position worse off. I am very proud of the fact that we resisted those. Now that we're in government we're about trying to improve this act from where it began under the Rudd-Gillard governments, from where it was under your government, to where it needs to be to make sure that workers in this country get a decent pay rise and we can lift productivity in businesses as well.

                                                 I repeat that, in the example you're giving, proposing to take protected industrial action, which is a legal right that employers and employees have, does not amount to the negation of choice and the use of unlawful, illegitimate or unconscionable means. Similarly, just as you give an example of employees proposing to take protected action, if an employer was to propose to lock out its employees in line with the law, that would not be coercion because it's not unlawful, illegitimate or unconscionable. What would be unlawful, illegitimate or unconscionable, and therefore could amount to coercion, is unprotected industrial action, unlawful intimidation or threats.

                                                  go to the effect of the amendment itself. Is it then to actually make explicitly clear, given the wording of amendment, the Fair Work Commission must disregard anything done and the effect of anything done by a person other than one of the employers who bargained for the agreement? The effect is to make it explicitly clear that anything done by an employee or their union under the umbrella of industrial action is permitted when negotiating an agreement?

                                                    This is the whole point which employers have raised with me. What was the rationale behind including the section, given what you have just said, other than the government effectively telling Australians that to get what you want in the workplace, all you need to do is threaten industrial action, and that is the whole point? What is the rationale behind adding or inserting section 2AA?
                                                   </p>

                                                    Why the difference between what unions do and what employers do? I don't see any need for this particular section other than you do want to make it clear that anything done by an employee or their union in undertaking the application of section 186(2)(b), the Fair Work Commission does not need to take into consideration, unless it is one of the employers who bargained for the agreement. You have confirmed, therefore, that proposing or threatening to take industrial action that would financially cripple a small or family business or a smaller business to force them to sign the agreement is actually not coercion and therefore allowed.

                                                     There is a very good reason section 186(2AA) refers to employers, and that's because it relates to the existing section 186(2)(b). That existing provision provides that in order to approve a multi-enterprise agreement, the Fair Work Commission must be satisfied that:
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p class="italic">
                                                     (i) the agreement has been genuinely agreed to by each employer covered by the agreement; and
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p class="italic">
                                                     (ii) no person coerced, or threatened to coerce, any of the employers to make the agreement …
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                     Given that the focus of 186(2)(b) in the existing legislation is on the behaviour or mind of employers, that's why section 186(2AA) also deals with employers. There is no reference in the current section 186(2)(b) to employees or to unions; it's focused on employers. That's why 186(2AA) also refers to employers. If, as I think you're suggesting, this new provision were to also refer to employees, it would be completely meaningless, because it connects back to 186(2)(b), which is all about employers.

                                                         As was the case last night, we are trying to get into strictly defining terms that have ordinary meanings in the law. The word 'some', as in 'some employees', would be considered under its usual meaning. I think it would be fair to assume that we're talking about more than one, because, if we were talking about one, the word 'one' would be used. So I think it would be fair to assume that we're talking about more than one, but, of course, the word 'some' has a usual meaning that would be applied by the commission.

                                                          Thank you. That's exactly where I wanted to get to: what is the minimum number? For very obvious reasons, when an employer or employee reads this, there is no explanation anywhere in the bill. You say that the word 'some' has its usual legal meaning. That's great, but they don't have a time to grab a book and look up the usual legal meaning in Australia of 'some'. I want to confirm because of statutory interpretation. This is very important and has been raised with me across the board. More than some means more than one? This is the exact point that employers have been raising with me. Whilst there is no minimum number, you are saying one employee alone will not suffice, based on the usual legal meaning of the word 'some' for the employees covered? That's the exact issue that's been raised. Would it require more than one?

People use that word every day in Australian life, and I think they know that 'some' is more than 'one'. But let's remember that what we're talking about here is cooperative workplace agreements. There are obviously a range of different streams of agreements being provided for by this legislation. What we're talking about here is the cooperative workplace agreement where there is agreement between an employer and a union that a particular workplace should have its terms and conditions governed by a cooperative agreement, so the entire basis of this stream of bargaining is that there is agreement between an employer and a union in which there are at least some of the employees. Really the point of it to say that not every employee at that business needs to be represented by a union but at least some of them are.

It will give people satisfaction that, based on that answer, 'some' does not equate to 'one'. That actually does clear that up. It could be two, but it is not one.

I want to now take you through—and it's going to take some time—each power, because we received something back from the department that had words to the effect of minimal difference, or no substantive difference. So, we'll be going through all that as well. But perhaps, in the first instance, I could turn to some basic questions.

You have stated that you believe the Fair Work Ombudsman does have a limited ability to intervene in relation to stand down and right-of-entry matters, but what we have also determined is that the Fair Work Ombudsman is not required to intervene in Fair Work Commission matters, that it is merely a discretion that the Fair Work Ombudsman has—depending on their workload, to be fair.
                                                                               </p>

To be fair to the Fair Work Ombudsman, they may say, 'There's too much going on, we will not intervene.' Based on your last answer, on unlawful picketing, can you take me to exactly where in the Fair Work Act unlawful picketing itself is? What section?

That's the current rule; I understand. I'm talking about the fact that today or tomorrow morning we will formally abolish the Australian Building and Construction Commission. They operate under a specific piece of legislation. I'm asking the questions very genuinely. As I said to Senator Watt last night and again this morning, these are important questions of statutory interpretation. So I'm only dealing with the powers the Australian Building and Construction Commission had, and whether or not they transfer over to the Fair Work Ombudsman. What other bodies may or may not be able to do is the current situation. My questions are in relation to the transfer of powers from the ABCC under the BCIIP Act to the Fair Work Ombudsman.

Again, there is an entire industry watching these proceedings. They would genuinely like to know what exposure they have to the likes of John Setka, the most militant union in Australia, the construction division of the CFMMEU. This is genuine questioning. You're abolishing a body, and that's your decision—I accept it's an election commitment—but there is also a transfer of powers or not. You have said on the

To date we've discovered there are some gaps. Minister, with all due respect, answers such as, 'We are confident we've given them money'—that's not the line of questioning I'm going down. We are going to go through each power they had and whether or not it transferred over. I'm going to have to assume, if you cannot give me an answer—because you have got advisers there—it is going to be no. Then later today we're going to have to go through what you mean when you say you are confident that there are no gaps.

I did actually have a look up at the gallery when you mentioned that. I do see some familiar faces up there, and I get a sense that a lot of them are here because they want to see this bill passed. We know that you've been opposed to this legislation from the beginning, as you are entitled to be, but stop the lectures. I'm answering your question, I'm happy to sit here for as long as you want and I'm providing the answers that are required.

There has been a 50 per cent spike in the number of new investigations launched into alleged wrongdoing in the building sector in Queensland, more than any other state or territory. The militant construction union, the CFMMEU, was hit with 88 per cent of the $3 million in fines for breaches of the Fair Work Act imposed by the soon-to-be-defunct Australian Building and Construction Commission. Of the $5.1 million in fines the ABCC imposed in Queensland since it was restarted in December 2016, $4.4 million—or 87 per cent of these—were against the CFMMEU or its officials. How is this behaviour going to be dealt with in the bill?

There are millions of workers out there whom we haven't heard anything about—the millions of women, for example, who are hoping for a pay rise, a narrowing of gender equity, an improvement in their circumstances and some flexibility, so they know what their rosters are tomorrow. Could you fill us in on how this bill will assist that group of workers, people for whom this bill holds great potential to improve their lives? I'm particularly interested in gender and women.

The total remuneration gender pay gap, based on the Workplace Gender Equality Agency data, is 22.8 per cent, meaning men earn almost $26,000 a year more than women. As you can see, there is a real urgency in how we address this and the need to address this.

That is the reality. In the design of these reforms we have deliberately focused on the needs of lower paid and feminised workforces, and we believe the bill we have put forward best deals with those issues. As Senator

That's workers in health care, aged care, disability support, early childhood education and care and other care in community sectors. Part of the discussion we had last night was about attracting worker to these industries as well, because they are areas where we are suffering from a significant labour shortage at the moment. Keeping those workers and attracting new workers to those industries are going to be much easier if they are better paid.
                                                                                                              </p>

The undervaluation is one of the biggest causes of the gender pay gap, and our reforms take a number of key steps to address it. Another key cause of the gender pay gap is that our laws are outdated and don't support workers with caring responsibilities well enough. We will take a number of historic steps to address these issues: (1) changing the objects of the Fair Work Act to include gender equality, (2) fixing gender pay equity and creating new expert panels, (3) fixing bargaining for low-paid feminised sectors through our new support stream, (4) banning pay secrecy, (5) stamping out sexual harassment and (6) providing greater access to flexible work. That's what the focus of this bill is. That's why it is important. That's why it's urgent that it be passed. That's why the government have made it a priority since we were elected.

We spoke to unions, we spoke to the government, we spoke to advisers, we spoke to businesses—everyone. It took us that long just to get our heads across the ABCC and the impact it has on the construction industry. You can't tell me that a rookie senator in this place, who's dealing with all the other legislation, has got his head around and knows what's happening in this industry. This has been pushed by Labor. I don't know what deals you've done with him, but there's no way in the wide world that he can actually be across this and know exactly what's going on. Not only that; you have Labor, and you have the Liberal-National coalition, but the fact is that we on the crossbench are not beholden to any of the political parties. We actually do represent the over 33 per cent of Australians who voted for us in this last election. To push this legislation through is disgusting; you have not really given big business the chance.

I asked the Fair Work Commissioner, 'Have you ever run a business? Have you ever employed anyone?' They looked at me, stupid. Then they had to say, 'No, I've only been a public servant.' You have really only listened to them. I asked a question about the Public Service. I said, 'Do you realise that right across your own board and The Public Service you don't have enterprise bargaining, because if you work under the E4 or E5, for instance, in one government department, whether it be Defence or another government department, people are paid different wages. That's something I would like the minister to answer: does the bill deal with the Public Service? You're dealing with the private sector. You're telling the private sector what they should be doing. What have you got in the bill to cover the Public Service?

He obviously was engaged in discussion with the government and made the decision to support this legislation because he thinks that this is going to deliver for the Australian people, and it's also going to be the focus from our government of getting wages moving again.
                                                                                                                   </p>

I'd be sceptical about the opposition doing that, given their record in government, but when we actually put something forward to do something about it, it's not the right thing. How do you think Australian workers are feeling about that now? For ten years, low wages were a deliberate design feature of the previous government. But, now that we have a government that wants to do something about it and has put forward legislation to do something about, people are saying, 'This isn't the right thing to do.' No-one has put forward any other alternative. This is what we put forward as the government. I've run through some of the reasons we think it will be successful, particularly targeting some of those lower-paid industries and feminised workforces, which we think are so important, and those people who are doing it tough. That's the legislation that we've put forward.

They suffer a pay penalty and have insecurity in their jobs. How will this bill help deal with that problem of the 21st century; not the old wars, the wars we're hearing about in other people's questions, but the reality of Australian labour now. How do we get more security there for those millions of workers.

Too many Australians are stuck in insecure work, and that is dragging down wages. In my travels through regional Queensland, I see the prevalence of casual work or labour hire and the undermining of communities that that causes. People are waiting for a phone call to know whether they have work that day, which has a debilitating impact just on surviving.

                                                                                                                     </p>

But now, too often, it's people who are trying to support a family, to run a household, or to get ahead in life. When we think about that, it's the pressures of being part of a family. The rent doesn't operate on a casual basis. The mortgage doesn't operate on a casual basis. They're things that you are responsible for every week or month, depending on what your commitments are. People in insecure work can't take sick leave, can't get a loan, can't get ahead. And there are too many rorts and loopholes that the previous government allowed to flourish. Nearly 27 million employees, or 23.5 per cent of all employees, are casual. These are workers with no paid leave entitlements. Of the 1.3 million low-paid employees in 2021, nearly 60 per cent were employed on a casual basis and around 704,000 casual employees have had regular work with their employer. Nearly two-thirds of these have had regular work with their employer for more than 12 months. It shows you the way these people are being treated.
                                                                                                                     </p>

This bill will focus on improving job security and gender equality by including both concepts in the objects of the Fair Work Act. Part 4 would amend section 3 of division 2 of the Fair Work Act to introduce the promotion of job security and gender equality into the object of the Fair Work Act. In addition, part 4 would amend section 134 of the Fair Work Act to include the promotion of job security and gender equality in the modern awards objective. It would also amend section 284 to include the promotion of gender equality in the minimum wages objective. We are also making bargaining more accessible to those who've traditionally been shut out of the benefits of enterprise bargaining, including workers in low-paid and feminised sectors of the workforce, of which you're well aware.
                                                                                                                     </p>
                                                                                                                     <p>

This is more than just a symbolic change. It will now be a legislative expectation that the Fair Work Commission have regard to job security when performing relevant functions. We think that is a very important change for those impacted.

That was One Nation that did that. Aren't you aware of it, Minister? That was actually addressed, so that if people want to move casual to full-time employment they have every right to do it now. But a lot of people wish to stay as casuals because of the pay they're getting, the higher rate of pay that they have at the time. That was something that One Nation did. So, we do care about the workers out there. We do understand the stresses and strains they are going through.

                                                                                                                         It's wonderful that you've given me that list. Just listening it to it, there was Woolworths, Qantas and all these others. My question was, basically, that if something is at the smaller end, can they afford the enterprise-bargaining agreements of the larger businesses? It's just ridiculous to say that you've had all these meetings with these people when the question is, 'Have you actually consulted with these businesses and can they actually afford it?'
                                                                                                                        </p>
                                                                                                                        <p>
                                                                                                                         If a small business is going to have to get legal advice, consultation and everything they have to go through then you're going to put an extra $14,000 cost on that small business to be able to deal with all this. So my question, again is—and I'll repeat it: have you had any feedback from businesses that are saying they're actually going to have trouble affording this? Will it affect their businesses? Has any business told you that this will impact on them and that it will possibly force them to shut down their business or take it overseas?

But I think that the focus and the important thing for smaller businesses to understand is that for cooperative work places, which is where we think small businesses would more than likely end up, it's entirely voluntary. It allows small businesses to opt in to an agreement without having to incur the costs of negotiating it. It gives them access to the benefits of bargaining for productivity, simplicity and flexibility that currently only bigger businesses can access. That is what we feel will be appropriate, and we think that would also be cost-effective at the same time.

Did you actually take this into consideration: if you're going to increase wages—and that's what you want to do, to increase wages—there's also a plus-plus-plus on top of that. So it's not just wages; enterprise bargaining means that they could bargain for four days a week or they could bargain for extra holidays. This is all added cost to the employer. But if they actually do increase their wages, have you considered having negotiations or talks with the states? What this is going to do is put added cost onto businesses with payroll tax in the states. Have you taken this into consideration, and have you actually tried to negotiate with the states to look at the payroll tax?

You could actually drive it up, and instead of putting more employees on, you're actually going to reduce the staffing levels. Has this been taken into consideration? That's what I want to ask—not about consultation. Was this taken into consideration in the bill that if you're going to drive up wages you're actually going to create unemployment, because businesses will not be able to afford the extra they're going to pay in payroll tax. Each state varies in the amount of payroll tax that businesses pay.

It was not part of this; you're not interested; you're just passing the buck to the states. They deal with payroll tax. If you put out a bill like this, you have to take into consideration the impact it's going to have on businesses, whether they can afford it or not. I will tell you now, this is going to have an impact on businesses that will have to reduce their staff because they won't be able to afford the overheads and the costs. This is something I have been on about for years and years, about the unfair payroll tax which is destroying workers. They are not employing more staff because they can't afford it with that unfair tax. Tell me also, when an agreement is not reached, can protected industrial action commence?

You haven't really clearly defined what the similarities are going to be. Does it mean that in producing, whether you're retail or whether you're a restaurant or a manufacturer, or whether you box in the same way, are you in the same shopping centre? You haven't defined what similar entities are. That's not in the bill. You have left it open-ended. Can you explain that part to me? Please define, so businesses out there know what enterprise bargaining agreement they're going to be tied up with another supposedly like-minded business.

You've left everyone out there wondering what the hell is going to happen here. What I see written over this bill is union, union, union. This is payback from the Labor Party to the unions for all the funding and all the money that they have given you. This is basically about giving the unions the right to walk into businesses and with enterprise bargaining say 'Sign up here'. I can see it now. They're going to walk into the business and say to the employee, 'Do you want higher wages?' Of course they will. Who is stupid enough to say 'No, we don't'? When they get the agreement, they all want higher wages. 'Listen, mate, you sign up to the unions and we're going to go and fight for you for higher wages.' That is written all over this bill. Union, union, union.

We've got a bill that you want to actually get through to this parliament. Where is Senator Pocock? I will tell him also. There are pages and pages of amendments. Even the government amendments are nine pages. You know what that tells me? If you were to go and buy a car and you had all these defects in the car, nine pages—and that's not just Labor; this is the Liberal Party, the Greens,

You're buying a frigging lemon. That's what it would tell me, and that's exactly what this bill tells me—that you have not researched it properly. You're rushing it through this parliament. You've got a rookie senator that you've talked into supporting this bill, and it's a real shame.

There is a lack of workers out there. I'll inform you what's going on. A lot of businesses are actually paying their workers above the award just to get good staff. They want to hold onto them, so they are paying a lot of them above the award and all the other agreements—plus, plus, plus—that they want. But I'll also tell you what you're going to tie up here, because I've been a small-business person most of my life. You're going to have enterprise bargaining right across the board with a lot of these workers as well, instead of a single enterprise agreement with the worker. A lot of the workers are no-hopers, the ones that do not do a decent day's work. If you've got one person who works their guts out and does a good job and the other ones beside them are on their phone all day and don't work, productivity is down the bloody drain. You're going to tie them up into getting the same pay, the same rights, the same everything. That is going to really upset the worker who does his job and takes pride in his work and productivity, and that's what's going to happen as well.

As I said, the Public Service hasn't even got its own act together. I say to you, clean up your own backyard before you start telling private enterprise how to run their businesses and whether they can afford it or not. You're going to drive a lot of these businesses into the ground who can't afford it, and you're pushing this onto them. You are actually going to create unemployment with this bill. It is ill thought out. It is not dealing with the real issues. There is not enough consultation. You're going to get rid of the

They won't have to be answerable to anyone. They are nothing but thugs—not all; I'm talking about the officials—on these building sites that have destroyed small businesses. It has driven up the cost on these building sites by 30 per cent, and that's going to be the same effect again. Yet you think it's a good thing?

When only 32 or 33 per cent of Australians voted for Labor, you don't have a mandate at all—not at all. The system got you the seats in here that give you government. That's not a mandate to me. A mandate is 50.1 per cent of the vote. You didn't get that. I don't believe you're listening to the Australian people.

I could probably go for a while with a lecture on how democracy works. I don't think any government in Australia has got 50.1 per cent of the vote for a fair while, Senator Hanson.

More importantly, I see a bill that is designed to ensure people do get that wage rise, and that is what we are absolutely dedicated to doing. That is the focus of what we want to achieve through this. Again, I mentioned earlier that everyone tries to claim they're for wage rises, but then they keep coming up with a thousand excuses why they don't support them. We are unashamedly in favour of them. I think one of the clearest memories for the Australian people during the election campaign was the now Prime Minister holding up a dollar, and that resonated with the Australian people. I have no doubt that there is support across the community. There is obviously the support in this chamber, and that's the way our democracy works, Senator Hanson.

I wanted to ensure that, overnight, you couldn't suddenly provide further detail or clarification in relation to some specific examples. That's fine. So we can now go back—we've been asked to put these questions—and say: 'There is no further detail. There is no further clarification. The answer is consistent: it remains at the discretion of the Fair Work Commission.'

The answer to that question was no. Did the department provide any advice to the government about how this sector could be excluded or carved out?

This is the first time I'm asking this particular question. So, Senator Watt did not give me an answer last night. You have now stated that you are aware that certain industries did make representations to government in relation to potential carve outs. You said you've got one for me—mining and resources. You said you're not aware of manufacturers putting any request in to government. You've said you'll go away on notice, and the good news is that we're open-ended tonight, so we'll be able to get that information if not shortly then after question time in relation to the other sectors that approached the government and asked for a carve out. This is information that you've given me that I'm now questioning you on. So, I ask again: did the department provide any advice to the government about how the mining or the mining and resources sector could be carved out or excluded from the single-interest multi-employer bargaining stream?

So, why did the government ignore the concerns of these industries?

Why did the government ignore the concerns of those industries when it was prepared to carve out the civil construction industry?

How can Geelong manufacturers be given certainty that they won't be placed in this situation and forced to close if required or compelled to bargain with the likes of Viva Energy in Geelong?

These laws are not in effect as yet, but if these laws are passed, as I assume they will be, and Geelong manufacturers are required and compelled under your laws—they are a manufacturer which employs more than 20 people. If they are required and compelled to bargain with Viva Energy—please provide this chamber with the advice as to how Geelong manufacturers can be given certainty that they won't be placed in this situation and be forced to close. The response that you gave before is totally inadequate and does not address my question. I would ask you to address my question.

In terms of a single interest test, if an employer does not want to bargain for a single interest multi-enterprise agreement there are factors the Fair Work Commission must be satisfied of before granting an authorisation, such as the majority of employees must want to bargain; if the business is in a franchise, the business is reasonably comparable with other businesses to be covered by the agreement and the employers have clearly identifiable common interests; and it is not contrary to the public interest. Again, that's a level of information for you. But I won't answer the hypothetical situation that you're putting to me.

These are real-life fears in the Geelong community about Geelong manufacturing.

We came into government in 2013 when Geelong was on its knees. Manufacturers had no confidence in the future. We worked extremely hard as a coalition to turn the economy around locally. Now we have a vibrant manufacturing sector, which is also working well together.

We are one of the most successful manufacturing regions in the country. The fact that you, under your laws, cannot provide Geelong manufacturers—or, in fact, any manufacturer around this country— with any guidance is a disgrace.

Right now, in the offices of the Geelong Manufacturing Council and in the offices of every manufacturer in Geelong and across Victoria, and, frankly, across this nation, there is deep fear. So, again, I ask you to address the question. And, if the answer is, 'This is a matter for the Fair Work Commission,' then that's fine, but please address the question.

                                                                                                                                                                                             </p>

                                                                                                                                                                                              It doesn't take long for them to get back on the scare campaign, because that's all they've got. They've learned absolutely zero from the last election campaign. If Geelong was going so well, how'd you get voted out? What happened there? If Geelong was going so well, how did you get voted out? Clearly they were not happy with you and clearly the local workers weren't happy with you and clearly the local manufacturing workers weren't happy with you as well.
                                                                                                                                                                                             </p>

That is what will be a focus.
                                                                                                                                                                                             </p>

I saw that Minister Husic put forward the legislation yesterday implementing our election policies. I am absolutely confident that the manufacturing sector in Australia will be very, very well supported by this government. We have big plans that we took to the election and we intend to deliver on them. And I'm sure the manufacturers of Geelong will be very excited by that.

You have indicated that you were aware that the mining and resources industry had provided representations to the government in relation to being carved out, you weren't aware if representations had been made by the manufacturing industry and you'd come back to me in relation to other industries.

Could I therefore ask that you bring back to the chamber the number of single-enterprise agreements in the construction, mining and resources, and manufacturing sectors so we can do that comparison to civil construction?

One of the amendments that was, I understand, negotiated with Senator Pocock—I think it was also the recommendation of the Labor members of the committee that looked into the bill—was increasing the employee headcount of businesses who will be excluded from multi-employer bargaining to 20. Can you confirm how the government came to this specific number?

My question was: was any assessment, consideration or modelling undertaken—given, in particular, all of the concerns that were raised in relation to the definition of 'small business' in this section—of increasing the headcount to 25 employees, 50 employees or 100 employees, or 125, 150, 175 or 200? If the answer is none, I can accept the answer as being none. But was there any assessment, consideration or modelling undertaken?

You have now gone to saying, if I understand you correctly, there is a difference, so they won't have the same powers and they'll have only the powers of the ABCC that the government believes are not excessive. I'm trying to explore. We were at the stage where you were confident there were no gaps, but now you're actually saying there are gaps. Can I get you to take me through, in particular in relation to gathering of evidence, what powers you believe are excessive, just so I can get a better understanding of that.

But an issue which has had no discussion, in the seven or nine hours of questioning that we've had so far, is from two sections in the bill, in relation to sexual harassment. Now, 53 per cent of Australian women will experience sexual harassment in their lives and it's an issue that really does deserve some discussion. How will this bill deal with this epidemic of sexual harassment? More than half of us are going to have the experience, including many in this workplace, and a third of Australians—men and women—in the last five years have had harassment experiences. So can we please hear a little bit about something that actually matters to most Australians?

I think it is an important aspect of this legislation. Stamping out workplace sexual harassment is central to achieving safe, productive and gender-equitable workplaces. That is what the government is committed to.

We will fix these issues. Firstly, we will broaden the scope of stop-sexual-harassment orders to make clear that the Fair Work Commission has the power to make orders preventing sexual harassment for all workers, including sole traders, employees of state governments, local government employees, workers in community organisations and workers in workplaces such as amateur sporting clubs. Examples of stop-sexual-harassment orders could include an order that individuals treat each other with respect or do not make contact with each other, or orders for companies to provide all staff with anti-sexual-harassment training or to arrange a health and safety inspector to attend meetings and parties. This is a key measure of how we can make workplaces safer.

Workers will have access to conciliation and arbitration by consent. Thirdly, our new provisions are broader in scope than the previous government's laws applying to conduct that occurs in connection with work and are consistent with protections in the

This means that protections will clearly apply to workplace sexual harassment that occurs outside of working hours or in employer provided accommodation, and to prospective workers as well.

Our changes will open a new pathway for people to get an outcome without having to go through the court system, which can be slow, costly and traumatic. That's a huge barrier for many workers, particularly those in lower-paid or insecure jobs. Our changes mean that every worker—whether they're a nurse in Tamworth, a plumber in Perth, or an office worker in Canberra—can ask the Fair Work Commission to deal quickly and effectively with their complaint of sexual harassment, whether the harassment occurred in the past, is ongoing or both. The new provisions also allow for the national workplace relations regulator, the

Is this an exhaustive list—in particular I am being asked by industries, 'Would we be an industry eligible to participate in the supported bargaining stream?'—and are there any other industries that may fall under this stream?

Can you confirm which industries the government intends will be eligible to participate in the supported bargaining stream? Again, I was noting, in looking at the revised explanatory memorandum at page 168, reference is made to aged care, disability care and early childhood education. Is this an exhaustive list, and are there other industries that may fall under this stream?

I'm just going to get page 168 of the revised explanatory memorandum. In the revised explanatory memorandum, you make the specific reference to aged care, disability care and early childhood education. But what you're saying is it's not an exhaustive list. I've got a number of industries coming to me and saying, 'Is this an exhaustive list?' It's not an exhaustive list. Can you give any further guidance than what you've just given to any other industries that may fall under this stream?

We've included a ministerial declaration for supported bargaining. This arose out of consultations that have occurred in relation to the bill. The purpose of the new power to make a declaration is to provide a final safeguard to ensure the supported bargaining stream is used in order to get wages in low-paid sectors moving. It is intended to provide some security so that we do not see a repeat of what occurred under the existing low-paid stream, where there were only four applications and no agreement ever made in reliance on low-paid authorisation.

The FWC would consider the prevailing pay and conditions in the relevant industry, whether employers have clearly identifiable common interests, and whether the number of bargaining representatives would be consistent with a manageable collective bargaining process. The supported bargaining stream is intended to be easier to access than the existing low-paid bargaining stream. The revised criteria for making a supported bargaining authorisation is intended to address the limited take-up of the low-paid bargaining process.

I thought my question was quite obvious. I just want to confirm this with you. We have the explanatory memorandum. It makes reference to certain industries that we've referred to. We've then established—and we're going to pursue it shortly—that the minister is able to make a declaration for another industry to be eligible to participate in the supported bargaining stream. All I'm asking is: is that the only avenue under which you can be declared eligible to participate—that is, via a ministerial declaration—or is there another avenue? We've talked about aged care, disability care and early childhood education and care. Is there another avenue through which you actually can participate in the supported bargaining stream?

So there are two ways. There is a ministerial declaration here—as I said, we're going to go through the ministerial declaration shortly—or, alternatively, I'm assuming you would make an application to the commission, 'Are we able to participate in supported bargaining?' and the commission would then determine whether you are an industry that is eligible to participate, based on the factors it needs to consider?

Or is it literally going to be left to the Fair Work Commission themselves to make the interpretation?

What is meant by 'whether the likely number of bargaining reps would be consistent with a manageable collective bargaining process'? Would it be the case that the Fair Work Commission could not approve an authorisation if it is unlikely that the number of parties involved—whether they're employer reps or union reps et cetera—would be able to reach agreement or otherwise act in an orderly way?

I'm just asking, though, what is meant by that? What's the guidance given in relation to that in terms of the change to the supported bargaining stream? Could you just confirm that an employer could be compelled to bargain for a supported bargaining agreement?

I just want to confirm that, because this has been raised by a number of people. We are saying that we have an employer eligible for both the supported bargaining stream and the single-interest stream. We acknowledge they can be compelled into either. You are saying though that you absolutely cannot be compelled to bargain in the supported bargaining steam and in the single interest stream at the same time. As I said, this has been asked by so many employers and it would give them comfort to know that that is the case. I want to know, are we formally ruling it out?

'May' being the operative word. My question was, is the chamber to take this to mean that if the Fair Work Commission is unsure there is a clearly identifiable common interest, so we don't know—so on that we're unable to determine whether or not there's a clearly identifiable common interest between the employers—and then the employers are not substantially funded directly or indirectly by the government, are you saying the Fair Work Commission should err on the side of not granting the authorisation? So we're not sure if there is a common interest. We do know that they are potentially not substantially funded, directly or indirectly, by the government. Is the guidance then that you should err on the side of not granting the authorisation? And is it the intent of government that the supported bargaining stream focus on funded sectors?

Given the answers to all the questions and in particular that there are changes that are happening to this particular stream, we can't give any further guidance other than what's already in the act in terms of the common interests. Ultimately, decisions are being left to the discretion of the Fair Work Commission. There is a focus on funded sectors, and we agree that's consistent with references in the revised explanatory memorandum and the government's own public statements about this stream being targeted at care sectors. We have established, though, that it's a focus and it's not exclusive. So, can you confirm that the supported bargaining stream is not directed at industries such as hospitality and retail?

We have also, as we did last night, confirmed that we can't give any further guidance in relation to the common interest, and what is involved in the common interest. It's either there already in the Fair Work Act or it is being left to a decision of the Fair Work Commission. Unfortunately it's the words 'not exclusive' that are going to pose a huge problem. So, again, can the minister confirm that the supported bargaining stream is not directed at industries such as hospitality and retail?

There are changes being made. It's not just a name change. Given that you don't think it's any different or very different, can you now take me through the changes that are being made in this legislation to the supported bargaining stream?

That was the failure of the previous government—that you had that part of the legislation in place but no-one was able to use it successfully. So, the focus, from our point of view, is removing that red tape to allow it to be used. And it's got a particular focus, from our point of view, on those feminised industries that a lot of us have talked about substantially last night and today and is a real focus of the bill. And we think that is required and will hopefully drive an improvement in wages.

And then I have a question as to whether the minister can confirm that the supported bargaining stream is not directed at industries such as hospitality and retail. You can't give that guidance because what we are actually saying is that it may well be, if certain factors are met, that the Fair Work Commission could make a determination that the hospitality and retail industries are actually eligible to participate in the supported bargaining stream.

We've just gone through a number of questions in relation to how you could potentially be deemed eligible to participate in the supported bargaining stream. One of the amendments that was moved last night was government amendment (40). The amendment gives the minister power, by legislative amendment, to declare an industry, occupation or sector eligible for the supported bargaining stream 'if the Minister is satisfied that doing so is consistent with the objects of this Division set out in section 241'. Could I just get you to confirm: what are the objects in section 241 of the act?

If there is already an enterprise agreement in place for the relevant employees or for employees within the same industry, occupation or sector, would this mean that the minister is less likely to make the declaration?

I'm just looking at the time in terms of actually moving through them, because I do also have a number of questions in relation to the regulatory impact statement and the costs in that that I would like to ask you. I will go very briefly to the agreement approval, before I go to the costs in the regulatory impact statement. On page 125 of the revised explanatory memorandum, it states that changes in the bill to enterprise agreement approval requirements are intended to simplify requirements that need to be met for an enterprise agreement to be approved by the Fair Work Commission, which are often regarded as overly prescriptive and complex. One such source of complexity relates to section 181 and the way it's traditionally been interpreted by the Fair Work Commission in relation to which casuals can vote for an agreement. I understand that the government has indicated to employer groups that the changes contained in the bill will mean that the Fair Work Commission will take a less prescriptive approach. Employer groups are asking if that is the indication, that there will be a less prescriptive approach.

That's fine. Can the minister confirm that if the Fair Work Commission continues to take a prescriptive approach—and, again, we are talking about the issue in relation to which casuals can vote for agreement, and I do appreciate the very clear evidence, which I thank you for—that the government has indicated to employer groups that the changes contained in the bill will mean that the Fair Work Commission will take a less prescriptive approach? I also understand your evidence in relation to 'Can the minister confirm the changes will mean that the Fair Work Commission won't fail to approve agreement because of confusion regarding whether a casual employee is entitled to vote on the agreement or not?' That is left to the discretion of the Fair Work Commission.

They've had the opportunity—it's not BHP. Certain employers in the mining and resources industry have had the opportunity to consider the evidence and the answers that were given to the questions that I asked last night. I have some questions in relation to government amendment (44), which was moved last night. They're in relation to more detail and definition. We didn't get to fully explore this last night, given we hit a hard marker.

We didn't actually get on to looking at what 'reasonably comparable' means. The government last night, at 6.26 pm, I think, tabled its amendments to the bill. The question is currently before the chair. Government amendment (44), which was moved last night, introduces the comparability test. For example, where two separate businesses in the mining industry operate different rostering schedules to create their own efficiencies which are fundamental to their operating models, is this enough for them to be considered not reasonably comparable?

The question I put to you was: where two separate businesses in the mining industry operate different rostering schedules to create their own efficiencies which are fundamental to their operating models—you can see where this is going, because this is very, very serious in terms of 'reasonably comparable'—is this enough for them to be not considered reasonably comparable? The answer you gave was that this amendment had been made as a result of representations from the mining and resources industry, but then you also said it is actually a matter for the Fair Work Commission. Given that this amendment has been put in as a result of the conversations you had with the mining and resources industry, they are the ones saying they are more confused than ever now as a result of this and they desperately need the guidance. In relation to the conversations and the representations, again, I ask you: what further guidance can we give in terms of 'reasonably comparable' or 'not reasonably comparable'? I was part of the talks. The minister's office and the department were part of the talks. We've got an amendment that's been inserted, but there's nothing around the amendment. Or could you take me to the explanatory memorandum and take me through the guidance in relation to 'reasonably comparable'?

The first is, of course, that the commission's required to consider all of the matters that it's required to consider, including a public interest requirement. The amendment would add a new subparagraph to paragraph 249(1)(b), which contains the factors of which the Fair Work Commission has to satisfy itself before making a single interest employer authorisation in relation to a proposed agreement. So the new subparagraph would require the commission to be satisfied that, in respect of each employer, it is a common interest employer and the operations and business activities of that employer are reasonably comparable with those of other employers that would be covered by the proposed agreement that relates to the single interest employer authorisation. So, employers of different size and scale might, depending on all the circumstances, be found to have clearly identifiable common interests for the purpose of bargaining together. The amendment would ensure that the Fair Work Commission must be also satisfied the operations and business activities of an employer are reasonably comparable with the other employers. It may be open to the commission to conclude that, despite two employers of a similar size, scope and scale operating in the same industry, they are not reasonably comparable. That is open to the commission, once the full extent of their business activities and operations are considered.

I have no issues with you there. But we seem to be a hamster on a wheel again, because the issue that we have is: what is the meaning of 'reasonably comparable'? I will give you another situation. Where specialist contractors are employed under a maintenance contract, these contractors have the same trades as employees in the host company but are specialised to fulfil specific roles—that is, for example, not labour hire. Could those specialist contractors be deemed reasonably comparable to employees in the host company under the legislation? The issue I have with the answer you gave—I agree; it's all set out in the act, but what I'm asking for is where is the additional guidance in relation to 'reasonably comparable'? Another example is two mining companies that compete at this level; they're all paying way above but we understand there is no carve out; the rostering system is different, but it's agreed and it suits those sites. Is that enough to actually have them as reasonably comparable, or does the difference mean they're not reasonably comparable? Ultimately, the words are there, but there doesn't appear to be any guidance given in relation to the words.

On this side, we place great confidence in the independence and the capacity of the Fair Work Commission. Over the last few decades, I think the historical record demonstrates that we treat that independence seriously. You'll find that, when Labor was in government the last two times, we took industry and the industrial relations community seriously. We took expertise and independence seriously. You'll find that people with great capacity from the trade union movement, from employer associations, from the community sector and from the legal fraternity were appointed by previous Labor governments, with an ethos of independence and a commitment to the public interest.

That has undermined industry's confidence in the independence of that institution. But on this side we put some faith in the capacity of the commission and its full bench to work through these issues in a sensible, pragmatic kind of way.

I think you actually do political diatribe better than Senator Watt. I really do. I prefer your approach to it. But it doesn't assist statutory interpretation. It'll just be no, no, no, no. So now we go back to the actual answer to the question. To assist those going forward in terms of statutory interpretation, I just need to take you through this. This is a substantial amendment. You've had to bring forward this amendment because of representations made to you by particular industries. The issue I'm having is: the chamber doesn't have the benefit of a definition in relation to what 'reasonably comparable' actually means. With all due respect, I'm not asking you about appointments to the Fair Work Commission. I'm not going to question whether or not someone has expertise. I'm asking you: what is the guidance the government is giving to the Fair Work Commission in relation to 'the operations and business activities of the employer are reasonably comparable'?

Occasionally you'll find that, when questions go to some of the aspects of the previous government's record in relation to the independence of the Fair Work Commission, I find it hard to resist pointing out the track record of politicisation of that institution. However, to your question: the amendment would also insert a new subsection—I think it's 249(1AA)—that would provide that, if an application for a single-interest employer authorisation is made by a bargaining representative under paragraph 248(1)(b), in respect of an employer that has 50 or more employees, it is presumed that the operations and business activities of the employer are reasonably comparable with those of the other employers that are covered by the agreement, unless the contrary is established.

Such evidence is likely to concern the nature and size of the employers and their operations and their business activities. While some of this information may be available, at least in part, to employees, particularly in smaller enterprises, much of it will only be known to the employer, or to employees only as it pertains to their role; that is, it may only be apparent to them in a partial or fragmentary way. This is particularly acute in terms of the nature of the employer's enterprise, the employer's business activities and operations. In most cases such information will be most readily available to employers or their bargaining representatives.

Who should bear the burden of establishing that the relevant test is met or not met? Having regard to the burden that could be posed in enterprises of 20 to 49 employees, it is appropriate in such cases to require employees and their bargaining representatives to establish that the relevant test is made when making the application for the authorisation.

In such circumstances it would also be much more difficult for employees and their representatives to provide sufficient evidence to establish that the test is met. It is appropriate, therefore, in the government's view, that the amendments provide for a rebuttable presumption and an opportunity for employers—that is, employers with 50 or more employees—to establish that the relevant test is not met in relation to their business. And for the kids upstairs listening to this, there will be a test at the end of the session!

In terms of the amendment that we're referring to, it does also state that if the employer that will be covered by the agreement employed 50 employees or more at the time that the application was made, it is presumed that the operations and business activities of the employer are reasonably comparable with those of other employers that are covered by the agreement, unless the contrary is proved. I believe that's what you were reading out.
