        My question is to the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator Carr. I refer to the minister’s answer yesterday when he asserted that it was ‘incorrect’ that Labor mate
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bracks" rel="nofollow">
         Steve Bracks
        </a>
        was to be appointed to head an inquiry into the automotive industries. In light of the minister’s own confirmation today that Mr Bracks will indeed head this inquiry, can the minister now confirm that he misled the Senate? As such, will he now apologise to the Senate?

         Yesterday, I indicated to the Senate that—and I will quote directly so that the senator who has asked this question might be clearer in his knowledge—‘We are about to announce the details of the review. We are about to announce the personnel associated with that review.’ It is quite clear that I did exactly that. This morning I announced the review. I announced the detail of the personnel of the review. I announced the terms of reference of the review. The review will be headed by

              Mr Bracks was the first Premier to appoint a minister for innovation, in 2002. We are lucky to get someone with the national and international experience of

              . This is a global industry. I am sorry if the senators opposite seem to be unaware of the significance of the automotive industry to the Australian people, to the Australian economy and to the Australian society. They seem to be concerned about one person’s job. I am concerned about the 60,000 Australians’ jobs that are on the line here. I am concerned that the opposition seem to have learnt so little about the significance of this industry. I am very concerned that Mr Bracks is being attacked in this way. Mr Bracks has worked tirelessly to attract foreign investment to Victoria. He is the sort of person that the opposition cannot stand, because he is the sort of person that can sort the wheat from the chaff.

Yesterday Senator Carr—in response to Senator Abetz, who put it to Senator Carr that Mr Bracks was to be appointed to head this inquiry—said that Senator Abetz was incorrect. Today Senator Carr is being asked a very serious question as to whether, in saying that, he was misleading the Senate. The question is not about Mr Bracks; the question is about whether Senator Carr misled the Senate yesterday, and I ask you to get him to answer the question.

Senator Carr was directly asked by Senator Ronaldson a question about the review he announced today and the personnel. He is answering that question. His answer is completely relevant. I would ask you to call to order senators when they stand when they have no point of order—other than to try to repeat the question or the supplementary question they are about to ask.

                    Order! Senator Carr, you are straying a long way from the original question. While I will allow a lot of latitude in answering the question, I ask you to remain relevant.

                     was paid $2,750 a day. In today’s dollars that is $3,280 a day. We are very fortunate that we are able to secure the services of Mr Bracks. We are very fortunate that we now have a government that does not work on the assumption that we can allow manufacturing to go onto automatic pilot. We are concerned to ensure the sustainability of this industry that 60,000 Australians rely upon. Our commitment is to ensure the sustainability of this industry. It is so unfortunate that the opposition has failed so dismally to understand these basic facts.

                      , I ask a supplementary question. I am just wondering whether former Premier Bracks was sorting the wheat from the chaff when he opposed the minister’s preselection. Why did the minister overrule his department’s advice to appoint the respected

                       The government indicated that it would establish a wide-ranging review. It was an election promise. It has been a longstanding commitment to ensure a thorough review, and it is a commitment that we have made on numerous occasions. There was no secret about our policy, and there was no secret about our commitment to this industry. The industry has welcomed the government’s response, which stands in such sharp contrast to the position of the opposition. They are essentially prepared to allow this industry to fade out of existence, because they failed to address the fundamental challenges that this society and this economy are dealing with. The Mitsubishi pullout just last week shows us why this review is needed. We did not start thinking about this last week—unlike the opposition. We have been considering these issues very carefully for a great deal of time.
