        , Senator Fifield. I refer to reports yesterday indicating the government will scrap its harsh cuts to families, pensioners and young jobseekers. Is the government planning to scrap its planned cut to family tax benefit part B families with children over the age of six and freeze family tax benefit payment rates for two years?

         Let me make clear to colleagues that the government remains committed to all of its social services budget measures. We are pleased, I might add, that the opposition has signalled support for savings measures around family tax benefit part A and family tax benefit part B. The opposition would be wise to get its facts straight rather than relying on newspaper reports.

             We on this side know that those opposite have an alternative. The alternative is to continue the trajectory, to continue the path of debt and deficit which they started when they were in government. I know colleagues have heard this number before but it warrants repeating—that is, the previous government had the nation on a path towards a gross debt of $667 billion. That is the plan and that remains the plan of those opposite.

                I thought I heard Senator Ketter say that the government was intending to scrap indexation. That is the first time I have heard anyone say that. The government, after the next election, will be changing the basis upon which the age pension is indexed but indexed it will remain and increase it shall continue to do. In fact, it was only on Friday that the age pension went up again as a result of indexation, which is good news.
               </p>

                The great lie of those opposite is that this government will—

                 I rise on a point of order: relevance. There was a very simple question and if the minister did not hear it, it was: is the government scrapping its plan to cut the indexation of the age pension? The minister is not being directly relevant to that question.

                   As I said in answer to the first question, the government remains committed to all of its social services budget measures. I thought I had made that clear. Let me make equally clear that the pension has increased and will continue to increase and will continue to be indexed. The lie put forward by those opposite that this government is seeking to cut the pension is wrong.

                    , I have a further supplementary question. Is the government scrapping its plan to penalise young job seekers?

                     This government is not seeking to penalise young job seekers. This government is endeavouring to make sure that younger Australians are either earning or learning. I would have thought that would be a policy objective that everyone in this place could embrace—that is, that, if a younger person is not earning then they should be studying and, if they are not studying, we want to see them in a position where they have a job. Every budget measure in relation to younger Australians that has been announced by the government has one objective in mind, and that is to do whatever we possibly can to help them into work.
