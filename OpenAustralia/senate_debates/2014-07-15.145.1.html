        I recently met members of the South Sudanese community living in Sydney. It was a most informative meeting. We discussed the challenges members of this community face and I heard of a range of practical measures that would make such a difference to their lives. Members of this community have largely arrived in this country since the mid-1990s through Australia's humanitarian program. Most have settled in Victoria and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        . The total number of South Sudanese living in New South Wales is approximately 6,000 with about 5,000 living in Sydney. According to the 2011 census, nearly half of all South Sudanese who made Sydney their home live in the Blacktown area. Other areas with a considerable number of South Sudanese include Parramatta, Holroyd, Penrith and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Liverpool Council
        </a>
        areas. I did find this a very valuable meeting because the people I met with had a range of suggestions on how the people living in these suburbs could benefit from a range of programs that are needed considering they have been in Australia a short time and they are still adapting to Australian life.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many of these people have experienced trauma prior to coming to Australia. The refugee experience South Sudanese have had before coming to Australia can be characterised as difficult and mostly under inhumane conditions. Life for them in

        can also be difficult and at times harsh. I was very disturbed to hear about the high levels of unemployment and the difficulties that they find getting work, and at times the racism that they encounter. Significantly, about 75 per cent have taken out Australian citizenship. According to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Immigration_and_Citizenship" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Immigration and Citizenship
        </a>
        , the unemployment rate among South Sudanese is 28.6 per cent. That compares to about 5.6 per cent among the Australian population. I found that a really alarming comparison. The unemployment rate among these people in Australia is much higher than the Australian average. This needs to be addressed.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the meeting I held with members of the South Sudanese community, I heard about the low participation rate in the workforce and the high unemployment rate that they face. Many have qualifications and skills gained prior to coming to Australia and have not been able to translate these qualifications and skills into meaningful employment because too often the Australian employment market just does not recognise them. Even after getting some qualifications here through
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
         TAFE
        </a>
        and university, many still find it difficult to gain employment.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was very disturbed to hear how common it is for South Sudanese to take jobs below their qualifications and skills. Many who obtain degrees here are forced to take factory jobs because they cannot find the jobs equivalent to their qualifications. The reason given by employers for not employing these university graduates is that they do not have Australian work experience. Some South Sudanese have identified racism as often being a factor in why they get job knock-backs.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian workplace is different from what South Sudanese might have experienced prior to coming to Australia. For example, things like using a computer or answering phone calls are skills that many South Sudanese do not have and they have not had the opportunity to develop them. The Australian workplace culture is not familiar to everyone. This may also mean that some South Sudanese do not quite understand the work culture and how to sell their skills to an employerâ€”for example, how to write up a curriculum vitae dealing with selection criteria and drafting a cover letter showcasing their skills, knowledge and work experience. This could be a challenge for many Australians let alone for people who have recently arrived in Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        I detail those aspects of going for a job because this is where assistance can be given to these people in quite an easy and straightforward way. The people I met from the South Sudanese community have some very practical ideas on how these problems that can lead to other complexities in our communities can be addressed. The South Sudanese community leaders I met with really did have a wealth of ideas to overcome the barriers. Some of the things that they suggested included providing job ready training tailored to the needs of the community members that covers computer skills, the use of the phone and how people relate in the Australian workplace. They also spelt out the need for writing skills, particularly how to prepare materials needed when one applies for a job. How to find referees is something that is also needed.
