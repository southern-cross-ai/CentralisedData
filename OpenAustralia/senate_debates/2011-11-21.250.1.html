          OHS
         </a>
         Regulations and First Stage Codes of Practice was prepared by Safe Work Australia. Safe Work Australia consists of representatives of the Commonwealth, state and territory governments as well as
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCI" rel="nofollow">

         .
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Consistent with the requirements of the Office of Best Practice Regulation, the Minister provided copies of the approved Regulation Impact Statement for the Model OHS Regulations and First Stage Codes of Practice to members of the Workplace Relations Minsters' Council (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WRMC" rel="nofollow">
          WRMC
         </a>
         ) on 13 September 2011.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         At 8.38am on 14 September 2011, Safe Work Australia provided its members with a copy of the approved Regulation Impact Statement. At 9.18am on the same day, the Minister issued a media release announcing the findings of the Regulation Impact Statement.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The approved Regulation Impact Statement (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIS" rel="nofollow">
          RIS
         </a>
         ) was attached to the media release on 15 September 2011 at 10.45am.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         As is the usual practice, the Office of Best Practice Regulation will publish a copy of the approved Regulation Impact Statement on its website once WRMC has made its decision. At this point, Safe Work Australia will also publish a copy on its website.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The approved Regulation Impact Statement is not a confidential document. If members of WRMC wish to provide copies of the Regulation Impact Statement to stakeholders, then that is a matter for them.
