        Purpose of the Bill
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill will:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Increase the managed investment trust (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT" rel="nofollow">

       <p class="italic">
        Reasons for Urgency
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This MIT measure increases withholding tax applicable to fund payments on or after 1 July 2012. In order for the new rate of 15 per cent to apply to fund payments, this bill will need to pass through the Parliament before 1 July 2012.

        Senator Collins to move:
