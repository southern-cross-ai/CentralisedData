         Thank you, Senator Brown, for this question. I can advise the Senate that the opposition spokesperson for human services confirmed that the coalition will be seeking to adopt the approach of the United Kingdom Tories in terms of its application to service delivery in Australia. I can also advise the Senate that I recently had the opportunity to discuss the implementation of the so-called
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Society" rel="nofollow">
          Big Society
         </a>
         with British ministers, shadow ministers and community organisations. I can indicate to the Senate that the overriding impression that I have been left with as a result of those conversations is that, when the Conservative government were elected in the United Kingdom in 2010, they promised to expand the role of volunteers and to empower citizens, but what in fact they have given has been budget cuts and privatisations.
        </p>
        <p>
         I understand how important the thinking of the British Tory party is to those opposite. They have always seen their guiding light as the high Toryism from London. What we have seen in the name of so-called strengthening of communities in the United Kingdom has been a 52 per cent cut to social housing development and a 25 per cent cut to community development. This approach undermines the various rhetorical claims that have been made about empowering citizens which, of course, we saw were a hallmark of Toryism in Britain. On this side of the chamber—

However, with respect, Mr President, in relation to the standing order that prohibits questions asking opinions, can I direct your attention to the fact that this question asks the opinion of a minister about the policies of the

            What I can say is that the Australian government is working with communities, particularly to strengthen those communities where there are very high levels of disadvantage. We have communities like Broadmeadows in Victoria and Bankstown in

               This has everything to do with this portfolio, the portfolio of Human Services, which is about the delivery of services to the public of this country. It is very much about the approach that is taken to undermining the levels of participation in our society in economic or in social terms. What we have seen in the United Kingdom with those that have followed this practice of so-called empowering of citizens through this policy of the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Society" rel="nofollow">
                Big Society
               </a>
               —a policy which is now being adopted in this country by those opposite—is that there has been a massive fraud. A massive fraud has been inflicted upon the people of the United Kingdom. What we have seen is the massive cutting of government programs, privatisations and, of course, the disempowerment of local communities. What we have seen is an approach which, of course, has meant that the architect of the Big Society,

               , who was in Australia just last year, has managed to persuade those opposite to follow this course of action.

                 What we have seen is that in states such as Queensland community groups have lost $368 million. Local councils have lost $60 million. Skills and training have lost $287 million. Of course, this is the approach that has been followed by conservative governments across Australia, drawing inspiration from the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Society" rel="nofollow">
                  Big Society
                 </a>
                 advocates in England. We note that, of course, in Queensland the conservatives are eager to go even further. Peter Costello's Commission of Audit have made it clear they want a focus upon the privatisation of essential services. So conservative parties in this country are using this rhetoric of the Big Society to actually attack community organisations, undermine the rights of citizens and undermine the levels of social engagement in this country. This is an excuse for the privatisation of services and budget cuts to services which we have seen—
