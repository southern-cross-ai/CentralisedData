        In the last parliament, the Senate Select Committee on Job Security, chaired by Senator Sheldon, heard from workers in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         Central Queensland
        </a>
        about the impact of labour hire in the mining industry. Rob had worked with one mining company for 14 years in a permanent role. He said that one day the company told the permanent workers that they would need to be moved onto a labour hire contract. Rob was told that he would be doing the same job but on a casual contract at half the pay. Chad from Rockhampton had been working in the coalmining industry as a labour hire worker for 10 years when he gave evidence to the committee. He said that, despite working the same rosters and the same shifts as the permanent workers in his crew, he was paid much less and had no job security. This is a common story I've heard as I've been travelling in Central Queensland and elsewhere in regional Queensland since being elected as a senator.

        and Nationals, when they were in government, let labour hire run rampant in industries like this across Queensland and across Australia. Despite hearing from Rob and Chad himself, Senator Canavan called the problem a 'Labor lie' in the interim report of the job security inquiry.

        Miners and their families in central Queensland know that this is their reality. Being stuck on an insecure contract with lower wages means these workers can't convince a bank to give them a home loan or a car loan. They can't go out of town or take time off work, because they're often on call and don't have any leave entitlements. That's why at the last election we made a commitment to enshrine same job, same pay into law and this week we have taken the next step to deliver on that commitment. Our bill will close the labour hire loophole that is keeping wages low and having a negative impact on families and communities. We know the opposition and their form. They see no problem with low wages and these insecure arrangements. The question will now be for those on the crossbench, particularly crossbench senators like those from

        . Are they going to stand up and support workers as the Albanese Labor government is committed to doing?
