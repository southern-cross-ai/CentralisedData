        Labor in Queensland are not building dams; they are tearing down dams. It has been 632 days since the farmers of the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Dam" rel="nofollow">

        out to sea and tearing down the dam wall. It has been 632 stressful days, 631 sleepless nights, and they are still waiting for Premier Palaszczuk to get out of her ivory tower and tell them the one simple thing that could put their minds at ease: when will she restore their dam? That's all she has to do. All we are asking Premier Palaszczuk to do is to tell the farmers of the Wide Bay-Burnett region that she will restore Paradise Dam. The destruction of this dam wall has meant a billion dollar hit to the economy of Wide Bay-Burnett. All they want is a simple rebuild of a dam. But, of course, we've got Labor in Queensland—Labor in Queensland who don't go around building dams; they're tearing down dams. We wanted to get Labor in Queensland to build Urannah Dam—but, oh, no, nothing there. Since 2003 there have been 20 dams built in Australia and 16 of those have been built in Tasmania. What have Labor done in Queensland? Nothing; shamefully nothing.

        This week the machinery began packing up and moving away from Paradise Dam. Next month the workers camp buildings will be removed. Whilst Sunwater have promised a dam improvement project will involve activities over a number of years, 'the timing is to be confirmed', which is the political equivalent of, 'I'll call you in the morning.' This is how the state Labor government treat the farmers of the Wide Bay-Burnett. Last month my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Drought and Emergency Management, David Littleproud, compared the Paradise Dam fiasco to an episode of the

        <i>

        </i>
        . But even that program, on its best day, could not dream up a debacle of this magnitude.

       <p>
        I would like to applaud the efforts of local farmers and business owners who have raised more than $1 million to fund a class action with the help of Tom Marland and Marland Law. I would encourage those who are listening to support this class action. But it should not have to come to this. People should not have to sue their own government to get answers and fair compensation for such a massive economic hit created by government incompetence.

        The very real and significant strain this has put on families throughout the region is serious. This should be beyond party politics. I would like to recognise OzHelp for their brilliant work in holding a mental health support and suicide prevention workshop in Bundaberg last month. I would like to also commend the efforts of Bundaberg fruit and vegetable growers, Marland Law, the state member for Burnett,

        , the state member for Callide, Colin Boyce, and the federal member for Hinkler, Keith Pitt, on their efforts to make the state Labor government see sense. Six hundred and thirty-two days is a long time to wait for an answer. Please, Premier Palaszczuk, do the right thing and rebuild Paradise Dam.
