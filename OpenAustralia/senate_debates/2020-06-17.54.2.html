        My question is to the Minister for Women, Senator Payne. Minister Sukkar justified providing stimulus for jobs in the male-dominated housing industry while providing none for jobs in female-dominated industries by saying:

       <p class="italic">
        Yes, it is dominated by men and in many cases those people will be supporting families …

              I am glad that Senator Pratt put that question again. As I understand it, Minister Sukkar is the Minister for Housing. Therefore I would expect him to talk about the housing and construction industry as it relates to his portfolio. I didn't hear his direct comments, but if Minister Sukkar is speaking about his portfolio that is what I would obviously expect him to do.

               CEDA
              </a>
              speech earlier this week, the Prime Minister was absolutely clear in saying:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              We know there is a disproportionate impact on women.
             </p>
             <p>
              He goes on to also speak about younger Australians, those with lower skills and a range of other people with challenges in the workforce:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              … which identify key parts of the labour force, key parts of the Australian community we need to focus on as we prepare and plan our way out and make our way out.

                    indices both tell us that the high-frequency spending data shows that that's being increasingly translated into increased retail sales. Those opposite mention work areas which have a high proportion of women working in them. That includes hospitality and retail, and we know that the good news for those women and young people who work in both of those areas, for example, is that they will be early benefiters from the reopening process.

                      Yesterday, the ABS released data showing that, since March, women lost payroll jobs at 1.3 times the rate of men. Modelling from the Bankwest Curtin Economics Centre found that the majority of the casuals excluded from JobKeeper are women, including more than 200,000 women in retail and fast food alone. Why did the government design a scheme that leaves women behind during Australia's first recession in 29 years?

                                      Prior to COVID-19, there were more women in the workforce in Australia than ever before. The gender pay gap had closed to its lowest level on record, at 13.9 per cent. When Labor was last in office, it was 17.4 per cent. Our ambition as a government is to return to those numbers and grow them and enhance them. That is the approach we will be taking. We absolutely know that we must draw upon every woman and every man in this country in the recovery process, to ensure the fastest possible economic and social recovery.
