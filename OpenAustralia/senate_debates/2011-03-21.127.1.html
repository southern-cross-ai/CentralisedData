        I note that the minister has tabled the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements Determination 2001 (Version 1.0). I also note that attached to that document is a Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements Guideline 12011.

        can take the minister to the differences between this and the 2007 document, so that it is placed on the record and that there is no ambiguity in how this would operate, is the minister in a position to indicate the key differences between this document and the 2007 document? Perhaps if I could get the minister, for the sake of time, to confirm if the key differences with this document are clauses 4.5, 4.6 and 5.13 which relate to the requirement for the states to have reasonably adequate access to capital in relation to insurance, and they need to look at, but are not limited to, mechanisms such as commercial insurance, reinsurance, any state

        reinsurance fund or pool and state department premium contributions—that is, internal state funds.
       </p>
       <p>
        Further, could the minister confirm that under 4.6 of the NDRRA the state must submit independent assessment of state insurance arrangements and that the Commonwealth will conduct a review of the state’s independent assessment in conjunction with the state? I want confirmation of that and some of the mechanics, which I will get to shortly.

         As Senator Xenophon has outlined, I can confirm that on page 8 of the document I have tabled 4.5 says, ‘State must have reasonably adequate capital or access to capital’ and a range of details are listed. Under 4.6 it says, ‘State must submit independent assessment of state insurance arrangements’. A number of subparagraphs flow from there to the middle of page 9. They are new. On page 10 under 5.13, it says, ‘Reduction in state of assistance’. That paragraph outlines the action taken if a state fails to take appropriate action within a reasonable time. They are new provisions.
        </p>
        <p>
         Before we move to the next part and the mechanism which Senator Xenophon has mentioned, I can acknowledge the senator’s positive contribution in seeking the inclusion of these provisions in the document. It is a consequence of his discussions and, indeed, insistence that these new provisions will be placed in the determination.

          I thank the minister for that. I refer to the insurance requirements guideline under the natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements 2011. Could the minister confirm that the manner in which the determinations are made by the Attorney-General will be in accordance with those guidelines and will involve a forensic look at the way the states go about seeking either insurance or reinsurance and also arrangements to ensure they have reasonably adequate capital to cover a natural disaster?

           Yes, that is correct. Any person reading the new provisions in this would come to the reasonable conclusion that it will be a rigorous method. You used the term ‘forensic’. If you look at the provisions outlined, it is indeed very rigorous.

            I want to acknowledge the work done by the Prime Minister’s office. There has been a lot of work in amending this document over the last few weeks. I am grateful to the Prime Minister’s office for some very robust discussions and negotiations in relation to this. I also acknowledge the advice from John Tsouroutis who is on my staff. He was former head of the Territory Insurance Office in the

            </a>
            who has provided me with invaluable advice in relation to this. The last time this document was amended was back in 2007. I would like to table a document I received from the Prime Minister—and I will seek the permission of the opposition to do this—which indicates this is a long-term change to the document. When is it proposed to review the new determination? I imagine there are processes that will take the next 12 months. It is a process that allows for the Auditor-General to be involved. Could the government indicate that they regard this as the determination that will stand for some time, given what has occurred with the Queensland floods and given the need to ensure that states and territories behave prudentially in relation to insuring or securing their assets?

             I can confirm that this is a new and updated document. It is the document that has standing in the context of disaster relief and recovery arrangements. There is no review period as such set down for this document. It will continue to have that standing with the amendments that we touched on earlier.

              I have just provided Senator Parry with a copy of the letter I received from the Prime Minister’s office in relation to this particular legislation. It is undated, but I believe it was received on 3 March. It says, ‘The government will ensure that the process set out in the attachment to this letter’—the process being the guidelines in identical format—‘will become a guideline to the NDRRA and that the provision will have a continuing application’. I seek leave to table that document which is a true copy of the original.
             </p>
             <p>
              Leave granted.
             </p>
             <p>
              I am grateful to the minister for tabling the document. I think that this deals satisfactorily with the concerns that I have raised about insurance arrangements with the states. I think there will now be a fundamental change in the way that the states need to consider the insurance of their assets. I have supported this levy, but I have done so on the basis that I believe that as a result of these new arrangements I cannot imagine circumstances in which a levy would be required again, given that there will now be a rigorous set of arrangements to ensure that the states do the right thing regarding their assets. This would generally involve some form of insurance or reinsurance, or taking other prudential steps, for their assets in the event of a natural disaster.

              <p>
               On behalf of the opposition, I thought I would put a few things on the record again. When we started this debate Senator Xenophon had not made up his mind yet about how he was going to approach this piece of legislation—I think the negotiations with the government were furiously ongoing—so I thought I would just go back to what this is all about.
              </p>
              <p>
               What we are dealing with here is yet another ad hoc Labor Party tax, which quite frankly should not be required. We are dealing with this tax because the government has fundamentally mismanaged our public finances. Any government that has its public finances under control should be able to fund the important reconstruction effort in Queensland, which we of course strongly support, without having to resort to an ad hoc tax introduced in this fashion.
              </p>
              <p>
               I draw the attention of the chamber again to the fact that we are having a budget in May. This particular tax is supposed to come into effect on 1 July 2011. The proper process to pursue the necessary Commonwealth funding contribution towards the reconstruction effort in Queensland would have been to assess all of the revenue and spending priorities in the budget and to reprioritise those spending commitments. The point has been made that our annual budget is about $350 billion. This increase in the income tax for all Australians earning more than $50,000, unless they are exempt, is supposed to raise $1.8 billion out of a budget of $350 billion. The point has been made that if you had $350 in your pocket and you had some spending commitments do you think you could find $2 in order to deal with an urgent priority? Any Australian knows that they would be able to do so.
              </p>
              <p>
               Why is the government bringing this tax on now? It is politics. They know that they can take advantage of people’s goodwill towards the people of Queensland, even though this is not going to do anything to rebuild any houses or anything—this is all about rebuilding the infrastructure for which the state Labor government in Queensland did not take out proper insurance.
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commonwealth" rel="nofollow">
                The Commonwealth
               </a>
               government wants all Australians earning more than $50,000 to pay more tax because their finances are out of control and they cannot reprioritise their spending to find $1.8 billion, and because the state Labor government in Queensland did not take precautions by taking out appropriate levels of insurance.
              </p>
              <p>
               What is becoming obvious is that only the Liberal and National parties will stand up for lower taxes in this parliament. Only the Liberal and National parties will be voting against this tax because we do not think this is the way to run the finances of the Commonwealth. In a $350 billion budget this government should have been able to reprioritise all of its wasteful and excessive spending in other areas to find $1.8 billion, particularly if you consider the $2.4 billion wasted on pink batts and all of the money wasted on school halls. With the money that is being wasted day-in and day-out by this government they cannot find $1.8 billion to help fund the necessary and important reconstruction effort in Queensland.
              </p>
              <p>
               We think it is quite disgraceful that it has come to this. We are very disappointed that Senator Xenophon has finally succumbed to the Prime Minister’s overtures on this. We think that this is a bad way to run fiscal policy in Australia. We think the proper way to run fiscal policy in Australia is through a proper budget process. Given the fact that this tax is not to come into effect until 1 July 2011, the more honest and more proper way to deal with this would have been through the budget process when the government should look through all of their spending commitments.
              </p>
              <p>
               Bear in mind that the expenditure for the Queensland reconstruction effort has not been properly quantified yet. It is said to be about $5.6 billion or thereabouts, but that did not include Cyclone Yasi. It is a rough estimate and it is likely to be more. When we asked the finance minister during recent estimates about what the government will do if the actual spending will have to be more than the initial estimate, she said, ‘We will just save some money.’ If you can save money then, why can you not save money now? That is a very important question.
              </p>
              <p>
               We are dealing with this tax because the Labor Party instinct is to go for a tax whenever they think they can politically get away with it. They want to whack it on because they know of people’s goodwill towards the people of Queensland and they think this is a tax they can politically get away with. They are bringing up all these cuddly names for it, such as ‘flood levy’ and ‘mateship tax’, but it is all politics. It is all about going ahead with this con at the expense of the Australian people. Every person across Australia earning more than $50,000 will have to pay the price for Labor’s mismanagement of our public finances.

                I have some questions that I want to ask that I flagged in my speech in the second reading debate. I am surprised to see that the Greens are not here because I indicated that I was particularly keen to get input from the Greens political party on this levy. As is always the case, when there is not a photo opportunity Senator Brown is never around. I am very impressed when Senator Brown rails against multinationals during debates on this tax and many other taxes that the Labor-Green alliance is proposing to introduce. I indicated in my speech on the second reading that I was going to ask some questions to the minister about this and I was hopeful that the Greens might have been able to participate as well.
               </p>
               <p>
                I also want to ask Senator Xenophon in the course of consideration, or ask the minister and perhaps Senator Xenophon can contribute, about this deal that Ms Gillard put to him that encouraged him to support this quite iniquitous tax. I will come to that question later, but the question I want to put to the minister at this stage is why is it that this tax, which he and the Greens have told us is so absolutely important for the recovery of my state of Queensland—and other states as well but principally Queensland—is being levied only on individuals? I do not have the figures in front of me, but I am sure the minister will so he will be able to tell me what percentage of the total tax revenue take do individuals pay, and what total contribution to the overall tax take do company, corporate and other tax revenues provide. We know the Greens’ penchant for attacking multinationals, those big companies that rip the profits out of Australia and take those profits overseas. We hear this from the Greens all the time.

                    No, the National Party is not like that—not when it comes to ‘ripping all this money out of Australia and sending the profits overseas’ and ‘Why aren’t they paying their fair share; we have to have a mining superprofits tax to make sure those corporate Bs pay their share.’ Why is it, Minister, that with this recovery of my state of Queensland, and of

                    with the fires, it is only individuals—read ‘small business men and women and wage earners—who are picking up the bill? With these great social engineers in the Labor Party and the Greens who do not want the poor people to pay, only the rich people, why are we having this tax only on individuals and not on those ‘big multinational money grabbing companies that send all Australia’s profits overseas’? Why is this happening in this way? I am seriously interested to hear the excuse from the minister. I would love to have heard Senator Brown try and bumble his way through an answer to that.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Senator Xenophon has very clearly and actively and aggressively pointed out that this tax is not all about rebuilding Queensland. Queensland will be rebuilt, I can assure you. It has been rebuilt after every cyclone that has hit that state in the last 150 years. After all the floods and the droughts we have had in Queensland in the last 150 years, Queensland has been rebuilt and it will be rebuilt again following the most recent floods and the cyclone. We need a levy because the Queensland state Labor government is so incompetent, so bereft of any financial management skills at all, that it is broke. Quite clearly, my state government is broke. How is it going to pay for this rebuilding? It picks up the phone to its Labor mates in Canberra and says it cannot afford to pay for it itself so let us have a levy. Queensland have not been sensible enough, like
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                     South Australia
                    </a>
                    and other states, to take out insurance. Do you know why they did not take out insurance? They could not afford the premium. I think Senator Xenophon, through the committee system, has shown—or did I read it in the paper?—that the premium is $50-$55 million. They could not afford it so they winged it, knowing that when things went bad their mates in the Labor Party in Canberra would come to their rescue.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    But their mates in the Labor Party in Canberra are not coming to the rescue out of the general revenue; they are going to impose a special levy—not on the money grabbing multinational companies that send all their profits overseas but on individuals, Australians, who cannot send their profits overseas even if they want to. If you are a decent government worried about social equity, wouldn’t you say to the Australian public, ‘Look, the progressive taxation system that has been so important in Australia over many years has got out of kilter a bit and the poor people are paying too much and the rich people are not paying enough.’ Wouldn’t you think you would say, ‘Let’s adjust the tax system, let’s make it more progressive.’ But, no, the Labor Party will not do that, because they are dishonest and they know there would be a voter backlash against them. So rather than doing the taxation reform that perhaps they think needs to be done, they approach it in a different way. If they did it out of general revenue, then the really big earners in Australia—those ‘money grabbing multinationals who send all of their profits overseas’—would have paid a fair bit towards the cost of rebuilding Queensland. Those people on $200 million or $300 million a year income would have paid a lot towards the cost had it come from general revenue, because we have this progressive taxation system. But, no, we are not doing that. We are introducing this special flood levy.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Again, as I pointed out in my speech on the second reading, we have a flood or a drought or a cyclone every year. Are we going to have a flood, drought or cyclone levy every year? This is why I have predicted, as I did in my speech on the second reading, that this flood levy will become a permanent part of the Australian taxation system while Labor is in power, because they simply cannot be trusted with money—they cannot manage money, they cannot manage taxation and that is why, when anything happens, they bung on a new tax.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    It is a long preamble to my question, but I want to get from the minister the understanding, the policy reason as to why only individuals are paying for the rebuilding of my state of Queensland—not companies, not the multinationals which are ripping the profits out of Australia and sending them overseas. Why are they getting a free ride when it comes to rebuilding my state, New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia? What is the policy rationale for doing that? Now do not get up and say, Minister, that you have a Medicare levy and that is how it works there, so this is how it will work here. This is supposed to be all about rebuilding my state and others after massive floods because my state government was too incompetent to have money aside to do it themselves.

                        Absolutely, Senator Cormann. Senator Cash raised the point about how the minister determines a class of individuals who will be exempt. Senator Xenophon might be interested in that. I made the quite ridiculous comment that perhaps the minister could exclude people who were members of the
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
                         Australian Labor Party
                        </a>
                        . Not for a moment do I think the minister would do that, but, as I read the legislation, he could. It will not help you, Senator Xenophon. You do not have a political party, so they cannot exclude the Xenophon independents from paying it but they could exclude the Australian Labor Party from doing it. This is legislation we are going to pass tonight. Would you believe that? The minister can determine a class of individuals for the purposes of subsection (2)—that is, paying a tax—if the minister is satisfied that the class was affected by a natural disaster which happened in Australia between July 2010 and 2012. I can tell you now that there are some members of the Australian Labor Party in the north and in Queensland who have been affected. Perhaps they could be excluded. As I say, not for a moment do I suggest that the minister would do that but there has to be some constraint on it. I will come back to that later. At this stage, my question to you, Minister, is—

                            and I was exempted from paying this tax. I and Senator McLucas know a lot of people who really did not want the $1,000. Do you know why they took it? Senator McLucas knows. Because they would not have to pay the tax then. That is true. Senator McLucas does know people. We both know the same people who took the $1,000—they donated it to charity—but they will not be subject to the tax any more. What sort of legislation is this?

                            read Senator Brown correctly, he is accusing those coal-mining companies of being a cause of the floods and the cyclones. Are they going to contribute any of their income to the recovery of Queensland? Why are they exempt? Why is it that these multinational companies, which are ripping billions of dollars out of the ground in Queensland and, according to Senator Brown, causing the floods and the cyclones—going to be let off scot-free, but in my home town my butcher and my baker will be paying this levy?

Why do Rio and BHP escape scot-free from rebuilding Queensland when my motor mechanic will have to contribute to the levy? I would be very interested, Minister, if you could set me right on the policy reason. Please tell me I have misread the bill.

                             In a long, rambling, contradictory and somewhat repetitive contribution from Senator Macdonald, there were two questions, which I will go to. He asked for the contribution of major taxes—it is in budget paper No. 1 as a percentage of Commonwealth tax revenue. In respect of personal income tax it is 45 per cent of total Commonwealth revenue, company tax 22 per cent,
                             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">

                             17 per cent. The second issue went to exemptions. We have restricted the scope of exemptions to those affected by disasters in the legislation in the form and manner which I read out in my concluding remarks to debate on the legislation. We published the draft determination on the Treasury website.

                                  Senator Macdonald asked a series of questions—in, as I said, a somewhat rambling and repetitive manner—about where the government had drawn its inspiration from for this levy approach. Senator Macdonald and I came into the Senate together in 1990. Senator Macdonald has been in this place for the same length of time I have, almost 21 years. He does not have the excuse that Senator Cormann has. Senator Cormann has not been in this parliament for too long and would not know some of the history behind levies.

                                 <p>
                                  If you want the truth, Senator Macdonald, we were inspired in our approach by none other than the former Liberal-National Party government of which you were a member. We were inspired by the Liberal-National Party government in our levy approach—you had six of them when you were in that government, Senator Macdonald. If we include the super surcharge, there were seven.

                                  I am showing my age, but in 1996 we had this promise: ‘No increase in taxes, no new taxes and no increase in existing taxes.’ And what were we presented with after the election? Senator Macdonald knows because he was here. We were presented with the super surcharge. Do you know how much this temporary levy or surcharge raised? It raised $1.48 billion. It was a temporary superannuation surcharge, but do you know how long it went on for? It lasted nine years. This temporary super surcharge lasted nine years. Senator Macdonald and quite a number of us know that because we received surcharge statements and we are still getting them. Do not come into this place and give us a lecture about levies when we have seen the impact of the super surcharge. Despite the election promise of those opposite that there would be no new taxes, that super surcharge went for nine years—well beyond when the budget went back into surplus.

                                  But there is more inspiration. There was the milk levy. It raised $1.74 billion thanks to the National Party. How long did the milk levy last? I do not think most Australians knew that they paid a milk levy. I think it was 11c. It went for nine years. Again, that is a far longer period than it took for the budget to go into surplus, Senator Macdonald. That was the milk levy. There was the sugar levy—the third levy under the previous Liberal-National Party government. It raised $86 million. That one went for three years. That was the third levy. Then there was the Ansett levy. That one went for about three or four years. How much did that raise? It raised $369 million.

                                    I will get to the issue of whether it was on individuals in a moment, Senator Macdonald. There was the gun buyback. The gun buyback was projected to raise $550 million and the
                                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
                                     East Timor

                                    levy was to raise $855 million. Let me read through these figures of the party that does not agree with levies or surcharges—$1.48 billion for super; milk, $1.74 billion; sugar, $86 million; Ansett levy, $369 million; and gun buyback, $550 million. This is from a party that says it does not agree with levies. But it is opposed to increases in taxes. That is where we drew our inspiration from, Senator Macdonald—none other than your government. When you were in government, you introduced six levies, not including the super surcharge.
                                   </p>
                                   <p>
                                    And then there was the piece de resistance—we even had a levy on shipping containers. That was the seventh. For the former Liberal-National Party government, the piece de resistance was putting a levy even on shipping containers. So if they were not whacking your super, your milk, your sugar, your airline flights, your guns or funding the East Timor dispute, there was a levy on shipping containers. That is seven levies over 12 years. That is where we got our inspiration from, Senator Macdonald—none other than yourself. You were a member of that government for almost 12 long years. So do not come in here and give us your hypocrisy about levies, Senator Macdonald. Stop wasting the Senate chamber’s time.

                                     I will not thank the minister for the answer after that gratuitous playing of the man and not the ball. It is always the way the Labor Party act—if they do not have an argument, they start attacking the man. Senator Sherry did not answer my question. I asked him for the policy rationale behind the rebuilding of Queensland being charged to individuals rather than multinational companies who are ripping profits out of Queensland and Australia and sending them overseas. That was the question, Senator Sherry. You did not answer that. I suspect you did not answer it because you do not have an answer for it. You chose to attack me and say that the coalition had levies. As I recall, the milk levy was on a bottle of milk. Is that right?

                                       The Ansett levy was on airfares, paid principally by those corporate multinational giants who fly all around the place. The shipping container levy was, I understand, on shipping containers—not on individuals.

                                       I will repeat my question, and do not bother giving me another tirade of ‘the Howard government had levies’. I seem to recall you opposed every single one of them, Senator Sherry, very volubly and aggressively. You have had a bit of a conversion on the way to the market, have you not? Do you not see a difference between putting a levy on containers paid for, perhaps, by those multinational companies and putting a levy on the incomes of individuals, or between putting a levy on the incomes of individuals but not on the incomes of multinational giants ripping off profits and taking them out of Australia and sending those profits overseas? I hasten to add, for Hansard and for the thousands of people who I know will be reading this and following it online, that I am not attacking the multinationals for making profits and paying shareholders. But that is the line you get from the Labor Party Left and from the Greens.

                                       So I will repeat my question, Minister, and hope that you might give me an answer. I am not after the policy rationale for levies; I am after the policy rationale for why in this instance you would charge individuals—that is small business men and wage earners—with the cost of rebuilding Queensland because the Queensland state Labor government was too incompetent to manage its finances to do it itself, the same as every other state does. Why is the levy on individuals and not on the large multinational companies? I will repeat it for you, Minister, in case you have forgotten, as you seem to have missed the question last time. If you took it out of general revenue then the really wealthy in the community would pay more because of our progressive taxation system, and the big multinational companies and the big mining companies, which Senator Brown said are the cause of the floods and the cyclones, would be paying. But under this legislation supported by you and the Greens, those big multinationals, who caused, according to Senator Brown, the cyclone and the floods, are getting away scot-free. Can you please explain the policy rationale? Do not give me a tirade of: ‘The Howard government did it. We opposed it but because you did it and got it through we are going to do it here.’ Tell me what the policy rationale is for individuals—the butcher, the baker, my motor mechanic—having to pay this levy while Coles, Woolworths and the multinational mining companies do not have to make a contribution to the rebuilding of Queensland.

                                        The levy is progressive based on income, as I outlined and defined in my concluding remarks in the second reading debate. It is fair and equitable, Senator Macdonald. That is why we based it that way, and that was the same approach in respect to the gun buyback and the

No member of the government that I am aware of suggested in their remarks anything other than the approach that is reflected in this legislation and has been outlined. It is not the intention, and it does not happen in this legislation, to take the Greens’ approach with a base for the levy.

                                         Minister, you still have not answered my question. Again, you are saying that because we did it for the guns buyback then it is okay to do it here. Let me take you through this. This levy is to rebuild Queensland and other states because of the floods. If you accept that the levy is a reasonable thing to do, rather than expecting the state to do it as every other state is required to do, the Australian public as a whole should contribute to rebuilding Queensland. Why, Minister, is it that individuals have to pay for this recovery yet major multinationals do not have to? Coalmining companies,

Your legislation imposes this obligation on individuals—the butcher, the baker, my motor mechanic. What was the policy rationale that said: ‘Okay, Coles, Woolworths,

                                           do not have to contribute to the recovery of Queensland’? That is the real issue. This is why I have been opposed to the levy and this is why many on my side are opposed to it. That is what I am asking you. Please do not say: ‘Well, the Howard government put in a levy so we’re having a levy and it’s only on individuals because that’s what the Howard government did.’ That was perhaps so with shipping containers and Ansett as well, but I am not asking about that. I am asking: why in the rebuilding of Queensland are individuals having to fork out but Coles and Woolworths are not? My baker and my butcher have to pay but Coles and Woolworths, who compete with them, do not have to pay. Rio and BHP get away scot-free but the excavating contractor down the end of my street has to pay. Can you explain for me why individuals should rebuild Queensland and not the big income earners in our country?

                                                Perhaps you could contribute then, Senator McLucas. Ask individuals in Cairns when you are up there why they should contribute but—I was going to say, ‘the big companies in Cairns do not have to’, but you have got rid of all of those with your Labor government legislation. There are not too many big businesses left in Cairns, I regret to say. You do have a Woolworths, you do have a Coles and I think some of the big mining companies have offices in Cairns. Why aren’t they contributing, Senator McLucas? If Senator Sherry cannot answer this perhaps you can get up and assist him.

                                                  Okay, I will seek your protection, Madam Chair. Thank you very much. Senator Sherry seems incapable or in the typical Labor way just does not want to answer the difficult questions. Senator Xenophon referred earlier to a letter he said he had from Ms Gillard. He clearly knew what it was about and Ms Gillard and her minions here on the government benches and the Greens will know what that was about. I was wondering if Senator Xenophon could explain to the Senate the import of that assurance from the Prime Minister. What was in that assurance that assuaged Senator Xenophon’s very genuine concerns about the lack of insurance taken out by the state government in Queensland?

                                                   There is no great secret to this. On 3 March, when agreement was reached between the government and me in relation to the whole issue of Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements, I put out a media release. I attached to the media release a copy of the letter from the Prime Minister and also the new guidelines to the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements which are attached to the determination 2011, version 1. I can indicate there has been complete openness and transparency in that process.

                                                   Essentially the determination itself has been amended. I understand the Attorney-General will also table it tomorrow in the other place. It requires a number of things. Firstly, a state must have reasonably adequate capital or access to capital. That can be done through a number of measures including but not limited to the following mechanisms: commercial insurance or reinsurance or any state

                                                   reinsurance fund or pool and state department contributions—that is, internal state funds. We know, given the questions of Senator Macdonald, the issue here is one of the Commonwealth having to bear 75 per cent of the brunt of any natural disasters under the arrangements that were in place from 2007 until now, arrangements that were largely in place for a number of years under both this government and the previous Howard government. The state must submit an independent assessment of state insurance arrangements and that includes having state Auditor-Generals being involved, for example, so the states need to tell the Commonwealth what they are doing in relation to insurance. The states must publish the outcome of any independent assessment, which in turn is assessed independently by the Commonwealth, and the

                                                   has a role in that. I will refer to that process as well.

                                                   The first independent assessment must be published and provided to the Attorney-General’s Department by 30 September 2011, with further assessments required no greater than every three years. If there is any significant change in the insurance arrangements of a state, including any reduction of the policy limit purchased, then there will need to be a review of that state’s independent assessment in conjunction with the state. The review will be guided by principles including: that the state has a responsibility to put in place insurance arrangements which are cost-effective for both the state and the Commonwealth for the financial exposure borne by taxpayers at both levels of government; that the onus is on the state to explore a range of insurance options in the marketplace and assess available options on a cost-benefit basis; and that, in the event as a result of that review the Attorney-General makes a determination, which must be published and transparent, and the state fails to follow that recommendation, the amount that a state would be reimbursed under this determination will be reduced in accordance with these principles. In other words, the rate of assistance will need to be reduced if the states fail to take prudential steps in relation to that.

                                                   In terms of the mechanism and how it will work there is a 15 paragraph document which relates to the guidelines which sets that out. It would involve a whole range of steps and safeguards including using the Attorney-General and the Department of Finance and Deregulation and ‘utilising such external actuarial expertise required in order to ensure a full and rigorous assessment.’ In other words, it is anticipated that there will be some external expert advice. Each review will include an examination of matters such as the following: the nature of any insurance or reinsurance sought and offered, the amounts of any premiums and excesses, the events and extent of assets covered, the amount covered per event, the maximum possible loss, the reinstatement terms, and the claims experienced in any related matters. It is very comprehensive. The document does have in it any insurance sought and offered because if a state or territory wants to be disingenuous and to say, ‘We got this premium offer which is totally unrealistic,’ it depends what they sought.
                                                  </p>

                                                   For instance, if Senator Macdonald wants to insure his home and insure every nook and cranny and wants full replacement value for every item in that home, replacing items such as antiques—I do not know what he has in his home; I have not been there—he can load the dice so that he will get an extraordinarily high premium if he is seeking an unrealistic term of insurance. There needs to be a question of reasonableness, because I think some of the statements made by the Queensland government have been quite extraordinary where it is saying, ‘It’s going to cost us billions to insure the state’s assets.’ That is patently absurd, from the discussions I have had with those in the insurance industry. I am very sad that the Queensland Treasurer has resorted to personal abuse in relation to my position.

                                                     I think it is unfortunate that that is the approach. Senator Macdonald needs to know that the Commonwealth government will ask the Commonwealth Auditor-General to periodically conduct audits at intervals no greater than three years to assess the adequacy of the Australian government’s responsibilities under the NDRRA, including determining whether the processes are appropriately transparent and whether there is best practice in determining when material is commercial-in-confidence. I really am grateful for the hard work of the advisers in the Prime Minister’s office. I am sure they got pretty sick of me towards the end of the process, maybe earlier in the process. They diligently and in good faith conducted this process with the aim of having a good outcome. That was my primary concern. If there is going to be a flood levy, I want it to be the last flood levy we have.

                                                     No longer can states hide behind the previous arrangements which were that the Commonwealth will always pick up the bill to the tune of 75 per cent. There has been a huge moral hazard here and that moral hazard has been quite apparent as a result of these terrible natural disasters in Queensland. I find the attitude of the Queensland government to be quite extraordinary. But this is a fair, robust and transparent process. It requires a review to be published within 90 days of receipt by the

There are some tremendous transparency mechanisms here, and I think this is a very good piece of public policy.

                                                     This is not a criticism of the coalition but, back in 2007, a decision was made by the Commonwealth not to self-insure their assets. I wonder whether these new criteria, while not directly applying to the Commonwealth, will set a new benchmark in how we determine these issues—although, to be fair to the Commonwealth, the assets that the Commonwealth has in terms of roads and infrastructure are much, much less than what states and territories have. So I hope this has answered Senator Macdonald’s concerns in relation to the document, but that was my key concern. I am looking at the big policy picture. The reason why we are having this debate and why we are having this levy in the first place is, I think, because the Queensland government decided, quite foolishly, not to take out insurance on its assets. I would like to think this will stand Australian taxpayers in good stead for a number of years. The transparency mechanisms are quite extraordinary. Again, I think this is the result of negotiations with the Prime Minister’s office which were hard, but which were conducted in good faith.

                                                      I do thank Senator Xenophon for perhaps the most useful answer that has been given in any debate in a committee stage in this chamber for a couple of years. He actually answered the question and knew what he was talking about. His answer did raise one issue, which I will ask the minister, but assuming the minister will not answer perhaps Senator Xenophon might take up the question for me. Perhaps you did explain this, Senator Xenophon, and perhaps I missed it. How can we be sure that this arrangement, which you have just explained very clearly, will be put in place? We on this side have a bit of hesitation in accepting promises made by the current Prime Minister, and I think most Australians will, too, after the ‘no carbon tax in any government I lead’ issue—but I do not want to go into that. What are the mechanisms that make Senator Xenophon confident that this arrangement—which he has almost single-handedly, I might say, arranged with the current government—will be put into effect?

He ran the Territory Insurance Office from 2003-08 and did so very successfully. Both sides of politics were quite praiseworthy of his expertise in turning that organisation around. He has some great experience in this sort of insurance. I did get advice from a number of people. I am also grateful to those individuals who risked their jobs, who risked their careers, by providing me with information that I thought was quite telling in terms of the Queensland government’s conduct.

                                                       This determination is a unilateral determination by the federal government because the federal government pays the bills. So it is not a question of it having to be signed off by

It is unilateral in its nature because it is the Commonwealth that provides the funding under this relief recovery arrangement. Obviously there has been consultation with the states but this is a document that does not require any of the states or territories to tick off on it. The document is very explicit in its timetabling and in its structure that the states need to undertake an independent and appropriate assessment of their insurance arrangements. It anticipates that it could be a state Auditor-General—it does not have to be—but they need to publish the outcome of such assessments. They need to do so by 30 September 2011. They need to do so every three years but the first one will be given to the Commonwealth.

                                                       The states need to say how they look after their assets, whether it is a case of commercial insurance reinsurance, any reinsurance fund or pool—and that is something that I would like COAG to look at, because that would create enormous economies of scale—or internal state funds.

I appreciate the answer that you have given so far, Senator Xenophon, but is this going to be legislated? Is it going to be a regulation? Has it already been done? Perhaps I missed it. If so, has it been done in a way such that a government can say, ‘Yeah, we’re going to do this’ one week and then say the next week, ‘Look, things have changed and we’ve had to form a coalition government with the Greens and so we’ve had a change of heart—sorry about that, Senator Xenophon’? That was really my question. What assurance have you got that this arrangement that you are talking about will actually happen? Is it going to be legislated?

The position is this: I considered that, but I did not think that it was necessary to incorporate it as a piece of legislation given that this government and previous governments have worked on the NDRRA by determination for a number of years—for many years.

If those were to change, they would be the subject of appropriate scrutiny through this parliament. I am satisfied with the arrangements because I think that the Commonwealth knows that these arrangements protect Commonwealth taxpayers in a reasonable and prudential way. It is a quantum leap forward in terms of transparency and accountability arrangements and requiring states and territories to do the right thing when it comes to insurance arrangements. So I am satisfied.
                                                                       </p>

The parliament will change in six months time. For the government to capriciously change them would carry with it some considerable risks for the government. They know that. But the government has done the right thing in terms of making a significant improvement in the arrangements to deal with natural disasters and relief and recovery arrangements. Even if this were set in legislation, you cannot bind a parliament; one parliament cannot bind another. I have simply taken the approach that these determinations have been dealt with previously in this way. I was happy for that to continue. I accept in good faith that we have some pretty good changes here. I expect that those changes will be with us for some considerable time—at least until there is a review by the Auditor-General in three years time. If the Auditor-General makes recommendations to improve or alter the arrangements then, that can be the subject of further scrutiny and debate at that time.

We thought that she actually meant it. Here we are a couple of months later and she did not mean it. You have answered my question, Senator Xenophon; I am not going to argue with you further on that. Remember the old Keating thing, the l-a-w law tax cuts back in the 1993 election? Senator Sherry raised this point—he was there then—I think that he was probably part of the government that legislated for these l-a-w law tax cuts. They had the election, won the election on that, and immediately got rid of it with the help of the Democrats, as I recall—the other left wing party that used to be here.
                                                                        </p>

If it were legislated, you could be more assured. Perhaps you do not want to answer this; perhaps you would only repeat what you have already said. But you are accepting the word of a government that has proved that you cannot accept their word that they will do this, that they will issue these determinations, that the Attorney-General will do this. I am sure that when they made the arrangements with you they probably believed that they would. But perhaps the Greens will come along and say, ‘We do not want you to do that for X, Y and Z reasons,’ and the Prime Minister will get up and ring her hands and say: ‘Oh, things have changed since I promised Senator Xenophon that we would do this.

If this arrangement had been in place, say, a year ago, could Senator Xenophon indicate in rough figures—not using exact figures because I appreciate he would not have them here—from his, I know, very diligent research into this whole issue, what the case would have been then—what it might have cost the Queensland government to insure and what they might have got back from the Commonwealth under the

I am satisfied that the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth will implement the terms of this agreement, as the minister responsible for that. I am satisfied that it is something that will have bipartisan support because it actually protects taxpayers’ funds in a way that is quite reasonable and robust and because there are transparency mechanisms in it.

I do not expect that to happen.

Every word in those guidelines in the new determination has been carefully weighted to ensure that Commonwealth taxpayers’ funds are protected, but in a way that is reasonable also to the states, as long as the states take reasonably diligent steps.
                                                                           </p>

I would be very interested to see what offers for insurance were made, because I think that they will vindicate the concerns that Senator Macdonald and I and others have had about the arrangements or lack of arrangements of the government of Queensland, which goes to the latter questions that Senator Macdonald asked.
                                                                           </p>
                                                                           <p>
                                                                            My understanding is that the government of Queensland was offered insurance back in 2000, and in more recent times, with a premium in the order of $50 million. It would have been multibillion dollar coverage that would have included roads. The extent of the loss to taxpayers, had some appropriate arrangements been in place, would depend on the sort of excess that applied. The advice I have had from within the insurance industry is that, with these sorts of claims, you may have a fairly large excess per event. It might be $50 million, $100 million or a larger amount than that. The fact is that, instead of there being a total bill of something like $5.8 billion in total, the bill would be in the hundreds of millions rather than in the billions of dollars for those sorts of insurable events. I have no doubt that, if prudential arrangements had been put in place, the cost to Queensland taxpayers and, in particular, to Commonwealth taxpayers would be billions of dollars less. States and territories will not be able to hide behind what they are doing now and use glib excuses for why they have not taken out insurance, because they will now be subject to mechanisms that are very transparent and robust.

Where is he going to specify that he is satisfied that that class was affected by a natural disaster that happened in Australia between the nominated dates?

How typical is this of the Labor Party! This government is only in power because of this new paradigm of ‘openness and accountability’.

I am particularly grateful to Senator Xenophon, who has at least put some legitimacy and truth into the debate by answering questions and explaining the legislation that we are going to vote on.
                                                                              </p>

                                                                               I am distressed that this legislation is going to become law very shortly. I cannot believe that only certain people are going to have to pay this additional tax. It has never before happened with a disaster in the history of the Commonwealth, yet people I know are going to have to pay this tax because of a bit of political mateship between the state Labor government in Queensland and the federal government. I cannot believe that people in Australia understand what this flood levy is all about. It is not going to be the case, as the Labor Party have been trying to pretend to people in Queensland, that this legislation is all about fixing their houses, replacing their furniture and helping rebuild the businesses of individuals. That is what people in Queensland have been led by the Labor Party to believe this flood levy is all about. It is anything but that. It is all about giving some taxpayers’ money to the Queensland state Labor government, a government that is so financially inept that it is broke and could not attend to recovery after a normal natural disaster.
                                                                              </p>
                                                                              <p>
                                                                               We have had natural disasters in Queensland, I am sure, since time immemorial, certainly since recorded European times. We have never had a special tax levy for work which governments must understand they will have to do every year. Good heavens, if you listen to the Greens and the Left of the Labor Party you will know that cyclones are increasing in their occurrence, that floods are going to get greater, that droughts are going to get greater, that erosion and tidal inundation are going to get greater. Why would you not think the Queensland government would have understood this and put aside a bit of money for a rainy day, the same as Queensland governments have done for the last 150 years since Queensland became a state? They have always paid for this out of the general revenue of the Queensland government. Suddenly, for the first time in European recorded history, we are having a special tax on all Australians because the Queensland government cannot rebuild Queensland. I just cannot believe that this parliament has been conned, if I might say, into voting for this particular piece of legislation. It is a disgrace. It is a scandal.
                                                                              </p>

They have led you to believe that the coalition, by intending to vote against this, is being nasty to individuals by not fixing their houses and their businesses. Nothing could be further from the truth. Not one cent of this flood levy will go to individuals. It will go to the Queensland government to build roads and bridges and to build cyclone shelters that the Queensland government should have been building.
                                                                              </p>
                                                                              <p>

I do not even bring the Greens into the equation—with such policy hypocrisy you do not even try to debate with them. But I must say I am distressed that the Independents are going along and slugging individuals—not all taxpayers, just a group of individuals—with this tax, with the money not going to householders and business people but going to the Queensland government. I am very concerned about this.
                                                                              </p>
                                                                              <p>
                                                                               There are issues in this legislation—one is the specifying of a class of individuals—put forward by a government led by a leader who simply cannot tell the truth. This is the leader that promised hand on heart that there would be no carbon tax under a government she led—and we are giving that sort of ministry the ability to specify a class of individuals that will be exempted from this tax. I have asked the minister at the table to explain this, to put the parameters around it, to say how this is going to be dealt with—no answer, no accountability. This is simply another one of the Labor Party’s taxation arrangements to help a broke state Labor government in Queensland and to help a federal government that is increasingly showing its incompetence in financial management. But it is not too late. I say to the Independents: why is it that only individuals pay this? Surely that must be a question in the minds of the Independents. What is the policy rationale? I gave the minister two opportunities to convince us that there was some genuine policy rationale in only taxing a certain group of individuals, but he chose to attack the messenger.
                                                                              </p>

Why do my butcher and baker, as I keep on saying, have to pay for the road works and bridge works in Queensland when these major multinational companies are getting away scot-free? Do not ever let me hear the Labor Party or the Greens pretend that they are interested in individual Australians and lower income Australians when they are letting the most profitable people in our country off absolutely scot-free.
                                                                              </p>

Why is not their 55 per cent going into rebuilding Queensland? Why is it only the 45 per cent contributed by individual Australians that is being taxed on this particular issue? If someone could give me a rationale for that I would sit down and walk out of here happily. Senator Xenophon is still here; perhaps you could tell me why you would tax individuals and let the big companies off scot-free. It just does not make sense. If someone could please explain to me why that is good policy I would leave the chamber disappointed that the bill went through but at least satisfied that there had been some policy rationale for it.
                                                                              </p>

I just hope that the people of Australia who are all paying this levy will one day work out that they have been absolutely dudded yet again by the Gillard-Brown government. Individuals are paying for public works in Queensland whilst others get off scot-free. There are certain groups of individuals not yet identified who will not have to pay the flood levy and, gee, that must fill the chamber with horror. We are leaving it to this government, with a great track record for honesty and accountability and truthfulness, to determine which group of people are going to be slugged and which group of people are not going to be slugged. I just cannot believe that I am seeing this happen in the parliament of Australia. But I and my colleagues on this side have done perhaps all we possibly can do to alert the people of Australia to them being dudded yet again by this government. This will not be a temporary levy; it will continue because we will have a flood next year, we will have a cyclone next year, we will have a fire next year, we will have a drought next year. Having got this through this chamber, there is the precedent—‘Look, back in 2011 you agreed to this levy. Here comes another flood, so let’s have another levy.’
                                                                              </p>

                                                                               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Senate" rel="nofollow">

I do despair. I hope against hope that when the final vote comes in the third reading perhaps a majority of this chamber will say, ‘No, this is just not good enough.’ If you need a flood levy, if you do need to get Queensland rebuilt, then let us get all taxpayers to do it—the big taxpayers, the 55 per cent who contribute to taxes in Australia. Let us get them to contribute, not just leave it to a couple of individuals.

My understanding is, very quickly, that it is administratively simpler to do it this way in the context of rather than dealing with corporations you have a greater degree of certainty as to the amount of levy that you will collect, and there are thresholds of income between $50,000 and $100,000. Below $50,000 no levy is payable and the levy rate changes at $100,000 and above, so there are some equity considerations in relation to that. But that was not the main reason why I got up to respond.

A number of my constituents raised issues on two aspects: one was the Stockport floods that occurred at the end of last year when a community in the mid-north of

Madam Chair, I think you have received some further information on this. I have received similar information from Treasury and from the government. That satisfies me.
                                                                                     </p>

I know this may pain Senator Macdonald, but Senator Milne from the Greens is at one with Senator Macdonald when it comes to—he’s wincing!—

In fact she moved a motion in this place, which was passed, expressing those concerns.

So, if any precedent has been set, I think it is a precedent that it is going to be very difficult to argue that we should ever have another flood levy like this once these arrangements are in place. That is why I support this legislation. I think that there is going to be a good long-term policy outcome when it comes to the states and territories insuring their assets.

My second observation will be in response to some of the remarks made by Senator Xenophon, but firstly I want to talk about the arrogance of this government and the arrogance of this minister in not being prepared to answer legitimate questions put to him by a senator representing the state of Queensland, the state that this tax hike is supposed to be for. These are legitimate questions being put by Senator Macdonald, a senator representing the state of Queensland, and the minister just sits there, refuses to get up and refuses to provide answers to the questions that are being put to him.
                                                                                          </p>

                                                                                           It is always easy to whack another tax on people right across Australia. Every Australian earning more than $50,000 will be asked to pay this tax—an increase in their income tax. Whatever cuddly name you want to give it, Minister, this is an increase in the income tax rates of all Australians earning more than $50,000, and it will no doubt get through this chamber with the support of Senator Xenophon. Minister, I urge you to just reflect on your attitude in this chamber in not answering legitimate questions that are being put to you by a senator representing the state that this tax is supposed to help fund the reconstruction effort for.

Senator Xenophon put it in these words: that he had been told that it was administratively—

I find the proposition that we impose a new tax on all Australians earning more than $50,000—just because it is administratively convenient to whack every Australian earning more than $50,000—to be quite a bad way for us to go.

This is money the government should be able to find by reprioritising its excessive and wasteful spending across this budget. This tax is supposed to come into effect on 1 July 2011. That is after the next budget. We will have a budget in May, when this issue—the funding required for the reconstruction effort—can be dealt with. There is absolutely no need to deal with this now. The reason we are dealing with this now is that the Prime Minister,

She knows that tax hikes like this are unpopular, so she always is on the lookout for a political strategy to get away with a tax. She is always focused on the spin and the politics rather than on what is good public policy.
                                                                                            </p>

It is not good public policy to set up a tax, supposedly for a one-year period, to raise $1.8 billion when, quite frankly, there would be an opportunity in less than two months to reprioritise our spending commitments in the context of the revised revenue estimates that will be before us at that point of time.

Of course, the thing that he had to bargain with was his vote. If he did not bargain with his vote, then Senator Xenophon would not be able to force the Labor government in Canberra to force their mates in Queensland to do the right thing in the future. He has done that, and I understand where he is coming from, but the outcome is still an increase in the income tax for all Australians earning more than $50,000, unless they are in one of the exempted areas.

Initially, all people who were impacted by a natural disaster that was a flood event were to be exempted. I asked questions about this in Senate estimates. Senator Macdonald, I am sure you would be quite interested in this. I asked: ‘What about the people in Kelmscott who were impacted by the bushfires?’ The secretary of Finance and, later, officials from Treasury told us: ‘No. People who are impacted by bushfires are not going to be exempt. They will have to pay the tax, because only those that were subject to a natural disaster that is a flood event will be exempt from this.’

It is a natural disaster that is not a flood event but a bushfire. Why do they have to pay this tax?’ On the spot, the Prime Minister made policy on the run. She changed her mind and said, ‘These people are going to be exempt as well.’ Just like that. Of course, the story in the paper the next day, on the back of a quick policy decision by the Prime Minister on legislation that had not even gone through the parliament, was that they were going to exempt those people as well.

There was no mention of the people who had been subject to bushfires and the like. So there is a lack of clarity, Minister, around how the exemptions are going to be handled if the Prime Minister can change it at the stroke of a pen when asked a difficult question by a newspaper out of

There is not much that they focus on outside of New South Wales and Victoria, but they took notice of a newspaper from Western Australia and—on the run—they put an exemption like this in. Of course, we welcome the fact that the people in Kelmscott will not have to pay this tax. We think that no-one across Australia should have to pay this tax. We think that all of the Australian people should be exempt from this tax.

Of course, that would be highly inappropriate. What other exemptions do the government currently have under consideration that go beyond what we have been told so far? Have other categories for exemptions been raised, Minister? I would be very interested in you answering this question.

You could argue that it is a disaster being governed by this minority Labor government, so maybe we should all be exempt because we are all subject to this natural disaster. You could argue that there should be a catch-all category of exemption here.

Can you confirm that on the record for the benefit of the Senate? Or is that just going to be another broken promise that was made under the pressure of the 24-hour news cycle?

Perhaps he did not hear the question. Perhaps I could get Senator Cormann to repeat the question. By confirmation to this parliament, I would certainly like to know if the Prime Minister has said that a group of individuals in Western Australia will be exempt.

We have a look at what the words say and we can be satisfied that those words do encompass what the media releases have said will happen. Clause 4.10 of this bill says that you must pay extra income tax for the 2011-12 financial year if you are an individual. I emphasis that if you are an individual—if you are a blood-sucking multinational company that Senator Brown talks about then you do not have to pay—and your income exceeds a certain amount then you have to pay a levy. But it says that that subsection:
                                                                                               </p>

                                                                                                … does not apply if you are a member of a class of individuals specified in a legislative instrument made by the Minister for the purposes of this subsection.
                                                                                               </p>

Some would say if these people had been in drought for several years they probably would not have an income; they probably would not reach the $50,000. That may be the case, but they may have some other investments that give them an income of $50,100—the same as many people who were subjected to Cyclone Yasi might have incomes well in excess of $50,000, but they will be excluded.

If Senator Sherry says that this has already been determined and the legislative instrument has been drafted, why does he not take the Senate into his confidence and table it in the Senate so we can have a look at it? There cannot be anything wrong with that. Perhaps we will find that there are some other holes in the legislation. I would be fascinated to see it. I note it is a legislative instrument, so I suppose it can be knocked off in the Senate; we can disallow it. If you disallow it because it does not include everyone, those that it does include are also knocked out so everybody has to pay the levy. The end result of that of course is that the Senate certainly would not disallow it because you would be cutting off the noses of a lot of distressed Australians to spite the face of those few people in, for example, the drought areas who are not going to be impacted upon.

Senator Xenophon tried to answer for the government when he said that the levy is on individuals rather than companies because it was administratively easier, he thought—that was his understanding. But that is hardly a basis for taxing Australians. The levy is raising $1.8 billion. That is all coming from individuals. If it were taken from general revenue, then Woolworths, Coles,

Individuals in Australia would pay about $0.8 billion and these wealthy, according to Senator Brown, multinationals would pay the other $0.9 or $1 billion. But, under this legislation, they get off scot-free; it does not cost them a cent. Certain individuals—though not every individual—will have to pay the levy. What is the policy sense of that? How could anyone vote for legislation that imposes a tax on some individuals? We do not even know how many individuals are going to be excluded. How many of the people who contribute 45 per cent of the general revenue are going to be excluded? If a small percentage of them are excluded it means those remaining pay even more. What is the sense in that? How could you possibly justify legislation along those lines?

In this place just recently I tried to establish the eligibility under the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment scheme for the $1,000 per adult and $400 per child payments. I asked—and I did not get a satisfactory answer—whether it was true that a community 1,700 kilometres north of Brisbane, just south-west of Cairns, was receiving the $1,000 cheques in consideration of the floods in Brisbane, 1,700 kilometres to the south, and then after Cyclone Yasi struck

In fact they did not even have to make an application to Centrelink; their’s was paid into their bank accounts.

It was put to me that, having received the funding under the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment scheme, they too would then be exempted from contributing to this levy. I am keen to know whether that is true, whether it happened, to what extent it happened, how Centrelink or other agencies have been able to establish this and what action, if any, is being taken to recover those funds. It could not be a greater contrast at this time with the shocking events in Japan recently—the earthquake followed by the tsunami—to have the realisation that the Japanese government, prudent as it is, has just gone into its sovereign wealth funds to fund the recovery from that dramatic and disastrous event. It draws to our attention the fact that any intelligent, wise or prudent household or any prudent business would always put to one side funds to use in the event of some disaster befalling that household or business.

It seems to me so ridiculous that we would frame the legislation in such a way that a group of individuals in the community would be so taxed but companies and others would not. How do we know that the $1.8 billion will be recovered in 12 months. What if it takes two years? What if it takes six months to recover these funds? What will happen then? If it is in six months, will the levy stop? Or if at the end of 12 months the $1.8 billion has not been recovered, will it continue? These are questions which I believe we have the right to ask and have answered.
