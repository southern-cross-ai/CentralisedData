         I understand that the Prime Minister will be making the announcement of the government's decisions in relation to the carbon price. They will be decisions taken by this government and no doubt she will be doing media in explaining the government's position on that day. As to the details, Senator, I think that you and I will both have to wait to see exactly how that occurs. You do know that there is a government lock-up for journalists and other associations. That will occur and, as I say, the Prime Minister will announce the government's position in relation to the future pricing of carbon.

           All I can say is that the government's position has been adopted following its normal processes, which include consultation with caucus and cabinet decision-making processes. All those processes have been followed in relation to this matter, as with all others. The Prime Minister will be announcing the govern­ment's position and the legislation that the government will bring before the parliament.

            , I have a further supplementary question. Can the minister explain to the Senate why Labor senators are so supinely prepared to allow themselves to be treated by the Prime Minister as second-class repre­sentatives of the Australian people and why caucus has been relegated to the 'mushroom club' while the Greens seem to know more about what is going on than most of the ministry?

              Thank you,
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">

              . I doubt that it is a question that is properly directed but I am happy to deal with it. The senator may be interested in the processes of the Labor Party because we actually have a policy debate inside the Labor Party. We are not a member of a party which has excluded itself from the public policy debate in this country.
             </p>
             <p>
              Only the Liberal and the National parties have decided not to participate in the public policy debate in this country about the pricing of carbon. They have said, 'We will follow our leader anywhere'—and he leads them nowhere. He leads them to the total negativity of running round the country starting fear campaigns wherever he goes and crying wolf wherever he goes, because the Liberal Party does not want to engage in policy; they have only got negativity; they have only got opposition. The Labor Party will continue to govern in the best interests of all Australians and develop policy that will serve the interests of all Australians for many years to come.
