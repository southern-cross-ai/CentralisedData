            NBN
           </a>
           , the existing regime needs to be reformed to improve competition, strengthen consumer safeguards and remove unnecessary red tape. The historic reforms will fundamentally change existing telecommunications regulations in the national interest. They are critical to future growth, productivity and innovation across the Australian economy. I note that these reforms have been welcomed by the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
            ACCC
           </a>
           , consumer groups, telecommunications carriers and other senators in this chamber—even by some members of the coalition.
          </p>
          <p>
           As I said yesterday, governments of both persuasions have avoided these necessary reforms. This has hindered the development of competition, investment and innovation in our telecommunications industry. It has hurt consumers and small businesses across the country. We are correcting the mistakes of the past, when opportunities to address Telstra’s highly integrated market position were missed. For years, telcos, industry experts and the regulator have been calling for fundamental reforms in telecommunications. These reforms address the structures of the telco market today. We cannot afford to wait for the completion of the NBN.

                  , I ask a further supplementary question. Despite the share price having recovered, probably because the market does not believe that Senator Conroy could possibly be serious, is it not the case that the government’s bungling of its

                   That was almost creative by Senator Minchin, because he tried to airbrush his support for, his appointment of, Mr Sol Trujillo out of the

                    Hansard
                   </i>
                   . Let me read to the Senate what Senator Minchin had to say just a few months ago on the departure of Mr Trujillo. He said:
                  </p>
                  <p class="italic">
                   Sol has provided strong leadership and vision in transforming Telstra, and has greatly enhanced the company’s profile both domestically and internationally.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Under that same regime appointed, supported and finally endorsed by Senator Minchin, we saw the share price of Telstra collapse from $5.20 to $3.20. That is in the period for which Senator Minchin said, ‘Sol has provided strong leadership.’ You just have to look at today’s newspapers to understand exactly how out of touch Senator Minchin is. There is an editorial in the

                     I thank Senator Bilyk for her question. Yesterday, the Rudd government introduced historic reforms to the existing telecommunications regime to make it work more effectively in the interests of all Australians. These reforms included measures to address the structure of the telecommunications market and the competition framework by addressing Telstra’s high level of integration and by streamlining and simplifying the existing regulatory framework to provide more certain and quicker outcomes for telecommunications companies. A vibrant and pro-competitive telecommunications industry will promote better consumer outcomes by driving lower costs, higher quality and more innovative services. This view has been widely supported, including by some of those opposite. I note the comments of Senator Williams this morning. Senator Williams’s understanding of these issues is clearly superior to those put by the shadow minister. Senator Williams gets out there among people in regional and rural Australia and he understands the failings that were left by the former government. He said, ‘In my opinion, in brief, it’s good for competition.’ How right Senator Williams is. His assessment is supported by key industry representatives, including iiNet Managing Director Michael Malone, who said yesterday:

                    <p class="italic">
                     The big winner from these reforms is the Australian consumer who will be able to gain access to fast, affordable and competitive broadband services.

Can the minister further outline to the Senate the benefits to Australian consumers and businesses that will result from the long overdue reforms of a consumer protection framework in the telecommunications sector? For example, what service guarantees and consumer safeguards does the legislation put in place in Australia’s national interest?

                       This government’s reforms will strengthen consumer safeguards to ensure that all Australians, including those in rural and regional Australia, have access to high quality telecommunications services. We will toughen the universal service obligation and the customer service guarantee to ensure that consumers have access to high quality telecommunications services, no matter where they live. Many in the community have expressed concerns about the removal of pay phones. Senator Bushby, for example, has complained that Telstra should not be allowed to remove pay phones from Burnie island—

                            I am happy to reiterate exactly what I said yesterday. What I said yesterday was that, because of policy failings that stretch back over two governments over 20 years, Telstra was allowed to become just about the most vertically integrated telco in the world. It is in all platforms. Many jurisdictions restrict the telco incumbent from being in all of the markets. You are allowed to be in the mobile market; you are allowed to be in the fixed line market. There are many restrictions around the world. As we move out of the copper era into the fibre future, the government have decided that we need to have a greater degree of competition. We want to redress the mistakes made by the two former governments, so we have said that we will restrict Telstra from moving into the next generation of spectrum—which will be auctioned in a few years—to ensure that it cannot dominate every single platform.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            What we have seen is that Australians are suffering from the highest prices in the world for broadband, virtually, and the slowest speeds, virtually. That is not acceptable because it is selling out our children, our small businesses, our educational future, our health future and our energy efficiency future. It is selling out all of those sectors, not to mention the potential in growth in aged care services online. All of those sectors are waiting to step into the fibre future. They are waiting for the capacity to deliver incredibly exciting new applications that are available overseas.

I ask the minister why Telstra is being excluded from competing for additional wireless broadband spectrum when wireless broadband is a highly competitive market and Telstra’s competitors have the majority of the market share?

                                    As I explained in answer to Senator Minchin’s first question, this is about the most vertically integrated telco in the world. It is in every platform. It is in cable, in mobile, in fixed; it is in all the platforms. We are saying that it is time to introduce some competition into this market. I read Senator Coonan’s quote yesterday. As I repeated yesterday, we should have given a bit more thought to separating before we floated it, but to the country’s detriment she was rolled by Senator Minchin—who was interested in nothing more than propping up Telstra and flogging off its shares.
