        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Housing, Senator Farrell. The Productivity Commission's latest report on government services showed that over a third of people seeking homelessness accommodation in the last financial year couldn't find any. One in three people looking for somewhere to sleep can't find somewhere to sleep. Does the government acknowledge the growing demand on homelessness services, and do you have any plans to increase their funding?

         I thank Senator Pocock for that excellent question, and I appreciate very much that he has a deep interest and a deep concern about the issue of homelessness in this country.

         </a>
         say the government generally shares your concern, but in particular the minister who has responsibility for this, Minister Collins, is very focused on dealing with this issue. They are all extremely serious issues. Regrettably, at the last census, there were over 116,000 people experiencing homelessness in this country. Of course that is an issue that we must address. It is unacceptable that so many Australians are now forced to couch surf, sleep rough or live in temporary or overcrowded housing arrangements.
        </p>
        <p>
         I understand, Senator Pocock, that you have had discussions with our minister on a regular basis and that you have the opportunity to raise these issues and try and deal with these issues that require negotiation between the states and the territories. Unlike the previous government, Senator Pocock, we are taking the issue of homelessness seriously, and we have started the process of delivering on all of the things that the previous government failed—

           Thank you, Minister. I appreciate your concern for the homeless, but I'll take that as no new funding.
          </p>
          <p>
           I understand that the government has written to state and territory governments offering to extend the National Housing and Homelessness Agreement by 12 months while the new national housing plan is developed. Can the minister please confirm if this offer included a 12-month extension of the payment for the equal remuneration order?
