        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Carr. Can the minister advise why the government should be trusted with a blank cheque for its proposed changes to the Migration Act after its disastrous decision to abolish the Howard government's successful border protection policies, the failed Afghan and

TPVs were introduced by the Howard government in October 1999. They said it was to defer boat arrivals. In fact, they did not stop the boat arrivals. There were 3,722 unauthorised boat arrivals in that year alone. During the next two financial years—

                     Isn't it the case that, since the government abolished the Pacific solution and temporary protection visas, the Rudd-Gillard government and their policies have become the people smugglers' business model?

                      Might I just remind Senator Cash that Indonesia is not a signatory to the international conventions. Your policy position is that you would turn the boats around and tow them out to sea. This is the policy position that you tried to put, Senator, and you try to claim you have got this superior attitude when it comes to human rights. I put it to you,

                          I find it quite incredible that the opposition, which is so badly divided on these questions, would seek to give us advice. People are engaging in a serious public debate about the humanitarian treatment of refugees and our international treaty obligations—which the government maintains it is honouring through the legislation it has before the parliament—whereas your policy is to tow back to sea vessels that come to this country, risking the drowning of many thousands of people. We have a situation where your historical record is a legacy of shame—and you want to give us advice on human rights! I find you have more front than Myers to be able to argue that case. Frankly, your position is without credibility. You have no credibility when it comes to the issue, given the way in which you have treated Australian citizens, let alone people seeking refugee status in this country.
