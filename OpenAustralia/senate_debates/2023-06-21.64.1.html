        A 'no' outcome is a win for the black sovereign movement. We say 'no' to assimilation. Our objectives are truth, treaty and justice. This can only be achieved through real self-determination, which allows our people to be the architects of our own futureâ€”imagine that. There is more to this referendum than 'yes' or 'no'. The ongoing impacts of colonisation are complex. To reduce this proposal down to two distinct sides is to ignore everything that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations
        </a>
        leaders have been saying. Our sovereignty has never been ceded. We have not successfully and sustainably governed our own affairs for over 80,000 years to now hand it all over to an illegal occupation.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is a racist 'no' vote. There are those that are so against my people that they would deny us anything, even if it is worthless scraps that fall off the table. There is also a progressive 'no' vote. There are well-known and respected members of our community who are calling this proposal out for what it is: more shiny beads and trinkets to try to distract us while the colony continues to attack our people and exploit our lands. There is a diversity of stances on the Voice, but we aren't seeing that diversity reflected in the media. Respected First Nations voices aren't being heard.
       </p>
       <p>
        Taking a crumb when you're starving doesn't mean you support the system that starves you. The black sovereign movement offers a third option, and I refuse to take crumbs or let fear guide my decisions. I will continue to fight for my people's sovereignty.
