           I note that this motion is part of the deal that the Palmer United Party have made with the government to set up a joint select committee to establish an Australia fund, but what we have never been told is whether the backroom deal also includes a sum of money. I think it is important for the parliament to know how much money has been promised behind the scenes for this particular fund.
          </p>
          <p>
           I also make the point that the Greens will not stand in the way of the establishment of this fund. We do not stand in the way of the establishment of committees, but in this case it is hypocrisy in the extreme that the Palmer United Party wants to have a fund set up for communities affected by natural disasters when extreme weather events fuelled by climate change are driving the natural disasters and it is the Palmer United Party that does not want to address the polluters and wants to now take the money out of the public purse.

             <p>
              I thank the chamber. I can indeed confirm that the government supports this motion and supports the establishment of this joint parliamentary select committee. It is indeed part of the historic agreement that was reached between the government and crossbenchers to get rid of Labor's failed mining tax.
             </p>
             <p>
              Having said that, we absolutely never predetermine the outcomes of such inquiries. We think it is quite appropriate for parliamentary committees to investigate issues of public concern and issues that are relevant to public policy considerations into the future. But, on any suggestions by the Greens or others that somehow the government has predetermined any outcomes from that inquiry by making pre-emptive allocations of funding, no, we have not. What we have said is that we are very happy for the parliament to set up a committee to investigate these matters, which are clearly matters of public concern, and we will await the recommendations of that inquiry before we make further decisions.
             </p>
             <p>
              Question agreed to.
