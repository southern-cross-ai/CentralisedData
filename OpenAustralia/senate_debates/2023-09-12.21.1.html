        Yet again the Queensland Labor government have shown that their solution to growing congestion is—surprise surprise!—another road. Residents of Caloundra are extremely concerned about the Caloundra Transport Corridor Upgrade, which proposes a new four-lane road, supposedly to serve the current and future needs of travellers in the area. The new four lane road cuts through two parks with developed trees, residential areas and local businesses, and will clear bushland adjacent to ecologically significant wetlands. The project is flawed and will have irreversible environmental and social impacts. Community members are clearly against this project and yet have not been involved in any meaningful discussions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week, concerned Caloundra community members came together to walk the area where the road is planned to go and were devastated to see all the habitat that will be impacted. Ironically, the government claims that this project is an investment in meeting the needs of public transport users. How can a few more lanes in one area seriously be considered an investment in public transport? But if the only tool you have is a hammer you tend to see every problem as a nail, and the only tool that the Queensland government knows how to use is an overfunded, poorly-designed new road.

        Queenslanders are clearly sick of outdated and tired, phoney solutions. With 32 per cent of 18 to 34-year-old Queensland voters listing the Greens as their first preference, it's clear that the next Queensland government needs to be one that plans for more liveable and connected communities while looking after our natural environment. Instead of the $7 million of federal funding being allocated to this project, the government could put money on the table for public transport projects that give communities accessible, affordable, clean and connected cities in the regions that they deserve.
