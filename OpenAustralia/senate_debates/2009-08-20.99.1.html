        My question is to Senator Arbib, the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Does the minister’s decision to intervene in award overhaul in the horticultural sector show that the government knows that its fatally flawed policy will cost jobs?

         I thank Senator Fisher. I am always happy to get up and talk about reforms that are taking place in workplace relations, and also to remind Australians about the previous, Howard government’s

          , I rise on a point of order. The minister has just indicated that he will not be answering the question but will be using it as an opportunity to talk about matters that are not directly relevant. I remind you of the sessional order requiring the minister to be directly relevant to the question, and that of course relates to horticulture.

           , I know Senator Abetz is trying to rebuild his confidence, but Senator Arbib is perfectly entitled to put the question in the context of the general

            Order! At this stage there is no point of order, but I do draw the minister’s attention to the question and I will be listening carefully to the answer that is given to ensure that it is relevant to the question.

             and reminding Australians about that, but I do want to move on to horticulture and award modernisation. This a major piece of reform that was too tough for the Howard government to take on, but the Rudd government is doing it: reforming 2,400 outmoded state and federal instruments into 230 simple, modern awards. There have been discussions with the horticultural industry. In fact, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and her department met on 26 May with Horticulture Australia Council, Growcom, the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Farmers_Federation" rel="nofollow">

             , Fruit Growers Tasmania and the

              Australian Industry Group
             </a>
             , and there have been further pieces of correspondence and also further phone calls. As Senator Fisher would know, though, these are quite difficult and complex issues that need to be worked through. They affect a very crucial sector of the economy and a very crucial workforce, so it will take time. Overwhelmingly, the task of award modernisation has been going extremely smoothly and has been very successful.

                As I was saying, there are a small number of issues, and we are working with industry and with unions to ensure that those issues worked through. The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has put it on the record that she is prepared to intervene in award modernisation, in the most unusual cases where she considers that the commission has departed from the principles laid down by the government and where the public interest and circumstances warrant it.

                     I do wish to remind Senator Fisher that she and all the Liberal Party and National Party senators actually voted for this piece of legislation. They voted for award modernisation. They can now whinge and whine about it, but they voted for it.

                     Senator Fisher asked a question in regard to other sectors. I can confirm that there have been discussions with other sectors. The Deputy Prime Minister met with: on 25 May, the aged-care industry; on 26 May, the horticulture industry, as I said; on 18 June, the pharmacy industry; on 18 June, the retail industry; on 4 August, independent schools; on 11 August, the

This is the difference between the Rudd government, who believes in fairness and balance, and the previous government, who believed in

                       , I ask a further supplementary question. Given that the minister refuses to immediately intervene to help sectors such as pharmacy, fast food and cleaning services, will the government suspend its bungled award overhaul to stop the execution of jobs economy-wide, or has the government guillotined its promise to not cost jobs, not cost business and not cost workers with its bungled award overhaul?

                            On the point of order, what the minister has been doing is responding to the question and being directly relevant to it. The minister may have been provoked by interjections from the other side, to which he fairly responded. The question was asked and the minister is responding directly to those matters. The question was about industrial relations and the minister is responding and also, inevitably, referring to the award modernisation program. That was clear in the answer. However, I do not invite you,

                            , like the senator on the opposite side did, because I think that was one step too far, quite frankly. I simply request politely that you rule that there is no point of order.

                             On the point of order, I consider that the minister is answering the question. He may not be giving the answer that the questioner would like, necessarily, but I have no control over the answer that is given by a minister. I have no control over the answer that is given by a minister—I repeat that. I draw the minister’s attention to the question and I invite the minister to continue his answer.

                              As I was saying, the government will continue to work cooperatively, fairly and in a balanced way with the horticultural sector and with all other sectors, because we believe in fairness and we believe in balance, unlike those in the Liberal Party and the National Party.
