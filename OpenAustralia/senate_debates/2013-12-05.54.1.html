        My question is to the Minister for Defence, Senator Johnston. I noticed in recent media reports that Defence has been weakened by the previous government's budget cuts. Can the minister please explain how the government plans to restore Australia's defence capabilities to rectify the unsustainable mess it inherited?

         I thank the honourable senator for his question and acknowledge his longstanding interest, and commitment as a former serving member of the ADF, to defence. This government has made a commitment to restore spending on Defence. First and foremost we have acknowledged the necessity to say that there will be no further cuts to Defence. This previous Labor government left Defence in an unsustainable mess.

             within a decade. On 22 November this year, the shadow defence ministers, including Senator Conroy, released a statement saying that we had not yet shed any light on how the government plans to match Labor's commitment to increase defence spending to two per cent of GDP. Let me remind the Senate that this year they delivered a white paper, with chapter 7 entitled 'Defence budget and funding' and there were 1½ pages with not a single dollar figure mentioned, now or ever. This government is committed to achieving a two per cent of GDP target in a time frame, not just an airy-fairy, long-term splash of a political objective.

The government is also committed to acquiring the joint strike fighter to bolster Australia's air combat capability. In addition, the government is closely considering the requirement for unmanned aerial vehicles in the context of broad-area maritime surveillance. Of course, we know the success of the opposition in government in managing our borders in the maritime sense. We are also committed to providing—

                   As I stated earlier, the previous government has left the current Defence budget in an unsustainable mess. The constant and repeated cuts to Defence under the previous government have left the portfolio reeling. Sixteen billion dollars, in just a few short years, was ripped out of the portfolio—treated like an

                   </a>
                   . Labor slashed 10.5 per cent from the 2012-13 budget, the largest single cut since the Korean conflict. The cuts and uncertainty around the Defence budget led the Australian defence industry to slash more than 10 per cent of its workforce. That is at least 5,000 jobs you are responsible for that have gone because defence industry has had no work. Without restoring defence spending, the capabilities outlined in the previous government's white paper are simply not able to be met. Despite this, the Labor Party continue to boast of their so-called achievements—
