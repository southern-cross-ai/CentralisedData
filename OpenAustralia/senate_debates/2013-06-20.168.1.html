           Thank you for your question, Senator Birmingham. The agreement that was reached when Minister Shorten and I convened a meeting of the companies involved—subcontractors, Telstra,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
            NBN
           </a>
           Co. and the unions involved—was for remediation work on asbestos. Telstra had already halted their asbestos handling and NBN Co. agreed to halt theirs while these issues were being worked through. I believe there is another meeting taking place today at some stage—it could even be finished by now—that is resolving these issues so that everyone can be sure that all of the standards are being followed.

              NBN
             </a>
             Co.'s training manuals. There were training courses and there were requirements. So NBN Co. have taken the asbestos issue seriously from day one. As I have said before, across the 18 months or so since we signed the agreement with Telstra, there have been 29 incidents of asbestos issues reported to Comcare—some of which have nothing to do with the

              , I ask a supplementary question. If, as the minister has just contended, the asbestos concerns were a known factor at the commencement of the build and were built into the training manuals and other documentation, as he just asserted, why then has it been necessary for the government to strip its original contractors of their responsibility for asbestos handling and engage specialist asbestos removal firms instead?

               Co. is working through these issues. We intend to ensure that there are no shortcuts. If some subcontractors of the prime contractors have taken shortcuts, they should feel the full force of all the relevant authorities and laws. We are working with the contractors and, through the contractors, the subcontractors to remind all workers involved that there are to be no shortcuts. Minister Shorten and I left everyone in that room under no illusions. The government does not accept shortcuts when it comes to dealing with asbestos. So, as a precaution, we are ensuring that everybody gets a reminder—

                 Co. do, as I think we discussed earlier in the week, augmentation of some Telstra pits. That means we come into contact with some asbestos. It is a very small portion of the total NBN work. I will have to take on notice the question of how many contractors we are using. I do not have a figure. Similarly, I do not have the figures for the cost, but I am happy to take that on notice for you as well.
