        My question is to Minister Sherry representing the Minister for Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. Has the Rudd government had any talks with, or given any undertakings to, Tasmanian Premier David Bartlett or any member of the Labor government in Tasmania about immediately renegotiating the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement to provide for logging of old-growth forests in Tasmania until at least 2037—20 years beyond the end of the current agreement due to end in 2017?

         It seems like there is an election in Tasmania. It is Tassie week. This is the third question we have had this week on Tasmanian issues. The government is committed to supporting regional jobs and communities and encouraging sustainable forestry, investment in forestry and helping our forest industry prepare for the future challenges. The regional forest agreements, commonly known as
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFA" rel="nofollow">
          RFA

         s, are the primary mechanism for ensuring sustainable forestry management in a particular region, which balances economic, social, environmental biodiversity and heritage outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am not sure whether Senator Milne was also going to my specific responsibilities as Assistant Treasurer. I think the only area of policy development that I am directly involved in as Assistant Treasurer is an examination of the tax arrangements relating to managed investment schemes, which in turn, of course—

          , I rise on a point of order. Clearly Senator Milne asked a question of the minister in his capacity as representative of the minister for forests, and it was about a 20-year extension of the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement. That is the question that the minister should be answering.

            I was really trying to be helpful by going to managed investment schemes, which are critical in terms of forestry plantations. In terms of representational responsibilities for my colleague Minister Burke, I can confirm that

              s are 20-year agreements. I can confirm there are 10 RFAs, in Tasmania,
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
               New South Wales

               Western Australia
              </a>
              . They were developed in the mid-1990s, following the largest scientific assessment and consultation process undertaken for forestry. Clearly a level of forest activity and harvesting is permitted under RFAs.

              I will take the remainder of questions, on the very few areas that I have not been able to comprehensively answer, on notice and refer them to Minister Burke. I will try and get you an answer, Senator, before the Tasmanian elections, because I think that is what your motivation is.

Can the minister tell the Senate whether Premier Bartlett has misled the Tasmanian people by saying that he would immediately renegotiate the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement to provide for logging of old-growth forests in Tasmania for another 20 years if there had been no talks with the Commonwealth—or have there been talks with the Commonwealth? It is one or the other. Have there been talks with the Commonwealth?

                            It was a fine speech, Senator Brown. Nevertheless, I cannot recall him mentioning forestry on that occasion. I will check—I will have a look at other public statements he has made. I am aware, obviously, that there is a Tasmanian state election on. I will come back to you.
