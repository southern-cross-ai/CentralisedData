        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Home Affairs
        </a>
        . Minister, I draw your attention to the humanitarian calamity your government has created on Nauru, where children have been continually abused and are suffering ongoing trauma. I remind you, Minister, that some of these kids have spent five years in detention, and about 40 of them were born into detention and have never known freedom. In the last five years we've seen physical abuse, sexual abuse of children, suicides, attempted suicides, widespread self-harm, children lapsing into catatonic states, and the destruction of people's hopes for the future. Last week

         Medecins Sans Frontieres

        was kicked off the island, and there is a complete lack of appropriate medical care for people, including children in desperate need. Minister, when will you get the kids off Nauru and bring them here so that they can get the medical treatment they so desperately need?

           It is a fact that when we left office there was a handful of people in detention. But there is a very clear policy choice now as we move towards the next election. Do you want a government that will always put the sovereignty of its borders first, or do you want the absolute chaos that ensued when the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Greens
           </a>
           supported the policies of the former

           government? And Senator

            McKim
           </a>
           , let me just remind you what occurred: 50,000 people arrived here on in excess of 800 boats. But when you talk about children in detention, it is about time you stood up and at least prefaced the question that you are going to ask with, 'I accept responsibility on behalf of the Australian Greens for policies that put in excess of 8,000 children into detention.' It is those of us on this side of the chamber who have ensured—Senator McKim, you may have forgotten this—the diligent, hard work of putting in place policies that work and that reduced the number of children held in detention in April 2016 to zero.

            Minister, can you confirm that there is currently only one mental health nurse on Nauru, who is not employed to provide services to refugees, and that the only psychiatrist employed by the Nauruan hospital does not speak English and does not have access to a translator to speak to refugee patients? Are you seriously maintaining your claim that this constitutes an adequate response to the mental health epidemic amongst refugees on Nauru that you've created?

The Australian government has provided, as you know, Senator McKim, and continues to provide, appropriate health care and mental health support—

                Yes, President. My point of order goes to direct relevance. The question is not generic or generalist in any way. It makes two assertions and asks the minister to respond to those, which, to date, halfway through her answer, she's yet to do. I ask that you remind the minister of the question and ask her to respond to the specifics contained in the question.

                 I think the minister is being directly relevant to part of the question asked. Specific questions that are narrow in scope make it easier to hold a minister directly relevant to a question. For a longer question, a minister can respond to part of it.

                    Australia director Paul McPhun says that it is the Australian government's policy of indefinite offshore detention that has 'destroyed their resilience, shattered all hope and ultimately impacted their mental health'. The AMA has repeatedly called on the government to urgently transfer refugee families off Nauru, describing the situation as a 'humanitarian emergency'. Minister, why are you ignoring experts and continuing to deliberately engage in child abuse on Nauru?
