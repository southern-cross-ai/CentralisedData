         I thank Senator Reynolds for the question. This government is focused on delivering better outcomes for Aboriginal and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
          Torres Strait Islander
         </a>
         communities and ensuring that our first Australians can expect the same—if not better—levels of service as other Australians. That is why we have been working with state governments to reform the delivery of municipal and essential service in remote Indigenous communities to ensure services like rubbish collection and the provision of water and power are provided by state and local government with funding provided by the Commonwealth financial assistance grants, as they are in every other community. What needs to be put on the public record is that communities are not closing and services have not been reduced.

            , confirmed that services would continue when he spoke on the steps of the Western Australia house of parliament last week and said no Aboriginal people would be forced to move from their traditional lands and communities. Last month, the Western Australian government confirmed that the funding provided by the Commonwealth would keep all community funding arrangements in place. It is great to see that state governments are taking up their responsibilities for Indigenous communities, something it does for every other town, city and state. This government will continue working with state and territory government to ensure that services are delivering outcomes for Aboriginal and

               government have confirmed that services are continuing in remote communities in Western Australia. No communities have been closed because of the transition and services will continue at existing levels from 1 July 2015. I can advise that, rather than using my position to speculate and create unnecessary fear, I have been working with ministers in Western Australia and other states to ensure there is no closure of communities.

It is unhelpful when senators opposite are tweeting that traditional owners have been forced off the land when they know this is not the case. So I call on those opposite to take a lead from this government and focus on delivering better outcomes for our first Australians, rather than misleading them.

This is what Indigenous communities have been asking for and telling me, and that is why these are the government's priorities in Indigenous affairs.
