        McDONALD () (): I rise with great enthusiasm to inform the House of an exciting development in our vitally important meat production sector. In an age when the noble art of growing food and fibre is scorned by green and vegan activists, Australian meat producers can keep holding their heads high, after more than 650 international scientists signed the Dublin declaration, endorsing the role of meat and its production methods. The declaration was made late last year at the International Summit on the Societal Role of Meat, which also highlighted the need to increase meat production to combat nutritional deficiencies affecting billions of people worldwide. The scientists also found that well-managed livestock production can improve soil health and aid carbon sequestration.

        In October last year, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations
        </a>
        reported that the number of people affected by hunger has more than doubled in the past three years and almost a million people are living in famine. The Word Food Programme reports that a record 349 million people across 79 countries are facing acute food insecurity, up from 287 million in 2021. Putting it simply, we need to dramatically increase our food production. Australia, with its space, quality controls, sustainability and cutting-edge approach to animals, genetics and welfare, is perfectly placed to improve the lives of people worldwide.

        Just this week I convened a gathering of the Parliamentary Friends of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Meat" rel="nofollow">
         Red Meat
        </a>
        , along with co-chair Senator Raff Ciccone, and was proud to host representatives of various national livestock bodies. Australia currently exports about 70 per cent of all of the beef, sheep and goat meat that we produce, making us the largest exporter. I wholeheartedly congratulate our meat industry and the work that they do.
