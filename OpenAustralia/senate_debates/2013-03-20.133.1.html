        Senator COLBECK asked:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Figures provided at Additional Estimates indicated the IER has dropped from approximately $24 million to $10 million this financial year, and that the target figure is actually $18 million.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Specifically what has this money been spent on?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Has industry been advised of the erosion of the reserve?

        Has industry approved the use of this money?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        What efficiencies is the division implementing to redress the ongoing use of the IER?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        What is the IER expected to be by the end of the current financial year?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        When will decisions be made on how to return the IER to the target of $18 million?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Answer:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        1. At Additional Estimates the opening balance of the reserve on 1 July 2012 was $14.3 m. The import clearance deficit for 2012-13 was forecast to be $24.7 m. This would put the reserve into a $10.4 m deficit position.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Departmental budgets have been updated since Additional Estimates and the forecast operating deficit has reduced from $24.7 m to $10.9 m. As a result, the reserve balance is forecast at a $3.4 m surplus.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The range of the reserve agreed in the Cost Recovery Impact Statement (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRIS" rel="nofollow">
         CRIS
        </a>
        ) is between 2 per cent and 10 per cent of annual expenditure. This equates to approximately $4 m to $19 m.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Attachment A provides a breakdown of expenditure for the 2012-13 year to date.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        2. Yes. Industry is provided financial information as part of the Import Industry Finance Working Group.

        3. The industry reserve is a mechanism to smooth out operational results of cargo operations over years. The

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAFF" rel="nofollow">
         DAFF
        </a>
        ) does not seek industry agreement to draw on the reserves each time a deficit is incurred. Industry is informed of the forecast, actual expenditure and the underlying activities on a regular basis.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        4. From 2007-08 until now, the following efficiencies have been implemented:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        a. Reduction of intervention of containers departing the wharf gate from 100 per cent external inspection to 30 per cent inspection.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        b. Paperless processing of non-commercial air cargo documentation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        c. Reclassification of postcodes previously classified as rural (rural assurance postcode review).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        d. Reduction of intervention on

        containers from 20 per cent intervention to surveillance only.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        e. Reduction of intervention on letter class documents from 20 per cent intervention to surveillance only.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        f. Introduction of a nationally consistent approach to monitoring imported goods at quarantine approved premises, airports, wharves and port precincts.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        g. Redirection of resources away from low risk activities and toward high risk cargo.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        h. Conducted targeted campaigns on imported commodities to verify the documentary assessment
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        i. Implementation of processes to reduce intervention on high risk cargo based on good compliance (Sea Container Hygiene System, Q-Ruler and e-cert)
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        j. Import conditions have been refined to reduce intervention on low risk cargo.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The industry reserve is a mechanism to smooth out operational results of cargo operations over time. DAFF does not plan to cease using the reserve for this purpose.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        5. The IER is forecast to be' $3.4 m in surplus at the end of 2012-13.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        6. The range of the reserve agreed in the Cost Recovery Impact Statement (CRIS) is between 2 per cent and 10 per cent of annual expenditure. This equates to approximately $4 m to $19 m. The current 2012-13 forecast closing balance of the reserve is $3.4 m. The operating result and IER are monitored throughout the year.
