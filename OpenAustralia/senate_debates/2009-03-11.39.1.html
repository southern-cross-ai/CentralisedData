        My question is to the Minister for Superannuation and Corporate Law, Senator Sherry, representing the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. Is the minister aware of any important budget health measures including their fiscal impact and can the minister outline to the Senate the views in the community about any such measures?

         Thank you, Senator Forshaw, for this important issue that you have raised. The Rudd government is extremely concerned about the scourge in our society of teenage binge drinking and about the role of attractively packaged sweet drinks that are laced with alcohol, colloquially known as alcopops.

           This does make an important contribution to the scourge of underage drinking. Between 2000 and 2004, the percentage of female drinkers aged 15 to 17—this is underage female drinkers—reporting that they consumed alcopops at their last drinking session rose from 14 per cent to a staggering 62 per cent. Between 1999 and 2005, the proportion of teenage girls aged 12 to 17 who chose alcopops as their preferred drink rose from 23 per cent to a staggering 48 per cent.

             So the Labor government’s policy approach to the alcopops problem is a very important social and health issue. Last year, the Rudd Labor government unashamedly increased the excise on alcoholic beverages known as alcopops by 70 per cent. Despite strong evidence supporting the continuation of the alcopops measure, this divided rabble of the Liberal opposition continues to oppose this very responsible measure. Those opposite talk a lot about budget deficits, government deficits and cash splashes, but what they are threatening is some $1.6 billion over the forward estimates—

                 I do not think the community would be terribly impressed with a Liberal opposition whose only support for a cash splash is a $1.6 billion windfall to the alcohol industry. Incredibly, the only area where the Liberal Party, which claims fiscal responsibility and wants to reduce budget debt, supports a cash splash is $1.6 billion to the alcohol industry. That is the Liberal Party’s position—dole out $1.6 billion to the alcohol industry. The

I have been listening to the answer of Senator Sherry and wondering what the possible portfolio relevance is either to his portfolio or to the portfolio he represents in this chamber. Revenue matters fall within the jurisdiction of the Treasurer and, in this chamber, that would be the Minister representing the Treasurer, not Senator Sherry.

                     I think the so-called point of order—effectively an interjection—highlights the problem that the irresponsible and divided Liberal opposition have. They do not understand the concept of budget responsibility—fiscal responsibility.

                       In terms of budget fiscal responsibility—which is one of my responsibilities representing the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, even though the Liberal opposition do not understand it—the Liberal Party’s proposal is to give a $1.6 billion cash splash to the liquor industry. That is the Liberal Party’s proposal: give $1.6 billion of money from the forward revenue estimates to the liquor industry. That is the only cash splash they support and it just highlights the fiscal irresponsibility of the Liberal opposition.
