        Type 1 diabetes directly affects over 120,000 people in Australia alone, some of which work right here in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I would like to note that type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition which is a non-choice disease that lasts for life.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Social Security Amendment (Diabetes Support) Bill 2016 I present to the Senate today will ease the impact of diabetes on individuals affected by the disease.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The purpose of the Social Security Amendment (Diabetes Support) Bill 2016 is to amend the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Social Security Act
        </a>
        1991, to give individuals diagnosed with type 1 diabetes access to the required medication and peripheral devices that the disease imposes upon the individual regardless of their geographic location or social status.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Type 1 diabetes is a form of diabetes marked by a complete lack of insulin, therefore insulin replacement is required for survival. Type 1 diabetes creates a significant financial and emotional burden to its patients, family and the community. Differing social status' can result in an unintended disregard of an individual's care plan, leading to a higher risk of complications requiring hospital admission, and can, as a result, impose a significant burden on the tax payer.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The more time people with type 1 diabetes spend outside the normal range of blood glucose levels, the greater their risk of serious health complications.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Currently the cost of hospital admitted patient services, as a result of diabetes diagnosed admittance, is equal to expenditure on blood glucose lowering medications. This level of hospital admittance is a completely unnecessary burden on the tax payer which could potentially be reduced should this Bill be supported.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This bill ensures access to medication and peripheral devices, required by individuals diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, are accessible despite their socioeconomic status.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I was approached by Dr Peter Goss of Gippsland Paediatrics Diabetes Unit, Sale, in my electorate of Victoria, in October 2014. Dr Peter Goss requested that I advocate for the age group of 18-25 year olds diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, at the time citing that the 18-25 year old age group with type 1 diabetes has the highest rate of death in diabetes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        With such a substantial number of Australians being directly and indirectly affected by type 1 diabetes, this was something I was more than happy to discuss further and support unconditionally.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Type 1 diabetes is an unwelcome and unwanted intruder into the life of an individual and their family. It is an autoimmune disease that cannot be prevented or cured.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Before the discovery of insulin in the 1920s, type 1 diabetes was a fatal condition. Although type 1 diabetes is now manageable, it places an enormous burden on families by requiring them to enter a daily and relentless grind of blood testing and insulin injections.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There is solid evidence that the peak risk of poor control and death in type 1 diabetes is between ages 16 and 25 years. Currently a child with type 1 diabetes often lose their
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Care_Card" rel="nofollow">
         Health Care Card
        </a>
        at 16 years, imposing a significant financial burden on the person with type 1 diabetes as they enter their most vulnerable period of life.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There is anecdotal evidence that young people are also more likely to skimp on the essentials of diabetes care, such as insulin scripts, glucagon scripts, blood glucose and blood ketone test strips, insulin pump consumables and even quality food because of the cost. This lack of attention to scripts, doctors' visits, diabetes education visits and devices due to lack of financial assistance can create long term complications and possible hospital admissions which impose a significant health and financial burden on, not only the individual, but the community
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Given that type 1 diabetes is a lifelong autoimmune disease, it is not unreasonable to not only try to ease the pressure on such a high risk demographic, but make available to all those at risk a health care card to assist sufferers of type 1 diabetes in accessing the medical and peripheral devices required.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On August 20 2015 I moved a motion in the Senate in relation to type 1 diabetes, the text was as follows;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        1. That the Senate—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) Type 1 diabetes mellitus is an autoimmune (not lifestyle) condition which effects over 120,000 Australians,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) people diagnosed with type 1 diabetes require insulin to manage their diabetes for life,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii) Type 1 diabetes is one of the most common chronic diseases effecting children in Australia, and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iv) Type 1 diabetes creates a significant financial and emotional burden for its patients, family and the community; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) acknowledges the importance of access to optical medical management for people with type 1 diabetes regardless of geographic location or social status.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This motion was passed in the Senate unopposed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition to this, I note that the Australian National Diabetes Strategy 2016-2020, which was released to supersede the National Diabetes Strategy 2000–2004, was endorsed by the Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council on 2 October 2015, noted by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
         COAG
        </a>
        Health Council on 6 November 2015, and publically released 13 November 2015.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        So since I moved my motion I am pleased to note that the Australian government has developed a new National Diabetes Strategy, to update and prioritise the national response to diabetes across all levels of government.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I appreciate that there are current government initiatives in place, in addition to the recently developed Australian National Diabetes Strategy 2016-2020, such as the National Diabetes Services Scheme and chronic disease management assistance to assist individuals.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I strongly believe that the Social Security Amendment (Diabetes Support) Bill 2016 can work in collaboration with these key government initiatives which are essential for individuals diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I also believe that the Social Security Amendment (Diabetes Support) Bill 2016 can support some of the key purposes outlined in the Australian National Diabetes Strategy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The purpose of the Australian National Diabetes Strategy 2016-2020 is "To prioritise Australia's response to diabetes and identify approaches to reducing the impact of diabetes in the community. It recognises the social and economic burden of the disease and provides action areas that:

       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Many of these "potential areas for action" can be addressed directly and indirectly through the support of this bill.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        More specifically, optimal diabetes care for children or adolescents in school is crucial to achieving the best possible diabetes control and to prevent any present or future risks of harm to their health and wellbeing. This will give affected children and adolescents the best opportunity to concentrate, participate and learn whilst at school.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Children with type 1 diabetes should have the same educational and social opportunities as children without diabetes. Every child has the right to participate equally in all school activities, including outdoor activities and sponsored events away from school and to receive support for diabetes care.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Ensuring the implementation of accessibility to diabetes care from a younger age will carry over into better diabetes care practices into adolescence and adulthood.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In closing I would like to readdress importance of awareness surrounding type 1 diabetes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Not one person who has type 1 diabetes had a choice in their diagnosis; it cannot be prevented, nor cured.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Type 1 diabetes creates a significant financial and emotional burden to its patients, family and the community
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This bill will ensure medication and peripheral devices that are required by individuals diagnosed with type 1 diabetes can be accessed regardless of one's socioeconomic status.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If we are in any way serious about improving the quality of life of people with type 1 diabetes; I suggest all Senators support this bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted; debate adjourned.
