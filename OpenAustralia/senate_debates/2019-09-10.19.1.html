        I have a few questions for the minister. Minister, the Moss review called for an Inspector-General of Live Animal Exports—one that would:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … review the performance of functions or exercise of powers by department staff members in the regulation of live animal exports.
       </p>
       <p>
        This clearly calls for the ability to review the exercise of the functions of the department staff. So I want to understand why the government has subclause 10(2) in the bill, which basically would restrict the inspector-general in doing what the Moss review recommended.

         Thank you for your question. I'm advised that the section you refer to, on limitations, is simply in regard to ensuring that the inspector-general focuses on the broad overarching assurance of the livestock regulatory process rather than investigations into any specific individual breaches of that framework. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Agriculture" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Agriculture
         </a>
         is the independent regulator for the livestock industry, so issues that go to specific individual breaches of the framework are investigated by the independent regulator. The role of the inspector-general is to review and provide assurance over the regulation provided by the Department of Agriculture itself.

          Would the inspector-general be able to investigate mortality reports that are revised or redrafted to dilute or expunge findings which reflect adversely on the regulatory framework? This is part of what the Moss review highlighted.

             The cost is outlined in the legislation explanatory memorandum at $450,000 each year over four years. That cost will of course be absorbed by the department through general revenue.

               As I'm sure you're aware, the interim inspector-general has been appointed for a period of 12 months. However, if this bill receives royal assent, the minister can appoint an inspector-general straight after that. It is the intention of the government to do so.

                  I won't be moving Greens amendments (1) and (2) on sheet 8736, because the government has now moved amendments identical to those, but I do move amendment (3) on sheet 8736, because the bill as presented by the government unnecessarily restricts the ability of the Inspector-General. We would like subclause 10(2) to be removed completely because, as I said earlier, the subclause does restrict the inspector-general from investigating individual cases. I think this is quite a ridiculous limitation and one that is wholly unnecessary. We know that there are serious problems with the way exports of live animals are carried out and regulated, and there are serious issues with the lack of oversight. This bill as it stands won't really allow the inspector-general to investigate individual actions. This oversight is absolutely necessary, given that we know what the Moss review said about the department and its limitations, and this amendment will ensure that that's not the case. So I do urge senators to support this.

                   Labor opposes the proposal to remove subclause 10(2) on page 7, lines 3 to 12. The subclause provides further clarification about the role and responsibilities of the inspector-general, and it is important to ensure that there is no confusion about the position.

                    The government too indicates its opposition to this amendment, as I outlined to Senator Faruqi in response to questions. This subclause is purely there to clarify and to ensure that the separate role of the
