        Overview

       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government believes in the fundamental right of all people in Australia to feel safe in their homes and in their workplaces. The
        <i>
         Fair Work Amendment (Paid Family and Domestic Violence Leave) Act 2022
        </i>
        (Amendment Act) was an important step

        towards making sure that no employee is forced to make a choice between earning a wage and protecting the safety of themselves and their family.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Amendment Act was the first parliamentary action of the Hon Tony Burke MP, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. This recognised the need to take quick action towards the Government's goal to end gender-based violence in Australia, set out by the

       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that the Australian Government commission an independent review of the provisions of the Fair Work Amendment (Paid Family and Domestic Violence Leave) Bill 2022 (bill) to be undertaken 18 months after the commencement of Schedule 1. The committee further recommends that the review assess the adequacy of support and guidance available to business to assist with implementation of the bill.

        Response: Agreed in-principle.

       <p class="italic">
        During parliamentary debate, the Government agreed to amendments to the Fair Work Amendment (Paid Family and Domestic Violence Leave) Bill 2022 requiring the Minister to commission an independent review of the operation of the paid family and domestic violence leave provisions.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In relation to the recommendations around the reporting obligations for employers and perpetrators not being able to access family and domestic violence leave, the Government's position was outlined during parliamentary debate (see Senate Hansard, 26 October 2022, pages 1565 and 1567-68). The Government made clear that the legislation does not impose any reporting obligations on employers and that an employee will only be able to access the leave if they are experiencing family and domestic violence.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As detailed in response to Committee Recommendation 1, the Amendment Act requires an independent review of the operation of the provisions be conducted. This review will provide Government with the opportunity to consider qualitative and quantitative research on the operation of the Amendment Act to understand the impact of the entitlement, including on small businesses and sole traders.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government recognises the importance of ensuring small business are equipped to understand and administer the paid family and domestic violence leave entitlement sensitively and lawfully. The Small Business Assistance package announced in the 2022-23 Budget provides $3.4 million over 4 years to deliver a range of holistic supports to help small businesses implement paid family and domestic violence leave. This funding supports:

       <p class="italic">
        That any financial support package provided by the government be contingent on recipient businesses offering paid FDV leave to employees at the earliest possible opportunity.

       <p class="italic">
        Response: Noted.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government recognises that small businesses may need extra support to implement the entitlement as they often have more limited resources and may not have access to payroll and human resources expertise. To reflect this, the paid family and domestic violence leave entitlement did not commence for employees employed by small businesses until
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        1 August 2023, 6 months later than the commencement date for employees employed by non-small business employers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Small Business Assistance package announced in the 2022-23 Budget provided $3.4 million to provide support measures to small business, as outlined above. This measure does not include delivery of funding directly to small businesses implementing the new leave entitlement, but rather provides support to ensure they have guidance and relevant materials to help them implement the entitlement.

       <p class="italic">
        Australian Greens Senators' Recommendation 2
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the 18 month review of the Bill consider the definition of family and domestic violence in the
        <i>
         Fair Work Act 2009
        </i>
        in the context of harmonisation initiatives, and consider whether to expand leave entitlements to family, domestic and sexual violence.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response: Noted.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The review of the amendments made by the Amendment Act will be independent of government and capable of considering the definition of family and domestic violence for the purposes of the leave entitlement, including whether the definition should be revised.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government notes that the
        <i>
         Fair Work Act 2009
        </i>
        contains a definition of family and domestic violence in subsection 106B(2) that applies for the purposes of the Act, including an employee's entitlement to paid family and domestic violence leave. The Government has committed to progressing a national definition of family and domestic violence that includes coercive control. A national definition of family and domestic violence will help inform a common understanding of family and domestic violence nationally and across jurisdictions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Progression of a national definition requires a coordinated approach from Commonwealth, state and territory governments and will progress separately to the statutory independent review of the Amendment Act.

        Parliament considered elements of these recommendations by way of non-Government amendments moved by the Australian Greens in the Senate (see Senate Hansard, 26 October 2022, pages 1560 and 1665). The amendments were not agreed to by the Senate.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In relation to the proposed amendments to s 106B, the Government recognises the policy concerns underlying the recommendation, but considers the existing language of the provision is sufficiently clear to address them, as set out in the Government's contribution to the parliamentary debate.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government's priority for the Amendment Act was to ensure that no-one should have to choose between their pay and safety. The Amendment Act achieves this objective and is world-leading in terms of scope and entitlements for paid family and domestic violence leave. The Amendment Act builds in a requirement for an independent review of the legislation as soon as is practicable 12 months after commencement of the reforms.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The independent review will provide a critical opportunity to consider the effectiveness and scope of the legislation and the impact it has had on people experiencing family and domestic violence.

        <i>
         Fair Work Act 2009

        This is demonstrated through the Government's investment of $2.3 billion to support the implementation of the

        The Government is supporting the delivery of more social and affordable housing through its $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund (HAFF). The HAFF will fund 30,000 new social and affordable housing properties. 4,000 of those social housing dwellings will be allocated for women and children experiencing family and domestic violence and older women at risk of homelessness. In addition to other acute housing needs, the HAFF will also fund $100 million in the first 5 years for crisis and transitional housing options for women and children experiencing family and domestic violence and older women who are at risk of homelessness.

        The Government has funded the Keeping Women Safe in their Homes (KWSITH) program since 2015-16. In the October 2022-23 Budget, a further $41.7 million was allocated to continue KWSITH to 2026-27. The KWSITH program supports women and their children to stay in their own home, or a home of their choice, where it is safe and appropriate to do so, through a range of safety responses such as risk assessments, safety planning, home security audits and upgrades. The KWSITH program supports greater housing stability by providing women with an alternative to homeless shelters and emergency accommodation, and reduces some strain on emergency accommodation providers.

       <p class="italic">
        The right to request flexible working arrangements has been expanded to employees who are pregnant as well as situations where an employee, or a member of their immediate family or household, experiences family and domestic violence. This amendment aligns the coverage of family violence with the entitlement to paid family and domestic violence leave in the National Employment Standards.

        The amendments make the right to request flexible working arrangements an enforceable right and allow the Fair Work Commission to deal with disputes about requests, including by arbitration. However, arbitration is a last resort and the Commission must attempt conciliation or mediation before arbitration unless there are exceptional circumstances.
