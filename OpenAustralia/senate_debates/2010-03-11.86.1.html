        My question is directed to Senator Carr, the Minister representing the Minister for Education. Given the government’s so-called
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_the_Education_Revolution" rel="nofollow">
         Building the Education Revolution
        </a>
        is supposed to be in full swing, can the minister explain why the government has been so incompetent in delivering this program and why Sandringham East Primary School is still waiting for construction to begin on its six classrooms, despite all plans having been drawn up and all approvals having been granted by the government in June last year? Given that construction will now take place during the school year, instead of during school holidays, does the government actually give a stuff about how this is going to disrupt this school and its classes?

          for that question, because I really do think that, given the circumstances and the way in which this chamber operates, the suggestion that people feel that way about the schools program is totally inappropriate and grossly inaccurate. I was asked about what progress is being made in regard to

          . We have a program of $16.2 billion now to support jobs in local communities in response to the global recession. As a result of that we have some 24,009 projects, as of 31 December, which have been approved for some 9,500 schools right across this country. So what we have actually seen is a very significant rollout of major projects which has enormous benefit—

            and I was asked a specific question in regard to a particular school in Victoria—and obviously I will seek further information about the specific matters in regard to that one school. But I was asked a more general question, contained within that question, that went to the fact that this government is spending $16.2 billion on investment in Australian schools that allows us to provide world-class educational facilities, in terms of new infrastructure and refurbishment of those facilities, right across this country. What that means, for the students of Sandringham and every other suburb across this country—

Given that this delay means that Sandringham East Primary School is still short of classrooms and that 48 grade 1 children have been forced into the one classroom, can the government explain why this issue is clearly not a priority for them to fix but it is a priority for them to make sure the school received a sign to put up saying the government was funding the project?

                  There are some 10,000 schools across this country and what you are seeing is a massive improvement in the quality of facilities provided as a direct result of this government’s expenditure on education. For those who do not understand it, an improvement in the facilities actually leads to an improvement in the educational environment for students, the environment in which they learn. It might be a little matter that you have overlooked, but the fact is the improvement in science labs—

Given that Cheltenham Primary School is also waiting for the government to get its act together, can the minister confirm that it is not just a coincidence that these massive delays in construction at Sandringham East Primary School and Cheltenham Primary School have occurred to schools in a safe Liberal seat?

                    This government does not allocate education programs on the basis of electorates. It does it on the basis of providing equality of opportunity to students right across this country, for all Australian students.

                      The Labor government are actually in the business of improving opportunities for all Australians. We do not pick and choose on the basis of the way in which people vote. That is the strategy that the coalition pursued throughout their decade of neglect of education in this country. So,

                      , it is about time you appreciated whose education policies are being run in this country. But, if you are so keen to work with the Liberal Party on these matters, I suggest you stand for preselection for them.
