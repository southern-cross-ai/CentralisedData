       <p>
        Today I would like to take the opportunity to mark the life and mourn the passing of Angus Macneil, and celebrate his life. Angus was a stalwart of the Liberal Party in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        , coming from the small town of Rand, near the New South Wales-Victoria border.
       </p>
       <p>
        He contributed significantly to the Liberal Party and also to the broader community. He led a life of tremendous service. He was a very good friend of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Heffernan" rel="nofollow">
         Bill Heffernan
        </a>
        . He was a tremendous supporter of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sussan_Ley" rel="nofollow">
         Sussan Ley
        </a>
        . He was a very well-advised confidant to me and an advisor to me both before I entered this place and since coming to this place.
       </p>
       <p>
        Like Bill, I think he is someone who would be best referred to as a 'busted arse farmer', because he was a sheep farmer following in his father's footsteps on his 2,600 hectare farm with merino sheep, goats and a variety of crops. So our conversations consisted mostly of what was happening in the markets and the weather.
       </p>
       <p>
        He also served for over 25 years on his local council and also worked and served on a number of other advisory boards, industry boards and sectors, as well as working with the Liberal Party for well in excess of the 20 years I was involved. In 2019, was awarded the honour of becoming a

         Member of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        for his service to primary industries. Anyone who knew Angus would just adore Angus. He was a great character, and a great person to have as part of your team.
       </p>
       <p>
        Angus, thank you for your contribution to our party, to our community and to the country, and sincerest condolences to Gail and your daughters Georgie and Kate.
