        My question is to the Minister for Jobs and Innovation, Senator Cash. Can the minister further update the Senate about the Turnbull government's commitment to creating jobs in my home state of Tasmania, particularly in the north and north-west regions?

         I thank Senator Bushby for the question. The Turnbull government said at the last election that we would deliver jobs and growth in the Australian economy, and now, with record jobs growth and strong economic growth, we are delivering to Australians on that commitment. Our continued focus is on seeing more Australians get into jobs, and the Turnbull government's commitment to tax relief for both individuals and for businesses makes our economy even stronger.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Bushby and the Tasmanian team would be pleased to know that every taxpayer in Braddon will be better off with the personal tax relief that passed through the Senate, including the 39,266 taxpayers who will receive immediate relief in the 2018-19 tax year, and the 14,300 who will receive the maximum amount of $530. Of course, we're also creating jobs in the seat of Braddon. Since the coalition was elected in 2013, the economy in Braddon has created 1,800 jobs. Compare this to the former Labor government, when they were in office between 2007 and 2013. The Tasmanian team will be horrified to know that 500 jobs were actually shed from the economy. Under Labor, the unemployment rate in Braddon was 9.1 per cent. It was 9.1 per cent under Labor and the Greens. It has now come down—it still has a way to go—to 6.3 per cent.
        </p>
        <p>
         On Friday, I was delighted to be in Burnie in Tasmania with our candidate for the seat of Braddon, Mr Brett Whiteley. Yet again, we were announcing more programs to get people off welfare and into work.

            On Friday, I announced—and, also, Senator Colbeck joined me for part of the announcement—a Regional Employment Trials Program. This is all about giving 10 regions across Australia the ability to create localised employment solutions. Why? Because we want to get individuals off welfare and into work, because when you're in work, guess what: you are paying tax instead of relying on welfare. Under the Turnbull government, colleagues will be pleased to know that welfare dependency is at the lowest in 25 years.
           </p>
           <p>
            I had the opportunity to meet a young man called Sean on Friday in Burnie. Sean had been looking for employment for a while and was pleased to tell me that he had secured a job and would be commencing employment shortly. He told me he'd been assisted by his jobactive provider, and, as a result of that assistance, he was off welfare and getting into work.

               The contrast for Australians now between the coalition government and those on the other side has never been starker. We, the coalition government, have delivered income tax relief to the Australian people. The contrast is this: Labor have openly said that they will go to the next election campaigning for higher taxes. The coalition under Mr Turnbull continues to back businesses with lower taxes, because we know this will generate more investment and allow businesses to grow. And when you allow businesses to grow, as Senator Cormann has said so many times, they will create more jobs. But Mr Shorten and Labor fight us every single step of the way. They don't seem to understand that a business that has to close employs no-one. Like most, we're delighted to see that Mr Albanese is finally talking some sense. If only he could now, though, convince those on the other side to support our business tax cuts.
