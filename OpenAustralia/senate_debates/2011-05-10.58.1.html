           As I said, tonight the Treasurer will hand down his fourth budget. This is a budget that will get us back in the black, get more Australians in jobs and spread the opportunities of the mining boom. It will be a budget that is marked by its commitment to sound financial management, a budget that recognises the challenges of the mining boom and leverages its opportunities for the benefit of all Australians. This sound financial management will be evident in the choices that we have made in this budget and in the fastest fiscal consolidation that we have seen since the 1960s. As we know,

              Senator Brandis is so concerned about budget deficits he perhaps ought to speak to the economic spokespeople on his side who are presiding over a complete mess when it comes to their fiscal position: an $11 billion black hole in their election policies and a party that would be in deficit in every year of the forward estimates. We are very focused in this budget on our priorities, on the fiscal discipline that is required, on training the Australian workforce and on lifting participation across our economy.

                 The government has made its priorities clear. This is about getting us back into the black, getting more Australians into jobs and spreading the opportunities of the mining boom, and we will outline a budget which sets out a clear path to the return to surplus, which we are committed to. But what will be interesting to see this week in this parliament is whether the opposition are prepared to apply the same discipline to themselves that they are asserting the government should adhere to. I think we should be running a bit of a wager as to whether they will front up. I wager they will not front up and do what they say they will do. Those opposite might want to know that your shadow Treasurer,
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Hockey" rel="nofollow">
                  Mr Hockey
                 </a>
                 , has committed to bringing the budget back to surplus on your figures by next year. That is what Mr Hockey has said, but he has not done the numbers to work out how.
