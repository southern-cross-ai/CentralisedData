        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. I draw the minister’s attention to a report on ABC radio, which stated that Aboriginal domestic violence is ‘now widely acknowledged to be devastating Indigenous communities around Australia’. That statement was made on 23 July 2003. It was made following the Prime Minister’s summit on domestic violence in Indigenous communities, which was held in Canberra that day with 16 Indigenous leaders from around Australia. Minister, what has the government done over the three intervening years to assist
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
         Indigenous Australians
        </a>
        at community level to deal with this very significant problem? Why does the upcoming summit on Indigenous violence, three years after the Prime Minister’s one, now have no Indigenous participation? Given that Australia seems to have discovered—or rediscovered—that domestic violence is still devastating Indigenous communities, can the minister indicate what will be different this time with this summit?

         I thank Senator Bartlett for asking a very important question. As a result of the work of Mr Brough, I think this has been able to focus community attention on the problems that are being experienced in Indigenous communities. I think it signals in a very powerful way the government’s concern about this. The levels of family violence and child abuse in some Indigenous communities require an urgent multilateral response. The widespread and endemic nature of the problem is highlighted by the recent
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         report on child sexual assault in Indigenous communities. This is why the Australian government has called state and territory premiers and chief ministers or their ministerial representatives to attend an urgent summit on 26 June in Canberra. The summit will focus on improved law enforcement, child protection and criminal justice to protect those who are the subject of or at risk of violence and abuse.

               Thank you. The summit will also look at the appropriate role of customary law in related criminal proceedings. The outcomes of the summit will be considered by the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Australian_Governments" rel="nofollow">
                Council of Australian Governments
               </a>
               at its meeting in July. The Australian government, I can assure the Senate, will do its part. But it cannot succeed alone. That is why the states and territories should join us in delivering immediate and practical responses to this crisis. Mr Brough makes the point that states and territories must meet their responsibilities, especially for policing and child protection.
              </p>
              <p>
               Vulnerable people need to be protected wherever they live and they need to have confidence in the criminal justice system. The government does not accept that violence and abuse are a traditional part of Indigenous culture or are condoned by it. Individuals and communities must also find the courage to act. People must have the confidence and support to report these crimes and give evidence. This is essential if we are going to break the cycle of violence and abuse. The government supports those Indigenous people who have taken a stand on these issues and it encourages more

                Indigenous Australians
               </a>
               to do the same.
              </p>
              <p>
               In conclusion, the government has shown its commitment to work in partnership with the states and territories and Indigenous Australians to prevent and reduce family violence. This is a very important issue. It is entirely appropriate that this matter be discussed in this chamber. I would encourage all senators to show support for the government’s actions in this area rather than involving themselves, Senator Wong, in childish comments in this chamber.

                I thank the minister for that answer. Could the minister ascertain, I presume through Mr Brough, whether he would be able to table in the Senate any letter of invitation that has been sent to the participants in the latest summit and a copy of the proposed agenda? I also ask the minister whether he would acknowledge that all governments—state, territory and federal; Liberal and Labor, and, indeed, any support from minor parties as well that has been provided along the way—have failed dramatically in this area? Given that that is the case, would the minister not acknowledge that a meeting of government ministers from around the country would benefit from actually hearing from some Indigenous people themselves about what they believe needs to be done and how best to go about doing it?

                 I will refer your request to Mr Brough to see whether he is prepared to table the information that you are seeking. I will raise that with him. You also raised the question: who has the responsibilities? I suppose you would have to say that, over the long haul, these problems have mounted over a considerable period of time. We do note that the Labor Party is in power in the six states and two territories. We notice that the state governments have primary responsibility for issues like policing.
