             Given the absolute neglect of the Liberal Party on child care, we are investing a record $14.4 billion in childcare benefit and childcare rebate to help Australian families. That is $8 billion more than was provided under the Howard government. It is not just about more funding but also about improving the standards and quality of childcare services provided.

                . So the government is undertaking a very ambitious reform to the quality of child care. I do not have any information on the childcare centre that the senator has raised, but I am happy to seek out that information and try to provide it to him. The government has undertaken independent economic modelling and found that the average out-of-pocket cost increases for a family on $80,000 would be 57c per week in 2010-11 rising to $8.67 per week by 2014-15 for one child to attend full time a long day care centre. The future of our children is absolutely critical and we make absolutely no apology for improving the quality of services to parents, the quality of teaching in those childcare centres and the quality of vocational education to childcare providers. That is what the government is undertaking. The previous Howard government neglected the sector, neglected child care.

                 , I have a supplementary question. Given the findings by Access Economics that childcare costs for parents under the National Quality Framework may increase by up to $12 a day per child, and given that for a family with two children this increase of $120 per week is not something that the average Australian family can afford, what plans does the government have in place to compensate families for the additional costs of child care to ensure they are not forced out of the workforce and their children out of an early learning opportunity?

                  In terms of the cost of the reforms to parents, I think I have gone through the independent economic modelling showing 57c per week in 2010-11 and $8.67 in 2014-15; but, as Senator Wong has just said, we should never forget that it was the Rudd government that increased the childcare rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. That was a commitment that was given prior to the last election and it was a commitment that the government stuck to and delivered for Australian families. What is the record of the opposition—the Liberal Party and the National Party—on child care? Absolute neglect. On their watch,

                       , I have a further supplementary question. Why is the government slashing the childcare rebate and putting mums and dads out of pocket by an extra $278 per child per year just to save a few dollars but is willing to splurge $202 million on accommodation for babysitting asylum seekers?

                         : I have a lot of time for you, Senator Fielding, but I have to say that, on that question, you have completely missed the mark. This government has delivered on its commitment to increase the rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent. In terms of the change in the budget, the vast majority of Australian families—some 97 per cent—will not be affected by the change arising out of the budget. We are extremely proud of the work that this government has done in terms of child care and childhood development. It took the Rudd government to put childhood development on the map. The Rudd government put lifelong learning on the map.
