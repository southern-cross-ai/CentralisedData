         I thank Senator Back for this important question and for his ongoing support for free trade and the particular benefits to the great state of

         . When we talk about innovation, we talk about any process, any product or any new service that comes into being because people have either come up with new ideas or they have responded to changing demands and consumption in the marketplace.
        </p>
        <p>
         One of the prerequisites for really good innovation is competition, and these free trade agreements that we have been entering into over the last few years will increase the intensity of competition in the Australian economy. They will increase the intensity of competition and will mean that our own firms will not only have access to new markets but also face competition here at home. That is a rising tide that can lift all boats. By allowing Australian business to become more agile, we ensure that our economy will be adapting in new markets and thriving from them. We are going to be agile, we are going to be nimble and we are going to be innovative.

          Absolutely. It is an exciting time to be an Australian. It is an exciting time to be in government. The numerous free trade agreements that the government has signed over the past two years will allow Australian business leaders and entrepreneurs much greater access into Asia-Pacific countries, and allowing Australians to travel to major regional economies will foster the exchange of ideas across our borders. These free trade agreements will deliver billions of dollars of additional export income for Australia across a variety of goods and services, from iron ore to education, health services and beef—and the list goes on. The opportunities offered in these free trade agreements—

            There is great excitement across lots of sectors of the Australian economy. Our lucrative mining sector will benefit, with tariffs and quotas on mineral exports slashed right around the region. Further, there are mining equipment and services, which are sources of innovation. We have one of the most innovative mining equipment services and technology sectors in the world—all set to become a global powerhouse. Services sectors across Australia are set to gain unprecedented access to regional markets.

            There you go, Senator Edwards: always excited, and more excited than usual today. Education, our nation's single-largest service export, will have more access into foreign economies than it ever has. Health services will be allowed to operate across the Asia-Pacific. Financial services, legal services and other professional services—all lucrative Australian sectors—will now have opportunities like never before.
