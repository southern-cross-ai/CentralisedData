        My question is also addressed to the Minister for Immigration and

        . I ask: will the minister advise the Senate on the extent of state and territory use of skilled migration, is the minister aware of any efforts to have particular occupations placed on the list of migration occupations in demand and, further, is the minister aware of any policy alternatives?

         I thank the senator for his very astute question. The states and territories, of course, are big users of skilled migration. They recognise their need for more people. They recognise they need people in the factories doing engineering work, in hospitals and in almost every facet of life. They have taken the opportunity to work with the Australian government to try and shape the population that goes to their state. Different states have a different emphasis on different industries and different needs at any one time, which is why the Australian government has been determined over the last few years to work very closely with the state governments and help them get the people they need. I am pleased to say that they have recognised that and they recognise that immigration can build state and territory economies and it can create jobs. In other words, the people on this side of the chamber, to use an expression that the other side of the chamber might understand, are on the tools. We are doing the job. We are out there creating jobs for Australians. Skilled immigration is a part of it.

          I am tempted to say something about the other side, but I will leave that. The number of skilled migrants under state and territory sponsored categories has been dramatically increasing. In my own state of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           South Australia
          </a>
          it has gone from 750 in 2001 to almost 8,200 in 2005-06; and in Victoria, from 1,827 in 2001 to 10,500 in 2005-06. These states are star performers at recognising an opportunity to work with the Australian government, taking that opportunity, putting their political differences aside and getting on with it. The states and territories are also big users of 457 visas. Almost 10 per cent of all temporary skilled migrants in 2006 were for state and territory governments or instrumentalities. They are helping business and industry sustain and increase productivity growth.

          The flexible system allows changing demands for skills to be met. The MODL, the migration occupations in demand list, is something that is updated every six months, and senators will understand that you get extra points for having particular skills, but if you have the migration occupation in demand skills you get extra points again. Last month we added childcare coordinators, which we thought was a good idea. It allows priority processing of applications for people with that skill—more points and priority processing—to help that industry meet the need.

          Mr Beazley called it an absolute disgrace and a short-sighted move that this is what we had done. My office recalled a letter from the shadow minister for work, family and community and shadow minister for youth and early education,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanya_Plibersek" rel="nofollow">
           Tanya Plibersek
          </a>
          . It was written in June last year and it was asking how long day care centres could access childcare coordinators and workers through skilled migration. I thought, ‘That is a bit unusual,’ because what Ms Plibersek wanted was long day care centres to access these skills through migration. She recognised more than a year ago that skilled migration could help that industry. She specifically asked whether childcare workers and coordinators were on the list and went further and said, ‘And, if not, why not?’
         </p>
         <p>
          I advised her that childcare workers were not on the skills lists but that coordinators were on the skilled occupation list but not yet on the MODL. So we have a situation where we now put them on the MODL. Tanya Plibersek, the shadow minister, should be very happy. Mr Beazley is unhappy. He says it is a disgrace. We have not heard from Tanya Plibersek. Senator Wong has been out there trying to use this opportunity to talk about child care. Ms Plibersek has been told to be quiet—say nothing. The childcare union—
