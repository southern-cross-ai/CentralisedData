        My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig. Prior to announcing the suspension of live cattle trade to Indonesia, what consultation or discussions did the government have with industry? With which producers, which exporters and which industry organisations did the government consult? When and how did this consultation take place?

         It is clear that industry has been on notice on this issue for some time. My office and I have been talking with industry about how to improve animal welfare outcomes in Indonesia and other markets as well. What the industry repre­sentatives and industry bodies together have brought back to my office has never gone far enough or provided us sufficient confidence that they would be able to deal with the live animal export industry and ensure the animal welfare outcomes that we would accept. No-one would accept the animal welfare outcomes that we saw on the ABC

         program.
        </p>
        <p>
         This government has been working closely with industry to ensure that we can continue to have a live animal export industry. It has been working with them not only at the time of the ABC program but post that as well, continuously, to ensure that we can highlight the fact that this industry needs to take responsibility for the animal welfare outcomes in Indonesia. This industry has allowed the self-regulatory approach to continue without the necessary checks and balances that are required. If you look at the actions that I have taken, you see an immediate investigation into the footage and evidence was undertaken by the

          , I rise on a point of order. Nothing the minister has said is directly relevant to the only issue raised in the question: what consultations were there with the industry about the suspension? Generalities about consultation with the industry about animal welfare are not directly relevant to the only issue: what consultation was there about the suspension? Now the minister is meandering off in another direction which is less relevant still.

             Those opposite do not accept the actions I have taken. I have been clear about this: the live animal export industry will not recommence until we can ensure animal welfare outcomes. Those in the opposition might want to play politics with this, but this is an issue where we have to ensure animal welfare outcomes are taken into account.

               Broadly, because it is not the usual practice to go through, piece by piece, individual conversations with overseas governments, what I can outline is that in terms of our bilateral relationship Indonesia is and continues to be an important trading nation for Australia. What we have done both through my department, the

                  It would help, as I am trying to listen to the minister's answers, if people on both sides were not screaming in my ear. That would be the first thing that would assist.

                   As I was saying, the Indonesian trade minister has stressed in her public comments that the Australian actions represent a temporary suspension and that Indonesia is keen to improve practices.
