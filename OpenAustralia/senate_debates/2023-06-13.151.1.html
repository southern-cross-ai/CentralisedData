        It is a levy-benefit scheme where levies are paid on the importation or production of oils and their synthetic substitutes. Levies fund benefits paid to oil re-refiners ensuring the financial responsibility to manage waste oil is borne by those who benefit from its use.

       <p class="italic">
        Since 2016 the scheme has fallen into deficit, levy collections have not been sufficient to cover the cost of benefit payments. This has meant taxpayers have covered the difference.

        The passage of this bill will see this long-running deficit remedied. No longer will taxpayers pay for the scheme's shortfall.
