        My question is the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. Following the disgraceful incident at the Perth home of Woodside
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        Meg O'Neill yesterday in which protesters tried to invade her home, has the Prime Minister sought an explanation from the ABC about the involvement of one of its television crews in the incident and how the ABC was provided with the home address of Woodside's CEO?

         I share Senator Henderson's concerns about the way in which the media were alerted of this. People have a right to their privacy. People's families have a right to feel safe. I think all of us would say that we have legitimate political protests in our nation and people have a lot of different views, but that right to protest and that freedom of expression that is part of that, the democratic rights that expresses, have to be utilised responsibly. I personally don't believe, and I think most of us would share this belief, that it's responsible for such protests to be taken to someone's home where their family is.
        </p>
        <p>
         I don't have any information in relation to how or what happened in relation to the ABC. I will certainly see if there's anything I can do to provide further information about that matter.

           Senator, if the protesters informed the ABC they were going to that address, was it appropriate for the ABC to embargo news of such a reckless protest? Should a responsible journalist have considered alerting police to their advanced knowledge of an intended illegal act?

             The advice I've received—and, again, Senator Henderson, I will add to this answer if I'm able to—is the minister has responded in the House that she has sought further information from the ABC on this matter in addition to their public statements. She awaits the further advice she has requested. She does note that the ABC has both operational and editorial independence.
            </p>
            <p>
             Senator Henderson, please. No-one in this chamber, I would think, would support what has happened, so let's not—
