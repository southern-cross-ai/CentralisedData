         <p class="moved">
          That the Senate take note of the documents.
         </p>
         <p>
          I want to commend the tabling of the proposal for a childcare centre at
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
           Parliament House
          </a>
          . On a very professional note, I want to say that this is long overdue. Also, I want to publicly commend individuals who, dating back from the construction of this building, have worked incredibly hard to see a childcare centre established in this place. I know that the proposal is talking about the mechanics for it to be constructed, with a view to it opening in January next year. I pay particular tribute to the work of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trish_Crossin" rel="nofollow">
           Trish Crossin
          </a>
          , who has campaigned tirelessly not only on a cross-party basis but also with successive governments and bureaucracies to ensure that one day this place will have a childcare centre.
         </p>
         <p>
          Finally, it is a real indictment of policy makers of successive governments and of this building as it now operates that we have celebrated its 20th anniversary and it still has no amenities for people with children. Do not get me wrong: I am not just talking about members of parliament—and I acknowledge a vested interest. A few of us in this room might have a vested interest, but more than 3,500 people work in this building. How dare we set such a poor example on work and family issues, especially given the unusual and sometimes extraordinary hours that people are expected to work in this place.
         </p>
         <p>
          I am sorry that I will not get to see either the construction of this childcare centre or it operating, but I am really pleased for not only the people who will come after us but also the many media, library staff, general staff and the many people who work in this place. I hope that they will use it. I hope it will expand not only in terms of numbers but also in age range. Again, I want to put on the record how impressed I have been by the work of Senator Trish Crossin and many others over many years in bringing this matter to fruition.
