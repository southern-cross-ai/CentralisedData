           Every single death is one too many. We know that domestic violence against women takes many forms, including coercive control. The decision to legislate in this area sits with states and territories; however, we have committed $4.7 million to invest in legislative reform across the country as part of the $1.1 billion Women's Safety Package. This is the single largest investment in women's safety and acts as a down payment on the next national plan, which is currently being consulted upon.

              opposes this motion. The national crisis is the very existence of violence in our homes and communitiesâ€”violence against men, women, children, the elderly and those living with disabilities. It is fact that males are less likely to be victims of assault from an intimate partner compared to women, but that's not the whole story. When it comes to violence and assaults from other family members, the statistics show that men and women are almost equally likely to suffer. Australia loses six men per day to suicide, and more men died from suicide in 2019 than the entire Australian road toll of 2019 and 2020 combined. Men are 75 per cent more likely to commit suicide than women. These figures are a national tragedy. This motion separates out a portion of the problem without regard for the whole. To solve a problem first requires understanding the problem and its causes and understanding what drives the perpetrator and the victim. To separate out only a part of the problem will perpetuate the violence.
