        My question is to the Minister for Employment, Senator Cash. I refer to the minister's statement in question time yesterday that the free trade agreements with China, Japan and Korea would 'create up to 178,000 jobs by the time those agreements come into full force in 2035'. Does the minister stand by her claim?

         Yes I do and, certainly, that is what I was advised. But I think the more appropriate question for the Senate to be considering is: why do those on the other side hate the China free-trade agreement in particular? Why have you indulged in what is nothing more and nothing less than a xenophobic campaign that is solely aimed at ensuring that Australians going forward, young Australians, will not have the jobs that can be provided to them by the China free-trade agreement?

           , I rise on a point of order: relevance. The senator has been asked to justify the 178,000 jobs that she claimed yesterday. She has made one short statement and then has completely moved away from that justification of the 178,000—

             You have got to love those on the other side, who continue to tell Australians that they are the great job creators, that they are the great protectors of the workers. They will come in here and quibble over the number of jobs that are going to be created by free-trade agreements. Look what

             . This is a government that does not just talk about creating jobs; this is a government that has a plan, a plan of action to ensure that going forward jobs are created for Australians, and you just do not like it.

                (—) (): Sound modelling, I would suggest. Yet again, you come into this place and instead of congratulating us, instead of showing a little bit of bipartisanship when it comes to the issue of job creation, all you do is come into this place and quibble. It is a fact that free-trade agreements do create jobs. It is a fact that more jobs will now be created by those of us on this side of the chamber because we have finally entered into those free-trade agreements. If you look at the modelling by the Centre for International Economics, what does that show in relation to our three free-trade agreements with China, south Korea and Japan? It shows they will create thousands of jobs, make households $4,348 better off and boost

                by $24.4 billion between 2016 and 2035. Again, why do you hate job creation?
