        My question is addressed to the Minister for Human Services. I ask the minister when the new exposure draft of the Human Services (Enhanced Service Delivery) Bill will be made public. When will it be tabled in the Senate? Can the minister outline to the parliament the agreed terms for public consultation, including how the consultations will be conducted, where they will take place and the time frame for those consultations? Will the consultation on this new piece of legislation be managed by the

         Department of Human Services
        </a>
        , with a view to refining any final legislation before parliament considers the bill? What impact will this have on the second request for tender, which was published on the access card website on 31 January, which has the design phase of the card being completed by July this year?

         I will deal with the tender process first. In relation to the question put by Senator Stott Despoja: last week, following my announcement about the release of the exposure draft of the bill, the department wrote to all tenderers and advised them of a briefing session to clarify time lines and to extend steps in the procurement process. I am advised that this briefing took place this morning. My department will continue to be closely engaged with tenderers and will undertake further meetings in relation to the tender evaluation process. These meetings, of course, are focused on the best value for money, and the tenderers will be kept fully informed.
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to the exposure draft, I have said publicly that it is my intention to release that during this fortnight of sittings, and that remains my intention. That exposure draft will be released for discussion for a period of around two months. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Human_Services" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Human Services
         </a>
         of course will take the lead in relation to consultations. But, as well as that, Professor Fels and his committee will continue their work. They have a number of reports to be released. I understand that one is about to be released and there are a couple of others that will be released very soon. That will inform discussion.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have said very clearly that this is a very big initiative. Some 16 million Australians will be affected by it, and we want to make sure that we get things right. In relation to other countries that have embarked upon a similar program, we have seen time lines of six years plus—and I am looking at countries such as Germany and Italy as examples. We need to make sure that, when we do bring the bill before parliament, there has been adequate consultation, and I know that Senator Stott Despoja has been one of those who have called for just that.
        </p>
        <p>
         This decision was informed by my own consultation with stakeholders across the board, ranging from people in the industry sector to those who are involved in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGO" rel="nofollow">
          NGO
         </a>
         s and those involved in those sectors of the community—the aged, those with disabilities, veterans and others—who would be very much affected by this. I think there will be great benefits from the exposure draft. The terms of how it will be dealt with will be released when I deliver the exposure bill.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for his answer and ask the minister if he will table in the Senate or outline to the Senate in his supplementary answer the details—those time frames—that he discussed with the tenderers this morning. I think the Senate would benefit from that information. I thank the minister for his indication that the exposure draft process will be around two months. I ask the minister: when will the final piece of legislation regarding the access card—that is, the final legislation post the exposure draft stage—be introduced into the Senate? The government has indicated a willingness to send that legislation to committee with the consent of the Senate. I ask the minister: when will that take place, or is this just a convenient way by the government of deflecting attention from a potentially electorally unpopular issue and getting rid of a debate before this federal election?

           Firstly, can I just correct Senator Stott Despoja: I never said that the discussions with the tenderers were conducted by me. If they were, then the opposition and others could ask a justified question as to why that was so, because the minister does not get involved in that process. That was my department. It is done at arm’s length from me as minister. I am not privy to those discussions, nor should I be. That is something that the department is handling.
          </p>
          <p>
           But I do wish to correct something that was in the
           <i>

            </a>
           </i>
           today—that is, that companies bidding for access card work are precluded from bidding for other government projects. I am advised by my department that that is not correct, and I just want to place that on the record.
          </p>
          <p>
           As for a legislative timetable, I have said that the government remains committed to the access card. It is a good idea which will deliver benefits to many Australians. But, as to the timing of the legislation, it will depend on the consultation period of the exposure draft. As we know from past experience, you cannot foretell what that will deliver. It depends on how that process goes.
