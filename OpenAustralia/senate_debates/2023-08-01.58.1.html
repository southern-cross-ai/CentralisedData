        was a relentless advocate for the education of Aboriginal children. As an Arrernte elder, professor, writer, artist, linguist and human rights champion, her recent passing leaves a huge gap. Her passing leaves an incredible legacy. Her passing also leaves a path for others to continue her work, and many will benefit from her unwavering commitment to education and bilingual education.

        In 1996, she received an Order of Australia for her service to the Aboriginal community of

        of Indigenous Tertiary Education. She authored and contributed to several books and publications on traditional bush foods, language and identity. The MK Turner report launched soon after her passing, affirming her commitment to Indigenous lead and designed education reform. She never sought power but rather saw the power in others. She saw the power of education delivered through a model that was accessible and engaging and that education committed to the safety and wellbeing of children and the strengthening of families. Its potential is to transform lives.

        The Common Ground report, launched with the endorsement of 100 Indigenous educators from across Australia, talks of the power of ensuring the combination of education, identity, culture and language is embedded in learning, and I was privileged to be able to see the launch. MK knew education was key to transforming lives. She sought meaningful reform of the Australian education system to recognise the crucial elements of language, culture and community. In her own words, 'Teaching is a really sacred thing, because everything that we are learning is sacred.' MK will be honoured with a state funeral later this month and, knowing her personally, with my colleague Jacinta Price, we acknowledge knowledge her passing and contribution.
