          It is bloody good. I'll take that through you, Chair. It is one of the largest agricultural gatherings in the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere" rel="nofollow">
           Southern Hemisphere
          </a>
          . It is more than just a gathering where people get together and talk about their farming and buy and sell things; it is a gathering where like-minded people come together. They talk about things. They have an event which is super. It has been going for over 50 years. Gunnedah is a wonderful place to go to. I've noticed my
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
           New South Wales
          </a>
          Nationals colleagues are on the tools today. They're on the barbeque. They're out there cooking their Teys and Cargill steaks for people. They are having a wonderful time.
         </p>
         <p>
          The agricultural minister was there. I love going there, and, if I weren't here, I would be there on the tools myself. Up there you get to see all the innovations in agriculture. You get to see the different breeds. You get to see the leaders. It is a backbone of rural industry. You get to talk to people experiencing similar problems. Something I do like is the last day deals, where people have taken augers up there to sell and they aren't ready to drive them home again, and you can drive them down and get a great bargain in that last half day up in Gunnedah.
         </p>
         <p>
          I wish my state colleagues well. I wish everyone in Gunnedah well, and I'm sure the agriculture minister, the shadow agriculture minister and everyone here wishes our farmers well as they do everything they can to feed this nation, to feed others and to grow the food and fibre that we need as a country.
         </p>
         <p>
          In Gunnedah, the New South Wales Nationals have their own shed, and we give a $2 donation to a local charity for every sausage sandwich—we don't charge full price—and that funds different things each year. All the MPs get on that. You can go to an MP, tell them you want a well-done steak, boss them around and tell them what kinds of onions and what kind of steak. Get out there, pay your $2 to charity and have a wonderful steak in support of charity.
