         I thank the senator for his question. This government has committed $16½ million over four years to prevent, screen for and treat trachoma in Indigenous communities in

         and

         measure.
        </p>
        <p>
         Trachoma is a preventable bacterial eye infection that is a leading cause of blindness, particularly for people living in remote communities. This funding will renew the agreement between the Commonwealth government and the New South Wales, Northern Territory,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
          South Australian
         </a>
         and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australian
         </a>
         governments for additional trachoma screening, treatment, management and prevention activities. Blindness rates among Indigenous people are more than six times higher than the rest of the population, and trachoma is a contributing factor. The Australian government is a signatory to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization" rel="nofollow">
          World Health Organization
         </a>
         resolution to eliminate blinding trachoma by the year 2020. Trachoma infections can impact on the ability of Indigenous children to receive a good education. Repeated trachoma infections can cause blindness in adults, which impacts on the ability of Indigenous adults to gain meaningful employment.
        </p>
        <p>
         This funding will support at-risk communities through screening and treatment activities and working with local primary-care services, Aboriginal healthcare professionals and teachers to help stop the spread of trachoma through prevention programs. For example, the funding will help build on the Northern Territory's Clean Faces, Strong Eyes campaign, which has successfully encouraged face washing to prevent the spread of trachoma in children.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would also like to acknowledge the efforts in this area through the Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust. Just yesterday, I met with

            n governments for trachoma control and treatment activities. Treatment activities and milestones include screening at least 85 per cent of five- to nine-year-olds in at-risk communities for trachoma, treatment of at least 85 per cent of trachoma cases and follow-up of any household contact.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have travelled to the remote communities in outback Northern Territory, Western Australia and Queensland and seen firsthand the need for programs like Clean Faces, Strong Eyes. Through this funding and agreement, jurisdictions provide surveillance and treatment data to the National Trachoma Surveillance and Reporting Unit. As a result of the collection and analysis of this data, we can see the prevalence has significantly decreased in five- to nine-year-olds in screened communities from 14 per cent in 2009 to four per cent in 2012.
