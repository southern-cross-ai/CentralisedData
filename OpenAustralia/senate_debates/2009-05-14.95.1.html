            <p>
             These amendments concern legislating lending criteria. This is all about making sure that up to $28 billion from the public purse has good governance around it, and is not left it to regulations. To have the very key area of lending criteria determined not by this parliament but by regulation I think would be very dangerous. So the amendments Family First have put forward here are to legislate the lending criteria. It makes sense that the lending criteria are no less strict than those required by other commercially competitive banks. So that is what we are seeking to do with these amendments. It is prudent and it makes sense to do it as the parliament rather than leaving it to regulations, and that is what these particular amendments are about.

              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_Fielding" rel="nofollow">
               Senator Fielding
              </a>
              ’s amendments, the government very reluctantly will support that. Clause 8, page 6, lines 16 and 17 we, equally reluctantly, support. We welcome clause 8, page 6, after line 17—the amendment that ensures that lending criteria are of a high standard and that the standard is set down in law. As I indicated, we reluctantly support the absolute time limit on time of loans, and we reluctantly support the limit to commercial property. But we do expect the Senate’s cooperation if ABIP is required to lend outside commercial property to support jobs. If that circumstance arises, we will return and we will need to deal with that very speedily because of the structure of the legislation that we are putting in place today. So we would hope that we can expect the chamber’s cooperation on that matter.

               I was just about to make sure that the focus of this particular debate was just on that one set of amendments: (1), (3) and (7). The crux of it is that ABIP Ltd must be satisfied that the lending criteria applied by ABIP Ltd in assessing the application for financing or refinancing under the arrangements are no less prudent than the lending criteria for investment-grade loans that the members of ABIP Ltd, other than the Commonwealth, would apply when deciding whether to enter into such an arrangement in the ordinary course of their business. That is what we are focusing on from there.

                  (3A)    An approval under subparagraph (3)(b)(ii) is not a legislative instrument, but is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46B of the

                   Acts Interpretation Act 1901

                 <p>
                  These amendments go to, I suppose, an area that has been a little contentious—what ABIP can actually refinance, or what types of loans they can provide. The whole premise of ABIP as it was put forward in the public’s mind was about helping commercial property funding. The idea here is that there is a tightening of funds and there could be some circumstances where commercial property comes up for refinancing. They are very complex issues. One partner of a syndicate might, for various reasons, pull out. It could be because an overseas bank or financier, having had restrictions or limitations placed on them, is unable to refinance their portion of a particular loan for commercial property.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The whole idea was that the focus would be on commercial property. In the legislation it also said the financing could be for other things, and I think that makes it too open ended. Parliament would be giving broad approval without knowing what these other things were actually for. I do not want to overly focus on the other things as we could get quite emotive and raise a few items that could be considered other things. I think it is very prudent that, if you are going to have up to $28 billion of funds from the public purse, there needs to be some confidence about what it is going to be used for. What we have to do is make sure it is for commercial property, but if ABIP and the minister believe they need to do financing in areas other than commercial property, then it really has to come back to parliament basically to make sure that approval is given before ABIP actually makes the loan. That is what those amendments (2), (4) and (5) on sheet 5785 are actually doing.

I discussed this during my second reading contribution.

                        We have had some extensive debate on the important amendment from the
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">

                        which would put a cap on salaries of $1 million for those who are to benefit out of the loans arrangements that are facilitated by this legislation. The minister has said that our amendments do not go far enough in terms of restricting what the Prime Minister has described as obscene take-home payments. I want to be more direct with the minister about this. The Greens will not be supporting this legislation if the government does not agree either to the amendment that we have put forward or to an alternative which satisfies us that the government is taking action, as have many similar countries around the world. The debate on this legislation is now going to go into the next period of sittings. I expect that the Prime Minister will engage in discussions with the Greens to come up with a provision which at least deals with the potential for

                        s of development organisations to have millions of dollars going to them in one way or another in take-home moneys from corporations which have at-risk loan arrangements guaranteed through the government.

                       <p>
                        I hope that the government understands clearly how important this measure is as far as the Greens are concerned. I make this offer to the government that we have serious negotiations about how to bring in an amendment, if the government cannot support this amendment, which does put a cap on those beneficiaries of the loan arrangements that are in here at the taxpayer’s expense. It is a serious matter and we want it taken seriously. We want action on it. I can do no more than make this public appeal, having written to the Prime Minister a number of times to get some action from the government on the matter.
