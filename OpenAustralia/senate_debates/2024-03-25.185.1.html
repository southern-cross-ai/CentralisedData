       <p>
        I rise to speak on the Broadcasting Services Amendment (Community Television) Bill 2024, a bill which underlines the significant role that community television plays in our communities, particularly in Melbourne, Geelong and Adelaide, where Channels 31 and 44 provide very valuable local coverage of local issues and events and, of course, give very important opportunities for emerging industry professionals. As a Geelong based Liberal senator I hold this issue very close to my heart. When I worked for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Indigenous_Television" rel="nofollow">
         National Indigenous Television
        </a>
        , I worked very closely with Channel 31 in Melbourne, and, in fact, we contracted the highly regarded
        <i>
         Marngrook Footy Show
        </i>
        , which was compulsory viewing for anyone who had any interest at all in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">
         AFL
        </a>
        footy. So I've seen on the ground, from the grass roots of community television, what a very significant role channels like Channel 31 play.
       </p>
       <p>
        Community
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">
         TV
        </a>
        has for decades been integral to our media landscape, not just because it offers a genuine platform for community engagement on issues which matter, particularly at a local level, but also because it offers aspiring industry professionals a very important foot in the door. For example, on the
        <i>
         Marngrook Footy Show
        </i>
        , there was everyone from hosts to cameramen, producers, scriptwriters and sound recordists. That was a program, which, just on its own, engaged so many people right across the television sector. There are so many programs on community television doing just that. The transition of these channels onto digital platforms has long been a topic of discussion. In 2014, the coalition government announced plans to move these stations online, citing the need to utilise broadcast spectrum for wider public benefit. Spectrum refers to the use of the airwaves, be it for television or indeed for mobile services, so this amendment goes very much to the heart of how the government manages that spectrum.
       </p>
       <p>
        To be frank, this government's record is not a good one. We have previously seen the Minister for Communications mismanage spectrum very badly in relation to round 6 of the Mobile Black Spot Program. This is the notorious funding round where the minister personally provided direction as to which project should get funding. In Victoria and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        , 100 per cent of these black spot locations were in Labor electorates. It was a shocking misuse of taxpayer funding and a real betrayal of so many communities which did not get a look-in when they raised deep concerns about black spots in their area. We certainly look forward to the results of the investigation by the Auditor-General in relation to round 6 of the mobile black spots fund over the next couple of months. We also await the outcome of an investigation by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Commissioner" rel="nofollow">
         Information Commissioner
        </a>
        into the minister's refusal to provide key documents on this very grubby affair under an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOI" rel="nofollow">
         FOI
        </a>
        application.
       </p>
       <p>
        More broadly, this government has a deeply questionable record when it comes to the Communications portfolio. Labor's ill-considered misinformation bill has been widely criticised by everyone from lawyers all across this country to human rights and civil liberties groups. The communications minister has claimed that the government wants to be very open and transparent about the misinformation bill. This, however, is gross hypocrisy from a minister who failed to reveal she planned to give herself the power to direct her own misinformation investigations.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Albanese government should also be condemned for failing to support the recommendation of the eSafety Commissioner for a trial of age-assurance technology aimed at protecting children online from harmful content. Now we're hearing the eSafety Commissioner say that there are in fact a range of technologies being used for age verification for gambling and alcohol. It is time for the minister to admit that she got it wrong. It is time for the minister to protect children from dangerous content online. And it is time for the minister and the Albanese Labor government to support the coalition's policy to implement the eSafety Commissioner's recommendation.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's no wonder that this government has failed to deliver the answers that community broadcasters are crying out for. It has been completely preoccupied by so many other matters—all the wrong priorities—including the Voice referendum. The neglect of the support of community television can be added to a number of issues for which this government has failed to deliver answers.
       </p>
       <p>
        The future of community stations hinges on proper consultation and negotiation, yet the government's lack of engagement with stakeholders is very disappointing. Why hasn't there been meaningful collaboration with community television stations and the telecommunications industry? Why do community TV stations continue to operate in a state of uncertainty? The Broadcasting Services Amendment (Community Television) Bill 2024, while aiming to extend the deadline for community television stations, ultimately fails to provide the certainty these stations need. The can is kicked down the road, in other words.
       </p>
       <p>
        So now the decision in relation to the future for community television is postponed until after the next election, further prolonging the uncertainty for this very important sector of our media landscape. The government's inaction on this is unacceptable.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_television" rel="nofollow">
         Community television
        </a>
        stations deserve clarity and support, not postponements and indecision. I put to this chamber: it's time for the government to prioritise the future of community television and engage in meaningful dialogue with stakeholders to chart a clear path forward. I urge those on the other side of the chamber to consider the ramifications of this bill very carefully. We cannot afford to let indecision and inaction dictate the fate of community television in Australia. It must continue to thrive and serve as a vital platform for local voices.

         I can barely believe my ears. They must deceive me! For years and years, the Liberal and National parties were trying to kick community television off air. When in opposition, I sat in estimates after estimates and put questions to the then minister, questions to the department, where I was told, over and over again, there was no cost in keeping them on air and no alternative use for the spectrum, yet they wanted them gone. They were trying to boot them off air. That is the truth of what has happened over the past few years in community television broadcasting. That is the truth. It cost you nothing to keep community television. You had no other plan for them. You just wanted them gone. It was an ideological attack by the Liberal and National parties against community television. It was absurd on any level you can think or measure, and those estimates hearings were absurd. Absolutely absurd.
        </p>
        <p>
         The good people who work in community television, the many volunteers in community television, the members of my community who rely on community television to tell their stories, they know the truth. They know the truth, that you were coming after community television. You tried and you tried and you tried, and we stopped you. We stood shoulder to shoulder with community television in this country, in Adelaide and in Melbourne. We stood shoulder to shoulder with them against these attacks because we knew their value, we know their value.
        </p>
        <p>
         In my community, during the pandemic it was community television which broadcast religious services of many different faiths. It provided that hugely important connection for people in my community to their faith at a time when they couldn't go to church, they couldn't go to temple, they couldn't go to those religious services. That was hugely important, as was the critical information in a range of languages which matter deeply to my community.
        </p>
        <p>
         In South Australia, community television is there. It shows up when we're sad, when we're celebrating, when we have those key and critical events across our state like the Fringe.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_television" rel="nofollow">
          Community television
         </a>
         is there because it is a part of us; it is a part of the fabric of our community. And I have sat with members of our station, year after year, as they have grappled with an inability to get the fundraising dollars they need, the advertising revenue they need to provide security to their employees, who are passionate about the work they do, and security to their volunteers.
        </p>
        <p>
         You could barely find a famous comedian, actor or presenter in Australia who didn't get their start in some way on community television or community radio. My community loves community television. They get it, and they don't believe the nonsense I've just heard tonight. They know the Liberal and National parties wanted them gone for no reason. Do you know what? All community television have been asking for is transparency in their future, and some kind of reasonable, logical, rational pathway. They are making great strides in their work to get online. They have launched an online platform. It is an amazing thing. But the absurdity was during the pandemic, during these years, when they did not have that certainty. In fact, they were being threatened with being kicked off every few months. 'Indecision' is the wrong word.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Liberals" rel="nofollow">
          The Liberals
         </a>
         and Nationals wanted them gone. This bill is not about getting rid of community television; this bill is about giving transparency and security in the future of community television.
        </p>
        <p>
         On this side, we get the value of community television. We stood up to the Liberal and National parties in the face of the absurdity of their conviction against community television. There is so much to value in this bill. I know it means a hell of a lot to the people who work in community television, to the volunteers in community television, to the people in Adelaide and Melbourne who watch community television and who love community television. It is a good bill, it does a good thing and it reverses the stupidity and callousness of the decisions the Liberal and National parties took—year after year after year, estimates after estimates after estimates—when they said, 'It costs nothing to keep them there. We have no plans for the spectrum. We just want them gone.' That is what they did. This bill is taking a very different path. I am proud of it. Let's have some truth in the debate. I commend the bill to the Senate.
