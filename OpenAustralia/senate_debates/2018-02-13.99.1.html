         I thank Senator Duniam for his question. I'm very pleased to advise colleagues that, among the 30,000 jobs created through the rollout of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
          NBN
         </a>
         , there's a particular focus on providing training and employment for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
          Indigenous Australians
         </a>
         within their local communities. All of NBN's construction and maintenance partners are required to prepare and report on Aboriginal and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
          Torres Strait Islander
         </a>
         engagement and participation management plans, which include targets for Indigenous employment and supplier spend.
        </p>
        <p>
         In financial year 2017, NBN's delivery partners achieved, on average, 4.5 per cent Indigenous employment on NBN projects, which was in line with the specified target of between four and five per cent. NBN's delivery partners also spent over $14 million with Indigenous suppliers in financial year 2017. In one example, NBN's construction contractor,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulton_Hogan" rel="nofollow">
          Fulton Hogan
         </a>
         , became aware that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander workers from the Ngarrindjeri Regional Authority, who were recruited for cultural heritage monitoring of earthworks, were also keen to be engaged with construction. Instead of solely being observers, these workers were able to participate in the NBN build in South Australia's south-east. Many of these workers have gained technical training, funded by NBN, and completed certificates in civil construction and telecommunication cabling.
        </p>
        <p>
         Internally, NBN is also engaging with existing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander staff and graduates on employment strategies that will attract more Indigenous workers and on the range of professional development opportunities available within the company and more broadly across the project. This is some extremely good news for workers to have this opportunity and to gain further skills.

            awards, where NBN took out the award for the most popular employer in the infrastructure, utilities and logistics category. NBN offers a highly sought-after two-year graduate program and encourages applicants from all backgrounds and a range of study disciplines, including engineering, business, commerce and
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT" rel="nofollow">

Each graduate is provided with an individually tailored employment experience, aligned to their area of study and career interest, which includes four main rotations throughout the various business units. Graduates at NBN have an opportunity to play a part in the delivery of Australia's largest and most complex infrastructure project. They're individually supported by a program manager and previous NBN graduates.

               The rollout is now more than halfway complete. There are an estimated 20,000 businesses connecting to the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
                NBN
               </a>
               network each month. Close to 80 per cent of regional Australia now has access to superfast broadband, meaning that small business owners in country towns and regional centres can enjoy access equal to that of metropolitan areas. As the rollout continues to scale, NBN is enabling businesses of all sizes to tap into a whole range of applications.
              </p>
              <p>
               Of course, this progress, which has seen over one million NBN services activated since July, is only possible because of the turnaround that's been effected in the project. Connecting more homes and businesses sooner is the key to keeping internet bills affordable and the overall cost of the project as low as possible for taxpayers. For every million connections completed, more than half a billion dollars is added to NBN's annual revenue.
