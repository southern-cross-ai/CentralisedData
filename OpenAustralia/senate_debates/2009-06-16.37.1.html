        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Evans. Can the minister inform the Senate of the progress on rolling out the government’s nation-building economic stimulus plan? For example, does the minister have details of the number of housing and schools projects which have started and the benefits these are providing to our local communities? In particular, the nation-building and economic stimulus plan provides a great chance for 2.9 million Australian households to improve the energy efficiency of their homes by taking up the opportunity to have ceiling insulation installed for free. Does the minister know how many households have taken up the opportunity under the plan to get free insulation?

         I thank Senator McEwen for the question. The stimulus plan of the Rudd Labor government is well underway around the country and is providing jobs in local communities. The stimulus plan is working. The stimulus package is expected to raise the level of gross domestic product by 2¾ percentage points in 2009-10 and 1½ percentage points in 2010-11, supporting up to 210,000 jobs. The government’s aim was to get the stimulus money out and working quickly. We now know that more than 27,000 Australian homeowners have had the ceiling insulation actually installed in their homes. While those opposite are contemptuous about this, those people regard that as a very important way of managing their household expenditure on power bills. Twenty-seven thousand have already got the ceiling insulation in. Construction of nearly 270 new social housing dwellings is underway; 270 are already started, with more to come. Work is well advanced on repairs to and maintenance of social housing, with work already completed on over 9,000 houses.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Housing_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Defence Housing Australia
         </a>
         has started 233 of the 800 houses they are building for our defence personnel.
        </p>
        <p>
         Every school in Australia has now been allocated between $50,000 and $200,000 for maintenance and repairs. Work has started on the projects approved in round 1 for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_Schools" rel="nofollow">
          Primary Schools
         </a>
         for the 21st Century project, and construction has started at 300 sites to build libraries, halls and classrooms at primary schools around the country. So the stimulus is working, jobs are being created, projects are underway and there is more to come to try and protect Australia from the impacts of the world economic downturn. But the stimulus package has been delivered in local communities now, delivering jobs now.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Can the minister inform the Senate of other views on the effects of the government’s nation-building economic stimulus plan? Has the government had an opportunity to consider those opinions, and what conclusions can the government draw about the success of the nation-building economic stimulus plan in helping to cushion the effects of the global recession on the Australian economy? In particular, is the minister aware of any expert views on the effect that the economic stimulus plan is having on the global economy?

            What is clear is that the opposition are not experts, because they opposed the stimulus plan. They opposed many of the measures that are delivering jobs and supporting our economy, although I note many of them turn up to the openings and launches of these projects. I was at one the other day. The local Liberal member voted against it in the House of Representatives, but he turned up at the council to try and get associated. In fact, he is in the picture with me. I will just bring the picture in. The member for Swan is in the picture, but he did not vote for it in this chamber. What we know is that the stimulus package is working.

               What we know is that people who have the responsibility in these areas and who make serious judgments know that the increase in consumer spending driven by our stimulus packages is delivering for the economy. Steve Lowy of Westfield said the performance of local operations of his firm had been positively influenced by the effects of the government’s stimulus package. Economists know the stimulus package is working.

                , I ask a further supplementary question. Despite those expert views outlined by Senator Evans, there continue to be some senators opposite who claim the stimulus plan is not working. As the economic stimulus is having an impact in the housing and construction sector, could the minister detail other measures which may indicate the success of the government’s plan? Is the minister able to advise the Senate of the evidence which indicates that the government’s nation-building economic stimulus package is working? In particular, does the minister have data which shows the effect on the economy?

                 I can say to the chamber that the stimulus package has resulted in improved economic data, particularly in the housing area but more broadly in the economy. The housing figures recently released show housing finance rose 3.6 per cent in April and is now 13½ per cent higher over the year. The number of loans for the construction of new owner-occupied homes rose to the highest level since January 2002. Loans to first home buyers are at record levels, representing 28 per cent of new loans financed—young families getting a start and an opportunity to move into their first home. The broader economy is also showing signs of responding to the stimulus package. Consumer confidence recorded its largest increase in 22 years in June and is at its highest level since January 2008, and business confidence also rose sharply in May. The stimulus package is working, building confidence and providing jobs and opportunities in the Australian economy.
