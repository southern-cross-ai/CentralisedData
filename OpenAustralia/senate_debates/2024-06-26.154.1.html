        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Minister Wong. Can the minister please tell the Senate how Labor's tax cuts will assist all taxpayers, not just some, as was the coalition's intended outcome? In particular, can the minister explain the impact on low- and middle-income earners and the broader range of industries that will benefit. Can you outline for us why the Albanese Labor government's No. 1 priority is providing cost-of-living support while putting downward pressure on inflation?

         I thank Senator Grogan, my fellow

         </a>
         senator, for that question. What I would say to her is this: in just five days time, all Australian taxpayers will get a tax cut.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Australian" rel="nofollow">
          All Australian
         </a>
         taxpayers will get a tax cut in just five days time—not just some Australian taxpayers, as those opposite had intended—because those of us on this side want Australians to earn more and to keep more of what they earn.
        </p>
        <p>
         From Monday, every teacher will pay less tax. Every nurse, farmer, dentist, chef, bus driver and accountant—they will all pay less tax. That's 13.6 million Australians, and, better yet, 11.5 million will get a bigger tax cut, compared with what those opposite proposed. Our teachers, who we are so reliant on, educating the next generation: 98 per cent of primary school teachers and 97 per cent of secondary school teachers across Australia will be better off under our package. Our hospitality workers: 97 per cent of the chefs working across Australia will get a bigger tax cut. Ninety-five per cent of sales assistants will get a bigger tax cut. Receptionists: 96 per cent of them will get a bigger tax cut. Senator Sterle, 97 per cent of truck drivers will be better off. Senator Sheldon, 91 per cent of electricians will be better off. Cleaners—for the UWU members: 96 per cent of cleaners will be better off under our tax cuts. Those opposite don't understand the importance of providing cost-of-living relief to Australians who are doing it tough. That's what this government is doing.

           Five days—that's great news. I can't wait! Can the minister please detail how, from 1 July, Labor's tax cuts will start to help women, particularly those in low-paid, female-dominated industries such as aged care and child care, and also how the Albanese Labor government is helping people in these industries by backing wage rises?

            Thank you, Senator Grogan. I know that questions about workers in the aged-care and early childhood sector are very dear to your heart, as a former
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USU" rel="nofollow">
             USU
            </a>
            official, as is the case for many of the senators on our side. I'm pleased that, from next Monday, nine out of 10 women will get a bigger tax cut than they would have had under those opposite. As I said yesterday, we know that aspiration doesn't begin in the top tax bracket. We also understand that women dominate low-paid hardworking industries; 96 per cent of early childhood educators are women, 81 per cent of age and disability carers are women, and 88 per cent of registered nurses are women. With Labor's tax cuts, almost all those workers will get a bigger tax cut.
           </p>
           <p>
            But of course, as Senator Grogan said, that isn't where it ends. Unlike those opposite, we support better wages for Australians. Under us, average wage growth is almost double what it was under the former government. As I said, we want Australians to earn more and keep more of what they earn, and we mean it.

               From 1 July, Labor's tax cuts will see families with children pocket an average of more than $3,000 next financial year—an extra $60 a week in their pockets—to help with the cost of living. Across all households, the average tax cuts will be more than $2,000 under Labor's plan. That's more than $40 a week. And of course next Monday the Albanese Labor government is taking $300 off people's power bills. What have we got from those opposite? We have Mr Dutton's announcement—it's not a plan; it's an announcement—which is serving up the most expensive form of energy there is and asking Australians to pay for it.

                 Well, I'll take that interjection from Senator Ruston. She said, 'Just because you say it doesn't make it so.' The problem with you on climate change and energy is that the facts have never graced your door. That's the problem. You just say, 'Oh, those facts are not convenient, so we're going to pretend they're not there.'
