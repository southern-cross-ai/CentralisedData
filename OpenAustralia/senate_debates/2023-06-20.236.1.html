        Before I begin my contribution, I would say to Senator Green that I'm sure
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Lee" rel="nofollow">
         Johnny Lee
        </a>
        would have been very proud of that tribute you gave him. That was outstanding. I give you my hearty congratulations on that, Senator Green.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have two good news stories to talk about. It's nice to have had some good news stories to talk about in the chamber over the last two weeks. The first is I want to pay tribute to Senior Sergeant Craig Mackenzie, who retired from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Police_Service" rel="nofollow">
         Queensland Police Service
        </a>
        after nearly 40 years of service with the Queensland Police Service—just three weeks short of 40 years service. Senior Sergeant Craig Mackenzie served with the greatest of distinction. He received the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         National Medal
        </a>
        with two clasps; the National Police Service Medal; and Queensland awards including the Queensland Police Service Medal with a 35-year clasp and the Queensland Police Meritorious Service Medal. His nearly 40 years in the Queensland Police Service included 22 years and four months as officer in charge of the Inala Police Station, which was an incredible period of service at that police station. It was in that capacity that I first met Sergeant Mackenzie.
       </p>
       <p>
        What particularly moved me about Sergeant Mackenzie was not only his service to the people of Queensland but the relationship he built with the wonderful Queensland Vietnamese community. There was such a deep respect and esteem for Sergeant Mackenzie in the Queensland Vietnamese community, and I saw this manifest itself in the lead-up to Sergeant Mackenzie's retirement. I should note that, even after retiring, Sergeant Mackenzie is still attending Queensland Vietnamese events. From my perspective, that relationship between Sergeant Mackenzie and the wonderful Queensland Vietnamese community represents the very best and the very finest of what our Queensland Police Service does for the people of Queensland. I pay tribute to you, Sergeant Mackenzie. Good luck in your retirement.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second good news story—and I know that Senator Watt, on the other side of the chamber, is very close to our wonderful Queensland Indian diaspora—is that it was the 25th anniversary of the Malayalee Association of Queensland this year. Namaskaram to all of my friends in the Malayalee community in Queensland. It is 13,000 strong in our home state of Queensland, and they are a wonderful community, hailing originally from Kerala in India. There were three events held to celebrate the silver jubilee: first, the Vishu and Easter function held on 23 April; second, the Badminton Indian Open held on 29 April; and, last, the culmination, which was the silver jubilee celebration held on 28 May. I was delighted to have the opportunity to attend all three functions. I'd like to pay tribute to Mr Vivek Menon and his committee and all of the organisers and volunteers for those outstanding events.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd also like to pay tribute to some of the award winners who were given special recognition at the silver jubilee celebration on 28 May. The first, for contribution to sport, was Mr Sravan Renjith, a chess prodigy in the community. The second, for outstanding contribution, was Professor Joseph Mathew, who has made an outstanding contribution to engineering asset management whilst also serving on the MAQ committee and being a badminton champion. The third was the music contribution by the wonderful Mr Ryan Feroz. We had the opportunity to hear Ryan play—just magical playing of the guitar. The last, for volunteering, was Mr Tom Jacob, who for over 20 years has been auditing the accounts of MAQ at no charge—an outstanding contribution.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd also like to pay tribute to some of the pioneers of the Malayalee community in Queensland: first, Mr Jacob George, who originally came to Queensland to study at my old school,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipswich_Grammar_School" rel="nofollow">
         Ipswich Grammar School
        </a>
        , and then stayed in Queensland and established a very successful private small business; second, the wonderful Varghese family—who, again, Senator Watt would know very well—George and Annamma Varghese and their nine children. Before he passed away,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Varghese" rel="nofollow">
         George Varghese
        </a>
        predicted that one of his sons would become high commissioner for Australia in India, and it proved to be true, with Mr Peter Varghese adopting that post. George Varghese did live to see his son Jim Varghese become the director-general of the Department of Education. The Vargheses are a wonderful, wonderful family who have contributed to Queensland and Australia in so many ways. Finally, I pay tribute to Mrs Thankamma George; Bala Warrier and Mrs Warrier; and Vimala and Ravi Menon. I pay tribute to each and every one of you as pioneers of the Malayalee community in Queensland. You laid the foundation for the success of that community in Queensland, and what a wonderful contribution our Malayalee community continues to make in Australia.
