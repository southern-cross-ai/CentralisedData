        Security is not provided by police and military who are busy harassing law-abiding citizens for the supposed crime of dissent. Security is not provided by unelected bureaucrats who never lose their pay. And don't get me started on masks.

        believes real security comes from a breadwinner job, owning the family home, being surrounded by family and living in a community where people interact and support each other. COVID restrictions are the reverse of common sense. Separating families and weakening communities is not how a society pulls through a crisis. Nothing shows the contempt for families more than the decision of Labor Premier Dan Andrews to ban visits to parents in their own home yet allow visits to brothels. Labor is sending a clear message: families are bad; brothels are good. That's just sick.

        Last week, I remarked on the plans to move everyday Australians into small, hive homes. This denies parents the space to allow their adult kids to stay at home longer to save for their own home. Without this leg-up, the security of homeownership is further out of our kids' reach. Liberal-National and Labor governments have spent 30 years making job security worse by exporting jobs while importing millions of new workers with no job to go to. The result is casualisation of the workforce, lower wages and terrible job security. Parliaments are exploiting this by blackmailing workers into getting the vaccine. Vaccination under duress contravenes the government's own guidelines. The outcome from this whole display of pathetic governance is a growing divide between vaxxed and unvaxxed, which is fracturing families and communities and robbing us of security. Protests and vaccine hesitancy are proof that society understands what parliaments do not: we will not be divided. We have one flag above us. We are one community. We are one nation.
