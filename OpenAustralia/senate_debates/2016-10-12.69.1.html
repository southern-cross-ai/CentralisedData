         Leader of the Government in the Senate
        </a>
        , representing the Prime Minister. Minister, your government has this week been crowing about 800 days without a boat arrival. However, we do know that at least 29 boats carrying at least 740 people have been turned around at sea, to meet an unknown fate, since Operation Sovereign Borders began—and these are just the ones that your government has admitted to. We also know that it has been 800 days of misery and hopelessness for the men, women and children stranded on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manus_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Manus Island
        </a>
        and Nauru. How many interceptions and turn backs have occurred since Operation Sovereign Borders began, and what is the fate of these hundreds of people who were turned around at sea? How many have been refouled contrary to your international obligations? How many have died at sea or in the countries you have illegally returned them to?

         Senator McKim, I do not assume several of the premises of the multiple questions that you have asked and, even if I did, I would not be in a position to provide that information, assuming such information exists in reality. But what I can tell you—as you said in your introductory words to your question—is that it is indeed more than 800 days since an asylum-seeker vessel penetrated Australia. Therefore, for 800 days, this government, first under the leadership of Mr Tony Abbott, then under the leadership of Mr Malcolm Turnbull, has discharged the fundamental obligation of any Australian government, and that is to keep our borders secure. As a result of that, we have driven the people smugglers out of business so that innocent women and children are no longer drowning at sea. More than 1,200 people—before the policies introduced by the coalition—that we know about and an uncounted number that we do not know about drowned at sea as a result of the policies of the previous Labor government. The other thing that we know is that the number of children held in detention in Australia today is zero. I do not know what it is about the word or the number 'zero' that you do not understand. When we came into office, the number of children in detention in Australia had peaked at 1,992—that is, 1,992 to zero.

           My supplementary question is this: Attorney, I note your abject failure to answer the question that you were asked. I want to ask you why it is that the government is prepared to reveal exclusive details of operational matters to media outlets like

              In order to assist the Attorney, I will refer him to the embedded reporter who reported on these matters during the election campaign. The government has comprehensively failed to find a solution for the people—our fellow human beings—stranded on Manus and Nauru. We know that they are suffering incredible trauma as a direct result of this government's policies. Why will you not do the right thing and bring those people here to Australia so we can look after them properly?

              <p>
               Senator McKim, let me respond to you in two ways: first of all, you speak about people on
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manus_Island" rel="nofollow">
                Manus Island
               </a>
               and in Nauru. They are people who were put there by
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rudd" rel="nofollow">
                Kevin Rudd
               </a>
               . They are people who were put there by Kevin Rudd as a result of an agreement entered into by Mr Rudd with Prime Minister O'Neil of
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
                Papua New Guinea
               </a>
               during the short and unlamented second Rudd government.
              </p>
              <p>
               The second observation I would make in response to your question is this: I have now been provided with some of the statistics you seek—thank you, Senator Cash. Since the commencement of this government's policy—in other words, more than three years ago—740 people from 29 people-smuggling vessels have been intercepted and returned the their country of departure. Seven hundred and forty! In the previous five years, there were more than 50,000.
