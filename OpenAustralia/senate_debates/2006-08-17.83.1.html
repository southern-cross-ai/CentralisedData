        My question is to Senator Ian Campbell, Minister for the Environment and Heritage and Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Can the minister confirm his support for the minister for transport’s decision to approve the development of the proposed
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BGC" rel="nofollow">
         BGC

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth_Airport" rel="nofollow">
         Perth Airport
        </a>
        ? Hasn’t the minister supported this project despite serious concerns being raised with him by his department, including: the department cannot be confident that the proposal will not result in adverse health impacts; the proposal should not be approved until the long-term monitoring of five existing neighbourhood brickworks, which might take several years, is completed; and the company had not conducted any surveys on the site to evaluate its use by threatened species? Isn’t there also significant community opposition to the project going ahead? Given the minister’s constant assertions about the importance of community opposition, and the health and environmental issues raised by his department, can he explain why he was happy to rush ahead and give the environmental tick to this project?

         I thank Senator Sterle for the question. It is probably a good lesson for people, because if you do not know something you should ask questions; we encourage people to ask questions. It is quite clear from Senator Sterle’s question that he knows very little about this process. I am happy to inform all senators about this project, because the

        <p>
         Senator Sterle correctly—and this is one of the few bits of correct information in the question—draws our attention to a serious deficiency in Western Australia: the lack of a monitoring regime for pollutants coming from brickworks in the Midland, Guildford and Hazelmere area. The environmental assessment report, which I released in full a few weeks ago, goes very much to the point that the Western Australian Labor government has totally failed the people of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan_Valley" rel="nofollow">
          Swan Valley
         </a>
         , Guildford and Hazelmere because it does not have in place a monitoring regime. If Senator Sterle were smart enough to read the approval that Mr Truss gave to the brickworks proposal, which contained 60 stringent environmental conditions, he would see that the proponents—the

            , I rise on a point of order to do with relevance. I thought that the minister was interested in running in the House of Representatives, not in state parliament. He was asked a direct question about whether or not he approved this project as minister for the environment. Again, he wants to talk about anything rather than answer for his responsibilities. I would ask you to refer him to the question.

It is one that to the best of my knowledge, when I first came to this place as an opposition member, was adhered to strictly—although it is only Senator Ray, Senator Faulker and Senator Sherry who were here at that time. That standing order says that when the President stands on his feet, a senator speaking shall resume his seat and shall remain silent so the President can address the chamber uninterrupted. It seems in recent times as though many new senators are not aware of that standing order, and I draw your attention to it.

Fair enough: criticise Senator Evans by all means, but I am afraid a number of senators in question time today have remained on their feet while you have been on your feet. The standing order that Senator Ferguson refers to, in my memory, requires you, Mr President, to maintain order in the Senate.

Is the minister aware that, under the Airports Act, development at airports has to be incidental to the operation of the airport? Can the minister explain how the development of brickworks could possibly be described as being incidental activity? What other activities does the government now consider to be incidental developments? Would wind farms also be considered to be incidental?
