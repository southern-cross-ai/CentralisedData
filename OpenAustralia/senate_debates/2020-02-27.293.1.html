         I thank Senator McMahon for her question and also for her tireless advocacy for Defence personnel and the facilities and support that they get in the Territory.
        </p>
        <p>
         I can confirm that Australia's north has played, and always will play, an important role in our nation's defence and broader security in our region. That's why this government is investing $8 billion over the next decade in new and upgraded Defence facilities in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         . These facilities will support new ADF capabilities, such as the F-35A
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Strike_Fighter" rel="nofollow">
          Joint Strike Fighter
         </a>
         and the offshore patrol vessel.
        </p>
        <p>
         Last week the Prime Minister announced a further $1.1 billion of work at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
          RAAF
         </a>
         Base Tindal, taking this government's total investment in the base to $1.6 billion. This is to ensure that we can continue to deliver a potent air capability from the Northern Territory. Under this $1.6 billion investment, over $700 million will go towards upgrading the airfield, including extending the runway and building a new air movements terminal, a parking apron and extra fuel storage facilities. The works will increase the capability of Tindal to support the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KC" rel="nofollow">
          KC
         </a>
         -30 Multi-Role Tanker Transport operations. These are a key part of the core air power role of air mobility, in particular air-to-air refuelling and air logistic support missions. This will also improve accessibility for Tindal for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
          United States Air Force
         </a>
         aircraft. Another $437 million will also be provided to critical base infrastructure upgrades. This $1.1 billion commitment comes on top of the $495 million already invested in the new air combat capability facility at Tindal, which will underpin the arrival of the Joint Strike Fighter in the Northern Territory.

            Yes, Senator McMahon. I can confirm that
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Australia" rel="nofollow">
             Northern Australia
            </a>
            is and will remain our gateway to the Indo-Pacific. This is a region of growing economic prosperity, trade and opportunity for Australia, but it's also one that is more dynamic and more interconnected, and where traditional and new security threats increasingly transcend state boundaries. We cannot deal as a nation with any of these challenges in isolation. As the Defence minister, I recognise that strengthening the ADF's relationships with regional allies and partners is crucial to our nation and our regional security. This is why we, Australia, remain committed to the United States Force Posture Initiatives. They provide security benefits for both countries and for our regional partners, by deepening the joint operations between the ADF and the US forces. Also, they increase engagement with nations right across the Indo-Pacific.

               This is one of the many aspects of our defence industry policies that I'm so proud of. The Morrison government is making it easier for local businesses to get involved in delivering this $8 billion of investment pipeline over the coming decade in the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
                Northern Territory
               </a>
               . This government's local industry capability initiative announced in Darwin, in 2017, by the then minister, Minister Payne, continues to deliver valuable opportunities for local businesses. Since the implementation of this initiative, the average local engagement target for major infrastructure projects has been 79 per cent. We have now met this, and it is now over 80 per cent. The Morrison government remains committed to ensuring the delivery of the best capability for the ADF, investing in infrastructure and supporting a local defence industrial base in the Northern Territory.
