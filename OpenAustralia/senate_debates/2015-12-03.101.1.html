         was one of those flagship Labor programs—in this case designed to improve rental affordability. From the beginning of the

          RGR

         government's scheme, it was poorly designed. It had multiple flaws, ambiguous legal requirements and red tape. The scheme has been slow in delivery, which is not good. It has failed to meet its delivery targets despite ongoing funding. The Audit Office released a report on the NRAS on 18 November, and it found that from the commencement of NRAS, in 2008, the delivery of eligible dwellings has been slower than anticipated—not good.

              Do not tempt me! The ground work for NRAS had not been put in. The basic planning to ensure competent delivery had not been put in. Ms Plibersek cites NRAS as one of the greatest achievements of the former government. Those opposite have some odd benchmarks.

                The audit office report identifies that the scheme was launched by then minister Plibersek and then Treasurer Swan before the legislation and regulations supporting the operation of the scheme had been put in place—just a fact. The audit office report identified a range of adverse findings against the administration of the scheme: slow delivery of dwellings, as I have mentioned; no evaluation of the scheme's objectives; administration that did not fully accord with

                regulations—again, not good; and poor record-keeping to substantiate past decision making. On this side we at times get a little used to examples of poor Labor policy design. Regrettably, this is another such example.

                  The government did take a decision in the context of the 2014-15 budget not to proceed with the final round of the
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NRAS" rel="nofollow">
                   NRAS
                  </a>
                  , and also to cap the scheme at 38,000 dwellings. The government does remain committed to improving the administration of the scheme for the incentives already allocated. Amendments to the legislation have been introduced to improve the rate of dwelling delivery, as well as to simplify and streamline a number of aspects of the scheme. Despite the scheme, the proportion of low-income households in rental stress increased from 35.4 per cent in 2007-08 to 42.5 per cent in 2013-14. They are ABS figures. So the scheme did not achieve the desired outcome. It was poorly designed and poorly administered. This government is setting about trying to make that right.
