        My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Evans. I refer to the government’s persistent and now farcical assertion that no special deal was offered to the 78 asylum seekers on the
        <i>

          Oceanic Viking

        . What special deals or arrangements has Australia made with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNHCR" rel="nofollow">
         UNHCR
        </a>
        to ensure that the asylum seekers from the
        <i>
         Oceanic Viking
        </i>
        will be resettled within four to six weeks of the time of disembarkation, as opposed to the years it would normally have taken?

         I thank Senator Fierravanti-Wells for the question. It seems very much like the four or five questions she asked me last week, but I am very happy to assist again and respond to her question. What has occurred in relation to the
         <i>
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_Viking" rel="nofollow">
           Oceanic Viking
          </a>
         </i>
         is that there was an arrangement between the Indonesian government and the Australian government about how we dealt with the situation that arose following the rescue at sea of those persons who were on board the
         <i>
          Oceanic Viking
         </i>
         . At the Indonesian government’s request, we attended—in their search and rescue zone—and rescued people who were in fear of drowning. Under the arrangements with the Indonesian government, we took them to an Indonesian port and sought to have them disembark. I am pleased to say, despite us having to show an abundance of patience, eventually all persons disembarked from the
         <i>
          Oceanic Viking
         </i>
         and went into the detention facility. Women and children are housed in an immigration facility within close proximity of the centre. We tabled in the parliament the agreement between the Indonesian government and the Australian government for the processing and settlement of those persons on the
         <i>
          Oceanic Viking
         </i>
         and the time frames associated with that.

          , I rise on a point of order. I asked the minister a very direct question: what special deal or arrangements has Australia made with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which is responsible for resettlement and for ensuring that the four to six weeks resettlement occurs? That is the question that I asked. Minister, could you please give me a direct answer.

            As I was saying, the time frames that were agreed with the Indonesian government are being applied, and the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNHCR" rel="nofollow">
             UNHCR
            </a>
            has begun processing the claims of those who were on the

              Oceanic Viking

            </i>
            . As those who followed the case will know, a number had already been found to be refugees. So the UNHCR has begun that work of assessing the claims and processing those persons. Once that is finalised, those who are found to be refugees will be resettled.

                 That makes clear what is to occur. We are working with the

                  UNHCR
                 </a>
                 , as we have in the past and as the Howard government did in the past, to assist with the resettlement of people who have been found to be refugees. As the Senate would be aware, refugees out of Indonesia have been referred to a number of resettlement countries. In the last nine years, about 1,300 have been resettled, of whom 450 or so have come to Australia, but others have gone to Canada, Sweden, Norway and
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
                  New Zealand
                 </a>
                 and, I think, some small numbers have gone to other countries. Those processes will be applied by UNHCR in this case. As I said, we expect Australia to take some of those processed, but the UNHCR will go through its processes and we will work with them on that basis.
