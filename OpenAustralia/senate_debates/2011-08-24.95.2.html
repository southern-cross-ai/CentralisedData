        My question is to the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator Carr. Given growing concerns with the two-speed growth in our economy, can the minister outline to the Senate what he is doing to help manufacturers capitalise on the $430 billion in the resource sector investments pipeline?

           These are measures which are about building the capabilities of local firms and building the partnerships that link them to real opportunities wherever they are and wherever we can develop those relationships. Whether it is in major public infrastructure or whether it is in a big resources project or whether it is in the

           , we are in the business of ensuring that Australian firms do get the fair go they deserve to compete. Just as we expect our athletes to perform and to meet international competition head-on, and we do so by providing them with the training necessary to make sure they are successful, this is the type of program that provides support to our companies. We are boosting firm perfor­mance through Enterprise Connect. We are also finding wherever the strengths of industries exist and ensuring that every possible opportunity is taken through the industry capability networks. We are putting local industry experts right at the heart of the procurement teams for major contracts through the Supplier Access to Major Projects program. We are promoting local industry—

                 Those opposite would be keen to know, I am sure, that this is an approach that actually works. It makes sure that we get our customers, our contracts and their dollars together. Take, for instance, the coalmining areas and China. Australian industry specialists have been put on the ground, at a cost of some $150,000, and as a result they have been able to secure 13 contracts worth $42 million for Australia. In the past three years, supplier access programs have helped local firms secure $1.8 billion in contracts that otherwise would have gone offshore. We have seen the missions led by

                  . Can the minister inform the Senate of what the government is doing to lift the tax burden on Australian companies who are doing it tough?

                   Ministers in this government know that the resources rent tax has been the basis on which we can ensure that company tax rates can be reduced to 29 per cent.

                     What this government is doing is providing the wherewithal to support new investment. What this government is doing is providing the support for small business so it can move through these difficult periods and ensure its own future. This is a government that knows about how firms can regroup, reskill and redevelop opportunities. Unlike those opposite, who have shown nothing but contempt for the industries that have to go through this period of adjustment, we are in the business of taking practical measures to ensure the future of Australian industry and to ensure the future of high-skilled, high-wage jobs in this country. You, on the other hand, Senator Abetz, have not even signed up to any measures to support manu­facturing, to support the steel industry or to support our major companies.
