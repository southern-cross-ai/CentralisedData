          This is an important motion. It is a motion which goes to ministerial accountability. It is a motion which goes to the basic requirement that a minister should be required to attend the chamber and should be required to respond to matters within his or her portfolio which are of such concern to the community. I would argue that it would also empower the chamber to determine what action should be taken. So I would say to the crossbench that I ask for support not only to require Minister Colbeck to come down to the chamber to respond to the extraordinary maladministration in his portfolio. I would also say—I notice that Senator Roberts is on the monitor—that the second part of the motion which currently

              I thank the chamber. I make this point: there are not many occasions in this place where we are confronted with hundreds of Australians dying whilst we are sitting here, day by day. The fact that the government failed to act on multiple warnings—I think it is demonstrably the case they failed to do so—has caused enormous and tragic consequences. This minister should be held to account by this chamber. It is a basic principle of ministerial accountability. We move this motion and we ask for support from the crossbench for all of the paragraphs in the interests of that accountability. I flag here that we will continue to press ministerial accountability because Minister Colbeck has demonstrably failed to do what he ought to have done as a minister of the Crown.

                <p>
                 Our government takes ministerial accountability and responsibility very seriously—very seriously indeed. Senator Colbeck has been answering questions all week. I think he's fielded every Labor question in the chamber this week. He has done his absolute best to provide the information that was sought of him. He is dealing with a very difficult challenge and a very difficult circumstance.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In Victoria—in Melbourne, I should say—there is a very significant outbreak of a terrible virus. There is a significant increase in infections, which inevitably, sadly, exposes those most vulnerable in the community the most. That sadly includes residents in aged-care facilities. Of course we all are focused on doing the absolute best we can to make sure we get on top of that very challenging and tragic situation as swiftly as possible. The minister is being accountable. We absolutely think it is appropriate in these circumstances, if the chamber seeks the attendance of a minister, for the minister to attend and for the Senate to take note in relation to the minister's explanation. That is not something we have a problem with.
                </p>
                <p>
                 We do have a problem with paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) because they seek to provide unprecedented power to Senator Wong to move without notice a motion and to have the motion dealt with without amendment. It actually says so in the motion.

                         I'm reading directly from the motion. Senator Wong is seeking the power to move a motion without notice relating to the explanation of the conduct of the minister. For that motion to be moved under paragraph (b) it may not be amended. If Senator Wong wants to move motions in relation to the minister she should follow the normal processes of the parliament. This is just an extension of Labor's attempts to play politics with what is a very serious issue.
