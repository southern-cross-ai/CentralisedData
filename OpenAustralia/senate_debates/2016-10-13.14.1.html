       <p class="italic">
        Since an earlier version of this Bill was introduced into the 44th Parliament in 2015, there have been significant changes made to the Explanatory Memorandum that should be examined.

        There has also been a significant change in the composition of the Senate and it would be appropriate to allow the new Senators the opportunity to engage with this legislation.

        Very limited submissions were received by the previous inquiry into the 2015 Bill and a further referral would provide another opportunity for submissions from stakeholders.

        This is legislation which proposes changes to the criminal law. The criminal law has a significant impact on the rights and obligations of the Australian people, including potentially the ability to see them deprived of their liberty.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is appropriate and responsible for the Senate to properly examine the impact of proposed criminal laws, including in light of recent developments.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There has also been a significant change in the composition of the Senate and it would be appropriate to allow the new Senators the opportunity to engage with this legislation.

          I indicate that the Greens will support that amendment, though I also give notice that I will be moving an amendment, which has already been circulated in my name, to the motion that the report be adopted. The amendment provides that the

           Criminal Code
          </a>
          Amendment (
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Crimes" rel="nofollow">
           War Crimes
          </a>
          ) Bill 2016 be referred to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee" rel="nofollow">
           Committee
          </a>
          for inquiry and report by the first sitting day of 2011.
         </p>
         <p>
          We attempted last night to refer this bill to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee. The reasons for referral are grave. We are astonished that the committee did not support it, because we think this bill has changes that deserve public scrutiny. We are unaware of any consideration of this bill in public and we understand that the last time the war crimes offences incorporated in domestic criminal law were amended was in 2002.
         </p>
         <p>
          The changes proposed in this bill seriously alter the governance of ADF personnel in combat and change the definition of a war crime. This is an issue that has just recently broken as a story on radio, with the internal Defence inquiry into potential war crimes on foot at present. This is a highly charged, complex topic and there is a need to hear from the ADF about why such changes are needed and what actions they are trying to take that are being prevented by existing war crimes legislation. Parliament should have a greater role in debating the use of military force and the implications of those deployments. These are some of the most important decisions a nation can make, and that is what parliament should be for.
         </p>
         <p>
          Australian forces operate under much more stringent rules of engagement than many of our allies, including the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
           US
          </a>
          . Anything that creates a risk of changing that needs to be carefully scrutinised. The announcement is also of concern since the Criminal Code was developed to reflect international law, and the extent to which Australia is following a dangerous precedent, set by the US, to expand international law's permissiveness around targeted killing must be explored. We also feel it is necessary to determine exactly what constraints the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Defence Force
          </a>
          believes exists and who is in the list of persons not involved in hostilities, including civilians, medical personnel or religious personnel who not taking an active part in hostilities. Recent counterterrorism and national security views do not consider war crimes offences.
         </p>
         <p>
          It is also of grave concern that proposed amendments did not arise from the recommendations of various recent reviews of national security and counterterrorism legislation and in fact appear to be materially different to the recommendations made by both the former INSLM and the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
           COAG
          </a>
          review of counterterrorism laws in 2013. We are aware of grave concerns about this bill from experts on the ground in actual war zones and protracted conflicts around the world in which we are implicated. This involves the

          </a>

          and Medecins San Frontieres.
         </p>
         <p>
          For these reasons we strongly implore the government and the opposition to allow a full, thorough, public review of this legislation, and we believe the most appropriate committee therefore is the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee.
