            A great question, and a great interjection. I will get to that interjection a little later. This is a very significant contract between one of the partners in the Gorgon project,

            oil company. The government, through my colleague the Minister for Resources and Energy, is pleased to have been invited to attend the contract signing in Beijing. I congratulate the Liberal Party in

             Western Australia
            </a>
            and the Premier, Mr Barnett, and the former Premier of WA, Mr Carpenter, for their roles. The contract will see PetroChina buy $50 billion worth of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorgon_LNG" rel="nofollow">
             Gorgon LNG
            </a>
            over the next 20 years. It will buy $33 billion worth of Australian goods and services. It will create 6,000 jobs at the peak of construction. It will generate $40 billion of government revenue that will go to schools, hospitals and roads. Yet there are still those who question and undermine these particular projects.

              I am agreeing with the Liberal Party interjectors. Barely was the ink dry on this particular project than the Leader of the National Party in the Senate, Senator Joyce, criticised the project. He has been spreading his particular brand of division and insinuation with respect to Chinese investment in foreign projects, as important as this one is. Firstly, I point out that
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PetroChina" rel="nofollow">
               PetroChina
              </a>
              will have no ownership of the resources in the ground in this instance. Secondly, the joint partners in the Gorgon project are Chevron,
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exxon_Mobil" rel="nofollow">
               Exxon Mobil
              </a>
              and Shell. It may have escaped Senator Joyce that these companies are all foreign owned. So is Senator Joyce’s problem foreign ownership of Australian resources or is it just a base fear of where some of that investment is coming from? Senator Joyce never lets facts get in the way of a random—

                The $50 billion contract with
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PetroChina" rel="nofollow">
                 PetroChina
                </a>
                comes on top of a $25 billion deal with India and recent agreements with Japanese and Korean interests. As is obvious, both the Liberal Party and the Labor Party support this approach. Unfortunately, Senator Joyce does not. The Leader of the National Party in the Senate does not like these particular deals. This Gorgon deal with PetroChina will return Australia more money for less product, yet Senator Joyce only sees dangers in these job-creation deals.

                    Senator Joyce, I cannot control what a minister will say, but if you think you are being misrepresented then you have the right, upon the conclusion of question time, to stand and take a point of order and let it be known that you have been misrepresented.

                     Senator Joyce cannot see the investment boost and the thousands of jobs that this project will create. It is obvious the Liberal Party supports this project and that is great to see, but Mr Turnbull should exercise some authority and pull Senator Joyce into line. What about the other members of the National Party? Do they support Senator Joyce’s criticism of this foreign—

                      , I ask a further supplementary question. Can the Assistant Treasurer reveal to the Senate the current value of foreign investment in Australia and the Rudd government’s approach to this vital lifeline of Australia’s economy?

                       The total stock of foreign investment in Australia as at 31 March 2009 is $1.7 billion. I have to say that the leading foreign investor is the United States. Senator Joyce said he is the champion of regional Australia and of regional jobs. Foreign investment supports one in four jobs in regional Australia and yet Senator Joyce continually criticises these forms of foreign investment. He is the grim reaper when it comes to regional jobs. If we were to adopt Senator Joyce’s approach, you would have to shut down most foreign investment projects in mining and in regional Australia and destroy thousands of jobs. That is Senator Joyce’s approach.

                       I am pleased to see the Liberal opposition are committed to foreign investment. We need foreign investment, particularly in the resources sector. This project is a great example and they should pull Senator Joyce into line.
