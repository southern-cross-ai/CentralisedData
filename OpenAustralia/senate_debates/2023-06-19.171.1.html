        I table a supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government requests for amendments to this bill. These amendments align the Higher Education Support Act with the government's pathway to Australian citizenship for New Zealand citizens. They fix a long-existing gap in the HELP system where New Zealand students miss out on HELP loans for a portion of their Australian citizenship pathway. They ensure that students who are already on the pathway are treated the same as those embarking on the government's new pathway. They permit them access to the HELP system. It's a matter of fairness. My understanding is that they have the opposition's support. It is a modest fix, but one which is very important to those it helps.

              I move opposition amendment (1) on sheet 1936:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              (1) Schedule 1, page 3 (line 1) to page 38 (line 15), to be opposed.
             </p>
             <p>
              I have moved this amendment to effectively separate the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup" rel="nofollow">
               Startup
              </a>
              Year provisions from the rest of the bill. As I've indicated, the opposition supports other measures in the bill—being, the provision in relation to the increase to the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Research_Council" rel="nofollow">
               Australian Research Council
              </a>
              and the classification of Avondale University—and of course the amendments we just passed.
             </p>
             <p>
              I profoundly disagree with the minister's characterisation of the Startup Year provisions in this bill. The Startup Year provisions, as I discussed earlier in this debate, present a very high risk to students. This scheme is meant to start in a couple of weeks. It is such a mess that the guidelines have only just been tabled. The universities are very concerned that they weren't able to consult on the guidelines which underpin how this scheme will operate. The principal concern the opposition has is that it subjects students to such high risk—a full-fee-paying course and a debt of up to $23,600, which will go up each and every year because it's indexed. This will expose students to enormous risk.
             </p>
             <p>
              What is so nonsensical about this situation is that this is a solution in terms of a problem. We are strongly supportive of accelerator and incubator courses. We have led the way and championed the need for student entrepreneurs to be supported. There are, as I mentioned earlier, more than 100 accelerator courses available through universities around this country. But while the universities have mooted their support in the Senate inquiry, after being scathing in the earlier consultation, and while this looks and sounds like a good idea in principle, the fact of the matter is that the government is asking students to pay through the nose for courses they can currently do for nothing.
             </p>
             <p>
              These are courses that are delivering. I mentioned earlier visiting the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTS" rel="nofollow">
               UTS
              </a>
              Startup Hub, as one example. The UTS Startup Hub has more than 800 students enrolled. Last year alone they created, through businesses developed through the Startup Hub, some 570 jobs. These accelerator and incubator courses are available all across the country and the universities are doing a great job. Regrettably, the government has not made out the case to impose this very significant debt. These are not even Commonwealth supported places; these are full fee-paying courses. The government has not made out the case as to why it would impose such a significant debt on students for doing courses that they can currently do for free. The value proposition is not there and the benefits are just not discernible.
             </p>
             <p>
              While I appreciate that the universities would love more
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HECS" rel="nofollow">
               HECS
              </a>
              revenue, the universities have not been able to explain what courses would be offered, because they don't know. That's why we've also put forward a number of amendments to protect students. I'm deeply concerned about this when looking at the huge acceleration in HECS debt and at how Labor's cost-of-living crisis has driven up indexation to the highest indexation rate in more than 30 years: 7.1 per cent. That means an average increase in an Australian student loan of some $1,700 in a year. The government has not made the case as to why it would support student entrepreneurs by slamming them with this horrendous additional debt. That's why we're seeking to split the bill; to support the other measures in the bill and to oppose the startup provisions.

                Startup
               </a>
               Year program from the bill. Although opposing startup, the amendments that the opposition offer in alternative are of a major nature and do not substantially change the program from what the government is proposing. The opposition have had the benefit of briefings, a Senate committee inquiry and even the provision of draft guidelines and the program handbook, as well as a schedule to assist in understanding the program. They've now offered paltry amendments and also opposed the bill, which is 'no-alition' politics at its finest.
              </p>
              <p>
               In terms of the lack of support, I would disagree with that. I think this bill has been met with enthusiastic support from the sector. The consultation process was lauded by key stakeholders, and described as first class by

                Year program. What convinced me was that, throughout the Senate inquiry on the Education Legislation Amendment (Startup Year and Other Measures) Bill held in April this year, we heard broad support from stakeholders and universities for the program. I have not heard from one single stakeholder of mine asking me to oppose the Startup Year program. Of course, there is a big issue with how the student loan system operates at the moment. The Greens' views on that system are well known. It is a broken system, and it needs to be overhauled. That's why I moved the second reading amendment a few minutes ago to wipe student debt and to make university and

                free. But the coalition voted against that. If the coalition is genuine about wanting to do something about indexation, there is an opportunity coming up in the next half hour where we have amendments to scrap indexation. If the coalition really cares about it that much, it should vote for the amendments.

                  <p class="italic">
                   (3) The Minister must not specify a university, or particular campus of a university, in the START-UP HELP Guidelines made for the purposes of paragraph (2)(h), unless the university or campus is located in a Remoteness Area categorised under the *ABS Remoteness Structure as Inner Regional Australia, Outer Regional Australia, Remote Australia or Very Remote Australia.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Regarding the rationale for moving items (2) and (3) together, item (2) on sheet 1937 relates to the STARTUP-HELP Guidelines requiring that the intellectual property rights of students be protected. Whatever is in or out of the guidelines—and we haven't had an opportunity to even read them because they've just been tabled and we don't know whether they're any different to the guidelines we received last week—the opposition is profoundly concerned that the bill does not include a provision which protects students' intellectual property. If students are going to do an accelerator or incubator course and they've got great ideas, they've got great innovations, they want to start a new business, it's very important that students know that their ideas are protected. So we think this is a very important amendment to make sure—standing up for students first—that their intellectual property is protected.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Item (3) also addresses another defect in the bill, and that relates to regional students doing an accelerator course at a regional university. I do respectfully disagree with Senator Faruqi, as she characterised the feedback and submissions we'd received in the Senate inquiry. There was deep concern expressed by a number of the regional universities that if a regional university did not have an existing accelerator course it was going to be very difficult under the current structure, given the funding model, to develop an accelerator course. We want to make sure that regional students and regional universities get every possible opportunity. So this amendment makes it clear that, as far as reasonably practical, at least 25 per cent of the persons selected for receipt of a startup HELP assistance are students enrolled in an accelerator program course at a regional university.

                   Too often, we've seen the government not properly consider the needs of regional Australia. Too often, we have been concerned that sometimes, in many different ways, the needs of people living in regional Australia—

                     . As I was saying, this is a very important provision to support regional students. I have been very concerned, as the shadow minister for education, travelling around the country as I have been, that regional universities have not been given due consideration in the many challenges they face.

                     places that have been announced, Commonwealth supported places, they're not able to use them all. They don't have the appropriate flexibility, in relation to how they can use that funding that's been provided by the government. They are very keen to utilise that funding in a different way by providing more enabling courses so that more students or potential students living in northern Queensland can access their university and go on to complete a course and to live and work armed with great knowledge from a university in northern Queensland.

                     I hope and trust that these two provisions will receive support across the chamber. We have been consulting widely, and I would commend both of these items, on page 1937, to the Senate.

                      ownership, as flagged in the draft guidelines, and the government has been clear from the beginning that the startup year will focus on getting underrepresented groups into the entrepreneurial ecosystem, specifically including programs that focus on solving regional issues through innovation. So the government will support the amendment, noting that essentially supports the position taken by government to date.

                          </a>
                          , I'm just going to interrupt you before you speak to your amendments to make sure that leave is granted for you to move them together, which I presume it will be. Leave is granted. Please continue.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Amendments (4) and (5) on sheet 1937 concern the ability of students to access a refund. We think this is critically important. So this provision provides that the debt for an accelerator program course with a higher education provider can be reversed if the secretary is satisfied that the course has not met its stated objectives. We propose these particular amendments because there is such high risk involved with these accelerator courses because they are full-fee-paying courses.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          As I mentioned earlier in this debate, the universities are doing a first-class job at delivering a very broad range of courses—accelerator courses, activator courses, incubator courses, co-working spaces and mentoring programs—which are mostly delivered at no cost to the student. So, if this scheme is going to be rolled out, we want to make sure that the universities are held to account.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          I will say that we have had some discussions with the government in relation to this particular amendment, and, from our discussions, I am concerned about any suggestion that this should be discretionary. Of course, this is very much in the hands of the secretary of the department, so we want to make sure that, if a student is charged $11,800 for a course, an enormous amount of money which, of course, will be indexed—and then who knows? With the way things are going, it could end up being a $20,000 debt for the student. We want to make sure that, if that course is not fit for purpose and doesn't meet its objectives, the student has an important opportunity to seek to obtain a refund.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          This will be safeguarded by the Secretary of the Department of Education. We recognise that, in determining the merits of a refund, there need to be proper principles in place, so that is why, in clause (2) under amendment (4), we are proposing that the guidelines must set out the principles and procedures that the secretary must follow in deciding whether the stated objectives of an accelerator program course have been met and that there are procedures for a person who is or has been enrolled in an accelerator program course to make an application to the secretary for an amount of STARTUP-HELP assistance to be reversed.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          We very much hope that this provision is not needed by any student. Assuming that any university does go ahead and deliver a
                          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup" rel="nofollow">
                           Startup
                          </a>
                          Year course, we very much hope that these courses are of the highest quality and that the universities will work exceptionally hard to make sure that they deliver real value for money. But, as we know, through the consultation process and the concerns that continue to be raised by a number of universities, the value to students is very much at issue. Despite the rhetoric from the government and despite the universities indicating they support the Startup Year program in principle, so far we have seen no evidence that these courses are going to deliver value, and therefore we want to make sure that the universities are held to account for the way in which these programs are delivered.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          This is a really important safeguard. This is about putting students first. Frankly, as I mentioned, we very much hope that students don't need this recourse and don't have to go through the rigmarole of applying for a refund and needing the secretary to make the appropriate assessment in relation to a course. But this is a safeguard of last resort, and it's very, very important, when students are facing cost-of-living pressures as they are, remembering, of course, that most students who will embark on a Startup Year course, if any do—and, as I said in my speech in the second reading debate, currently I don't think there is any merit in any student doing a Startup Year course and incurring such enormous debt with such little discernible value. Perhaps the universities will deliver some courses that present that value, but, if they do, we want to make sure that students are protected. I really hope and trust that we can attract the support of the Senate in adopting this particular amendment. As I said, this is a recourse of last resort. This demonstrates the opposition's concern for the cost-of-living crisis that so many students are facing.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          This also reflects our deep concern about the enormous acceleration in student debt—another 7.1 per cent increase in student debt from 1 June. We expect there'll be another very significant increase next year—at least three per cent, maybe four per cent. All in all, under Labor, more than three million Australians with a student debt are looking at an increase in their student debt, by reason of the indexation which applies, of some 15 per cent. In the last decade, principally under the coalition, the average indexation rate was two per cent. It was moderate, it reflected a strong bipartisanship that we've always had for the
                          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HECS" rel="nofollow">
                           HECS
                          </a>
                          -HELP scheme and it was fair. But this is not fair. When you couple this with the fact that the HECS payment system is antiquated and needs urgent reform—particularly when students are paying down their debt, those repayments are not being realised in real time and students are being indexed on the higher rate from 1 July, the beginning of the financial year—then we think this is really, really important.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          I hope, Minister, that you might support this. This will demonstrate that the government does care about student debt. Your support, Minister, for this provision would demonstrate that the government is putting the needs of students first, with respect to those who do a Startup Year course that doesn't measure up. We hope and trust that this particular amendment does attract the support of the Senate.

                            I have a number of questions in relation to the minister's position on amendments (4) and (5). Minister, I am deeply concerned that the government is not supporting these provisions, which give students the right to secure a refund. I'm deeply concerned that the government doesn't see the merit. I appreciate that there are existing measures in relation to these matters, but, insofar as what's been presented to me from the government, they are discretionary. In our discussions in relation to this particular provision, what was put forward to me would not give students an inherent right to secure a refund. In fact, this provides that the

                            guidelines must include the provisions to secure a startup refund. Could you explain to me, Minister, why it is that you don't believe universities should be held to account to ensure that they deliver the best quality courses?

                             We do believe that they should be held to account. But, as I mentioned, we believe that there are sufficient existing mechanisms in place to ensure that higher education providers do the right thing and that we address the noncompliant delivery of courses by them. We believe that that will also be in place to cover the

In addition, we've also said that the working group and then the pilot program will be closely assessing and monitoring the quality of courses to be approved and offered. We think we've got the appropriate mechanisms in place through both existing structures and then what we're proposing around the working group to ensure that we have this important issue covered.

                                That sounds very vague, Minister. I don't quite know what you mean by that. How will the working group ensure that universities are going to provide courses of the quality which justifies the government imposing a full fee of $11,600 for one simple course that currently students can do for nothing? Where is the protection for students? You've not given me any satisfaction at all. If you're saying that there are alternative ways in which a student can obtain a refund if a course doesn't measure up, can you please explain what they are?

                                   My understanding of the way the process works is that students are able to start a complaints progress through the university that they're enrolled at, and then other mechanisms can flow from that, but that is the starting point for students if they wish to raise a complaint.

                                      I have to say that sounds totally inadequate. What you're proposing is that students will need to go through a horrendous bureaucratic nightmare to get justice if a university rolls out an accelerator course which doesn't measure up. I am very disappointed that the government has not seen merit in this particular amendment. Based on what you have said, I have no sense of satisfaction at all that students will be able to get a refund. Could you just confirm to me the period of time it would take if a course is defective, doesn't meet its objectives or hasn't delivered for a student to make a complaint, to go through TEQSA, to have the university audit it and to examine the merits of the complaint? Does the student have an inherent right to access a refund?

                                       I don't have a time line in front of me as to how long it would take. But the point is that this currently applies to students in universities now. So it is the same process for a student enrolled now, in terms of the process they would have to go through. If they were unhappy or if they were seeking some sort of recompense, the same as it is for a student now would apply to the

                                           Year program is rolled out in full, the universities or the government require the universities to conduct a pilot. In the initial consultation, one of the deep concerns of the universities was, 'We can't see the value proposition, we can't see what discernible benefit this provides to students, we are deeply concerned, and we suggest that a pilot be rolled out first.' The government says that it took into account the scathing criticism that it received in the consultation process. In fact, it was so scathing that the government did everything it could to keep the submissions to the consultation secret, and the opposition needed to secure an order in the Senate to have those submissions made public, as I mentioned in my second reading speech.

                                           One of the principal concerns of the university sector was that they need to understand the efficacy of this Startup Year program, how it will work, how they can assess it. This amendment provides that three higher education providers will conduct a pilot, there will be prescribed requirements in relation it to, there will be an independent review of the pilot and that independent review will produce a report to be tabled in each house of the parliament. This would ensure that there is appropriate accountability and transparency. While the amendment requires that the pilot must be completed no later than two years after the commencement of this section, the bottom line is that the universities are simply not ready to deliver any of these courses. I'm laughing because I'm watching one of the minister's advisers laughing. I probably shouldn't make that comment; I accept that.

                                           I accept that I should not be reflecting on advisers. The bottom line is, as the universities have indicated to me, they're not ready because this so-called Startup Year program starts in under two weeks. We don't have the course, we don't have a proposal, nothing has been designed. The guidelines have just been tabled today. The university sector has been blind as to how this program will work, and it will take, based on the advice I've received, a very significant amount of time to design the courses, to promote them and to market them. This could take some 18 months, so this is a responsible and appropriate response to a ham-fisted scheme which will at least ensure that the efficacy of the Startup Year program and this loan scheme can be properly piloted.

                                           The government is proposing to roll out one thousand places. That is not a proper pilot. Just delivering half of the program now is not a proper pilot. We want to make sure that a proper pilot is delivered that will ensure that the welfare and the rights of students are first and foremost. This is about protecting students. I have to say that we went about this with a lot of good faith. We did not oppose this bill in the House. We did seek to pass a second reading amendment, which was very critical of aspects of the bill. But we went about this with a lot of good faith because we recognise that startup courses, accelerator courses and incubators are key to so many young Australians getting ahead and getting the mentoring and guidance they need to start their first business, to come up with a great idea, to develop it, to grow a business and to employ others in their business. As I mentioned earlier, the
                                           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTS" rel="nofollow">

                                           Startups hub has developed businesses that have a total value of more than $500 million. These courses are incredibly important. If the government, with this crazy idea, now wants to start charging for courses that currently students can do for nothing, then the government should be held to account and this scheme should be properly tested.
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                           So I commend this amendment to the Senate. It also provides that, in relation to designing a pilot, the minister should consult with key stakeholders and peak representative bodies from the higher education sector, as well as organisations currently running accelerator programs. We want the government to work with industry, with those running accelerator programs and with higher education providers to make sure that we have a proper pilot that can be tested on agreed criteria and then properly reviewed with the appropriate accountability back to the parliament.
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                           This will be a very positive measure for students, and, frankly, it could save the government from itself. I'm absolutely certain that a properly run pilot would identify a range of risks and a range of gaps in this program which will give the parliament the opportunity to improve. So I do commend this amendment to the Senate. The opposition is very proud to be standing up for students and putting their needs, their welfare and their best interests at heart first and foremost.

                                            's concerns for the government's welfare. It's much appreciated, Senator Henderson, but the government will be opposing this amendment. We have already stated the startup year will commence with a 12-month pilot program. The opposition amendment seeks to artificially limit the pilot to three universities. In our view, this will restrict the effectiveness of the pilot and runs contrary to the opposition's earlier amendment that regions must be included in this program.
                                           </p>
                                           <p>
                                            The draft guidelines make it clear that a working group will be convened, as recommended in the consultation process, to advise on the pilot program and their work together with the departments. This should not be artificially limited by the opposition's amendment. And the government will oppose it.

                                            Just on some other clarity that Senator Henderson might find helpful, it is the view of the government that universities will be able to apply to conduct courses in the second half of this year. We would then imagine students starting in February next year. That would be the time line that we'd be working towards.

                                                 Minister, you didn't use those words. Your representation was that universities would be starting courses—or some universities would be ready to start courses in February of next year. And I put it to you that they won't be ready to start in February of next year. They've only just seen the guidelines tabled in the Senate today—these are the guidelines which underpin how this startup year program will run—so they've got absolutely no idea how the government proposes to run the startup year courses, because they've only just learnt of those today. So I would welcome any further advice that you have, because

So what you're putting to me, Minister, is that, in 12 months, the universities are going to apply for places, promote a course of up to 1,000 places, market the course in the coming months, have the course ready to go from February of next year—up to 1,000 places—and then complete the pilot by mid next year, which is the end of semester 1. On what basis do you give that assurance to the Senate?

That is why we took this policy to the election. It was one that was endorsed by the Australian people. We are obviously quite excited about it. I think it is something that the country has fallen behind on. We think that this is going to be a good incentive to get people who do have a vision for themselves being an innovator to make use of these courses. We think that there is strong demand in the community. Obviously that's the work that will be undertaken by the department and the working group if we are able to pass this legislation.

                                                           Minister, where is your evidence that there is strong demand for students to sign up to and spend $11,600 on courses they can do for nothing? What student in their right mind would take on that sort of debt when currently we have no evidence at all that these courses are going to be any better than the ones currently on offer? You talk about incentives; this is a perverse disincentive. Why would a student sign up? It would have to be something incredible to justify a student paying this sort of money. This is a perverse disincentive to do a
                                                           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup" rel="nofollow">

                                                           Year accelerator course, because the government didn't even have the decency to provide these places with Commonwealth subsidy. The government were so committed to this scheme that they thought they would hit students with a full-fee-paying debt. So I again return to my question: where is the evidence that any student would sign up? Do you have any testimonials from any student group—or anyone at all—who said, 'Minister and Prime Minister, we want to sign up and do a course and pay $11,600, $11,800 or even $23,600, if we do two courses; we want to take that debt on rather than do a course for no cost'?

                                                           This is why this is such a hairbrained scheme. If the accelerator courses being offered by the universities were not working, if there weren't accelerator courses, if the universities weren't investing, I could understand it. But the fact of the matter is the university sector sees great value in delivering this incredible wide range of courses, and they are, right across this country. As I say, you have presented no evidence at all that any student is going to be unwise enough to take on this level of debt to do a course they can currently do for nothing. I would again invite you to provide the Senate with evidence that students are going to sign up to this course.

I think it was something like 55 per cent of students who indicated they were interested. Then there is also the feedback from universities. I've talked about this repeatedly.

You only have to attend a university campus and talk to students to hear about the interesting things they're doing but also how optimistic they are about the future and the role they can play in the future. We think this bill will play an important part in that.

                                                             initially took the view that, if the government were going to provide any funding for student entrepreneurs, that money should go to the students by way of capital to support the students in their various enterprises. Yes, there was a bit of a backflip in the Senate inquiry; I do agree with that. But I also am concerned that the university sector are seeking to appease the government. Perhaps they see a bucket of money coming their way as part of the Universities Accord process. I think they'll be sadly disappointed. But I think the initial consultation that we saw indicated the enormous breadth of concern from the university sector.

Unfortunately, we weren't able to access all of the data, because the government refused to provide that. But, in the data that the government has provided, 55 per cent of students surveyed—and we're looking at 530 students, which is only a very small handful, in three focus groups—have an interest in joining a startup; 83 per cent would join a university accelerator; and the majority, 58 per cent, would consider taking out a

We had an ongoing session at education estimates about that. We understand that students are doing it tough in relation to their

It is something the government are aware of, but we also do acknowledge the overwhelming difference that HECS has made for the country in terms of enabling people to go to university who otherwise would have missed out. I can put myself in that category. If it were not for HECS, I have no doubt I would never have been able to achieve at university. I am sure there would be others as well.

My understanding is that the accelerator start-up program is capped as well in terms of HECS. That is what will apply in relation to the start-up program.

We've also been focused on the university accord, but we also want to deliver on our election promises. That's what this legislation is about.

I also share this concern for students going into newly formed accelerator programs, and, should those programs not be up to scratch, then having some sort of recourse, some sort of way to get a refund. These amendments state that a university can be required to conduct an audit of the course, and, should it be found to be deficient, then the students would be entitled to a refund. I thank Senator Henderson for her work on this bill and her concern for students who potentially would be billed for a course that does not necessarily meet the requirements, but I believe this is a way to achieve that outcome through using an audit. Minister, I just have one question. The bill being around startups and entrepreneurship, I'm interested in why the emphasis is on the accelerator programs creating qualifications rather than startups, and, with that in mind, whether the government will consider providing funding to expand accelerator programs that have a proven record of helping support startups. For example, here in Canberra the Canberra Innovation Network, CBRIN, has a long history of working with universities and working with students, helping them develop their startup. An independent review suggested that, for every $1 invested in CBRIN, they were returning $50 worth of value to the Canberra area.

The provision that the opposition has put forward, in relation to student refunds, puts the students first and foremost. There's a lot of legalese in this particular amendment, but the bottom line is that the government is not required to make these provisions, because of the way in which clause 2 of item 1 is drafted. I just want to raise that concern and ask you whether you also share my concerns that the government should not be allowed to be let off the hook on this and that it should be mandatory that the government provides students with the opportunity to have their fee reversed and to get the refund if, as I've talked about already in this debate, it is necessary—if a course doesn't measure up.

I'd invite Senator Pocock to reply if he has any concerns that he wants to share with the Senate on that. But my concern about this amendment is that there's no compulsion to do so. Therefore, it leaves students stranded without the appropriate mechanism to secure a refund, and it really only becomes a matter of discretion as to whether the government includes these provisions in the guidelines. Minister, I'd like to check something with you. As you know, I've received a copy of your guidelines during this debate, but, obviously, I haven't had an opportunity to read them. Do your guidelines provide provisions in relation to the requirement of universities to conduct an internal audit?

Is the government willing to include this as a mandatory obligation, because I understand this is Senator D Pocock's amendment, but currently this is only a matter of discretion, which gives students no guarantees whatsoever.

I'm still considering our position in relation to this amendment, because we haven't had a division in relation to the amendments brought forward by the opposition, so it's quite tricky to work out whether our provision in relation to refunds for student debt will be supported. We need to keep our options open, at this point in time, because divisions will be held tomorrow.
                                                                                          </p>

They've stated that they will update the guidelines to be consistent with whatever passes here. I don't see a problem with moving from 'may' to 'must', but I'm happy to engage on this more. You said this is the first you've seen it circulated in the chamber. My understanding is that there have been discussions about this. Is this the first time you've seen it or have you actually seen this amendment before?

From you saying that you won't agree to changing the wording in provision 2 from 'may' to 'must' so that there is an obligation to include this provision in the guidelines, I can only deduce that the government is not committed to providing the rights of an internal audit such that students can then access a refund, which is deeply concerning. Why would the government not agree to this if you were committed to giving students a refund using this mechanism?

So I hope that, by splitting this amendment, it will give an opportunity for senators to actually vote for one or the other or both. I don't think I need to make another case here for why this is being done because I've spoken about it almost every single day for the last six months and already have a bill in the Senate, so that's it from me.

It is not like a home loan or a personal loan, where, if the interest goes up, your payments go up. It's built on a really important principle that you pay what you can afford, and you don't pay more unless you earn more. To remove or freeze indexation on loans or not apply it to a future loan means shifting that financial burden onto taxpayers. So the government will be opposing these amendments.

This is a scheme that has worked well to support students to take on a university course and not have to find the funding for that course upfront. It has generally been a very successful scheme, but we have seen deep concerns arise by reason of escalating student debt, with an indexation of 7.1 per cent.
                                                                                                   </p>

Over three years, under this government, we are looking at a total indexation of 15 per cent. So the best thing, frankly, that we can do is see the return of a Liberal-National government which knows how to run the economy, which prioritises lower inflation, which reins in spending and which runs the economy responsibly. It's no accident that we saw very, very low indexation under our government. Students and young Australians—in fact, more than three million Australians—who have been hit with an average increase in their student debt of $1,700 a year have every right to question the government's competence in relation to this scheme. We hope and trust that under a future Liberal-National government the scheme will return to the great success that it was with moderate indexation, allowing students to do the courses of their choice, to follow their dreams to go to university, to take on a
