        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Eric Abetz. Can the minister confirm that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Human_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Human Services
        </a>
        told
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICT" rel="nofollow">
         ICT
        </a>
        staff in Hobart on 5 December that it intends to transfer 56 ICT positions from Hobart to Adelaide, Brisbane and Canberra? How is this loss of jobs consistent with assurances the department gave staff in April 2013 that there were no plans to 'move existing staff from, or close the ICT functions in Hobart'?

         The scenario to which the honourable senator refers is unfortunately just one of the many examples of the 14,500 job cuts implicit in the last Labor budget, for which the honourable senator voted.
        </p>
        <p>
         These are part of the cost-saving measures that are regrettably required as a result of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Labor Party
         </a>
         making savings but not telling the Australian people about them and the consequences. So part of the budgeting that the Labor Party undertook and took to the last election included downsizing and amalgamating groups of individuals to the tune of 14½ thousand people.
        </p>
        <p>
         And, of course, make no mistake: that total of 14½ thousand people—and I do accept,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
          Mr President
         </a>
         , that each one of those 14½ thousand people is a person and is a breadwinner with aspirations; chances are with mortgages and with loans that they seek to pay off—that Labor said needed to be removed from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Public_Service" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Public Service
         </a>
         unfortunately has that consequence. And part of that consequence is the regrettable loss of jobs in our home city of Hobart.
        </p>
        <p>
         Am I happy about it? No. But Senator Singh, you and the Labor Party were the architects. They were the architects, Mr President, and this was in the pipeline courtesy of the policies that Senator Singh and others voted for.

             , I ask a supplementary question. I refer the minister to the Prime Minister's statement in Launceston on 8 August when he told Tasmanians:
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             … we want to look at boosting the Commonwealth presence in regional areas, not reducing the Commonwealth presence in regional areas.

            <p>
             Isn't the decision to transfer 56 jobs from Hobart yet another example of the government saying one thing before the election and doing the opposite now in government?

               The Prime Minister did put to the Tasmanian people a very comprehensive plan in relation to Tasmania's economic future. That plan included many things, such as new jobs at Cadbury's, new jobs in the dairy sector, new jobs in construction on the

                  , I have a further supplementary question. I am pleased that the senator refers to the coalition's pre-election economic growth plan, because I also refer to it. For Tasmania it said a coalition government would provide scope for 'Commonwealth agencies or functions to be relocated in whole or part from Canberra to Tasmania'. Doesn't the decision to transfer jobs from Hobart to Canberra mean that the coalition's Economic Growth Plan for Tasmania isn't worth the paper it's written on?

                   The affected outrage from Senator Singh might have some credibility but for the fact that she was kicked out by the people of Denison at the last state election because of the job-destroying policies of the Labor Party in that state. Now she is here voting for policies to get rid of Public Service jobs, not by 50s but by the thousands—14½ thousand—and then she claims a concern for job opportunities in Tasmania. Tasmania, as a result of Labor legacy issues—both Canberra and Hobart—has the highest unemployment rate in the country. It is in recession because of Labor-Greens policies from Canberra and Hobart. If you want to do something for job opportunities in Tasmania, vote to remove the carbon tax, vote to remove the mining tax, to ensure that the cost of living can be enhanced.
