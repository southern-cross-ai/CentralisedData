        and the Arts, Senator Coonan. As the minister is aware, the continuation of reliable mobile phone coverage is an extremely important issue for regional and rural Australians. Will the minister please advise the Senate of any government action to protect those living and working in regional and rural Australia from the potential for a premature closure of the

         I thank Senator Ronaldson for the question and for his interest in regional and rural telecommunication services and, in particular, the important issue of the closure of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDMA" rel="nofollow">
          CDMA
         </a>
         network. Since announcing its intention to construction the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_G" rel="nofollow">
          Next G
         </a>
         network, Telstra has given public assurances that the CDMA network will continue to operate until the Next G network provides at least as good coverage and services. The government has heard loud and clear the concerns from regional and rural Australia about the problems currently being experienced with the Next G network. After hearing those concerns, I issued Telstra with a draft licence condition that would, if made, require Telstra to keep the CDMA network in operation until the Next G network provided at least as good coverage and services. In accordance with the legislative requirements, Telstra was given 30 days to consider the draft licence condition. Disappointingly, however, before I had a chance to fully consider Telstra’s submission on the draft, it commenced civil action in an attempt to prevent a final decision being made to protect rural and regional Australians from the network being shut down until there was equivalent or better coverage.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is a very important matter for rural and regional consumers and they deserve better than to be left hanging while Telstra subjects them to a time-consuming, costly and pointless legal dispute. Accordingly, last week I authorised the Attorney-General, the Hon.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillip_Ruddock" rel="nofollow">
          Phillip Ruddock
         </a>
         , to consider the matter and, if warranted, to make the decision in relation to the draft licence condition. I was today advised that the Attorney has in fact made the decision to vary the conditions of Telstra’s carrier licence to protect users in the transition from CDMA to Next G.

                     I was in the process of saying that so afraid were the Labor Party to interrupt their cosy little relationship with Telstra that they could not even raise a whimper of support for the protection of rural and regional Australians. Mr Rudd and his union mates should stand condemned today for their abject failure to stand up for consumers around Australia when it comes to mobile phone coverage. In contrast, the government makes no apologies for putting consumers first when considering the regulation of Australia’s telecommunications industry.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The government understands that good mobile coverage is not an optional extra; it is vitally important. People living in regional and rural Australia can be absolutely assured that this government will continue to stand up for their interests and deliver them the services they need and want.

                            As those listening to this broadcast will know, the Labor Party has a long record of seminal neglect in looking after rural and regional Australia. It will not stand up for rural and regional Australians, whether it is delivering them broadband or delivering them mobile phones. We all know that the Labor Party is hand in glove with Telstra. It will ride roughshod over consumers in rural and regional Australia and it will continue this neglect as long as it suits its interests, which is so long as the Labor Party is in cahoots with Telstra.
