         As Senator Coonan would be well aware from her experience as a minister in the former government, Treasury model a great number of options. Ultimately it is the government of the day that determines what options are adopted, if indeed the particular option she is referring to was one. I can confirm that it is longstanding government practice not to comment on matters that may or may not have gone to cabinet or its committees. As the documents make clear, these various options were canvassed in the context of the 2009-10 budget in May and were not adopted.

         What we do know, of course, is that the current shadow Treasurer,

          Mr Hockey
         </a>
         , did want to adopt at least one of those options. It is interesting that the Liberal Party, as advanced by the arguments of the shadow Treasurer, Mr Hockey, are the only political party that want to increase taxes in Australia. They are the ones—

          , I rise on a point of order. Sessional orders require that a minister’s answer be directly relevant to the question asked. The question asked was very simply whether or not Treasury had modelled an income-tax surcharge on so-called high-income earners. What other people’s policies might be is completely and utterly irrelevant.

           : Senator Abetz raises a spurious point of order. Senator Sherry was directly responding to the question about whether consideration was given to these issues as part of the determination of the 2009-10 budget. Senator Sherry was directly responding on those issues. I think you ought to rule that he has dealt with it, as he should do, by being relevant to the question.

            I do consider that the minister is answering the question, but I point out that I cannot direct the minister to answer the question or respond to it in the particular manner that the person asking the question might wish. Senator Sherry, I do draw your attention to the question. If there is anything further you wish to add to the answer that you have given, you have 49 seconds remaining.

             . This Labor government is very, very proud of its tax record. We have delivered on the election commitments and promises we made. The tax cuts we have delivered—not modelling or options but the tax cuts delivered by this government—we are very, very proud of. Let me give a couple of examples. We have doubled the low-income tax offset from $750 in 2007-08 to $1,500 by 1 July. We have increased the 30 per cent threshold from $30,100 to $37,100. We have also reduced the tax rate applying to income over $80,000 from 40 per cent to 38 per cent.

               this Saturday that related to issues around types of taxes. As I have indicated, neither the Henry tax review nor the government has sought such research or proposals. I think I have described it as ‘utter rubbish’. Those were my comments in respect of the report in the

                       In respect of the point of order, there is no point of order. Senator Sherry has been answering the question. The question goes to the issue of increasing tax. He is being directly relevant to the question by providing a response in relation to that. He is being directly relevant with that response.
