          [by video link] I completely reject Senator Pratt's assertion and its implications. It is completely false. Indeed, it is an attempt to beat these statements up—statements that were in no way suggesting that any particular part of Australia was as Senator Pratt has suggested. This was an analogy drawn about the very important pathway out of the challenging situation Australia and, indeed, the world faces. Our plan is one focused very much on driving vaccination across Australia to support Australians, as we hit the 70 per cent and 80 per cent targets informed by the experts at the Doherty institute, to be able to move beyond widespread statewide lockdowns and restrictions—to be able to move beyond the restrictions that prohibit individuals from being able to reunite with families and loved ones or pursue business opportunities across state borders. We want to see success for Australia. As we have succeeded, relative to so many other nations, in saving lives, we want to see success on the way out of this as well. Of course, what we have from the Labor Party is no plan—no plan, no pathway. All we have are these cheap political points that we're getting, whilst the rest of the country is getting on with striving towards the plan.

            In stark contrast to the Labor Party, Australians are turning out in record numbers, day in, day out, getting vaccinated, driving us toward the targets we need as a nation. That's what's going to get us there—

              not the type of cheap point scoring from Senator Pratt or whatever it is that Senator Watt, who I can't hear from here, is saying. Frankly, all of them ought to think about the national interest—it's a blessing that I can't hear him! All should think about the national interest being served by driving the vaccine targets to a point where we can actually give Australians certainty and hope for the future.

                   [by video link] No, it's not. But Senator Pratt's desire to create division across Australia is absolutely a way to hurt the nation. It's a way of trying to hurt and divide. It's a way that will not help

More than 307,000 people turned out yesterday across the country to have another vaccination dose or to have their first dose, climbing our numbers, as we've seen with our senior Australians—now more than 85 per cent of whom over the age of 70 have had that first dose and so many of them have had the second. They're setting the example, a positive example, that we want

                       (—) (): [by video link] Senator Pratt is showing no sense or logic in recognising what is happening right around the world at present. Australia has been dealing for more than 18 months, as every other country has, with a global pandemic, a once-in-a-century pandemic. As a nation, we've saved lives far more effectively than most others. I pay tribute to and acknowledge the

We've all managed to suppress it in ways that have saved lives. But, as a result, we didn't get the prioritisation that Europe or the

                        I'm going to ask the indulgence of the Senate. The parliamentary photographer is here, if we all just want him to take a shot of this somewhat unique parliamentary arrangement. This was done in the House yesterday. I'll stop the clock on question time for that matter. It's appropriate the Senate gets recorded as well, not just the House. Thank you.
