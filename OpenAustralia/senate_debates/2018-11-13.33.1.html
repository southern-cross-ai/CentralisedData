        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Cormann. I refer to the minister's letter to the President responding to questions taken on notice yesterday in relation to Prime Minister Morrison's sacking as managing director of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Tourism Australia
        </a>
        by the Howard government. The minister's letter states, 'I can confirm that the performance requirements for the Prime Minister's contract at Tourism Australia were fully satisfied.' Minister, why was Prime Minister Morrison sacked only a year and a half into his contract by a unanimous decision of the board without any dissent whatsoever?

         I was not a minister in the government in the period 1996-2007. I can see that the Labor Party is interested in the ancient past. We are interested in the future. We also understand that the people of Australia know very well what an outstanding performer Prime Minister Morrison has been in every single one of his ministerial and shadow ministerial responsibilities. They know how effective he has been in fixing up Labor's mess at our borders. They know how effective he has been in initiating and implementing social welfare reform, getting people back from welfare into work. That, of course, is why the proportion of working-age Australians on welfare today is the lowest it has been in 25 years. I know that Prime Minister Morrison, as Treasurer, was the key architect to turn around the situation that we inherited from Labor. When Labor lost government in 2013, when Mr Bowen was Treasurer in 2013, they left behind a weakening economy, rising unemployment and a rapidly deteriorating budget position. Today, the economy is stronger, employment growth is stronger, the unemployment rate is well below where it was anticipated it would be—down to five per cent—and the budget position is stronger and improving. At the next election, the Australian people will be contrasting the strong plan, the strong team and the strong performance of the Prime Minister against the reckless, anti-business, class-warfare, politics-of-envy agenda of Mr Shorten turning Australian against Australian—

                Firstly, I would refer Senator Sterle to a previous answer where I pointed out that I'm in this chamber representing Prime Minister Morrison. I'm not in this chamber representing a Prime Minister a couple of prime ministers ago. And the other point I would make is that you are flogging a dead horse. How about focusing on the Australian people? How about focusing on giving the Australian people the best possible opportunity to get ahead? How about focusing on a pro-business, lower taxes, increased growth, more-jobs agenda where more Australians will have the opportunity to get a job, to build a career and to get the best possible—

                  Again, my point of order goes to direct relevance. I don't know why the minister is so scared of telling the truth, but the one question that has now been asked on five occasions that the minister is refusing to answer is: why was the Prime Minister sacked after a year and a half?

                    . If the Labor Party wants to continue to ask me questions about decisions that were made in the period of the Howard government, good luck to them. We're going to continue to focus on the best interests of the Australian people today and into the future. We will continue to make decisions to ensure that Australians today and into the future have the best possible opportunity to get ahead.
