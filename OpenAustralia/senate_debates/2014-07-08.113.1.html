        I rise to note a centenary that should be celebrated by all Australians, and that is the centenary of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Red_Cross" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Red Cross
        </a>
        . On 13 August 1914, the Australian branch of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Red_Cross_Society" rel="nofollow">
         British Red Cross Society
        </a>
        was formed at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_House" rel="nofollow">
         Government House
        </a>
        in Melbourne, just nine days after the outbreak of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">
         World War I
        </a>
        . The Australian Red Cross, as it became known when it was recognised in its own right in 1927, has grown to be one of the most successful humanitarian caring organisations in Australian history and life. By 1944, the Red Cross had reached a membership of some 450,000 Australians who were contributing towards its valuable work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many Australians know the work of the Red Cross through their blood donation services, something that they have been doing from their early days. Indeed, we saw the first plastic blood packs being used in Australia in 1960. In 1970 we saw Red Cross make a breakthrough in blood screening for hepatitis B and in 1980 it screened for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV" rel="nofollow">
         HIV
        </a>
        for the first time. Equally, Red Cross has a huge role in disaster relief and assistance, working both within Australia and internationally. In 2002, Red Cross launched the Bali Appeal after the Bali bombings and raised some $15 million through that appeal. In their response in 2004 to the Asian earthquake and tsunami, which devastated Indonesia, Thailand,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka" rel="nofollow">
         Sri Lanka
        </a>
        and the Maldives, their disaster relief appeal raised some $108½ million. In 2008, in response to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Saturday" rel="nofollow">
         Black Saturday
        </a>
        bushfires which devastated Victoria, their appeal raised some $379 million.
       </p>
       <p>
        The commitment of Australians to Australian Red Cross, after their 100 years of work, remains very strong to this day. It is a centenary well worth celebrating, and it is well worth ensuring that people recommit themselves to the work of Red Cross into the future, whether it is through those blood donation services, that humanitarian relief and disaster relief and assistance, or the many other practical activities that Red Cross undertake, such as first aid training and the like. As part of their centenary celebrations, Red Cross has set up a website, centenary.redcross.org.au, to collect stories about people's involvement with Red Cross. Looking at some of the fabulous stories that have already been put up there, I was drawn by a couple. There is the story of Rosemary Smith, speaking of service to Red Cross in the 1960s, who said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In the 1960s, I helped Nan at the Red Cross Canteen at the Adelaide Children’s Hospital. When decimal currency was coming there was a great debate. We could get six lollies for sixpence, but when it became five cents, would we only get five lollies? It did not seem fair.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I remember many parents, with children, waiting all day to see a doctor. Nan gave them the leftover buns. I was a member of the Dunant Red Cross Younger Set in the 60s, established by staff of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_Bank" rel="nofollow">
         Savings Bank
        </a>
        of South Australia. We organised a band and barbecue and hundreds came. I was turning sausages in my sleep! We had to comb the grass tennis court on our hands and knees the next morning for butts and rubbish. It was a very successful fundraiser.
       </p>
       <p>
        Her story is one of many.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another story is from Barbara Elefsen from Whyalla. She told the story of coming to Whyalla in 2000 from Minnipa in South Australia. She said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I was an Anglican and I offered to do church flowers where I met Clare McNamara and asked her about some voluntary things to do around Whyalla. She suggested Red Cross and I joined in 2009.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I have found Red Cross very interesting as I help with

        and Badge Day. I also enjoyed going to meetings and conferences and the friendship it offers. I am looking forward to 2014 Centenary and our

        project.
       </p>
       <p>
        Other stories went back some distance. Fay Jackson told her story of leaving the Mount Millar farm after 43 years to live in Whyalla. She needed to get to know people so her first choice was to join the Whyalla Red Cross. She said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Over the years I have been involved in doorknocking, badge days, blood bank and helped out at our conferences, all of which I have enjoyed.

        My mother was a Red Cross member in Cowell for many years. During World War

        , mum and I knitted many helmets, socks, gloves, and scarves for the soldiers. I enjoy meeting up with friends at our meetings and having a chat afterwards with a cup of tea. I am now in the process of making a Red Cross Banner with members names stitched on.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I was a blood donor up until the age of 70, giving a total of 50 pints. I was the first blood donor in Cowell.
       </p>
       <p>
        It has been a remarkable 100 years for the Red Cross. May there be many, many more successful years of humanitarian and community work.
