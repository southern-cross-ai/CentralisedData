        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Evans. Details released in the

         Strategic Indigenous Housing and Infrastructure Program
        </a>
        report reveal that the total budget—either allocated for the first three packages or already spent—equals $182.54 million, or 28 per cent of the total program work budget. Given the contracts let to date will deliver only around seven per cent of the required houses and 1.5 per cent of the rebuilds, will the government now concede that their promise of 750 houses and some 2,730 refurbishments and rebuilds cannot be delivered through the existing Strategic Indigenous Housing and Infrastructure Program budget?

         I thank Senator Scullion for the question. I suppose the first thing to say is: leave the maths to the mathematicians. I read your release and it does not add up, so your criticisms are not right. You made some mistakes in your assumptions and, therefore, your conclusions are wrong as well. I am happy to take you through those. But I am informed by Ms Macklin that the maths is wrong because some of the assumptions are wrong. So let me take you through some of that. I understand your calculations assume—

             The calculations attached to Senator Scullion’s press release assume that all of the $45 million spent under SIHIP up to 30 June 2009 was on program management costs. But, as the review clearly showed, less than $18 million of that expenditure at that time was for program management. It also appears that you have not appreciated that the $128 million allocated for the first three packages on the

             will be spent on improving essential services infrastructure, delivering power, water, sewerage and roads. Finally, I am advised that the press release of Senator Scullion states that there will be 37 refurbishments and upgrades provided under the first three packages; however, there will actually be 308 rebuilds and refurbishments in the first three packages.

              are alleged to have cost around $560,000, and the revised budget provided by the government for all future houses is $450,000. Given the budget blowouts, how can the government continue to claim all promises can be met within existing allocations?

               The simple answer to the question is that the minister, Ms Macklin, has made it very clear that the commitments will be honoured—the commitments to building 750 new houses and performing 230 rebuilds and 2,500 refurbishments by 2013 will be met. That is the answer—that she will meet those requirements. I am sure at the up and coming estimates we will be able to take you through all the detail about the expenditure and the cost of houses et cetera. I suspect we will spend quite a bit of time on it, and I look forward to that. But the key response to you is to make it very clear that Ms Macklin and the government will deliver on the commitment made in relation to the number of houses, the number of rebuilds and the number of refurbishments. The government is committed to delivering on those assurances.

Given the minister’s confirmation that 750 houses will in fact be built and given that the government have invested some $45 million in what would have to be the largest consultation of all time, will the minister now provide a list of how many houses will be built community by community?
