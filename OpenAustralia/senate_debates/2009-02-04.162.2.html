         by leave—The coalition will not be supporting this motion, but I want to put our motivation in context. The coalition is deeply saddened by civilian casualties on both sides of the Israeli-Gaza border. The coalition supports the government in providing aid for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          United Nations
         </a>
         to be used for humanitarian purposes in Gaza. The Israeli ceasefire declaration was important in attempting to bring an end to the violence, but Hamas must reciprocate. Hamas should respect the ceasefire conditions as outlined by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council" rel="nofollow">
          United Nations Security Council
         </a>
         ’s Resolution 1860, notably containing specific guarantees to Israel’s security including an explicit condemnation of terrorist attacks on civilians and the demand that member states act to stop the smuggling of arms into Gaza. And finally, the coalition has pointed out that it was the conduct of Hamas that violated the ceasefire with its unprovoked rocket attacks on Israeli towns, villages and civilians. There can only be lasting peace if Hamas accepts the state of Israel’s right to exist within secure borders.

              That is unfortunate, because with these foreign affairs motions I might seek leave again to complete my remarks. The government’s position on the conflict in Gaza is well known. We are strongly supportive of the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
               United Nations
              </a>
              Security Council Resolution 1860 and its call for an immediate, durable and fully-respected ceasefire. For this ceasefire to be effective it will require an end to arms-smuggling in the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip" rel="nofollow">
               Gaza Strip
              </a>
              , an end to rocket attacks on Israel by Hamas, and the opening of border crossings. Australia condemns recent rocket attacks from Gaza into Israel and understands that Israel has responded through air strikes. This recent outbreak underlines the importance of a durable and fully-respected ceasefire.
             </p>
             <p>
              Australia regrets the number of people that have been killed and injured in this conflict. The original motion tabled by Senator Hanson-Young referred only to conflict in Gaza. We welcome the preparedness of the senator to amend the motion to refer to the conflict in Southern Israel. In addition to referring to those Palestinians who have lost their lives it is important that the motion refers to the conflict in Southern Israel following rocket attacks from Hamas, a terrorist organisation, over several months.
             </p>
             <p>
              In response to this crisis Australia recognised the need for urgent humanitarian assistance including medical assistance. I inform the Senate that the government has provided $10 million since 1 January this year for emergency humanitarian aid. This is in addition to the doubling of Australia’s assistance to the Palestinian people in 2008 of $45 million. We are committed to assisting further where we can. This conflict has demonstrated once again the vital need for a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict. Australia remains strongly committed to that objective.

               by leave—I just want to respond to Senator Coonan’s remarks. I find it disappointing that the opposition is not willing to support a motion that looks clearly at the deaths of 437 Palestinian children during the last few weeks. I think that it is outrageous that the coalition cannot simply see that we are talking about the killing of innocent children and that Australia has a role to play in supporting extra funding to medical support.
