         I thank Senator Trood for the question. There is an important issue for Greek passport holders that becomes vitally important at the end of this month. On 1 January this year, the Greek government commenced issuing a new-series passport. It is designed to ensure compliance with European Union regulations and includes a biometric facial image. From 1 January 2007, all old passports—that is, all passports produced before 1 January this year—will no longer be valid. They will become invalid regardless of the invalidity date shown on the passport.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is of particular interest to Australians because we have so many people who have both passports. We have a very high Greek population in Australia and especially in the state of Victoria. From 1 January, people travelling on an old Greek passport must have a new passport to enter Australia.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greek" rel="nofollow">
          The Greek
         </a>
         embassy has assured my department that the changes have been very well publicised. Following that, I issued a media statement at the weekend, at large and to all the Greek media outlets, encouraging those in Australia affected by the change to contact the Greek embassy or consulate to confirm the arrangements.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to reinforce that, as far as practicable, the efforts of the Greek government have been significant. But, given the size of the Greek community in Australia, we do not want to have tears at the airport, either from people seeking to enter Australia finding they do not have a valid passport or from people seeking to leave. Electronic travel authorities granted in old Greek passports will cease to be valid for travel from 1 January 2007 because an
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETA" rel="nofollow">
          ETA
         </a>
         is valid for the life of the ETA or the passport, whichever ends first. This could affect over 5,000 people with ETAs in old Greek passports that will cease to be valid for travel from 1 January.
        </p>
        <p>
         People with other valid Australian visas in the old Greek passports, and who are overseas on 1 January 2007, may have difficulty travelling to Australia. People in Australia on temporary visas in the old Greek passports will be impacted. Their ability to return will depend on their capacity to secure another passport quickly or on the position of individual airlines.
        </p>
        <p>
         A lot is being done, as I said. I have issued a statement. The department is making systems enhancements to identify Greek passport holders applying for a visa both onshore and offshore to advise them directly of the need to secure a new passport if they intend travelling to or remaining in Australia after 1 January. The client contact centres are being briefed, the migrant resource centres have been alerted and, of course, the Greek organisations have been alerted. I urge all senators and members to discuss the issue within the Greek communities in their electorates. People wanting a new passport in Australia should contact the Greek embassy or consulate in Australia nearest to them. Australian citizens and permanent residents travelling overseas on Greek passports should contact the Greek national passports centre if they wish to receive a new Greek passport. Those that qualify for an Australian passport can of course contact their nearest Australian embassy or consulate.
