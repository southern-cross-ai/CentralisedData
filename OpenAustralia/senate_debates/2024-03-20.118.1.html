        My question is to the

         Special Minister of State
        </a>
        , Senator Farrell. I refer to Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine and the impact the war is having on the country, its sovereignty, its people and, of course, its democracy, especially after we've just witnessed a shocking so-called election in Russia. Can the minister tell the Senate how the Albanese Labor government is supporting Ukraine to protect its democracy in the face of Russia's illegal invasion?

         I thank Senator Bilyk for her question and her very deep interest in the fate of the brave people of Ukraine. For more than two years, since Russia's illegal and immoral invasion, Australia has continued to strongly support Ukraine's sovereignty and integrity. We stand in solidarity with the Ukrainian community. Recently, along with Senator Birmingham, I was proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with members of the South Australian Ukraine community on the steps of the state parliament.
        </p>
        <p>
         The reality for Ukrainians is that their country is under attack and elections have had to be deferred. But the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Election_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          Central Election Commission
         </a>
         is preparing for the delivery of the first elections after this conflict has ended. Yesterday I was privileged to meet with the chairman of the Central Election Commission, Mr Oleh Didenko, and a member of the Central Election Commission, Mr Sergii Postivyi. The commission has a complex and challenging job in delivering the first election after the war with Russia has ended. The Albanese Labor government is committed to supporting Ukraine in this, a goal that I am confident all members of the Albanese Labor government are completely behind.
        </p>
        <p>
         Sadly, given the comments of some Liberal senators in this place about Ukraine's fight against Russia, it is clear the same unanimous support does not exist in other parties. However, I am proud to have pledged my support for Ukraine in ensuring that they can again hold fair and safe elections in an effort to restore effective democracy to Ukraine and its people.

           Thank you for that answer, Minister. I do hope all of us here echo your support to the commission to see elections being able to be held in Ukraine. Australia's democracy is strong, and the

             AEC
            </a>
            is internationally known for its support of emerging democracies and its close collaboration with partner electorate agencies. This reputation enables the Australian government to include electoral support as a key element of development assistance, including to countries like Fiji,

               I thank Senator Bilyk for her second supplementary question. The Australian electoral system is the envy of the world, but it can and should be strengthened. The Albanese Labor government have been clear that we will legislate reforms in response to the recommendations of the recent Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters inquiry. I'm consulting across the parliament and continue to invite any parliamentarian with an interest in strengthening our democracy to consult with the government on our proposed reforms. Unlike some in this parliament, we intend to progress reforms to strengthen our democracy rather than simply grandstand. It is clear that we must stop billionaires attempting to buy our elections, and I look forward to support across the parliament to achieve this aim.
