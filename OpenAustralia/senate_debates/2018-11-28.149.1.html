          Lady Cilento was an incredible woman, a pioneer in the fields of women's and children's health. She was a household name in Queensland due to her decades of tireless work across a variety of different fields. The decision made by the then Queensland Liberal and Nationals government to honour Lady Cilento by naming the children's hospital after her was the right one. The politically motivated decision by the Queensland Labor government to remove Lady Cilento's name from this hospital is shameful, and their decision to use a rigged, gerrymandered survey to justify this name change is embarrassing. Nearly 18,000 votes, or half the votes in the entire survey, came from the same 74

          addresses, including some of the same IP addresses as used in Queensland ministerial offices. A total of 6,000 votes from just four computers is alleged. The Queensland state government should be condemned for their sneaky tactics, their attempt to dishonour an incredible woman and their misuse of taxpayer funds. I urge senators to support this motion.

             This is another attempt by the government to hide from their own record on health funding. The coalition government is cutting $6.9 million from the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Children's_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
              Queensland Children's Hospital
             </a>
             between 2017 and 2020 alone. This is part of a massive $160 million cut to Queensland hospitals over the same period. The
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
              LNP
             </a>
             in opposition in Queensland has drummed up a fake scandal about the children's hospital name, because they have no health policies of their own. They are too weak to call out their mates here in Canberra over their hospital funding cuts. The Queensland government changed the name of the hospital to Queensland Children's Hospital following requests from doctors and staff at the hospital and taking into account a range of considerations. The medical staff association had been campaigning to change the name of the hospital ever since the Newman government named the facility, in late 2013, without any public consultation whatsoever. A petition with almost 1,000 staff signatures calling for the facility's name to change was given to the Queensland health minister recently.

                I wish to express my strong support for this motion. Lady Cilento was a truly great Australian and a pioneer in women's and children's health. Perhaps more than anyone else, she richly deserves to have a children's hospital named after her. Queensland Labor's efforts to erase the name of this wonderful Queensland lady from the hospital, especially by using fake surveys and deregistering the name in advance of any purported consultation process, is an absolute scandal. Labor are only too keen to rush to name public assets in honour of has-been Labor Party hacks, like the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clem_Jones_Tunnel" rel="nofollow">
                 Clem Jones Tunnel
                </a>
                , but take exception to having the name of a real achiever and a great contributor to the lives of so many Queenslanders. The real reason Labor wants to erase the name of Lady Cilento from the children's hospital is precisely because she wasn't one of their hard-left cronies. Lady Cilento was a high-achieving woman who held traditional Christian values. For comrade Palaszczuk and her socialist sisterhood—
