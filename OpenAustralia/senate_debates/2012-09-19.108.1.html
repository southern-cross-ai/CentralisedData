        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, Senator Evans. I refer the minister to the resignation of the Secretary for Defence, former
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_General" rel="nofollow">
         Major General

        Duncan Lewis, a very respected and esteemed defence secretary. Does not his premature resignation after only 12 months of a five-year term represent a vote of no confidence in the Gillard government's defence policy, including its $25 billion worth of Defence cuts?

         I know Senator Johnston has been away in Perth the last couple of days attending the funerals of two of the soldiers killed in Afghanistan. I am sure it has been a trying time for him and I know a difficult time for all involved. But I think it is important to note that while Mr Lewis is a highly regardedâ€”

           Mr Lewis, in his current role; he has also been a very senior officer in defence. The fact is he has accepted an ambassadorial position with the government and is succeeding Dr Nelson, the former Liberal leader, in the role of representing us at the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU" rel="nofollow">
            EU
           </a>
           ,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO" rel="nofollow">
            NATO
           </a>
           and Belgium. It is a very important appointment. It is one that he took up at the request, as I understand it, of the Prime Minister. The senator is right to indicate his long and proud record of working for governments of both persuasions, as
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Adviser" rel="nofollow">
            National Security Adviser
           </a>
           and his senior roles with the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Army
           </a>
           . To characterise Mr Lewis's move to that ambassadorial role in the way that the senator did is quite incorrect. A number of changes have been made to both diplomatic appointments and appointments to senior positions as secretaries to the departments of foreign affairs and defence. The government think this will better effect the capacity to deliver on its objectives. Mr Lewis is very well regarded by the government and we think he will do an excellent job in his new role.

            , I ask a supplementary question. I draw the minister's attention to the fact that this year the share of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
             GDP
            </a>
            for defence spending will fall to 1.56 per cent, the lowest figure in 74 years. Next year, defence spending will fall to 1.49 per cent, the lowest share since 1937. Just why is the government engaging in such budgetary vandalism with defence funding and as a consequence compromising our national security?

             As the senator is aware, any budget decisions taken in relation to defence have been made with the clear policy intent that there will be no impact on operational activity or front-line defence operationsâ€”no impact at all. As part of the government's budget priorities, the fact is that we have asked Defence to take some responsibility for that, as we have with many other departments. It is the fact that defence continues to have an allocation that is at record levelsâ€”I think, more than $100 billion across the forward estimates. That remains a very, very serious commitment to the defence of this nation and the capacity of our defence forces to continue to provide first-class defence for Australia.

              , I ask a further supplementary question. With the alarm bells ringing right across defence, will the government stop trashing the defence budget just to fill its $120 billion budget black hole? A simple yes or no will suffice.

               I absolutely reject the assertion in the supplementary question that the defence budget has been trashed; it has not. We have budgeted for over $100 billion for defence across the forward estimates. It is the case that compared to like countries such as the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
                US

               </a>
               , France, Canada, Italy, Germany and Japan, Australia continues to rank second on a military expenditure per capita basis, with only the United States spending more. We have a very significant investment in defence. We expect that the investment we are making will still see Australia listed as No. 13 in world defence expenditure and continue to be highly ranked in terms of per capita expenditure. It is just not right to make the assertions that the senator does in asking his question.
