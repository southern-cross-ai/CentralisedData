         I thank the senator for her question. The Labor budget support jobs and growth. This Labor budget invests in the future at a time of economic insecurity around the world. This is what Labor budgets doâ€”invest in the future, protect jobs, support industries, promote growth and provide services. Under Labor, 950,000 jobs have been created, with more Australians in work than ever before.

         Those opposite need to acknowledge that they were a high-taxing government, in fact almost the highest-taxing government in the history of this country. It is estimated that the tax to

           was a six-week blip. No government gets to choose the global economic circumstances in which the budget is framed. But you do get to choose the priorities. Labor chooses a stronger, smarter and fairer Australia. While our economy remains resilient, powerful global forces and the stubbornly high Australian dollar have savaged budget revenues. When Labor are faced with a choice between cutting to the bone and putting jobs first, we proudly stand here and say, 'We are putting jobs first.'

             Creating prosperity and spreading opportunity are the values which drive this Labor government every single day. These are the values the Australian people expect from their government. Labor has a proud record of making visionary choices which strengthen this great nationâ€”the age pension, Medicare, universal superannuation, paid parental leave, pricing carbon. With this year's budget, Labor builds upon that proud Labor tradition. That is why we are increasing school resourcing through the National Plan for School Improvement, that is why we are investing in the

             and that is why we are establishing DisabilityCareâ€”the national disability insurance scheme. These are the choices which government has to make to keep our economy strong.

              My question is to Senator Wong, the Minister representing the Treasurer. Given the current legislated debt ceiling of $300 billion and the projected increases in government debt over the forward estimates, can the minister advise the Senate exactly how much gross debt will be at the end of each financial year across the forward estimates?

               I am asked about debt. It is important to recognise a couple of things. The first is that all the debt figures are published, in the usual way, in the budget papers. The second point I would make is that, despite the fear campaign from Senator Joyceâ€”although I notice that
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Hockey" rel="nofollow">
                Mr Hockey
               </a>
               is now trying to tone his rhetoric down a littleâ€”Australia's debt remains very low by international standards. Our net debt peaks at 11.4 per cent of
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
                GDP
               </a>
               , which is about one-eighth of the average of the advanced economies. In other words, the debt of the major advanced economies is on average eight times greater than Australia's. So I think it is an important economic fact to get into the discussion, because there is a lot of economic fiction, particularly from Senator Joyce, that gets put into the debate.

                , I have a point of order on relevance. The question is quite clear. It asked what the gross debt will be at the end of each financial year. However, what we seem to be getting is percentages and analogies. Now the minister might not know the answer. That is all right. Just tell herâ€”

                           , I ask a further supplementary question. The finance minister of the Commonwealth seems embarrassed to mention our own debt, so I refer the minister to the fact that the budget papers show that the market value of Australian government debt will peak at $370.3 billion. When does the government plan to increase the debt limit above $300 billion? Maybe she could be succinct in answering that, unless she is scared of that answer as well.

                            Was that supposed to be a 'gotcha' question? You know the answer and then you read the budget paper back to me as a supplementary. So that we are clear about the political strategy: you read the budget paper at me, after asking me what is in the budget paper. Is this a serious discussion of the federal budget from the coalition? Is this a serious discussion, the day after the federal budget, from the coalition? The best they can do is try and get 'gotcha'â€”

                              , on the point of order: Senator Joyce was completely disingenuous about the question he asked. He had a rambling commentary before, during and after the actual substance that he has just mentioned. So it is completely disingenuous, when he goes on a rambling commentary, to try and claim that the answer is not directly relevant.
