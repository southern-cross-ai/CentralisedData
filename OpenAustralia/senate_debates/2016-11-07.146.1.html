        Since 2013, the Coalition has sought repeatedly to honour the commitment it made to the Australian people to legislate to improve the governance and accountability of registered organisations -- unions and employer organisations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Sadly, this legislation was blocked by the previous Parliament time and time again, and consequently was one of the reasons for July's double-dissolution election.

        We fought the double-dissolution election on our industrial relations commitments – and won. Following our re-election we are therefore again seeking to honour our commitment to the Australian people by re-introducing the Fair

        The case for reform is clear and compelling. Is there anyone who honestly believes the current governance provisions are doing the job? This Parliament cannot ignore the reams of financial impropriety and gross breach of trust demonstrated by office holders of the

       <p class="italic">
        Some registered organisations have expressed concern that the new penalties will discourage people from taking on official responsibilities. If that is the case, it is a sad reflection on those organisations but, quite frankly, I do not believe it.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is very simple: no wrongdoing, no penalty. The only people who have anything to fear are those who do the wrong thing.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Those officers who operate within the law – and I believe this is the majority of officers – have nothing to fear. Rather, they should be comforted in knowing that unlawful behaviour will be dealt with, thus ensuring ongoing members' confidence in registered organisations as a whole.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The government acknowledges that registered organisations play an important role in the affairs of workplace relations in this nation and the broader economy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Registered organisations are given special privileges under the Fair Work scheme. Additionally, just like charities and our cultural and sporting associations they are income tax exempt. With these privileges come countervailing responsibilities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Every year, hundreds of thousands of Australian workers pay hard-earned wages as union dues; similarly, Australian businesses – both small and large – pay membership fees to employer organisations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Workers and businesses invest a great deal of trust in the organisations that represent their interests. They are entitled to expect that these registered organisations operate to the highest standards. This Bill ensures that they will do so.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Conclusion
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The government has an unambiguous mandate from the Australian people to ensure that registered organisations act in a transparent and accountable manner.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is clear that the corrupt and illegal conduct of many union officials will continue unless there is immediate and effective parliamentary intervention, meaningful reform and strong leadership.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is our hope that this new Parliament will understand the urgent need to act and honour the judgment of the Australian people. We have made it very clear that we stand for a clean, honest and strong union movement. Our commitment to reform is absolutely unwavering.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I call on all other Senators to support honest union members and honest union officials by supporting this Bill.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I commend this Bill to the Senate.
