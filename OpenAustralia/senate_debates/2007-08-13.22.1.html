        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, Senator Ellison. Will the minister update senators on the latest
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">

         I thank Senator Adams for a very important question and one which is a very positive story indeed. Not only is it very important to resource our defence forces appropriately and at record levels, which we have done, but also to see recruitment increase. We have seen that in the last financial year. We have seen just under 9,000 people recruited into the Australian defence forces last financial year, an increase of 1,125 people. It is one of the best achievements in the last 30 years in relation to defence recruitment. Of the new full-time members recruited, we have an overall increase of 664 full-time entrants over the previous year and that is a very positive story indeed. Not only that, we have devoted extra funding in relation to recruitment initiatives: $789 million to defence apprenticeship schemes, to better managing of applicants, to establishing career and transition advice. That all goes towards increasing that recruitment that we need to grow the ADF to 57,000 personnel by 2016.
        </p>
        <p>
         Importantly, last Thursday we opened for business the ADF gap year. In December last year we announced this initiative, which is an important one, for around about 34,000 young Australians who have a gap year. We are offering people who have completed year 12 or a year 12 equivalent a period of up to 12 months in the Australian defence forces.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is a unique opportunity to provide young people aged between 17 and 24 with the opportunity to engage in the ADF and see if that is an appropriate career for them. Of course, if they choose to continue, we have a $10,000 initiative which is paid to them should they decide to stay on. This ADF gap year is all about full participation. Whilst it would not normally be expected that they engage in any deployment on operations, and that is due to the time factor for training and other factors in that first 12 months, these participants will have full access to the range of ADF training and activities, and also access to ADF benefits such as free medical services, subsidised accommodation, meals and employment allowances. In all respects, this will give them a taste of what life is like in the ADF, and give them an opportunity to take that up as a career for the future.
        </p>
        <p>
         In November this year, for the first intakes, the Army will accept 500 participants into the program and 100 each in Navy and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Air Force
         </a>
         . That will grow to 1,000 positions each year and offers those people the unique experiences that I mentioned. This is an outstanding initiative to improve recruitment into Australiaâ€™s defence forces, a great initiative for young people, and something which will bear fruit for the future.
