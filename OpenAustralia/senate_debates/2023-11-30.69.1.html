        Today I rise to speak to the chamber about Lily Harrison, a parliamentary intern who has been working in my office through the Australian National Internships Program. Throughout her time with us, Lily has been preparing a report on birthing on country models as a mechanism for improving maternity care for

        </a>
        . Her report, which I'm very proudly holding here today, found that over two-thirds of women from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait" rel="nofollow">

        and the cape are relocated from their lands and communities to give birth. This dislocation is a contributing factor to rates of premature births and low-birth-rate babies that are high compared to the state average. Lily consulted with community controlled health services like Gurriny in Yarrabah and Wuchopperen Health Service in my home town, Cairns. They were open about the systemic barriers that result in poor maternal outcomes. Lily's report found that where birthing on country programs already exist maternal outcomes are materially improving, including a 50 per cent reduction in preterm births.

        I am really proud of the work that has already been done by our government in this area. The federal government has invested $22.5 million towards the construction of a dedicated birthing on country centre of excellence. In my home state of Queensland the state government has invested to train more rural

        s in obstetrics and increased funding to First Nations midwifery models. Most importantly, we're working together across all levels of government. Recently, I met with the Queensland minister for health, Shannon Fentiman, and Torres Strait community leaders about improving maternal health through culturally appropriate consultation. I look forward to continuing these discussions.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to thank Lily for her work and congratulate her on her high distinction.
