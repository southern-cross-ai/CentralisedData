        My question is to the Minister for Defence, Senator Reynolds. Can the Minister update the Senate on what practical support Defence has been providing to states and territories to minimise the spread of COVID-19 and drive our health recovery?

         I thank Senator Paterson for the question and for his tremendous support for our troops in Victoria at this time. I am so proud of the efforts of the Defence department and our ADF—and their family's support—during the COVID-19 pandemic. The ADF very quickly adapted and developed new business-as-usual processes and practices during COVID-19. We did that to ensure Defence keeps our people in Australia, and over 2,000 personnel deployed overseas, safe—safe when on training exercises, when on exercises on operational deployments and also when on routine postings. We did that to make sure that we adapted very early and that we now maintain the best possible health protocols.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since February, under Operation COVID-19 Assist, Defence has been providing a wide range of support to all states and territories with their COVID-19 response. Defence has demonstrated great capability and great agility in that support. Support has been provided in many forms—in traditional tasks, such as planning, logistics and also in health support, but a number of new tasks, such as contact tracing and also training to drive ambulances.
        </p>
        <p>
         Today over 3,400 ADF members are supporting all states and territories with their COVID responses. Throughout the pandemic Defence has been postured to respond to requests for support from all states and territories.
        </p>
        <p>
         Following the Prime Minister's offer to all first ministers on 27 March for assistance from the ADF for mandatory hotel quarantine, the ADF prepared 100 personnel in each large state and 50 in smaller states. The following day in New South Wales ADF personnel began supporting the reception of international arrivals. I say to all colleagues here: we have much to be proud of in how our ADF has responded to Operation Bushfire Assist and Operation COVID-19 Assist—

            (—) (): Yes, I can. Our ADF personnel have been assisting Victorian authorities since 23 March this year with its COVID-19 response. Since then we have supported 11 separate Victorian requests for assistance. Today, 1,700 defence personnel are deployed to Victoria to support its latest efforts to get this next wave under control. For example, 338 ADF personnel are supporting contact tracing through data management, admin and logistic support and also doorknocking close contacts unable to be contacted by phone; 250 ADF personnel are supporting COVID-19 testing right across the state of Victoria; 150 ADF personnel are supporting seven

               n government authorities since 22 March this year. Since then we have supported 10 separate WA requests for assistance. Today 112 ADF personnel are on the ground in Western Australia. At its peak, on 22 April, the ADF had 326 personnel assisting

                Western Australian

               authorities with their COVID-19 response. This builds on the support the ADF had provided earlier in March to assist with the cruise ship disembarkation, and that assistance provided included assistance with quarantine compliance checks and a range of logistics support, including cargo transportation.
              </p>
              <p>
               On 3 August this year we agreed to provide 50 ADF personnel to support WA authorities with hotel quarantine at five hotels. We are working with them on a new request.
