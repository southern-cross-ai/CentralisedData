        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Abetz. I refer to the government's decision to freeze the superannuation guarantee for millions of workers and to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMP" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        chief executive, Mr Craig Meller, who says the guarantee should be increased to 12 per cent because, 'Saving just 9½ per cent of your earnings is not enough.' Is Mr Mellor right?

         In these matters you cannot just look at one situation in isolation. As we have seen from the tax review by the

          Australian Labor Party

           , Senator Doug Cameron, as is his want, interjects nonstop to completely trash the reputation of Labor's former head of Treasury, Dr Ken Henry. Why they do it, I do not know, but that is what Senator Doug Cameron is doing. It stands to reason that the more one puts into superannuation the more one would have later on in life. That is logical. The question is: is it affordable today, given all the economic imperatives and problems we face for that to occur? Those opposite would be aware that—

             We do support thrift. That is why we have been seeking to stop the debt burden inflicted on the Australian people by those opposite. One thousand million dollars per month is being borrowed from overseas to pay the interest on the debts incurred by the

              , I ask a supplementary question. On the question of wages, I refer to the Prime Minister's advice that for workers, 'By delaying the increase in the superannuation guarantee levy, we are keeping more money in workers' pockets.' How will hundreds of thousands of workers covered by enterprise agreements negotiated before the government froze the superannuation guarantee get more money in their pockets?

               What we have regrettably been seeing around this country is too many Australian workers losing their employment and it might not be dawning on some of the former trade union officials sitting opposite but it is dawning on some practising trade union officials that sometimes it is worthwhile to say no pay increase to protect jobs.

                    , I ask a further supplementary question. Will the government enable workers, whose enterprise agreements were negotiated between 7 September 2013 and 2 September 2014, to renegotiate wage increases in order to compensate for the adverse freeze on superannuation contributions?

                     I do not think anybody would want the government to start intervening in enterprise agreements negotiated between workers and employees, sanctioned by the Fair Work Commission. If Senator Bullock wants the government to start setting the wages in this country, let him say so, let him say that that is the new Labor Party policy. But I doubt it very much.
