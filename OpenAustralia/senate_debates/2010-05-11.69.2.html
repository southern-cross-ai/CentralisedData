         Recommendation 3:
        </b>
        The committee recommends that the Government exempts the Remote Locality Leave Travel entitlement from fringe benefits reporting.

         The Government
        </a>
        does not agree with this proposal.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The fringe benefits tax (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBT" rel="nofollow">
         FBT
        </a>
        ) system plays an important role in maintaining the fairness and integrity of Australia’s taxation system. It places employees with access to fringe benefits on a more even footing with employees whose remuneration consists entirely of salary or wages.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The introduction of FBT was designed to remove a serious gap in the income tax law and ensure that all forms of remuneration paid to employees bear a fair measure of tax. The FBT system also facilitates the inclusion of fringe benefits in an employee’s income for the purposes of means testing benefits such as family tax benefit. This ensures that families with remuneration consisting entirely of salary are treated equally, when compared to those in receipt of fringe benefits.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        FBT applies to virtually all employers, including Government, and is designed to be as inclusive as possible in the coverage of benefits received by employees in respect of employment are taxed, whether received in cash or otherwise.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Providing a FBT reporting exemption for the remote locality leave travel entitlement to members of the ADF would be inequitable to other employees working in remote locations who receive similar benefits (for example, employees working in the mining industry) and have them recorded on their payment summary. This exclusion would also have a broad range of implication across the transfer system.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Many of the existing FBT exemptions are work-related, that is, there is a general underlying principle that concessions or exemptions are provided on the basis that if these expenses were borne by the employee, it would be deductible to them. The Remote Locality Leave Travel Entitlement would not be deductible under the income tax law as there would not be the relevant nexus between the expense incurred and their employment. The expense, had the employee borne it themselves, would be considered private in nature.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government notes that in some circumstances it may be necessary to allow Australia to commit personnel prior to the full articulation of these mission aspects where our strong national interests are engaged. Flexibility is also required to enable ongoing review of a mission’s mandate and goals in response to developments over time, as has occurred with the UN and

         Recommendation 3
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that before the Australian Government decides to contribute to a non-UN mandated peacekeeping operation, it is satisfied that the mission has a proper legal framework with recognised authority to deploy the operation and is consistent with Australian law. In this regard the committee recommends that:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         as early as practicable, the UN is consulted and fully informed about developments and any proposals for a peacekeeping operation;
        </li>
        <li>
         the Australian Government places the highest priority on securing regional support for the peacekeeping operation;
        </li>
        <li>
         the host country, through its legally recognised authorities, has requested the establishment of a peacekeeping operation and willingly consented to the deployment of forces and the conditions under which they are to operate - the agreement to be documented in appropriate legal instruments and provided to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Council" rel="nofollow">
          Security Council
         </a>
         ; and
        </li>
        <li>
         the legal documents authorising the deployment of a peacekeeping operation to be treated, if not in the form of a treaty, in a way similar to treaties; that is, tabled in Parliament with an accompanying National Interest Analysis and examined by a parliamentary committee.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Furthermore, that the operation’s mandate:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         is in complete accord with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Charter" rel="nofollow">
          UN Charter
         </a>
         and is accountable to universally accepted human rights standards and Australian law;
        </li>
        <li>
         contains arrangements to ensure that the Security Council and the peacekeeping operation complement each other’s efforts to keep the peace; and
        </li>
        <li>
         includes provisions making the mission accountable to the UN and covers issues such as reporting procedures and channels for the exchange of information.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Finally, through both formal and informal channels, the government endeavours to obtain UN endorsement of the operation even though the operation may have commenced.

       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Partially agreed
        </b>
        . The Government will continue to ensure that, before contributing to non-UN mandated peacekeeping operations, the operations’ mandate is in accord with the UN Charter (including any relevant Security Council resolutions), applicable human rights standards and Australian law. The Government must satisfy itself that the conditions under which forces are to operate are documented in appropriate instruments. While in some circumstances a treaty- level instrument may be required, in other circumstances lower level instruments may be sufficient. Consistent with long-established Government policy, such lower level instruments are not tabled in Parliament.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government would only contribute to a non-UN mandated peacekeeping operation if satisfied that the host country, through its legally recognised authorities, requested the establishment of a peacekeeping operation and willingly consented to the deployment of forces.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government notes that in certain circumstances where a host country seeks a peace-keeping operation due to a humanitarian emergency (e.g., East Timor in 2006 and 2008 and Tonga in 2006), an instrument of less-than treaty status may be the only mechanism allowing relevant countries to consent to that operation in a timely manner. Such an instrument would be confidential to the participants and therefore the Government would not be in a position to table the instrument in Parliament for examination by a parliamentary committee. The Government considers it necessary only to table in Parliament those instruments that create binding international legal obligations on Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Government further notes that Chapter
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VIII" rel="nofollow">
         VIII
        </a>

         UNSC
        </a>
        , the Government would use its best endeavours to seek the agreement of the other participants before providing copies of the relevant instrument to the Security Council. Likewise, if the UN requests the Government provide further information or report periodically on the progress of Australian contributions to a regional peace-keeping operation, the Australian Government would seek to cooperate fully with the UN.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Beyond the specific case of the ATST-EM, the ADF has an ongoing ‘lessons learned’ process which integrates lessons through small evaluation teams focussed on designated objectives. These teams capture data and information, during the actual conduct of each operation as well as reporting from commanders, senior staff and participants. The information is recorded in the ADF Activities Analysis Database System.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition to the ‘lessons learned’ process, HQJOC has implemented an Operational Capability Review (

        </a>
        ) process to review the tasks and composition of all deployed elements. The OCR process will enable information and issues from theatre to be captured and conveyed to HQJOC directly, allowing timely action such as force design and training adjustments for follow-on rotations, and the application of lessons to other relevant situations. The OCR process is being rolled out progressively with priority to larger and more complex contingents, but will in time be applied to every ongoing ADF deployment.

Additionally, there are agreed higher levels of care available regionally where ADF personnel can be evacuated for treatment if required.

       <p class="italic">
        The Government notes that the legal basis for use of force contained in the authorising UN mandate for a particular peacekeeping operation cannot be unilaterally amended by the Government to ensure that it is ‘appropriate to the mission and provide[s] adequate protection.’ Instead, the mission’s rules of engagement (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROE" rel="nofollow">
         ROE
        </a>
        ) must be appropriately defined and suitably tailored to complement the legal basis for use of force. If the legal basis for the mission is deemed to be inadequate, then the Government may either decline to contribute to the peacekeeping operation or seek changes to the mandate that would satisfy its concerns.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government further notes that while deployed, all ADF commanders and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">

        personnel have an obligation to continually review the authorised ROE or

        , and to seek clarification or request any necessary changes if they are considered to be unclear or inadequate to cover the security situation. The Government understands the importance of having an appropriate and unambiguous use of force regime that is fully understood by all personnel involved, whether the mission is a UN or non-UN peacekeeping operation.

         Recommendation 6
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that all government agencies advising the Australian Government on Australia’s participation in a proposed peacekeeping operation address clearly the adequacy of force protection provided in the mandate and accompanying ROE. This consideration is not only from the perspective of the physical safety of Australian personnel but also their mental wellbeing. Ultimately, the government must be satisfied that the mandate matches the needs on the ground.

        . A primary consideration when advising Government on a decision to commit personnel to a peacekeeping operation is the adequacy of available force protection measures for the overall wellbeing of Australian personnel.

        The Government is committed to ensuring that high quality mental health support is available for

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Package" rel="nofollow">
         The Package
        </a>
        includes nine strategic mental health initiatives targeted across the four stages of an ADF member’s lifecycle: recruitment, service, transition, and resettlement into civilian life. As part of these initiatives, the Australian Centre for Posttraumatic Mental Health (ACPMH) is undertaking research and learning processes to enhance current practices. Defence and the Department of Veterans’ Affairs are working closely with the ACPMH on the lifecycle initiative.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition, Defence has commissioned the Centre for Military and Veterans’ Health to conduct the Deployment Health Surveillance Program, a series of longitudinal health studies of deployed personnel, including mental health issues.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government notes that, in the case of a UN-mandated peacekeeping operation, force protection policy and military ROE applicable to Australian personnel are ultimately derived from the UN mandate, which as previously noted cannot be unilaterally amended.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Prior to approving Australian participation in a peacekeeping mission, the Government receives advice on the sufficiency of ROE and force protection measures in view of the needs on the ground. This process applies to all ADF operations including those not led by the UN, and non- peacekeeping operations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As noted in the response to Recommendation 5, all ADF commanders deployed on peacekeeping operations have an obligation to continually review the authorised ROE, and to seek clarification or request any necessary changes if they are considered to be unclear or inadequate to cover the military situation.

         Recommendation 7

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that, when considering a proposed peacekeeping operation, the Australian Government examine in detail the mission’s exit strategy to ensure that Australia’s contribution is part of a well-planned and structured approach to achieving clearly stated objectives. When committing forces to an operation the Australian Government should clearly articulate its exit strategy.

        . The Government recognises the importance of exit strategies. However, as noted in response to Recommendation 1, a degree of flexibility is required, as there may be circumstances where it is not appropriate to articulate an exit strategy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government conducts a classified annual review of the ADF’s commitments to peacekeeping operations. This review critically examines each mission and considers the continuance, or otherwise, of the ADF’s contribution.

       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that the ADF place a high priority on its undertaking to give training for peacekeeping operations a ‘more prominent place’ in its training regime. This training should extend to reservists as well as regular members of the ADF.

        . Training for peacekeeping operations has been identified as a fundamental element to the continuum of training in the ADF, especially within the Army.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_Command" rel="nofollow">
         Land Command
        </a>
        provides collective training for regular and reservist personnel aimed at meeting operational requirements, and peacekeeping is included as part of this requirement for operational training. In addition, the ADF Peace Operations Training Centre (formerly the ADF Warfare Centre (ADFWC)) includes peacekeeping operations modules on most of its joint courses and incorporates peacekeeping and stabilisation operations in joint exercises, such as the Talisman Sabre series with the United States. Peacekeeping operations are covered in a dedicated civil- military cooperation course, and also in a variety of other courses conducted by the ADFWC through presentations, syndicate tutorials and discussion periods.

       <p class="italic">
        The ADF Peacekeeping Centre also provides the ADF UN Military Observers’ Course, which prepares selected military personnel from Australia and overseas for service as military observers in UN or multinational peacekeeping operations. The course is focused on meeting the standards stipulated by UN DPKO’s Integrated Training System. Since 2008, components of the course have been merged into a course conducted by the AFP’s International Deployment Group.
