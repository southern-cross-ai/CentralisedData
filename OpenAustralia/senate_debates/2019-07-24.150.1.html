         The answer is: yes. But, of course, the question is: will the Labor Party rule out their $30 billion in higher taxes on Australian's retirement savings?

         <p>
          I've already answered the question. But, of course, this is a contest—this is a battle of ideas. We stand for lower taxes. We stand, of course, for sustainable funding of all of the essential services Australians rely on, which also includes our appropriately well-targeted but generous welfare safety net. We are putting that on a sustainable fiscal foundation and trajectory for the future through our plan to build a stronger economy.
         </p>
         <p>
          But what is the Labor Party doing? The Labor Party went to the last election promising $387 billion in higher taxes. There was the retiree tax, the $30 billion in higher taxes on super and the higher taxes on housing, investment and income—you name it!
         </p>
         <p>
          Under this government, the Australian people can be confident that the pension is safe. Under the Labor Party, it wouldn't be, because under the Labor Party the economy would be weaker, the budget would be weaker and, of course, funding for the essential services would be on a weaker trajectory for the future, which is why, no doubt, the Australian people chose to re-elect us to form government at the last election.

               was such an amazing Treasurer and such an amazing Labor member for the great state of Queensland that Labor's primary vote in Senator Watt's home state of Queensland is down to 22.6 per cent—22.6 per cent! That is because the Australian people understand that under Labor and their higher taxes, class warfare and antibusiness agenda the country would be weaker and they would have fewer opportunities to get ahead. We will continue to build a stronger economy and better opportunities for people to get ahead.

                    This is her first question. I would ask that the usual courtesies, in addition to the standing orders, be observed. I would request that the senator be allowed to recommence her second supplementary.

                     just rule on the point of order? I ask all senators—there have been a number of incidents about questions and first speeches—just to remember the usual courtesies when a senator is on their feet for the first time in this chamber for either their first question or a first speech. I think that courtesy is important, without pointing fingers in any direction.

                        has reported that Mr Kelly has spoken out in defiance of the Prime Minister's call to toe the party line. Will the Prime Minister exclude any consideration of the change Mr Kelly proposed to the pension assets test from his government's retirement incomes review?

                             Let me be very clear: the question is based on a completely false premise, which has been rejected, and I've been very explicit: there will be absolutely no change to include the value of the family home in the pension asset test. It's not our policy and never will be. The Treasurer has made that extremely clear on behalf of the government—and you knew it.
