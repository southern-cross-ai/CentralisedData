          CFMEU

         is currently running a series of completely dishonest television commercials that are, quite frankly, based around a work of fiction. Perhaps you would have seen it,

          Mr President

         . It makes a number of false claims about those people who may be questioned by the

          Can I

         be very clear in relation to the television ads being run by the CFMEU? The powers that the CFMEU are now publicly complaining about in a series of television ads are the same powers that those on the other side—Labor, the people who do their bidding in the parliament—gave the Fair Work Building and Construction inspectorate. They are the same powers. Did the CFMEU run a series of television ads when those on the other side gave the Fair Work Building and Construction inspectorate these powers?

            Order! On my right. Senator Moore, I have been listening very carefully, and you may recall that regarding an earlier question I did remind the minister that she had to be careful in relation to this territory. Whilst I am not completely familiar with every detail of the bill, I do believe the minister has not gone to the pertinent detail of the bill. But I am listening carefully and I think the minister has taken heed of the earlier advice.

             Again, it is a little ironic that in an election year the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
              CFMEU
             </a>
             are currently running a series of ads that are based on a false premise. But, worse than that, they did not run that series of ads when the former government gave the same powers to the Fair Work Building and Construction inspectorate. If that does not speak of a political stunt then I do not know what does. The CFMEU also forget that these powers that existed for years in other industries and with other regulators are the same types of powers that ASIC, APRA and the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
              ACCC
             </a>
             had. So, again, they never complained about those agencies having those powers and they never complained when former Prime Minister Gillard gave her regulator those powers.

               As I said, even former Prime Minister Gillard and those on the other side recognised the need for compulsory powers within the building and construction industry, because they gave those same compulsory powers to the current inspectorate—the Fair Work Building Industry Inspectorate. As we have heard so often, and in particular during estimates hearings, the reason these powers are so necessary within the building and construction industry is that there is a culture of silence. And why is there a culture of silence? Because in this particular industry—

                    Colleagues, did anybody see Senator Cameron stand up when they introduced the same powers for the Fair Work Building and Construction Inspectorate? Did the

                    not give you instructions, Senator Cameron, to come in here and a jump up and down and say, 'I don't like these powers—they are taking away people's rights'? You did not do that, and that is why we know that this is nothing more and nothing less than yet another political stunt.

                       are very happy with the current state of play in the industry. Why do we know that? Because they have donated more than $7 million to the

                        Australian Labor Party

                       since 2007—$7 million. In fact, $7 million is also the sum of money that the CFMEU have been fined. When you have in excess of 100 of your senior officials facing court or the Fair Work Commission on in excess of 1,000 charges, it is little wonder that those opposite do not want anything done within the sector.
