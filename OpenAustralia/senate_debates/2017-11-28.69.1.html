        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Brandis. I refer to the minister's statement yesterday that a royal commission into the banks will take forever and achieve nothing. Can the minister rule out the Turnbull government's support for a royal commission or a commission of inquiry into the banks?

         I explained yesterday why it is not the government's policy to have a royal commission into the banks. If you'd been listening—as I'm sure you were, Senator Ketter—to the question Senator Georgiou asked me yesterday, he pointed out himself that, since the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GFC" rel="nofollow">
          GFC
         </a>
         , there have actually been 17 separate inquiries into the banking system, parliamentary inquiries and other inquiries, and the government has been very, very active in implementing the recommendations of those inquiries; in particular, giving effect to the recommendations of the Ramsay review, looking at legacy cases of banking misconduct. The point I made to the chamber yesterday and I make again today is that, if we had adopted the Labor Party's view that there should be a royal commission, then it would still be going, because these royal commissions go for years. They report at the end, and aggrieved customers would have years to wait before they got any relief, years to wait before they got any compensation or recompense, as they are getting now as a result of the much more immediate steps that the government has taken. The Ramsay review is only one of the many—

           The point of order is direct relevance. The question asked the minister to rule out the government supporting a royal commission or a commission of inquiry. He hasn't actually answered the latter part of the question.

             Let us accept the position that is common between both sides of the chamber. There have been instances of misconduct by the banks. Some of those instances have been egregious. They should be redressed. So the question is: what is the most effective, immediate and useful form of redress? It's the government's view that, because of the cost and length of a royal commission, a royal commission is not the most useful and immediate form of redress.

                's arrangements are and who he speaks to. Senator O'Sullivan is a very industrious senator and he speaks to many colleagues. But, Senator Ketter, you asked about a commission of inquiry. I've explained to you why—in redressing the problem that the government, like the opposition, acknowledges is a matter of legitimate public concern—a royal commission is not the best mechanism or vehicle to deal with that problem.

                   I can tell you what the policy of the government is. As I've told you at length, the government's policy is not to have a royal commission, because a royal commission is not the most effective, immediate or efficacious way to deal with this problem. The most effective way to deal with this problem is to do what the government has already done—particularly, for example, through Professor Ramsay's review. Now, I acknowledge that there are a variety of views across the chamber in relation to this matter, but I've explained to you why the government has adopted the view that it has.
