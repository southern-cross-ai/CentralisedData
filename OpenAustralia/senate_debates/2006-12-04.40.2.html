            in regard to the promise by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in the 2004 election to protect 18,700 hectares of old-growth forest in the Styx and Florentine valleys, the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Minchin, stated in the Senate on 30 March 2006 that ‘It is absolutely outrageous to suggest that the Prime Minister has not honoured his promise. He is honouring his promises to the people of Tasmania in full. This was a major commitment to the people of Tasmania to achieve both the protection of vital forests and the protection of jobs...’,

             Mercury
            </i>
            on 30 November 2006, that ‘not all the Upper Florentine Valley was protected as pledged during the 2004 election campaign’,

            (iii)
           </dt>
           <dd>
            Senator Minchin’s statement is contradicted by the Government’s own literature about the outcome of the election promises, ‘The Tasmanian Community Forest Agreement: Fact sheet no. 3’ (May 2005), which admits the failure to meet the Prime Minister’s election promise because the protected areas in the Styx and Florentine contain ‘4,730 hectares of old-growth eucalypt against a target of 18,700 hectares’, and

         Reasons for Urgency
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The creation of the Australian Military Court is one of the major outcomes of the Senate Inquiry into
        <i>
         The effectiveness of the military justice system
        </i>
        conducted in 2004, which was critical of the military justice system.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In tabling its response to the 2005 Senate report, the government directed a two year implementation period for the agreed recommendations. This implementation period expires at the end of 2007. Passage of the bill in the 2006 Spring sittings is therefore fundamental to allow for the establishment and commencement of the new system within the implementation period.

        <b>
         Purpose of the bill
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill amends the Royal Commissions Act 1902 to enable regulations to facilitate provision of custody and use of, and access to, records of royal commissions, including those of the Inquiry into Certain Australian Companies in relation to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Inquiry" rel="nofollow">
         Cole Inquiry
        </a>
        ).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill will remove any argument that there might be a requirement to provide procedural fairness to persons who could be adversely affected if documents obtained by the Cole Inquiry, or any other royal commission, for its purposes, were to be made available to other persons or agencies and used for other purposes. Providing procedural fairness in respect of use of documents could be very time-consuming, and is arguably unnecessary and unmeritorious, particularly in a law enforcement context. The government therefore considers it prudent to legislate to allow royal commission records to be used for defined purposes without having to provide procedural fairness, and is taking the opportunity to provide a framework which can be used for future royal commissions, without needing additional legislation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill will insert a regulation-making power to enable regulations to be made to give custody or access to records to persons and bodies, which could then use and deal with those records, without any prior need to notify and consult those who might be adversely affected by the release and use of the records. The amendments broadly follow and generalise the model in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIH" rel="nofollow">

         Reasons for Urgency
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill will enable the making of regulations concerning the provision of relevant records of the Cole Inquiry to appropriate authorities, including for law enforcement purposes. Such regulations will assist in expediting consideration of whether proceedings should be commenced in relation to the possible breaches of the law identified by the Cole Inquiry. The government therefore considers that the bill should be passed during the current sitting.
