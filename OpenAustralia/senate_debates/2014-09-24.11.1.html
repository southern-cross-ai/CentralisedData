          Senator Brandis, in your closing remarks you mentioned quite correctly that this bill originated from the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Joint_Committee_on_Intelligence_and_Security" rel="nofollow">
           Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security
          </a>
          report, of which committee you were a member, and you were a signatory to the recommendations that were put forward. One of the recommendations, I believe recommendation 41, was that the bill should firstly be put into the public domain as an exposure draft, which obviously was not done, but also that the views of the national security legislation monitor should be sought.
         </p>
         <p>
          Australia's oversight of these intrusive and, in some instances, quite coercive powers has effectively three limbs: the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and, I would argue, the national security legislation monitor—not so much concerned with operational oversight as with the policy architecture that governs how these agencies operate. As to the national security legislation monitor, the government sought to abolish that office as part of some kind of red-tape initiative. Later there was an agreement, I understand, to restore the operations of that office. Why does it currently not exist? And why has the government not sought the views of a reinstated national security legislation monitor—as, Senator Brandis, you signed to? It was a recommendation that I thought had merit. Why does that office not exist? When will you instate such an office?
         </p>
         <p>
          Do you believe in its importance? Why was this bill not subjected to having his or her views sought, as you recommended last year?

           The criticism that appears to come from Senator Ludlam is that this bill has not had sufficient scrutiny. That criticism could not be more misconceived. The bill was first introduced by me on 16 July. It has been in the public domain and the subject of much public discussion since that time. It has been back to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Joint_Committee_on_Intelligence_and_Security" rel="nofollow">
            Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security
           </a>
           since then which has reviewed it and, as I said in my second closing speech, it has been the subject of 17 recommendations by that committee, all of which have been accepted by the government.
          </p>
          <p>
           The process and genesis of this bill, as I explained in my second reading speech, is a process that has been in train for more than two years. These recommendations, along with many others which will be the subject of other legislation brought forward by the government, were the subject of the most exhaustive review by the PJCIS during the life of the 43rd Parliament. So it could not be possibly maintained that these provisions, the provisions that command the support of the entirety of the political mainstream in this country, have not had exhaustive deliberation and extensive opportunities for public scrutiny. Indeed, the report of the inquiry on the basis of which these bills have been drafted was tabled by Mr Byrne as long ago as June 2013, so the recommendations have been in the public domain for much longer than a year. So the suggestion that these proposals have not had the benefit of exhaustive public discussion is a piece of arrant nonsense.
          </p>
          <p>
           Senator Ludlam asked about the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor. Might I inform the senator, because he seems to be unaware of the fact, that the proposal for an Independent National Security Legislation Monitor came from the Liberal Party. Specifically, it came from the former member for Kooyong, Mr Petro Georgiou, during the life of the 42nd Parliament. It was proposed in this place by my friend and former colleague Senator Judith Troeth, and was seconded by me. So I do not need to be informed by you, Senator Ludlam, about the wisdom of having an Independent National Security Legislation Monitor.
          </p>
          <p>
           That was opposed by the Labor government at the time, the first Rudd government. However, with the passage of time, that unhappy government saw the wisdom of what Mr Georgiou and former Senator Troeth and I were proposing. They changed their position from one of opposition to one of support and the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor was created with the Liberal Party and the National Party's support.
          </p>
          <p>
           Earlier this year, the government considered whether an efficiency could be made by abolishing that office. But, in view of the fact that we knew that extensive new legislation governing national security was going to be introduced during the course of 2014, we decided not to proceed with that idea. So the office was retained. Senator Ludlam asked when the office will be reinstated. The office exists. Mr Walker, who had been appointed by the previous government to occupy that office, served his term. His term expired and the government is currently considering the replacement of Mr Walker as the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor.
          </p>
          <p>
           Lastly, might I point out to you, Senator Ludlam, that the role of the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor is to oversee the operation of legislation and to advise government on the suitability of that legislation in the light of the manner in which it operates. This legislation, obviously, is legislation yet to be enacted; therefore, the need for the particular contribution of the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor has not arisen. But I can assure Senator Ludlam that when Mr Walker's replacement is named, that man or woman will be a person who will be in a good position to advise future governments on the efficacy of this legislation.

            Senator Brandis, the potted history actually is useful in the context of people who might be discovering this issue for the first time. And you probably will not appreciate being reminded of the last time, I suspect, that you would have supported an amendment that I put into this place. It was to create greater transparency in the operations of the office and to keep it at arms-length from the Prime Minister's office. Support for that amendment I appreciate to this day. So I think it probably is useful to put that historical perspective because we were obviously a part and we were advocating very strenuously for the former government to put this office into the field. But if what you just told us is correct then why did you sign a recommendation last year, recommendation 41, proposing that the monitor review this draft bill?

             I see no need to add to anything I have already said in response. It cannot be maintained that this bill has suffered from an insufficiency of scrutiny at many levels. Senator Ludlam, I wonder whether you might get on with Greens amendment (1), which is in relation to

              Senator Brandis, you have been here longer than I have. You are very well aware that we are able to take time to ask general questions about the operation of the bill. I will move to that amendment when I am ready. Thank you for your advice.
             </p>
             <p>
              I might put a couple of other general questions to you before we do start moving through the amendments. I wonder whether you might care to address a fairly general question about the operation of the SIOs because I think these special intelligence operations are really at the heart of what this bill implements. Would you care to comment on the Law Council's submission to the PJCIS that this bill should not pass in its current form? I think that calling it scepticism is currently underplaying it somewhat. There are those in the legal fraternity, of which you were obviously a part for a very long time, who believe that this bill does overstep the mark, that it is an overreaction, that it is overreach and that we are taking agencies who already operate at arm's length from any form of parliamentary scrutiny and further shrouding their operations behind a veil of secrecy. Obviously, that is a perspective that the Greens share, but I wonder if you would care to reflect on the fact that the Law Council, who you would not exactly phrase as radicals in this area also share that view?

               The Law Council of Australia, with which I am very familiar, and whose current president, Mr Colbran, is a personal friend of mine, encompasses all the lawyers in Australia, of whom there are tens of thousands. As you would expect, among tens of thousands of people one would expect a wide variety of views. There are some among those tens of thousands who disagree with the special intelligence operation. There are many who would agree with it. But the government does not agree with the view expressed by the Law Council.

                In relation to the most recent question and answer about the Law Council of Australia's submission: what does the Attorney-General say about the broad concerns that there are not adequate safeguards? For instance, in terms of the unauthorised disclosure: as I said in my second reading contribution, I acknowledge the need for secrecy. I acknowledge the importance of not disclosing the identity of an officer or associates of an operative because it would put their lives at risk. But for the penalty going from two years to five years for disclosing a special intelligence operation—under the current legislative regime it has been a two-year penalty for disclosure; a five-year penalty is a significant jump. Ten years in terms of putting others at risk, I can understand the rationale for that, but in terms of the general disclosure provisions, I do have a concern about them being without any safeguard of a public interest test or a public interest factor in respect of mitigation.
               </p>
               <p>
                I would be grateful if the Attorney-General could either address it now in this general area of questioning or when the particular provisions are being considered. For instance, the Law Council considered that
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
                 ASIO
                </a>
                officers should be required to seek a new warrant in every instance where there is a significant change in circumstances:
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                …which could include a change in the premises subject to a search warrant (noting that a change in premises from a person’s home to a large workplace could have broad privacy implications), the identity of a person subject to a listening device or tracking device, or the range of activities needed to be authorised to execute a warrant.

                The Law Council of Australia is not known for its radicalism. I think it has taken a prudent and cautious approach to this, with the balance of keeping Australians safe. I would the grateful if the Attorney-General could either address that particular concern now or in the context of the specific clauses when we deal with them.

                   Indeed, it is relative—very alarming, in any event.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   You asked me what particular safeguards there are in relation to the offence of the disclosure of the identity of an officer of
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
                    ASIO
                   </a>
                   . This is governed by section 92 of the ASIO Act. Before I come directly to your question, might I point out that there are very good and sound reasons why there should be a prohibition on doing so. To identify an officer who may, for example, as part of their daily work engage in covert operations with dangerous people, could very easily place their life at risk. The work that ASIO does is, in many of its aspects, very dangerous work. To put into the public arena the identity of a man or woman engaged in a covert operation among, let us say, dangerous people could, as you can readily imagine, put their life at risk. So there are very sound policy reasons why there should be such a prohibition.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   You asked me particularly what special protections there are. I can tell you there are two particular protections and then there are some more general protections. Section 92 of the ASIO Act is not excluded from the whistleblower regime. If a person who is a bona fides whistleblower reports a matter through the process established by the whistleblower regime, they do not find themselves in breach of section 92 of the ASIO Act. That is not a public declaration, of course, that is a private complaint. As you know, because I know you are very well informed about the whistleblower regime, in the first instance, a person who has a bona fides issue and wants to avail themselves of the protections of the whistleblower regime is able to do so without falling foul of section 92 of the ASIO Act.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Secondly, Senator Xenophon, there is another, very particular, protection in the existing section 92. That is subsection 92(3), which provides:
                  </p>
                  <p class="italic">
                   A prosecution for an offence against this section shall be instituted only by or with the consent of the Attorney-General.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I think you are aware that there is a small number of criminal offences in Commonwealth criminal law which, beyond the orthodox manner in which prosecutions are instituted by the Commonwealth director of prosecutions—on top of that—require the consent of the Attorney in his capacity as the first law officer of the Commonwealth. That is a super-added protection specifically in relation to this provision. The fact that the parliament has put that super-added protection there should indicate to you that the point you make—that prosecutions of this kind are a little unusual and do merit an additional layer of scrutiny and discretion—has already been accommodated by the existing act.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   As well, there are multiple layers of executive and legislative oversight in relation to the exercise of powers under the ASIO Act already. Those levels of oversight and scrutiny have been increased, not decreased, by the legislation before the chamber today.

                    I am grateful to the Attorney for his answer. I said this in my speech in the second reading debate and I will say it again: I want to make it absolutely clear that I understand the grave danger that an
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
                     ASIO
                    </a>
                    officer or an
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIS" rel="nofollow">
                     ASIS
                    </a>
                    officer is placed in if they are involved in a covert operation and their cover is blown. I understand that. That is why I am generally supportive of a significant penalty for disclosing that person's identity.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    But, if we are talking about the specific instance that I referred to in my contribution in the second reading debate, in respect of witness K—and I understand it is a matter before the courts—if there is no question of the security officer's identity being involved, if the covert operation is already over and done with, and there may be some compelling public interest reasons to disclose, I think that ought to be taken into consideration, in the context of penalties.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I do not want to verbal one of the Attorney's very fine advisers, who have been very helpful in this whole process. I want to congratulate the Attorney on the quality of his advisers and the advice that they have given. But there is a concern about whether, in the case of witness K, the disclosure of information is in the public interest. This is a real-life example currently before the courts; the circumstances relate to allegations of the bugging of the
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
                     East Timor
                    </a>
                    cabinet room and the implications for East Timor in relation to a treaty negotiation. I am of the view it is in the public interest; presumably, the Attorney would say it is not.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    But there would be many people of good faith who are concerned about security who would think that it is not an unreasonable thing to disclose why that person should be subject to a much more significant level of penalty and why there should not be consideration of the penalty or the prosecution of that person. That would be distinct from someone who is a spy for another country, putting the lives of Australians at risk. That person would be a traitor to this nation—in other words, someone with a commercial consideration, receiving money to disclose information to another government. That is very different from a situation where an intelligence officer or someone disclosed information about something that may be dubious or unethical or illegal. That is the context.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I want the Attorney to please understand that I do not want to put the lives of our security officers at risk in covert operations. I understand fully the imperatives in ensuring that they are not at risk. As I said earlier, disclosing their identity if they are operating in a covert operation, with some pretty evil people, is effectively signing their death warrant. I do not want that to occur. There should be clear legislative sanctions against that. The case of witness K is quite different I think.

                     Senator Xenophon, as you say, the witness K matter is before the courts so of course you would not expect me to comment on it, and I will not. Secondly, in a sense, you have already answered your own question by indicating that there is a variety of circumstances, a gradation of seriousness, of the kind of conduct which could constitute an offence against the existing provision, section 92.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     That is what courts do in sentencing offenders. They do not need legislative direction to do so. They take into account all the facts of the particular offence. If a person has committed a crime, then obviously the circumstances in which the crime was committed and the circumstances of either severity or mitigation will always be, as a matter of the orthodox application of the principles of criminal sentencing, taken into account by the judge. So the sentiment you have expressed, if I may say so, is correct, but I do not think you give sufficient credit to the capacity of judges, uninstructed by provisions of the kind that you propound, to take those considerations into account in arriving at sentencing decisions.

                       <p>
                        I do not want to hold up this part of the committee stage. I do have serious concerns about some aspects of the increased penalties in this legislation. I take the Attorney's point about the general judicial discretion in determining penalties, in determining a sentence, for instance. But I think sometimes having something drawn to the attention of the judiciary—as is done quite often particularly by state governments on so-called law and order matters—and directing the judiciary to certain matters that should be of particular emphasis or importance, particularly in respect of the public interest in such matters, would be a good thing and would be an added safeguard. Depending on how the committee stage goes, I hope that the government can at least seriously consider that particular amendment.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        The logical extension of what the Attorney is saying is that if the court already has the discretion to take these matters into account then what harm is done if we elevate that concern about public interest within the legislation? It is a remark I address also to the opposition—if they are so minded to look at that. All I ask is that it be considered in the course of this debate because I think it would provide some comfort to those who were concerned about any overreach in these matters. Having said that, I am grateful for the Attorney's answers.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Finally, notwithstanding that the Witness K matter is before the court, I think we can safely discuss circumstances similar to Witness K or a similar hypothetical example in the context of considering how this law would apply in increased penalties and in disclosure. I will not take it any further than that at this stage. Witness K is a real-life example. Whilst we cannot comment on what the court will do, we can, I think, comment on allegations and the sets of circumstances that may present themselves again at some time in the future in respect of some of these operational matters.

I am going to put a couple of questions to you, Senator Brandis, based on the issues that they have put into the field. It seems the committee have identified some grave misgivings about the way that the bill operates. I will go to one specific issue, which I think is the third or fourth one that they raise, around delegation.

I just wonder, Minister, if you could give us the benefits of your wisdom on the degree to which ASIO is currently able to delegate any or all of its powers to third parties who may not be an employee of the organisation. Does this is power exist at the moment? Is it something that is completely new?

                                is able to delegate its powers, apparently a very wide range of powers, to an affiliate that is newly defined in schedule 1, item 61. My question is about the degree to which ASIO is already empowered to delegate its responsibilities or its authorities to third parties or whether this is a completely new power. What it looks like to me, and the way the scrutiny of bills committee has identified it, is it will extend to these ASIO affiliates an extraordinary range of intrusive and coercive powers. What I am trying to do before I get to the substance of the way that this amendment will operate is get a sense of the status quo that prevails at the moment as far as delegating ASIO's powers away.

                                        So are you able to confidently allay my concerns—and evidently the concerns of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee—that these authorities are still only delegable to people who are officers of

                                        ? My reading and my reading of the concerns that have been put by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee is that the categories of persons who can have these powers delegated to them is extremely broad. I wonder, Minister, if you might then explain to us what exactly the change is, because I do not understand exactly how this is drafted in that case? What is the material change: if the delegation power still only includes people who are ASIO officers then what exactly is being changed here?

                                                  Management is a very broad phrase. Is that administrative, financial—this is not a trick question; I am just trying to understand in what sorts of circumstances would this apply? In other words, how is this power of delegation any different from the previous power? Does it relate to administrative functions? Does it relate to operational matters?

The answer to that question is no.

We will come back to that in a moment—an exception from the prohibition on the interception of a communication passing over a telecommunications system. Would you define that as an administrative task rather than an operational one? If you do, I might need to ask you: what is your definition of an operational activity?

This seemed to me to be extremely important. A very broad range of people are potentially going to have powers delegated to them and there does not appear to be any circumscribing of the kinds of powers that can be delegated out, and it would appear, at least on the reading of this report, that that could include anything up to and including installing surveillance equipment or wire-taps. If, as I say, the committee simply got it wrong, I will not detain the chamber any further.

The explanatory memorandum merely repeats the effect of the proposed amendment.

Also, is the Attorney able to clarify the concern expressed by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee as to what the nature of the appointment would be and the protections afforded to affiliates? I think there was a concern raised by the committee in respect of that, saying that it is unclear whether the exception should appropriately apply to them, given their qualifications.

They are bound by the law and they are bound by the terms of their contract. There is no general exemption from legal liability in relation to a contractor. If they were to be indemnified by the organisation, that indemnity against a public liability, for example—they cannot be indemnified against a breach of the law, of course—would have to be found in the terms of their contract.

This does not appear to be addressed in the explanatory memorandum other than to say it is 'consistent with operational requirements'. It seems to the committee that there is a real issue about what powers etc. might be appropriately be held by different classes of decision-makers, how appropriate qualifications will be determined and assessed and what safeguards will apply given that ASIO affiliates are not employees of the organisation.
                                                                         </p>

The Attorney has, in his previous answers, gone some way to explaining those, but I think it is an issue of concern. Insofar as the committee asserts that the explanatory memorandum does not address those issues, I would be grateful if the Attorney could address those issues now.

I appreciate the Attorney's candor in his answers to date, but it seems that these are matters where the committee raised issues of how qualifications will be determined and assessed and what safeguards will apply given that those ASIO affiliates are not employees of the organisation. To categorise them as hypothetical matters is not fair. I think it is reasonable to say that the committee has identified a number of items where there are some additional powers. All I am trying to establish is how those additional powers will be dealt with and what safeguards will apply. The Attorney is quite right to say that this does not relate to operational matters, but can there sometimes be circumstances when a so-called management issue can flow into or intersect with an operational matter?

Could you just seek some advice as to whether you are able to actually put that document into the field now? If the clerks disagree, we will let that go, but this is something that is directly relevant the operation of the bill that we are debating now.

As I say, I am not the author of the standing orders. What I want to do is get on with the debate. You have yet to move your first amendment. This bill has been in committee now for about an hour and a half. I would ask you to move your first amendment.

It is also, I might say, governed by strict internal protocols and, of course, warrants are sought from the Attorney. As the officer of government who has to authorise these warrants from time to time I can assure you that the material put before the Attorney in order to satisfy the statutory tests is very, very extensive. Now, it is not for me, or for that matter for you, to speculate on the meaning of what is not a defined term in the act. We can each have our own views about the meaning of an ordinary term in the English language. I do not think that is very helpful, frankly. I did not understand it to be in controversy in this debate, even with the Greens, even with your party, Senator,—the manner of the execution of ASIO warrants—which have been an established part of the ASIO Act since, I believe, the first ASIO Act was enacted.

If we are not able to have that information in writing, the only way for us to get to it while we are at this stage of the debate is to put these questions to you now. Minister, I wonder whether you could satisfy for us—and I put this question to you in the form of words that it has been put by the scrutiny committee, which said:

The committee is also interested in whether it would be appropriate to provide legislative guidance as to any parameters on the class/es of persons to whom authorisation can be granted and whether the option to authorise classes of persons could be limited to emergency situations (those involving 'very short notice').

There is a series of questions that have come in, particularly from Senator Ludlam, to issues that have been raised by a Senate scrutiny committee to which a detailed response has in each particular case been provided but which, as a matter of ordinary course in the Senate business, will be tabled later in the day. I question whether or not we are now approaching an abuse of the committee stage of this debate by delaying the debate on amendments which have been circulated that, after nearly two hours, have not yet been commenced by questions which, in the ordinary course of events as part of the Senate's routine, as prescribed by the standing orders, will be tabled later in the day.

                                                                                                </p>

                                                                                                 Senator Brandis, through the chair, the reason this is taking time is that you are refusing to provide us with your counterarguments, which you have written. You obviously consider that the concerns raised by the scrutiny committee are legitimate enough to be worth bothering to reply in writing. You are withholding those responses from those who are seeking to ask those same questions. You are offering to table them later in the day, presumably, after this opportunity for us to put these questions to you has lapsed and that opportunity will be lost. Then you wonder why things are taking time.
                                                                                                </p>
                                                                                                <p>
                                                                                                 Let me spell it out: things are taking time because you are withholding information which you are proposing to provide in a couple of hours time. Just seek leave, table the document and we can move on, if we are satisfied with the answers that you have provided. Senator Brandis, in the meantime, through you, Chair, I do not appreciate being accused of abusing Senate procedure, for coming in here and asking you perfectly reasonable questions, which have been asked by a Senate committee and which deserve answers. With that in mind I would, again, invite you to just produce the document so that we can get on with the debate. Or, if not, feel free to just read in sections of what you have provided to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee so that we can see whether we are satisfied with your response.

As I understand it, it can be done pretty much automatically by the minister and that he is entitled to do so. I may have misunderstood standing order 166 but, on the face of it, that is what it says. That may give the Attorney comfort in order to table these documents sooner rather than later which may, in turn, assist the debate.

I am looking at standing order 166. There are certain conditions that need to be satisfied, including the assent of the acting chair, if this is in the committee stage. I am not sure that I am in a position to avail myself of standing order 166, so I am not going to do so without careful consideration and without knowing what the attitude of others who must consent to the process you recommend may be. But may I say, Senator, particularly at a time like this, I find it unbelievable that you would spend two hours of the committee stage of the debate on an urgent bill playing procedural games and engaging in what is starting to sound a little like a filibuster.

It is what we are meant to do. I do want to get to the amendments and I do want to deal with them expeditiously. But these are matters that were raised by a standing committee of the Senate that raised, I think, quite legitimate questions in respect of this bill. I will not cop it from the Attorney—with great respect to the Attorney—to be accused of filibustering or wasting the Senate's time. I simply alerted the Attorney to standing order 166 as a mechanism to perhaps short-circuit the debate on the tabling of documents. However, I think the questions and the answers given by the Attorney have been useful in understanding this very important bill.

You have provided written answers to the committee and we have identified that there is a standing order that will allow you to table them so that we can now consider your answers rather than having you withhold them in here. The reason why this is taking so long, Senator Brandis, to spell it out to you, through you, Chair, is that you are withholding information that, in a couple of hours, will be put into the public domain. Provide it to the Senate now, while we are debating these provisions, then we can move on. If you need the consent of the temporary chair, which is what you put to us before, I find it hard to imagine that that would not be forthcoming.

The point I make to you is that this is not—I do not have the liberty under that standing order to, by my own unilateral decision, take the course that you have recommended. This is not up to me alone, so I am not in a position in which I am able to do that. I am neither the author of the standing orders nor am I a member of the committee, so my hands are tied.
                                                                                                      </p>

And frankly I think, given that your party, Senator, has circulated a number of amendments, that you would be eager to get on with the debate.

Let us see if we can untie the minister's hands, shall we? Under standing order 166(b), I understand committee chairs could also table the document—I do not have the standing order in front of me. I seek your advice, Chair, and maybe if you want to avail yourself of advice from the clerks, because this is getting a bit ridiculous, we can help Senator Brandis to do his job.

That is what I am seeking to do in the face of your opposition. You and Senator Xenophon have asked me many questions about the bill, which I have responded to in detail and often. You are now proposing a course of variation of the Senate's procedure over which I have no power, so we are bogging down debate on an important piece of legislation with a quibble about procedural matters. What I am imploring you to do is to get on with the debate.

I do not have the authority to ask that that report be tabled early. I understand that would have to be a decision of the whole Senate to table that report early.

It was: if Senator Brandis sought the permission of the chair to table the report whether that permission would be forthcoming from you—so the initiative would come from the Attorney. I am trying to identify if there is any procedural reasons or otherwise why that consent would not be forthcoming, and then we can move this absurd debate along.

Rather than dealing with the issue of fast tracking the report, as I understand it there is nothing to limit the minister from releasing his response to the committee independently of that report.

Otherwise I am effectively just taking your word that we should let the debate move on. It is unlikely that we would really be able to come back to the substance of the scrutiny committee's issues, of which there are many. I am presuming you took them seriously enough to write a response, that you to regard them as serious—although I think you said before they were not very good lawyers. So if we just traverse them one by one, are you able to just provide us with an outline of how you have responded to each of the committee's concerns? Otherwise I think what you are asking us to do is just set it aside and trust you and, quite frankly, I do not.

Senator Ludlam, I will not, for the reasons I have already explained, traduce the procedure of the Senate by, in effect, tabling the report; however, I can answer your question. The answer to your question is that the method that has been adopted by the provision to which you refer—that is, schedule 2, item 29—is to bring the provisions of the act into conformity with the scheme of the Surveillance Devices Act.
                                                                                                                 </p>

It is something that I believe is vital for the national security and the security of all of my fellow Australians. With all of these sorts of issues, there is always some apparent curtailment of liberties and freedoms we have enjoyed in the past. I have had a careful look through the work that Senator Brandis has done and what the government has proposed, and, whilst in different circumstances we might take a different view to this, I certainly am one of those in Australia—and I think there are a lot like me—who are very keen to see these measures implemented, even if it does, in some small way, impinge upon freedoms that I had previously enjoyed.
                                                                                                                  </p>

I would only feel sorry for them; they would die of boredom by listening! Certainly, I never have anything to hide. It does not, but if perchance this bill did give someone the right to listen to my phone calls because perhaps I was a threat to the community then so be it. But I have nothing to hide, so I do not care if they do.

If there are other amendments to come, to address some of the issues that Senator Ludlam and Senator Xenophon have raised, then let us debate them, let us put them and let us get on, because it does seem to me essential that we do actually move on the bill.

I am not particularly in favour of it myself, but I leave it to those who think it is a good idea to actually propose the reason that these amendments should be adopted. At the present time I am not convinced that they should be adopted. But I will listen to the debate and listen to the minister's response.

As you, Senator Macdonald, would well understand, that would impose an arbitrary, artificial and wholly unworkable limitation that would frustrate the ability of ASIO to perform its statutory functions. How can anyone—certainly, how can Senator Ludlam—stand in the Senate today and anticipate what the needs of ASIO will be in relation to warrant based computer access next year, or in 10 years time, or for however long this legislation exists? The idea of saying today, in September 2014, that we know that in years to come there will never be a necessity for ASIO to have any more than a finite number of computer access warrants in operation is of course an absurdity.
                                                                                                                   </p>

With the variety and number of devices now commonly used as well as the increasing use of computer networks and remote storage, it is highly probable that data may be stored on a number of devices. In exercising its functions, including its powers under a computer access warrant or search warrant, ASIO is required to comply with the Attorney-General's guidelines.
                                                                                                                   </p>

                                                                                                                    These require ASIO to use as little intrusion into individual privacy as is possible. The means used for obtaining information must also be proportionate to the gravity of the threat posed and the probability of its occurrence. In line with the PJCIS's unanimous recommendation, the government has issued an additional explanatory memorandum which explains the concept of a security matter in relation to section 25A and its limiting effect on the ability to issue warrants and authorise activities under them.
                                                                                                                   </p>
                                                                                                                   <p>
                                                                                                                    The Attorney-General can include appropriate conditions and restrictions in the warrant which could include a limitation on the number of devices to be accessed where appropriate. Limiting computer access warrants in the way the Greens propose would produce, as I said before, an absurdity. It would create a significant loss of ASIO's capability—perhaps that is Senator Ludlam's motive—which contradicts the position of the unanimous report of the PJCIS that there is a need to enhance, in line with developments in computer technology and its usage, ASIO's capability. It would be irresponsible in the extreme to seriously entertain that notion. I know Senator Macdonald has ridden to the rescue of the hapless Senator Ludlam by moving a motion he was unprepared to move, so that we could progress this debate in a mature and businesslike fashion. Having formally moved that motion, I hope I have persuaded you, Senator Macdonald, that the motion standing in the Australian Green's names is a nonsense.

Also, by way of a point of order, could I seek your advice on how Senate practice applies to senators moving amendments that they have not actually introduced into the chamber—it seems somewhat unorthodox—and whether it then obliges Senator Macdonald to vote for the motion that he has put to the chamber. I am happy to debate it, but I just seek your advice in that regard.

That being the case and leave not been given to withdraw the amendment, I will briefly speak to the minister's response. I thank the minister for his explanation. It has reinforced my own thoughts that the amendment is quite ridiculous and takes away the powers the government and, I think, Australian society deem that our protectors—

I trust that the chair will allow for that to occur.

Nearly all those who provided evidence to the joint committee on the bill noted a very wide loophole in the drafting in the way that a computer is defined. We are not seeking to amend that definition, but merely the way that

The simple interpretation is this: in expanding the definition of a computer to include a network or networks, you have effectively created an open-ended power for the exercise of a single warrant to, in theory, at least, to include anything connected to that device and anything connected to devices connected to that.

Is our reading of the drafting correct in that there is actually no upper limit to the number of devices that could be caught in the execution of a single warrant? If that is the case then that obviously justifies the purpose of this amendment. Firstly, if we could get the Attorney-General to explain whether there is an upper limit or whether that would be conceived of warrant by warrant, or exactly how open-ended this drafting is?

Senator Macdonald did not raise this in his comments. You did not therefore address them because he did not think to ask. Is there a theoretical maximum to the number of devices that can now be caught by a single warrant, given that we have expanded the definition of a computer to include a network or networks. That is a fairly straightforward question that you have not addressed. If it is the case that there is no upper limit, just let us know. If there is an upper limit or if you let us know how

However, from the opposition's point of view I can indicate that our response to this amendment will be not to support it. Indeed, for almost all of the amendments other than the government amendments the position will be pretty much consistent.

Of course, if the government is convinced by additional matters such as those that Senator Leyonhjelm forecast earlier, we are in a position to reconsider what has been reached as a joint position arising out of the

From the Labor Party's point of view, we are confident that the measures provided to our security agencies by this bill are both necessary and appropriate. We are also confident that the intelligence committee has reviewed this bill thoroughly and had no additional amendments beyond those recommended by the committee—which, indeed, the government has adopted. That said though, we certainly have an open mind if there are further additional issues that come forward arising from broader consideration as now the crossbenchers have had the opportunity to raise these. Were the government of a mind to make further amendments, then we would consider those—as indeed we have with respect to the issues that have been raised around torture.

We have been assured—and I wait to hear from Senator Brandis—that when we get to the government amendments there will be additional commentary added to the explanatory memorandum to deal with the definition of what torture is, which was our concern in that matter.
                                                                                                                           </p>

                                                                                                                            But just before we reached 12.45, I would like to put on the record my concern at how this committee stage debate has been proceeding. Unfortunately, we just saw the process deteriorate to farce. Senator Macdonald moving Greens' amendments in committee stage amendments is something I have not seen in my time! Indeed, had they sought to, it was available to the government to proceed with their own amendments. I think we could get to the first one at about third if they were frustrated at dealing with what, from my point of view, were fairly reasonable questions during the committee stage consideration.
                                                                                                                           </p>
                                                                                                                           <p>
                                                                                                                            But I would say to the government that this process becomes more lengthy than necessary when amendments are circulated later than perhaps should have been the case, like when the minister tells the Senate that a matter raised by one of the senators is a public document and then we discover in subsequent debate that that public document is not yet public but will be made public later in the day, and when the minister ignores my suggestion that there is nothing to stop him, as minister, making available to the Senate the substance of his response to the scrutiny process. I think it is unfortunate that we have deteriorated the committee consideration in this way. I would encourage the government to ensure that when we return to the committee stage that we are in a position to deal with the issues that have been raised by the scrutiny committee and that we can move more promptly through the amendments.

Senator Collins, I was not at liberty to do that. Under standing order 166 I did not have the capacity unilaterally to do that. Had I had the capacity I expect I would have done so.
                                                                                                                            </p>

That is not late in the piece. The government amendments were based on the recommendations of a parliamentary committee which reported and whose report was published two weeks ago. I announced not quite two weeks ago that they would be adopted. So there has been no obscurity or delay in the publicity given to the government amendments. They have been in the public domain, in substance, for two weeks and in a technical drafting sense for more than the ordinary length of time. I am not going to engage in a verbal quibble with you about whether a document that is published is a public document because it has not been published yet.

Acknowledging that this is an important debate, I ask Senator Brandis to withdraw the imputation that I filibustered anything. I have been asking you questions for a period of time, as have Senator Leyonhjelm and Senator Xenophon, that have been put into the public domain by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. This is hardly a waste of time and I ask you to withdraw that. We have largely conducted debate respectfully and I would ask you to continue in that vein.
