         I thank Senator Polley for that very insightful question and, of course, acknowledge her very longstanding support for Australian manufacturing, particularly in her home state of Tasmania. As we all unfortunately discovered during the pandemic, the goods that Australians assumed would be there when we needed them were not available. Across a range of products, our supermarkets and pharmacies couldn't get what we needed. Who can forget going to supermarkets, with the long lines of empty shelves and the sense of disappointment that we all felt when we couldn't get the products we needed? That was when the seed of the National Reconstruction Fund was planted. After a decade of neglect under the Liberals and the Nationals, it was time to re-invest in our manufacturing capability.
        </p>
        <p>
         Now that the government is seeking to make the

         </a>
         , the National Reconstruction Fund, a reality, it's once again the Liberals and the Nationals that are standing in the way. The government plans are to grow from our strengthsâ€”places where we already have natural resources or the human capital to compete with the best in the world. The National Reconstruction Fund will attract investment, it will help grow the Australian economy, and, most importantly, it will deliver high-quality, high-paying jobs for Australian workers.

           As you know, manufacturing is a vital employer in many regions around the great state of Tasmania. What role will the National Reconstruction Fund have in revitalising regional manufacturing after the decade of Liberal neglect?

            Well, I'd have to disagree with you there slightly, Senator Polley, because it wasn't just Liberal neglect; it was Liberal and National neglect that has brought us to the situation where we need a National Reconstruction Fund. Sadly, it was the former Liberal-National government that did neglect manufacturing right across Australia. I have seen it firsthand with Holden. It was an unforgivable decision to kick that company out of this country. This is despite the fact that one-third of manufacturing jobs are in regional and remote Australia. Manufacturers are based across regional Australia because of the access to natural resources from minerals to agriculture to forestry and to much more. The

            is determined to continue that focus on our regions.

               I thank Senator Polley for another very good question. There they are, right across there. They are the obstacles to the creation of a National Reconstruction Fund. Those opposite are the threats to improving our national self-sufficiency, investing in Australian ideas and turning them into great Australian businesses. Those opposite threaten plans to attract international investment and deliver jobs, many of which will be right in your regional areas. The biggest threat to our plan for a National Reconstruction Fund is those senators sitting across the chamber, the coalition. They say no to investment, they say no to opportunity, they say no to self-sufficiency.
