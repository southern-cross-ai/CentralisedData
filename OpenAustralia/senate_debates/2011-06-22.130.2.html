        I have provided a response to questions asked by Senator Milne today about audit reports relating to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmanian" rel="nofollow">
         Tasmanian
        </a>
        Community Forest Agreement. As the senator is aware, the Tasmanian Auditor-General has commented on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forestry" rel="nofollow">
         Forestry
        </a>
        Tasmania's administration of Commonwealth funding. For further information about this report, which is public, it can be obtained from the Tasmanian Auditor-General.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition, my department has commissioned an audit into the administration of the industry development program under the Tasmanian Community Forest Agreement. The report is not finalised. It will be made public after its finalisation. I will get back to her with a date on when that is likely to be. My department is also working with the Tasmanian government on an audit of the Intensive Forest Management Program, part of that Tasmanian Community Forest Agreement. This audit has not commenced at this point. If there is a time line in relation to that, I will provide that in addition to those comments.

        also indicate there is an additional response to Senator Bob Brown's questions without notice on 15 June 2011 dealing with Tasmanian forestry issues relating to browsing animals. I seek leave to incorporate that into
