         I thank Senator Milne for her continued interest in climate change, unlike those opposite. The science of climate change is robust and continues to be robust, despite challenges from a very small number of scientists and public commentators including those opposite on occasion. The science clearly demonstrates that the climate is warming and will continue to do so as a result of greenhouse gas emissions from human activities. The Intergovernmental Panel on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
          Climate Change
         </a>
         special report on extremes has found that climate change can result in unprecedented extreme weather and climate events.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Australian government has established the Climate Commission to provide the public with reliable independent information about climate change. There is unequivocal evidence that the earth is warming. If you look at the global statistics, mean atmospheric temperature has increased by around 0.74 degrees Celsius over the last 100 years. A recent report by the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has found that 2011 was among the 15 warmest years since records began in the late 1800s. In Australia each decade has been warmer than the previous decade since the 1950s. Through the process characterised by rigorous oversight, transparency and expert participation, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPCC" rel="nofollow">
          IPCC
         </a>
         finds that warming is very likely due to human activities. Of course, these findings are supported by respected international institutions around the globe: the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Meteorological_Organisation" rel="nofollow">
          World Meteorological Organisation
         </a>

          CSIRO
         </a>
         and Bureau of Meteorology. Australia faces potential significant environmental and economic costs from climate change impacts including on coastal communities, infrastructure, water, security, health and energy supplies.

          , I have a supplementary question. I did ask about the global warming potential of the increased level of methane and the methane impacts. In spite of accepting the science on that, why has the government decided not to require methane emitters like coal seam gas to pay the additional liability from 21 up to 25 until 2017? Now that they have done that, what is the financial value of this new fossil fuel subsidy to the coal seam gas industry?

           Dealing with the broad view of Australia's objectives, I had not quite finished the first part. I will come to the second part shortly. Australia's objectives ahead of the Doha round on 26 November to 7 December are: to finalise the second commitment period of the Kyoto protocol and conclude the ad hoc working group on the Kyoto protocol; to recognise the achievements of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWG" rel="nofollow">
            AWG

            LCA
           </a>
           and move to implemented outcomes as it closes; to enhance further work to cut emissions before 2020, beginning with securing new commitments to cut emissions by countries that have not yet done so; and to continue the open-minded thinking of the new agreement.

              ask the minister to take on notice what he clearly does not know and that is: why have you given the coal seam gas industry till 2017 to pay the additional liability? What is the value of the additional liability in dollar terms? What is the estimated volume of methane emissions from coal seam gas and is the government's failure to have an independent assessment of methane leakage a deliberate strategy to shield the industry from its actual financial liability?

               I do not accept the premise of the question by Senator Milne. What this government is doing is ensuring that we are driving for a low-carbon future; we are looking at how we can continue a clean energy future. I can take those parts of the question on notice to ensure that Senator Milne is provided with a comprehensive answer in relation to this issue but what the government is doing is acting on climate change. We are ensuring that emitters do have energy security and that industries can continue to operate in commercial environments. What we have done is ensure that the emissions-trading scheme after the fixed price on carbon will ensure that we drive for a clean energy future and that we then pursue a low-carbon emission future.
