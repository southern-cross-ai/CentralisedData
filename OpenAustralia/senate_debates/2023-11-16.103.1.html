         Local Government

        , Senator Watt. I refer to the Albanese Labor government's commitment to reform the way the Commonwealth funds infrastructure and undo a decade of bad decisions. What did the infrastructure review released by the minister today find?

         Thank you, Senator Sheldon. I know Senator Sheldon, along with all senators on this side of the chamber, understands the importance of infrastructure to local communities as well as knowing how important it is that Australians are able to trust the promises of their government. As we all know, the previous government left the infrastructure investment pipeline in a complete mess, and the review that Minister King released today makes that clear.

           I'm not surprised that, of all people, Senator McKenzie might have to say something about this—of course, the master of the spreadsheet sitting over there with her green highlighter out, colouring up the National Party projects and every now and then a Liberal Party project, but mostly National Party projects. I know today is an embarrassing day for Senator McKenzie and all members of the National Party in—

             On a point of order—and, indeed, I think Senator Colbeck just nailed it—he's not even being relevant to the question he was asked as a dixer. But of course he is also seeking to impugn a senator and imply motives. Senator Watt should withdraw.

                  Senator Wong, it is my habit to specifically request for personal reflections never to be repeated, and I really don't want to diverge from that. Senator Watt usually withdraws. I think it was close, but, in the interests of a calm chamber, I would ask that the comments be withdrawn.

                       The review that Minister King released today found a pipeline of infrastructure inherited from the coalition that was jam-packed with backed-up projects that were announced without the support of states or territories, poorly scoped, underfunded at the outset or designed simply to win votes. The infrastructure program was spiralling out of control under the coalition, having blown out from 150 to almost 800 projects. It has become clear that the previous government was addicted to announcements and colour-coded spreadsheets and neglected the hard work of building real infrastructure. While they may have had—

                             As Senator Wong has pointed out, it was a pretty uncomfortable episode for all Australians to have a government led by colour coded spreadsheets, and even now they still boast about it. The coalition's legacy and the path they set for this nation was $33 billion in cost blowouts and an inability to add any new infrastructure projects to the pipeline until the 2033. This is a breathtaking indictment on the Liberals' and Nationals' economic management and their failure to genuinely deliver for our communities. That's the coalition's legacy; under them, we would have had no new infrastructure projects until 2033.

How is the Albanese Labor government demonstrating its commitment to nation-building infrastructure and bringing certainty to the infrastructure sector?

                                We will be implementing the recommendations of this independent review, and that's because, in the words of the reviewers, 'There are projects in the infrastructure investment pipeline that do not demonstrate merit, lack any national strategic rationale and do not meet the Australian government's national investment priorities.' What a great investment program! What a great government you were! What great economic managers you were!
                               </p>

                                Unlike the coalition, we will be investing in projects that enhance productivity by removing traffic bottlenecks and building resilience in our supply chains. We are committed to a better approach, focusing on delivering nationally significant infrastructure that aligns with our broader national priorities in housing and critical minerals. We'll be investing in projects, as I said, that remove traffic bottlenecks and build resilience in our supply chains—projects that improve liveability of the cities and regions we call home and projects that contribute to sustainability and reduce our emissions, like public transport.

                                  Under the Liberals and Nationals, the number of infrastructure projects in the pipeline blew out from 150 to 180, but, as always, delivery was a secondary consideration.

                                   They are great questions. This review and the implementation of it will have real benefits for Australians, allowing our government to end the waste and rorts that we saw under the coalition and invest more in the projects that matter. Over the next 10 years, more than 400 individual ongoing projects are expected to be completed or substantially developed, including the north-south corridor in Adelaide, where we have proposed an additional $2.7 billion dollars in addition to the funding that was already committed; Logan and

                                   Those opposite may claim there are cuts while at the same time saying we should cut government spending, but you wouldn't want to look for consistency. They're making it up. We're not taking a single cent out of the infrastructure investment of the federal government.
