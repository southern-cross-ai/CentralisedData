         The Greens
        </a>
        have two amendments to move this morning to the Treasury Laws Amendment (Banking Executive Accountability and Related Measures) Bill 2018. The first one I will move immediately. By leave, I move Greens amendment (1) on sheet 8342 revised:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) Schedule 1, item 1, page 20 (lines 8 to 25), omit section 37G, substitute: 37G Pecuniary penalty for non-compliance with this Part.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) An
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADI" rel="nofollow">
         ADI
        </a>
        is liable to a pecuniary penalty if:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) an ADI contravenes its obligations under this Part (other than this Division); and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) the contravention relates to prudential matters.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) The maximum amount of pecuniary penalty is an amount at the rate of 10 penalty units for every $1,000,000 in assets, of the ADI within the control (however described) of the part of the ADI's banking business that is carried out in Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) In determining the pecuniary penalty, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Court_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Federal Court of Australia
        </a>
        must have regard to the impact that the penalty would have on the viability of the ADI.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) Subsection (3) does not limit subclause 1(3) of Schedule 2.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (5) This section is a civil penalty provision.
       </p>
       <p>
        This amendment in a nutshell directly relates any penalties or punitive measures to accountable persons or executives to their size under this scheme. We believe that an ADI, an authorised deposit-taking institution, which is liable for pecuniary penalties, should receive a penalty in line with their company size or their value. So the bigger the bank the bigger the fine. It's pretty simple and it's outlined in the amendment. We believe that the maximum amount of pecuniary penalties is an amount at the rate 10 penalty units for every million dollars in assets for those ADIs that are captured by this legislation. There are some more detail in there, and I presume, of course, all the senators have read it. We think it's pretty straightforward and self-explanatory. I'm not sure why you wouldn't support it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just before we put that to the vote, I do need to clarify one thing you said, Senator Cormann, in relation to deferred remuneration. In your second reading speech you talked about deferring the variable component of captured persons under this legislation and you said it was for at least four years. My understanding is that it was up to four years in the legislation. Could you clarify that, please?

              <p>
               I'm now speaking to the amendments moved by Senator Whish-Wilson. The government will be opposing this amendment. The government considers the civil penalties are set up at an appropriate level to provide a strong deterrent for poor behaviour by banks. These penalties equate to maximums of $10.5 million for small authorised deposit-taking institutions, $52.5 million for medium-sized authorised deposit-taking institutions and $210 million for large authorised deposit-taking institutions. These are tough penalties and substantially higher than the penalties generally available under the Commonwealth legislation. They provide a clear incentive for banks to ensure they comply with the requirements of the Banking Executive Accountability Regime. In contrast, the penalties proposed in this amendment would, in many cases, grossly exceed the maximum penalties currently provided for under the Banking Executive Accountability Regime. For example, for large authorised deposit-taking institutions, the maximum penalty would increase from $210 million to over $1 billion. The maximum penalties for some small and medium authorised deposit-taking institutions would also increase under the proposed amendment. The Banking Executive Accountability Regime has been carefully calibrated to operate proportionately across banks of different sizes. This amendment would adjust that calibration to the detriment of the small and medium authorised deposit-taking institutions. The civil penalties proposed by the government strike the right balance between providing a strong deterrent to poor behaviour by banks and ensuring they are proportionate to the size of authorised deposit-taking institutions.
              </p>
              <p>
               I also reiterate that these are maximum penalties. In imposing a civil penalty, a court is required to take into account the nature of the breach of the Banking Executive Accountability Regime, the extent of loss suffered and the impact of the penalty on the viability of the bank, amongst other factors.

               <p>
                Labor will not be supporting this amendment. This amendment seeks to replace the current tiered penalty regime under the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BEAR" rel="nofollow">
                 BEAR
                </a>
                with a sliding scale of penalties. We note that submissions to the Senate inquiry into this bill stated that the maximum penalties under the government's bill are a greater proportion of the size of small and medium
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADI" rel="nofollow">
                 ADI
                </a>
                s compared to the large banks. However, this amendment ties the penalties to what seems an uncertain definition of what the banks' assets are. This would lead to uncertainty over applicable penalties for individual ADIs. While we note the intent to have penalties set at a more proportionate level, an effect of the formula in this amendment will be to significantly increase penalties for many small and medium ADIs. This could have an impact on the ability of these small and medium ADIs to compete.

                 . I've been hearing about grizzly bears and teddy bears in this place for two days now from the Labor Party. They wanted a regime that's going to be like a grizzly bearâ€”a bear that's got teeth and claws and rips into the banks and makes sure we get some solid action hereâ€”and here they're knocking back a simple amendment that, yes, would significantly increase potential pecuniary fines on the banks for bad behaviour. That's why we've done it. I would have thought that was pretty straightforward and exactly what you were seeking, having listened to all your second reading speeches. So I am disappointed that Labor will not support this.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I do take on board your views about total assets, but that is actually quite clearly defined. In any banking analyst's report, you'll get a definition of how the assets or net assets are calculated for the bank. So I don't personally think that's an issue, but, if the Labor Party had a problem with that, they could have talked to us about it and we could have clarified that or included it in the amendment. The amendments have been circulated for some days now, so I do see it as probably a bit of an excuse to just not support a good Greens amendment.
                </p>

                 Minister, you mentioned that there's a gradation in the fines or pecuniary penalties for different sized banks and that the top-tier banks' penalties are set at a maximum of $210 million. Is the minister aware that the size of those tier-1 banks is very variable? For example, the market capitalisation of the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Bank" rel="nofollow">
                  Commonwealth Bank
                 </a>
                 is about $140 billion as we speak, whereas
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Australia_Bank" rel="nofollow">
                  National Australia Bank
                 </a>
                 is half that at just over $70 billion. How is it fair that the Commonwealth Bank, which is a much larger bank, gets to pay the same penalty as a bank half its size?

                  Yes, I'm aware that different businesses in Australia are of a different size. I'm aware that different banks are of a different size. I know that, among the big banks, some are bigger than others. But it's not appropriate for parliament, the government or legislators to tailor-make penalty arrangements for individual businesses. It's not unusual for certain tiers to be determined and for certain categories to be established and, as I indicated in my primary response to the Greens amendment, the government believe that we've got the balance right and that we've got the categorisation of small, medium and larger banks right.

                  <p>
                   I'd like to take this opportunity to put on the record the Nick Xenophon Team's support for this bill. A new accountability framework for the banks and for senior bank employees is long overdue. The Nick Xenophon Team welcomes the delayed implementation for small and medium banks, credit unions and building societies. While the bill may not be perfect, it should not be opposed. The royal commission into misconduct in the banking superannuation and financial services industry is finally underway, and I sincerely hope this will lead to a change in the culture that has adversely affected the lives of so many consumers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The royal commission will also examine the need for a last-resort compensation scheme for victims of bad financial advice and misconduct. A number of senators in this chamber would be aware of the strong advocacy by former Senator Nick Xenophon on the issue of a last-resort compensation scheme. A last-resort compensation scheme is the only way to ensure that customers who suffer loss from misconduct are compensated. It is a missing piece of a financial services regulatory framework. The Nick Xenophon Team looks forward to seeing the recommendations of the royal commission in relation to last-resort compensation schemes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I will also take this opportunity to indicate the Nick Xenophon Team's position on the amendments circulated by Senator Whish-Wilson. We do not support the amendment on sheet 8342 relating to executive caps. Whilst we agree that the pay packets of many
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
                    CEO
                   </a>
                   s in the financial services industry are far from perfect and ought to be reformed, it is the shareholders who ultimately bear the cost of paying the CEO. The direct intervention approach as proposed by the Greens is not an approach that is supported by the Nick Xenophon Team, but we do believe that the issue of executive pay is a debate worth having.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I can indicate that we will be supporting the amendment on sheet 8343, as the penalty regime does not adequately reflect the difference in size between big banks and the smaller regional and customer owned banks. The entire profit of the customer owned banking sector in 2016-17 was $487 million. In contrast, the
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Bank" rel="nofollow">
                    Commonwealth Bank
                   </a>
                   announced today a $4.8 billion half-year profit. We believe that this amendment will prevent any disproportionate impact on smaller banks and assist in discouraging activity within banks that gives rise to prudential risk. In closing, I'd like to acknowledge the work of the Economics Committee and thank those who made submissions to the inquiry into this bill.

                    Before I get to my next question to Senator Cormann, I might say, for Senator Patrick's benefitâ€”and I did cover this in my second reading contribution yesterdayâ€”that the Israeli parliament looked at this issue of executive caps, starting with their own version of a parliamentary inquiry in 2010. At the time it was very progressive legislation around executive caps, and it took the approach that you mentioned, whereby they said that they wanted to give shareholders, especially, more transparency and more say in setting executive caps for the banking sector. That legislation was passed in 2012, but they found that it led to no change at all in the executive salary caps. Then in 2016, four years later, they passed the first legislation internationally capping executive salaries at very similar levels to what we're proposing. Any banker who earns more than that gets a massive amount of tax, and basically it's not worth it. They came to the conclusion that, left to their own devicesâ€”many of the big institutional shareholders that control the banks are part of the market system and part of the same ethos, the profit ethos, that drives the banks and a lot of the bad behaviour. But their decision wasn't just about bringing the banking sector into line and holding it to account. It was also fundamentally a question of equity and a moral argument about inequality in their own country. If a banker earns $1Â½ million, that's still a hell of a lot more than most people will ever earn. It's still 100 times your average weekly earnings. They felt that was sufficient.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Interestingly enough, the bankers association in Israel challenged it in the
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court" rel="nofollow">
                     Supreme Court
                    </a>
                    , as you'd expect they would, and failed. So, they were the first country in the world to do it. And I don't often get up in this place and speak about Israel, but in this case I think they've led the way and there's absolutely no reason we can't do the same thing. So, I will just say that, which I did cover during the second reading debate yesterday.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Senator Cormann, my last question to you, you'll be pleased to know, on this amendment is on the differences in the sizes of the tier 1 banks. As you just agreed, those banks are very different sizes. The
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Bank" rel="nofollow">
                     Commonwealth Bank
                    </a>
                    is nearly twice the size of the
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Australia_Bank" rel="nofollow">
                     National Australia Bank
                    </a>
                    . Isn't that fundamentally also accepting that those different banks will have different advantages and disadvantages in funding a penalty, if it's capped at $210 million? Essentially, by saying that, given the funds available to CommBank, it'll be twice as easy for them to pay a fine of $210 million based on their market capitalisation. I think that we actually need to differentiate all banks on the size of their assets.

                     I've answered that question. The answer to the initial question is no, and the government believe that we've appropriately calibrated the penalties according to the various tiers, as I indicated in my initial response. We believe we've struck the right balance, and there's not really anything further I can add.

                      Market caps are a pretty blunt instrument to go on because there are all sorts of other types of financing banks go into apart from equity, but it is a value of the bank based on the issue holder's equity and, listed on a stock market, it changes all the time. However, it's a fundamental principle that, for a bank half the size, it's going to be twice as difficult to pay the same fine as a bigger bank. I will leave it at that and let the Senate decide.

                        We've already talked about this this morning, and I certainly did in my second reading speech. The Nick Xenophon Party have indicated they won't be supporting the amendments before the Senate today to cap executive salaries. I am glad that

                        </a>
                        is going to support the amendments to cap executive salaries. No-one can justify the salaries that are paid by shareholders to the bank
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
                         CEO
                        </a>
                        s in this country. Our banks are some of the most profitable in the world and our CEOs are some of the most highly paid CEOs in the banking sector on the planet. These amendments before us today, amendments (1), (2) and (3), will put a cap on both variable and fixed remuneration.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Fixed salaries are 10 times average weekly earnings, which roughly works out at about $850,000, double what our Prime Minister makes, so bank CEOs still make a lot of money. The variable component's half that, so it still takes them to well over a million dollars. As I mentioned earlier, this is in line with what the Israeli government capped their bankers' salaries at. They took some firm action. When that vote went to their parliament, it was 56-zeroâ€”56 MPs voted for it and zero voted against it. They got to the point where they all agreed that their banking CEOs were paid too much. There was no need for it, it was counterproductive and it only added to inequality in their country. They saw capping the salaries of bankers not just as an economic argument but as a moral argument. I argued in this place in my second reading speech that we have the right to do that as a government because bankers are an unusual breed and they have a privilege to operate in this country that is given to them by the Australian taxpayer. They have a licence given to them by the taxpayer, the voters and the government that allows them to operate and then they're insured against failure through the too-big-to-fail guarantees. They work in a very privileged environment and they literally are given a licence by the Australian people to print money.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        I want to make this very clear: the Treasurer talked in his second reading speech in the other place about bringing bank executives more in line with community expectations. I have no doubt at all that, if you go outside these walls and speak to Australians, the expectation of nearly every Australian you speak to is that these salaries cannot be justified. They are excessive, totally unnecessary, inequitable and unfair, and they add to inequality in this country. If government can play an active role in setting minimum wages in Australia, why can't we also play a role in setting maximum wages, especially in an industry that's regulated by the government? It's part of our constitution.
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Banking_Act" rel="nofollow">
                         The Banking Act
                        </a>
                        very clearly talks about governments issuing a licence to bankers and playing an active role in regulating this industry. As we know, if the financial system collapses, there's corruption or there's instability then it affects every single one of us.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Lastly, I have no doubt about the rotten culture, which everyone has acknowledgedâ€”even Senator Cormann tacitly acknowledged it in his speech in the second reading debate todayâ€”and the need for this legislation. Believe me, that is a big turnaround from four years ago, when we were having the FOFA debate in this place and Senator Cormann clearly said it was just a few bad apples in the banking industry. I'm glad he's come to the view now that there are some systemic issues and that this legislation is here today because of those systemic issues. I accept that it's more about prudential issues than it is about bad behaviour and adverse consumer outcomes, but nevertheless at least it is something.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        We accept there's a rotten culture, and there has been in the banking sector. There have been numerous scandals. We've talked about them ad nauseam in this debate. The only way that you can fix that profit-before-people culture, that profit-at-all-costs culture, is to cap CEO salaries. It's the simplest and easiest way to do that, because the culture of an organisation starts at the top. If CEOs know they're not going to earn $10 million or $20 million this year based on massive returns, there'll be a lot less pressure throughout the organisation to constantly make profits and do all the kinds of things that we've uncovered in our Senate inquiries, like sell to people products they don't want, charge excessive fees and charges to their customers, rip off customers or carry out unconscionable conduct. That's our view. I won't talk about that anymore. I will simply ask Senator Cormann to at least address this when he responds to this amendment. Senator Cormann, do you believe that bankers' salaries are excessive and do you believe the government has a role in limiting them?

                        <p>
                         I don't believe the government has a role in setting remuneration for employees of any business, including the banking business. The government does not support a cap on the remuneration for accountable persons under the Banking Executive Accountability Regime. Setting of salaries and remuneration arrangements more generally of any private sector business is, ultimately, a matter for shareholders and boards to make decisions on. It is not the role of government to set the size of remuneration payable to accountable persons; these are commercial decisions for an authorised deposit-taking institution to make in line with its policies.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         However, the government does have a role in ensuring such policies do not result in perverse outcomes for consumers. This is why the bill includes provisions requiring the deferral of a minimum percentage of an accountable person's variable remuneration for at least four years. This will ensure that accountable persons have clear incentives to make decisions which account for longer term effects on the bank and its customers. Simply capping the remuneration of accountable persons would not provide the incentives that the referral of variable remuneration can, when behaviour of a person is clearly linked to remuneration outcomes.

                          In terms of incentives, if a variable remuneration is deferred for four yearsâ€”and let's say the variable remuneration, the bonus, is $5 millionâ€”what kind of opportunity costs are going to be carried by that particular

                          or executive, Senator Cormann? What is the real penalty of having your remuneration deferred for four years? You still get it four years later. We're not talking about very significant costs. It's hardly an incentive.

                           What Senator Whish-Wilson has said is not quite right. Firstly, there's the provision where payments of variable parts of the remuneration can be deferred for at least four years. But, if there is conduct in breach of the Banking Executive Accountability Regime, my advice is that there is a requirement for the bank to reduce your variable remuneration. There is a penalty, which we are confident will focus the relevant people's minds.

                            will support this amendment put up by Senator Whish-Wilson of the Greens. We are going to support this because I think what the banking executives get in their remuneration packageâ€”between $10 million and $20 millionâ€”does not pass the pub test as far as Australians are concerned. The minister states that it is not the government's responsibility to get into private business, but this is not the government getting into private business. As I see it, the banking sector is a necessity that Australians have to use. It is a service that is important to their everyday needs and requirements in running their businesses and their lives. It is something Australians have to use.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            The fact is that the Australian taxpayer guarantees the banking sector, so we do have a very important decision to make here, because if ever the banking sector were to fail then the taxpayers would be picking up the bills. So the taxpayers do have a right to have an input and a say into the remuneration that is paidâ€”which is out of the realms of common sense. It is important that we have this discussion and the Australian taxpayers have a right to know the government's stance on this and why the government are not prepared to rein it in, when there is another country in the world that has done the same with their banking sector.

The fact that this amendment has been raised so lateâ€”in fact it only emerged this week and really wasn't raised until this weekâ€”suggests that this amendment is more about grandstanding than considered policy to address this issue with banks, of which Labor is very, very aware. The ultimate sign that it is a stunt is that we have

                                 and the Greens voting together. This amendment would not fix issues with the banks that have come to light over recent years. Evidence has not been provided to suggest it would have the impact of addressing cultural issues and poor practices in banks. Labor has consistently argued that the most crucial thing needed to address cultural issues, misconduct and poor practices in the banks is a royal commission. Banker wages need scrutiny, but this must be done in a considered and careful way, and only a royal commission can properly attend to this matter, amongst many others.

                                  This will be the last contribution from me. My colleagues and I want to move on to the next pieces of legislation. I can't let Senator
                                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Neill" rel="nofollow">
                                   O'Neill

                                  's brief contribution go unanswered. Senator O'Neill said that Labor believes the best way to tackle culture in the banks is through a banking royal commission. While I agree that it's certainly an important part of this debate, may I remind Senator O'Neillâ€”through you, Chairâ€”that, when I raised a motion in this place over three years ago, to have a banking royal commission for exactly this reason, Labor didn't just oppose it; Senator Dastyari made a public statement that it was a 'Greens' stunt'. I remember seeing some people on social media saying, 'If it's a Greens' stunt, Sam, it's a good one. Support it.' Anyway, we don't need a history lesson. But Labor did fall behind our push for a royal commission and, I will say, Senator Williams's and other people's push for a royal commission. I think it's ironic that I'm being told this is a stunt today when it is exactly what I was told when I was pushing for a royal commission into the banks to try to help fix the cultural problems that we have in our financial services sector.

                                  I accept that this is going to be revolutionary and radical to some, but it's not going to go away. Other countries are looking at this. This debate about excessive executive remuneration in financial services is happening right around the world. Nothing else is working. You can't leave this to shareholders. If we want to look at the larger debate of inequality in this country then we actually have to look at not only how we raise minimum wages, which we desperately need to do in this country, but also how we cap ridiculous maximum wages at the top end of the spectrum. We need to do both if we're going to fix inequality and close the gap.

                                   and the Greens is absolutely ridiculous. There's no basis to that comment whatsoever. No talks or negotiations have actually happened between our offices. We actually came to the decision this morning after reading the legislation and reading the amendment. It was common sense for One Nation to actually support the Greens' amendment to this.

                                   To hear Labor say this is rushed through and this is politicalâ€”I've seen them rush through so many things in this chamber when it suits them. The whole fact is that One Nation along with the Greens have been pushing for a royal commission, and I'm very pleased to see it happen as well. To hear Labor many a time grandstand about the workers and what they're paid in this country, bleating from the bleeding heart, and then say that they're going to support uncapped executive salaries is looking after their mates as far as I'm concerned. They don't really care about the workers in this nation who are struggling; they look after their mates. So it's all bleating as far as I'm concerned when they support the government or they don't support the amendments put up. The Australian people will in their own minds think, 'Why would anyone be entitled to receive $10 million to $20 million a year in remuneration?' It's just way out of the ballpark, and Labor can never justify that.
