        is a statutory authority within the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Government
        </a>
        ’s Innovation, Industry, Science and Research portfolio. Its mission is to deliver policy and programs that advance Australian research and innovation globally and benefit the community.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In seeking to achieve its mission, the ARC provides advice to the Government on research matters and manages the National Competitive Grants Program, a significant component of Australia’s investment in research and development.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Through the National Competitive Grants Program, the ARC supports the highest-quality fundamental and applied research and research training through competitive selection processes across all disciplines, with the exception of clinical medicine and dentistry.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This is an appropriation Bill to support the ongoing operations of the ARC. It will fund the high-quality research we need to address the great challenges of our time, to improve the quality of people’s lives, to support the development of new industries, and to remain competitive in the global knowledge economy.

        Bills to amend the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Research_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Research Council
        </a>
        Act to receive administered funding occur each year, this is to apply indexation to existing appropriation amounts, create a additional forward estimate and may also contain new funding for new initiatives.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The current Bill updates the special appropriation funding cap amounts administered by the Australian Research Council to include indexation adjustments to three existing financial year appropriation amounts, and adds a forward estimate year in the Australian Research Council Act 2001. The bill adjusts the Australian Research Council’s funding cap for the financial years beginning on 1 July 2010, 2011 and 2012 in line with indexation, and sets the funding cap for the financial year beginning on 1 July 2013. Indexation adjustments and adding a third forward estimate are part of the standard budget process and are administrative in nature.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The proposed amendments change only the administered special appropriation; they do not alter the substance of the Act or increase departmental funds.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The ARC is the major source of funding for the innovative, investigator-driven research that has underpinned inventions ranging from the

        </a>
        to the Jameson Flotation Cell which saves the coal industry hundreds of millions of dollar each year. ARC Centres of Excellence provide key science and policy advice on the management of coral reefs, are developing automated control systems for the mining industry and agricultural sector and are taking some big challenges in medicine such as applying nanobionics to regenerate spinal cord injuries. ARC funding has enabled regional centres such as the Cairns campus of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cook_University" rel="nofollow">
         James Cook University
        </a>
        to attract Australian and international leaders in tropical rainforest ecology to build world class teams of researchers and postgraduate students.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On-going funding for the Australian Research Council is essential to the vitality of the Australian higher education system. Excellent researchers across all areas of the university system must be able to compete for funding if we are to keep world class academics in Australia working in our universities and teaching the next generation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Since 2007 the Australian Research Council has delivered on the 2007 Election Commitment—for 1000 Future Fellowships. The Australian Government will provide over five years up to $844 million and will award up to 1000 of these mid career research fellowships. The inaugural 200 Future Fellows were announced in September 2009 and the next 200 will be announced this week.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

        In July 2010—13 new Centres of Excellence were announced with total Australian Government support of $255.9 million over 7 years. This was in addition to the Australian Government’s announcement in February 2009 of an additional $82.25 million to extend the funding of 11 existing Centres of Excellence.

        Through this important legislation, the ARC will continue to advance our efforts to build a fairer and more prosperous Australia through innovation and education.
