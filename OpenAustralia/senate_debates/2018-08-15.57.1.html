        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Energy, Senator Birmingham. The Australian Academy of Technology and Engineering released a statement on Monday entitled, 'More coal-fired power stations would be a mistake', which said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        New coal-fired power stations will not reduce the cost of electricity and will not aid efforts to reduce emissions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Is the academy correct?

         It's funny but the last two days I have received questions from the opposition about whether there wouldn't be any new coal-fired generation investment under the policies of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEG" rel="nofollow">
          NEG
         </a>
         . Now, of course, we're getting questions going in the opposite direction. The Labor senators seemed to be asking, 'Why won't there be?' Now they're saying, 'There will be.' Of course, every entity is entitled to its opinion.

Whether that is thermal generation using coal or gas, whether that is storage, whether that is renewable energy generation, what we want to see put in place are market conditions to get the lowest cost generation for Australian households and businesses.

                    Those opposite asked the question: is the academy correct in saying that coal would not provide for lower prices? That's their analysis. What I'm saying is the role of this government and the intent of this government is to have policies in place that give the lowest-cost energy generation for Australians whilst ensuring it's reliable, whilst ensuring we meet our international obligations. That is precisely what we're getting on with doing. That's what we've done in a range of energy reforms to date that are already bringing down prices. It's what we'll continue to do through the National Energy Guarantee and through our responses to the

                       I'm not going to come in here and play 'do I agree with somebody's statements or disagree with somebody's statements'. We respect Dr Schott's work and analysis, and indeed we are acting on the recommendations of the National Energy Guarantee. If you value her words so much then you should sign up to the National Energy Guarantee. As you rightly point out, it was the Chair of the Energy Security Board—the Energy Security Board which has recommended the National Energy Guarantee—so you have to ask: why does the Labor Party continue to play ducks and drakes over their position on the National Energy Guarantee? Why is it that Mr Shorten cannot give a straight answer when it comes to whether or not the Labor Party will support the National Energy Guarantee? Why is it? Of course, it's because the Labor Party is still trying to cling to their 45 per cent emissions reduction target—a 45 per cent target that, of course, we know will see much higher prices and much lower reliability and destroy aspects of the Australian economy.

I'd encourage them to look at the recommendations, which also apply in a technology-neutral way. They apply in a technology-neutral way just the same as the National Energy Guarantee does, because it's not about picking winners in the Turnbull government's policy; it's about picking policies that give us the lowest possible prices, policies that give us the most reliable energy, policies that meet our international commitments but do so with the lowest price and reliable energy.
