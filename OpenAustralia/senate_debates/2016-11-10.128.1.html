        My question is to the Minister for Education and Training, Senator Birmingham. Can the minister confirm that under former Senator Day's student builder pilot so-called student builders will not be paid any wages and, when participants are placed in unpaid work experience, host employers will pay a placement fee to former Senator Day's North East Vocational College?

         Let me firstly deal with the last part of Senator Moore's question, in which she describes it as 'Senator Day's North East Vocational College'. Let us be very clear: the North East Vocational College is a not-for-profit training provider. It is a trading provider that Senator Day voluntarily served on the board of, received no payment for and has no financial interest in. I want to be very clear about that, because there is smearing going on from those opposite not just of former Senator Day but also of a quality training provider that just last year was recognised in the South Australian Training Awards as the Small Training Provider of the Year and in the last few weeks was visited by the state Labor Treasurer,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Koutsantonis" rel="nofollow">
          Tom Koutsantonis
         </a>
         . It is a recognised quality training provider.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is an alternative delivery model. That is the exact nature of the pilots that are in question here. And so it is that, yes—

             As I was telling the senators, I have emphasised again and again these alternative delivery pilots are exactly that: they are alternative to the different delivery arrangements that trial apprenticeship models in different ways and trial the delivery of qualifications in different ways. These students will receive a certificate

                   . I was working through the elements of the question, and, indeed, reminding the Senate and Senator Cameron that not only are recognised qualifications received but also that there are licences that are received as well. Under the alternative delivery arrangements in this case, students are not paid. They are students; that is the nature of the arrangement for this model. Just as many students around the country receive qualifications for which they are not paid during their training. This is an alternative delivery pilot—

                         Order! Senator Cameron, I will entertain points of order, but I do not want it to become an abuse of question time by having an opportunity to repeat the question. Senator Birmingham very clearly, up front, indicated he would take the details of that on notice, and that is the minister's entitlement. He indicated that, and the minister is entitled then, if he is relevant to the topic, to complete the answer fully. The minister was in order.

                          As I was saying, a range of qualifications are received and, of course, there are on-the-job training elements to those qualifications. So I will check exactly what the on-the-job training elements are and the number of hours that are required to meet them, and I will happily provide that to the Senate—as I said, Senator Cameron, in the first 10 seconds of my answer. But all of this is about trying to trial new ways to lift apprenticeship numbers, which went into free fall thanks to the policy actions of the Gillard government in 2012.
