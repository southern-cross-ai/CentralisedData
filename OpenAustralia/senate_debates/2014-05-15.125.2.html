        I have further information to provide to the Senate on a question asked by Senator Wong on Tuesday. As I said on Tuesday, I can assure the Senate that, like all members of this government, I take the Statement of Standards for Ministerial Staff seriously. This government recognises the importance of appropriate governance arrangements for staff. I remind the Labor Party that it was this government that strengthened ministerial staff standards when we were elected last year.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I outlined to the Senate on Tuesday, Mr Johnstone came on board to assist me in the set-up of the Remote School Attendance Strategy in late 2013. As anyone who has met Mr Johnstone will attest, he is a strong and active community representative and someone who is highly regarded in the Aboriginal and Islander community. After joining my office late last year, Mr Johnstone completed his private interests disclosure, as all staff are required to do. After reviewing his disclosure, there were a couple of items that required follow-up. This process was underway when we received a media inquiry about Mr Johnstone's employment prior to joining my office.
       </p>
       <p>
        Following the media inquiry I moved immediately to clarify and address the issues raised. My office indicated to Mr Johnstone that he would need to amend some of his personal affairsâ€”but, as he never intended to stay in my office long-term, he made the decision to resign. There was no intentional impropriety on my former staff member, and there was no conflict of interest between his role in my office and the Indigenous Development Corporation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Johnstone was focused on getting Indigenous children back to school. That was his role in my office. He is committed and passionate about advancing the wellbeing of Aboriginal and Islander Australians, and I am sure he will continue to make an invaluable contribution in this area.
