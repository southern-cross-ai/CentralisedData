        My question is to the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, Senator Birmingham. Can the minister outline some of the support measures the Morrison government is implementing to support the tourism industry in response to the COVID-19 pandemic?

         I thank Senator Molan for his question. As was clear from yesterday's release of overseas arrivals and departures data, there's no industry in Australia that would be suffering any more or, frankly, has been suffering for any longer period of time this year than our tourism industry. Tourism operators right across the country deserve the thanks of everyone for the sacrifices that they, along with so many others, are making to help ensure our country stays safe at present, particularly given the burden that is falling upon them as a result of the necessary closure of international travel borders into Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         As senators know—and, indeed, debate and contest—the $260 billion package of economic support measures we've got in place is playing a crucial role in supporting many of those tourism industry businesses and their employees at present. Those assistance measures range across the small-business payments that we are making to those many businesses, particularly family owned small and medium-sized businesses in the tourism space. As well, we've provided aviation industry support, financing solutions and, of course, the JobKeeper payments that are supporting so many different parts of the tourism sector.
        </p>
        <p>
         We've also stepped in where there are additional fixed and specific costs in businesses that, were they to go under, could threaten the viability of a tourism region or ecosystem. In particular I give the example of our $94 million package for exhibiting zoos and aquariums. This is an important package that acknowledges that in those businesses, whilst JobKeeper measures may be helping with staff costs, whilst rent relief may be helping with other costs and whilst the small-business payments may be helping with other normal ongoing costs, there are high fixed additional costs, which we have provided support for, in terms of the care and treatment of animals and ensuring the welfare of those animals within those important tourism attractions across the many regions and cities of Australia.

            While these are dark days for our tourism operators, we are determined to support our tourist regions, in particular, to be ready to capitalise as states and territories reopen travel within and across their states and, ultimately, for when we do get back to hosting many millions of international visitors to our country. In the 2019-20 budget, our government announced a further $200 million towards a fourth round of the Building Better Regions Fund, which has brought that fund and program to in excess of $800 million of investment, and that's in addition to programs like our $50 million Tourism Icons Program. Just a fortnight ago, our government announced 163 successful projects under round 4 of the BBRF, and many of those support crucial tourism infrastructure in the regions across Australia.

               than Senator Molan does, and I thank him for his advocacy for many regions in those parts of New South Wales. Before COVID-19 hit, we initiated various tourism campaigns to try and encourage travel across those regions, and we stand ready to recommence those as border restrictions and travel advisories allow. Such campaigns showed off the stunning Glasshouse Rocks in Narooma, alongside an interview with zookeeper Chad from the Featherdale Sydney Wildlife Park and
