        My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Minister Cormann. Last week the Treasurer said that 'government has never entertained' changes to cash refunds of dividend imputation. Will the minister guarantee to the Senate that the government never has considered changes to cash refunds for dividend imputation?

         The short answer to that question is yes. What I would also say to you is that I've got in front of me a document called 'A fairer tax system with no

           No. Because we had the shadow Treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition coming out: this was a bit of handout from the Howard government. Let me quote to the Senate point No. 5 of 'A fairer tax system with no

                       The question by Senator Keneally goes to the heart of the modern Labor Party. The reason this is relevant,
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">

                       , is that I'm comparing and contrasting the Labor Party under Mr Shorten with the Labor Party of old under Mr Beazley. What we can see is that Mr Shorten is all about putting his hands into the pockets of pensioners and self-funded retirees, whereas Mr Beazley understood the cost-of-living pressures that pensioners and self-funded retirees were facing. Our government has not considered such a proposal. We are not prepared to put our hands into the pockets of pensioners and self-funded retirees.

                         I thank the minister for going back to 1998. I wasn't even a citizen then, so I appreciate the history lesson. How can the Treasurer's comments be correct, given that it has now been revealed that Treasury did in fact prepare a dossier entitled 'Tax policy: dividend imputation' in the lead-up to the last budget? Did Treasury do any work on options to limit access to cash refunds in the lead-up to last year's budget?

                               We stand on the side of Australian workers. Nine out of 10 Australian workers work for private sector business, and we don't want the businesses that employ them to be disadvantaged compared to businesses in other parts of the world who pay substantially less tax. We want Australians to have the best possible opportunity to get ahead and be successful. We understand that, for that to happen, the businesses that employ them have to have the best possible opportunity to be successful and profitable in the years and decades to come.

                               used to say and, indeed, that is what Senator Wong very succinctly and eloquently argued for in years gone by. If we want Australians today and into the future to be the most successful they can be and to get ahead, we need the businesses that employ them and that pay their wages to be more profitable into the future. That is why we don't want our businesses to be disadvantaged compared to businesses in other parts of the world.
