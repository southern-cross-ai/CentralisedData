        My question is to the Minister for Social Housing and Homelessness, Senator Arbib. Can the minister inform the Senate about the progress of the Australian government’s investment in homelessness and housing constructed to address homelessness? How is this investment helping to make a long-term impact on homelessness, particularly for people who are considered to be chronically homeless?

         I thank Senator Polley for the question. As the Senate knows, the government is extremely serious about tackling homelessness. We are passionate about this. We have set some very ambitious goals to reduce homelessness—halving homelessness by 2020 and offering supported accommodation to all those rough sleepers who seek it. We are working hard, but the government cannot do it alone. We need support and we are working closely with our state and territory colleagues and also with community organisations, the private sector and the Australian community to make long-term and sustainable changes.
        </p>
        <p>
         Homelessness is something that has been neglected by Australian government for far too long. I am happy to say that, under the guidance of Minister Plibersek, there has certainly been a significant investment already: almost $5 billion from the Gillard government of new funding to homelessness services since 2008—the greatest amount ever committed in Australian history. In addition, more than half of the social housing dwellings being built under the Nation Building and Jobs Plan will go to people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. I also recently announced an extension of funding for early intervention programs such as Reconnect and Home, which do wonderful work in helping young people and families avoid homelessness.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government wants to continue to drive the momentum and continue the reform in this area, and that is why we will continue to work with our state and territory colleagues and the ministers responsible. We are not after short-term solutions; we are after long-term changes. We are interested in sustainable strategies that will deliver, particularly for those who are at risk—

           There are certainly some very good programs underway across the country. Last week I had the opportunity to visit

           ’s Common Ground, which is based on the principle that you need to put people who are experiencing chronic homelessness into stable, permanent housing, coupled with onsite, wraparound support services, including health, counselling and vocational training.
          </p>
          <p>
           As we know, tackling homelessness is not just about providing housing; it is also about critical support services. That is why Common Ground is such an important program. It certainly will make a long-term difference not only to those people suffering from homelessness but also to those people requiring low-cost, affordable housing.

             is one such development which has received a great deal of support from the corporate sector. Grocon has played a huge role and invested in the program. It has been absolutely crucial. I am told that Grocon, by donating resources and constructing the site at cost, has enabled the cost of the project to be significantly reduced, by more than $10 million. On behalf of the government, I congratulate Grocon and thank Daniel Grollo for his and his company’s generosity. I understand that Grocon has also committed to doing the same work for the Brisbane and Sydney Common Ground sites. It is also worth mentioning that Grocon recently won the Mercy Foundation’s Social Justice Award—the first time the award has gone to the private sector. I know that there were many other partners in this initiative, including the
