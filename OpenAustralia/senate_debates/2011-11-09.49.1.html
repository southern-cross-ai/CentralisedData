        My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Wong. I refer to revelations that under the mining tax deal negotiated exclusively and in secret between the Prime Minister and the three biggest mining companies, without any direct involvement of Treasury, those large global companies and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FMG" rel="nofollow">
         FMG
        </a>
        will not pay any mining tax for a number of years, whereas smaller Australian based mining companies would have to generate most of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRRT" rel="nofollow">
         MRRT
        </a>
        revenue from day one. Does the government now concede that its mining tax gives multinational mining companies an unfair competitive advantage at the expense of smaller Australian miners and, if not, will the government now release all of its MRRT revenue assumptions for proper public scrutiny?

         I assume that the shadow minister is referring to some of the reporting about
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRRT" rel="nofollow">
          MRRT
         </a>
         revenue, which, if he had read subsequent articles, the Treasury has refuted very clearly the assessment made. I would make the point that the opposition on the minerals tax is really in all sorts of difficulty. Their shadow minister, Mr Macfarlane, has described the money being made in the mining sector as 'extraordinary'. He has described the profits made by mining companies as 'extraordinary'. Yet Mr Abbott's position is that—and I think I am quoting—'Mining companies pay more than their fair share of tax.'

          , I rise on a point of order. Commentary on the opposition's position is not directly relevant to the question that this minister was asked. Albeit that the minister has a minute and seven seconds to complete her answer, it is obvious to you, Mr President, that what she is saying now bears no resemblance to the question she was asked. You chastised the opposition before. All we seek is neutrality in the chair, with the same rules applied—

In responding to that question, she referred to Mr Abbott's commentary on the tax and his attitude to it, which is a perfectly reasonable thing in responding to the question.

                     , I withdraw unreservedly, as is my wont. It is perfectly in order for Senator Wong to canvass other views about that tax in responding to the question. I would ask you to rule it in order, and I would encourage everyone to calm down a bit.

                       If the shadow minister wants to ask questions about things which are incorrect then obviously I am going to respond to them. He made an assertion at the beginning of his question regarding revenue from the mining tax. In the first part of my answer, the first thing I said was that there was also reporting, which he should have been aware of, that the Treasurer had refuted—

                         The Treasurer and Treasury, I should say—thank you, Senator McEwen—had refuted those assertions. If he would like to refer to the public statements which were reported today about the inaccuracy of the modelling to which he referred, I am sure that he will become aware of those facts. But he comes in here asking a question which is not correct, which is based on incorrect premises. The reality is that you are making assertions which are not correct.

                          revenue assumptions in clear defiance of successive orders of the Senate since 30 September 2010? Is it because on reflection the government realised that the three companies which designed the Gillard version of the mining tax for them will not end up paying it? What has the government got to hide?

                               Thank you. I understand that Minister Wong enjoys getting stuck into me and the opposition more than providing an answer to a difficult question, but it is not consistent with standing orders, which require her to be directly relevant to the question. The question is why the government is refusing to release revenue assumptions related to the mining tax, despite successive orders of the Senate requiring the government to do so since 30 September 2010. What have you got to hide?

                                , on the point of order: the minister has been directly relevant in answering the question asked by Senator Cormann. Senator Cormann misses the point that the question he asked was very broad and included a part which he is now and was previously screaming across the chamber about. But that does not mean that the minister has to provide the answer that Senator Cormann is seeking directly. She is able to provide an answer to the whole question rather than to the piece that Senator Cormann seems to be plucking out in his interjection. So, Mr President, you should rule him out of order.

                                  The first point I would make on the question to which I was directly responding is that the senator made a comment about the government dealing with three companies. I was directly responding to the political assertion in that question by making the point that in a significant reform such as this of course it is appropriate that the government consults with industry. I would have thought that that, in fact, would not be a controversial proposition.

And why has the government also refused to release the estimated budget costs over the forward estimates for each of the measures attached to the mining tax, again in clear defiance of an order passed by the Senate? Is it because the cost of the measures attached to the mining tax is higher than the revenue it will generate from 2013-14 onwards? Again, what has the government got to hide?

I am not sure whether they have actually proceeded any further than the initial announcement telling people how those royalties that they are talking about will in fact be calculated. But the government will update its figures in the usual way in the mid-year review. We have disclosed the revenue forecast in the 2011-12 budget over the forward estimates of $11.1 billion. We will update that in the usual way.

                                     , I rise on a point of order. There are only three seconds remaining for the minister to respond directly to the question. On no view could anybody believe that by attacking Senator Cormann she is responding to a question about the figures in the budget bottom line. There is no element of the three parts of this question which the minister is directly or indirectly addressing. You should bring her to the question and ask her to quote the figures in the remaining three seconds.

                                           , a point of order was raised. You failed to rule on it. You simply responded, as I understand it, by saying that the minister had three seconds left. Mr President, I also ask you to give very serious consideration as to whether the change to sessional orders, made some time ago now, requiring direct relevance by a minister in answering a question has ever been applied or has had any significance in changing the way question time has been conducted since. Mr President, many times recourse is had to the precedent. But the problem was question time was turning into a farce. That is why the Senate took a deliberate decision to change the sessional orders to require ministers to be directly relevant. I would invite you to give serious consideration to ruling in accordance with that which the Senate voted for—namely, for ministers to be directly relevant.
