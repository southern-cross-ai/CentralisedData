        In his recent address welcoming the Prime Minister of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
         Papua New Guinea
        </a>
        to Australia, our own Prime Minister said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        â€¦ every Pacific nation, big or small, has the right to shape its own future and secure its own destiny.
       </p>
       <p>
        I strongly agree with these noble sentiments. Recently tabled in the Senate was a report titled
        <i>
         Restoring
        </i>
        <i>
         d
        </i>
        <i>
         emocracy
        </i>
        . The report was produced by the Joint Standing Committee on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Capital" rel="nofollow">
         National Capital
        </a>
        and External Territories, of which I'm a member. It was about the local governance on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Norfolk Island
        </a>
        . I encourage senators to read the report, and I draw their attention to my additional comments.
       </p>
       <p>
        The report explores ways to return democracy to the people of Norfolk Island. For some time now, they have borne the yoke of an oppressive administration which is the creature of Australian bureaucracy. It is my hope that the recommendations in the report are adopted and constitute the first step in freeing the people of Norfolk Island to be able to secure their own future and, further, that Australia supports them in this journey not as an administrator or manager but as a dear friend and generous neighbour.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank the people of Norfolk Island for the very generous welcome and hospitality they extended to me and my fellow members of the committee. I also thank them for their engagement with the committee, which was in good faith and in the spirit of friendship.
       </p>
       <p>
        My time on the island and with its people made a lasting impression upon me. I came to the view that there are two immutable principles that must guide the mainland's interactions with the people of Norfolk Island. Firstly, Norfolk Island is a distinct and separate territory and is entitled to determine its own future in accordance with the aspirations of its people. It must be supported by Australia in a manner that respects all that is sacred to and revered by the Norfolk Island peoples. Secondly, in all its dealings with the people of Norfolk Island, Australia must treat them with respect and a generosity of spirit. Australia must resist using its economic power unethically and instead negotiate with the island as an equal, having regard to its moral obligations to support the people and respect their aspirations.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is my great hope, moving forward, that this report is the beginning of a journey so that Norfolk Island's people can enjoy democracy and have an enriching relationship with Australia to the benefit of both communities. This can only be achieved with friendship, love and understanding.
       </p>

        Senate adjourned at 17:46
