        My question is to the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Government Service Delivery, Senator Arbib. Will the minister confirm that Labor-held metropolitan seats received, on average, double the amount each of funding compared to coalition-held metropolitan seats under the science and language centre component of the so-called

         . When you talk about productivity—the productivity of schools, the productivity of the stimulus package—this is one area in particular which will provide a great deal of productivity for the economy. That is what education does. Again, the Liberal Party neglected education. This government is taking it up.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government committed itself to deliver 500 science and language centres. We will deliver 537 of those. Senator Ryan would, I am sure, be aware that there was a comprehensive and competitive application process to determine which schools would receive funding under the science and language centre element of the

                    . That was the group that was involved in the assessment, and this was done on the basis of disadvantage. That was one of the key criteria: disadvantage. Again, Labor is delivering for schools; Labor is making a more productive country.

                     , I ask a second supplementary question. Given that the minister has mentioned the panel, did the government accept the advice of the department and the panel in the case of each and every project, and will the minister give a commitment to the Senate that no advice from the department was overturned by the minister in the case of allocating funding or otherwise determining projects? Furthermore, will the minister give a commitment that, in considering these applications, applying funding and making announcements regarding these projects, no discussions were had between his office or the department on the one hand and the

                              Senator Birmingham, you cannot debate the question. Senator Ludwig, I am going to rule that there is no point of order because I cannot instruct a minister how to answer a question. It is not within my province. The minister is addressing the question, but I cannot tell the minister how to answer the question.
