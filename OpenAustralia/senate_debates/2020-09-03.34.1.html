        Name of bill: National Commissioner for Veteran Suicide Prevention Bill
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Reasons for referral/principal issues for consideration: to allow for consideration of design of proposed National Commissioner, informed by the findings of the impending interim Commissioner, forthcoming government response to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Productivity Commission
        </a>
        's A Better Way report, impacted stakeholder submissions and consultation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Because the interim Commissioner (as announced February 5 2020) has yet to be appointed, the interim Commissioner's literature review, also announced in February, is also yet to commence. This review, consisting of a comprehensive review of known current and former ADF and Defence personnel suicides since 2001, as well as a progress update on the implementation of recommendations made in various reviews and reports since 2003, should be concluded to inform the design of the National commissioner's proposed functioning.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The expectation offered by the Government in February 2020 was that the interim Commissioner would produce an initial report back twelve months from commencement, with a final report due 18 months from commencement (or six months after the initial reporting date). As this has been delayed, it is reasonable to suggest that the work of the interim Commissioner should inform the consideration of the Senate committee, and such that the work of the interim Commissioner should be allowed to proceed without delay, and without undue haste. The 12-month timeline to produce an initial report should be honoured.

            Essentially, I just want to advise the chamber that the government will be supporting a referral of that legislation if the reporting date is 30 November 2020, because we do want the Senate to have the opportunity to deal with this very important bill so that this very important legislation can be passed by the end of the year. We don't think a reporting date next year is appropriate, because it would delay the establishment of this very important standing commission with the powers of a royal commission. I would also like to announce on behalf of the government that we intend to make an announcement in relation to the appointment of a commissioner during the month of September.

             I say to the government, look, it's as simple as this: you were going to put an interim commissioner in early this year. We are still waiting for you to do that. We still do not know who the interim commissioner is. We are now sitting in September and we've got no idea what you are doing or who it is, and there are no terms of reference. You've got a real problem here. What we're asking is: when that is done, can we overview that and have an inquiry, and watch this going through? I can tell you, you are the same government that still has not responded to the recommendations of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
              Productivity Commission
             </a>
             . What is wrong with you people? My thought is this: the only way you could come up with this is one of two ways. You are using information from the exact same people who are pushing these veterans to suicide—that is, the Department of Defence and the Department of Veterans' Affairs. I can tell you now that I sat on the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee" rel="nofollow">
              Committee
             </a>
             during the inquiries into veterans' suicide and veterans' health. I sat on those inquiries with some of your senators, and I have watched them in tears over the years—and you want to rush this through?
            </p>
            <p>
             If this is so important to you, why is there still no interim commissioner six months later? What sorts of games are you playing with these lives? Do you think we can do this in a month? Nobody in their right mind thinks we can do this in a month. You are being very unfair and very unjust to these veterans, and you know you are. You could be doing this. You and the Prime Minister are sticking your chests out at me because I won't give you what you want, and those veterans are paying the price. How can you do that to them? You know that one month is not going to cut it, unless you've already got this all down on paper. Have you got this down on paper? That is the question. There has been no discussion with anybody who actually cares and is heavily involved in this about who the interim commissioner should be—none at all. Today, quite frankly, you should be ashamed of yourselves. They're going to know what you are up to. One month!
            </p>
            <p>
             Who is the interim commissioner? Where is this magic man? Is he going to come to the inquiry? If it's so important, why wasn't this commissioner put in six months ago? If you really care about these veterans, why wasn't the commissioner put in six months ago? If you really care about these veterans, where is your response to the Productivity Commission? Where is all that? This is beneath even you. It is absolutely disgusting that you think someone can do this in just over a month.

              My God
             </a>
             ! There is no way you can do this in just over a month. You are kidding yourselves. I bet the interim commissioner is a mate. He'll be a mate of yours. If the interim commissioner is a mate of yours and if he doesn't do the right thing, I will be riding him from day one. God help you! These veterans are suiciding, and you're part of it over there. You've been mucking around with their lives for years. You just throw them around as if they can be used and abused like they're regimental numbers, not human beings. It's absolutely shameful of you people. If you actually gave a stuff about these veterans, you would take my amendment and leave this until April. It's your darkest day yet when it comes to these veterans. It's shameful.

              I urge the government to reconsider its position and give time for this committee to conduct its work, give time for the appointment of the interim commissioner and let the interim commissioner get his or her head around the issue so that they can appear before the inquiry. It's an important inquiry, and we should give it the time it needs.

               We have two amendments before the chair, and I will put them in the reverse of the order in which they were moved. On advice from the Clerk, I will interpret Senator Lambie's amendment as pushing out the reporting date in the government's amendment. The government's amendment is for a reporting date of 30 November this year; Senator Lambie's amendment is for a reporting date of 24 April next year. The question is that the amendment of Senator Lambie be agreed to.

                <p>
                 [by video link] In relation to the amendment that was put up by the government, I want to clarify that the reporting date for the inquiry moved to 30 November. It is not in one month. As Jacqui Lambie was saying, it was only going to be in one month.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I do support the government to move the reporting date to 30 November. I have heard from a lot of people who are fed up with inquiries into suicides. A lot of people are calling for a royal commission into it—that is true—but the government have made a commitment to put a commissioner in place. They have given an undertaking that who that commissioner will be will be announced almost immediately. I believe that the commissioner should be given the opportunity to start his work. If we hold this up with another inquiry, that means the interim commissioner cannot do anything and cannot do their job.
                </p>
                <p>
                 People have had enough with inquiries. I think there have been about 17 or 18 inquiries into this. I understand Jacqui Lambie's passion about this. I understand that she's frustrated at the answers hardly met, but we need to give the commissioner the opportunity to start investigating—and it's not about future deaths; it's about deaths in the past—those over 500 deaths have occurred in our

                  Defence Force
                 </a>
                 , and I fully understand that.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I do support Jacqui Lambie having her inquiry. But I think to extend that inquiry out for a year—which was initially until 27 August next year—was not reasonable. Even now, in taking it out to April, I think it needs to be a shorter period of time. As I explained to Jacqui Lambie, we need to get the commissioner working and to start working on this. Therefore I cannot support Jacqui Lambie's amendment—

                    This debate has been characterised by a little bit of dancing around the standing orders. It is a matter of some passion. I was going to draw senators' attention to the use of correct titles and addressing comments to other senators through the chair at the end. But I take your point of order; people should refer to others by their appropriate titles.

                     I do apologise to Senator Lambie. I am very passionate as well about the suicides that have happened in the

                     </a>
                     . Answers need to be had. But, to extend an inquiry out—and it was regarded to the terms of reference to a royal commission—there has to be no undertaking that the government will have a royal commission. What I have suggested to the government and to Senator Lambie is to let the commissioner do his job. He will be independent of the government and will do investigations into previous deaths that have happened. Let him come down with his findings. If that is not the case then the Senate can review that, look at how we will proceed with this and then possibly take it to a royal commission. But to have a commissioner in this position has never happened, and I believe that we need to actually move forward with this.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Senator Lambie, you have the opportunity now—a commissioner has been appointed and will be named—for a three-month period to have your inquiry, as you wished, and it's been referred to foreign affairs, defence and trade. So I would suggest that you've got an opportunity now to have that inquiry. I support the government's amendment to this.

                            No, I'm not going to lower my volume. This is a big issue and it's a shame that Senator Pauline Hanson's One Nation has become, even more so during the pandemic, just an arm of the Liberal-National government. We on this side of the chamber want to keep you accountable and transparent and scrutinise your decisions. I thank every single member sitting on this side of the chamber for doing that. We are doing our jobs and you have been pushing against us, pushing against scrutiny.

                            You gave us six days to look at the exposure draft of this bill—six days, not even one week! What are you afraid of really? Are you afraid that everyone will find out how destructive your uni fee hikes and funding cuts bill is? Are you afraid that everyone will find out your juvenile Murdoch-driven hatred of humanities in universities? Are you afraid that your bill doesn't at all do what you say it does? You are cowards and we will expose you. We will expose you through this inquiry. We want the 30 November date as well, but we will expose you no matter what inquiry we get. We are here to do our jobs, to keep you accountable, to make sure that every single person in Australia finds out how destructive your horrible piece of legislation is.

                                  This amendment refers the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Streamlining Environmental Approvals) Bill 2020, which is being debated in the House of Representatives as we speak, to an inquiry. It is unthinkable that this government would push through this piece of legislation without allowing the Senate to do its job. If they don't allow this bill to go to an inquiry, not only is this an attack on the environment; it is an attack on democracy and an attack on our children's future, because this is about the health and the sustainability of our planet. If the government don't have the common sense to know that our job in this place is to inquire into pieces of legislation, to scrutinise them, to work out what form the legislation and the amendments should take in order to make sure we actually protect the environment, then I don't know what they think they're doing on the front benches. This act and this piece of legislation require a full-blown Senate inquiry. The arrogance of this government to assume that they don't have to worry because they don't want to have to hear about it! It's just absurd. It's arrogant, it's undemocratic, and it is an attack on Australia's environment and our wildlife.
