          I understand that I do not have support from either the government or the opposition on this motion, so I wanted to note briefly what this motion actually does, because I doubt many senators present have taken the time to read it. The motion does nothing more than state facts about the serious and ongoing nuclear disaster on the north-east Pacific coast of Japan. The motion notes a number of official government reports and statements and it notes that the disaster is the worst possible type of nuclear event. It notes that the radiation levels are seriously dangerous to human health and the environment in the long term. It also acknowledges and encourages Australian nuclear expertise—because we have a fair degree of that here in Australia—to keep gathering data.

             , I raise a point of order. Senator Brown has just alerted us to the fact that there is a standing order that militates against reflection on a vote, and this senator is reflecting on a vote about to be taken. I thought Senator Brown would have been on his feet to take the point of order but, as he has not, I do it on behalf of Senator Brown.

               I understand that we do not have support for this motion. Since the chamber is not interested in understanding the facts on the ground in Japan, I would like to remind the chamber that there are 20 exposed nuclear cores at Fukushima, that a nuclear adviser to the Japanese government has reported that 966 square kilometres around the reactor site—an area 17 times the size of Manhattan—is now probably uninhabitable and that
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TEPCO" rel="nofollow">
                TEPCO
               </a>
               have been spraying water onto volcanically hot reactors and fuel cores, so radiation is now emitted in an uncontrolled way in air and steam. These are some of the facts that the government and opposition do not seem willing to face. Perhaps I will put to this chamber future motions that will have a better result. In the meantime, can we reflect on why we do not appear to be interested in having this information on the public record?
