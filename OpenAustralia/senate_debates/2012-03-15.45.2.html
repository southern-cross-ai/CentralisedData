        My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Senator Wong. Are there any ministers who have failed to report cash grants made to their own electorates over the past two years? If so, who are the ministers?

         I think Senator Evans's interjection, if I may say, is quite apposite. But I welcome a question from Senator Sinodinos. I also congratulate him on his appointment to the shadow expenditure review committee to oversight the work of Mr Robb and

           I am happy to. I am asked about grants in ministers' own electorates.

           make it very clear that this government has made significant reforms to improve whole-of-government transparency and accountability in grants programs. We established the guidelines in 2009 and the reason we did so is that we knew about the Howard government's inappropriate allocation of grants that occurred during their period in government, when the allocation of grants was clearly skewed towards Liberal and Nationals seats. I do not think anyone who was an observer of politics or was involved in politics could forget the 'regional rorts' program—a program where grants funding was blatantly skewed—

            , I rise on a point of order. As you are well aware, the minister is required to be directly relevant to the question. The question asked whether there were any ministers who had failed to report cash grants in the past two years. That can only be a request for the names of ministers and, if so, who were they? There is nothing the minister has said in response that is directly relevant or even vaguely relevant to the question asked of her.

                     The minister has taken a minute and 58 seconds to criticise the Howard government and to speak in general terms about the guidelines. She has two seconds to go. It cannot possibly be right to say that she is entitled at this late stage in the question to avoid coming to the question—that is, name the ministers.

                      , I rise on a point of order. If Senator Brandis refrained from such spurious points of order and listened to the answer that the minister was providing, she gave some general background as to the guidelines and their history and then went to the number of cases. If he had listened he would probably have heard his full answer.

                         , I ask a supplementary question. Will you name those ministers? And is it a fact that a minister who fails to report cash grants made to their own electorate to the minister for finance is in breach of the government's own guidelines? Has the minister exempted any ministers from abiding by these rules and, if not, what steps has the minister taken to ensure that ministers do abide by the rules?

                          In relation to the last aspect of that multifaceted question, my department, at my request, has already commenced action in response to the audit report. The secretary of the department wrote to all portfolio secretaries in January, reminding them of their obligations under the guidelines and drawing their attention to any shortcomings in agency practices that the Audit Office had identified.

                          I also would just indicate to the senator that the information was audited in confidence and was provided to the

                          of Public Accounts and Audit. The classification of this information is a matter for the Auditor-General. The information was provided to the JCPAA and I understand that the JCPAA will be considering how the information is dealt with. I think I have very thoroughly, if I may say, responded to Senator Sinodinos's question. But what is interesting, of course, is the reason they asked Senator Sinodinos to ask this question is that none of the former ministers over there could have asked it.

                                  In the primary question the minister was asked one thing: to name the ministers. You gave her all the latitude in the world, and after the expiry of two minutes she had not approached the question. In the second supplementary she was asked again to name the ministers. She has still not done so. Given that she defied the standing orders by refusing to deal with the primary question and by refusing to abide by your ruling in relation to the primary question, you should bring her to the question now and direct that she name the ministers.

                                      Order! I believe the minister has been addressing the question. The minister has 10 seconds remaining. Minister, if you have anything further to add you have 10 seconds.

                                       I have now, on a number of occasions, explained that the information is ordered in confidence.
