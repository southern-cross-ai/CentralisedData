         Senator Sterle, as a matter of fact I can. I know this is something that you followed very closely in your role as the chair

         , the committee we know affectionately as RRAT in this place. I don't know about you, Senator Sterle, but I thought that the election defeat that we saw recently of the former coalition government meant that once and for all the coalition's rorts had ended—the scandals, the rorts, the media reports, finally we might be making it clear of that. But, sadly, these reports have not even ended with the defeat of this government because last week the

          Australian National Audit Office

         released yet another scathing report into the former government's management of the $1.15 billion Building Better Regions Fund.
        </p>
        <p>
         This report confirmed what we already knew about the former government. It was the latest rort from a government notorious for rorts: sports rorts, car-park rorts, stacking the

               I think Senator Rennick's interjection indicates exactly why the former government cared so little about accountability if that's the way in which they regarded the high office of Auditor-General of this country.
              </p>
              <p>
               What the report released last week showed is that communities in regional Australia have been dudded, as the coalition actively ignored grant guidelines for their own political purposes in the largest open and competitive grants program available for regional projects. Regional communities with projects assessed as deserving were dumped to accommodate the political needs of a desperate, failing government in its final hours.

                    Thank you, Senator Sterle. One of the worst aspects of the report tabled last week was what it had to say about ministerial panel composition and record-keeping of decisions. That presumes that there was record-keeping of decisions, which, of course, there was not. Instead of transparent, accountable decision-making, ministerial decisions were shrouded in secrecy. The ministerial panel made decisions on the basis of 'choose your own adventure' criteria—a non-exhaustive list of other factors that were not fully explained to those applying for grants.

                    I know that the Nationals have again said this was all about supporting the regions, but, of course, what happened with this program was that some regional areas were dumped to favour certain other regional areas. Would they maybe have been regional areas that had the right colour code next to them in a spreadsheet? We all know that's how the Nationals went about decision-making. Who benefited most from this? It was the Nationals.

                    benefited the most, as proper process was actively ignored. Those seats got $104 million more than they would have if the proper process had been followed.

                           I can understand why Senator McKenzie, of all people, gets a bit toey when we talk about rorts in this chamber because, of course, we have had sports rorts, where almost half the projects that were funded were actually ineligible for funding until they had the colour coded spreadsheet that emerged out of Senator McKenzie's office. We've got the car park rorts—$660 million of rorts—which the former government used simply to target their own marginal seats. And, while those opposite love to name-check regional communities, when it comes to funding them, the Auditor-General found that 27 per cent of regional grants awarded by the Commonwealth between 2018 and 2021 actually went to recipients from major cities. Remember the regional pool that just happened to be in

                           </a>
                           ? That's how much they care about regions. They will rort till they die, and that's why they're out of government.
