         Mr President
        </a>
        , I am proud to present the Parliamentary Business Resources Amendment (Voluntary Opt-out) Bill 2017. This measure was a core commitment of mine to the people of Queensland and Australia, to whom I serve, after the recent outrageous pay rises of parliamentarians, coming off the back of stagnating wages growth over the last decade.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Everyday Australians would be appalled to know that not only do politicians constantly gleefully accept pay rises, but if one of their more modest colleagues wants to refuse acceptance of that pay rise they are unable to do so.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As stated in the explanatory memorandum, the purpose of this bill is to for provide Senators and Members the option to 'opt-out' of receiving any or all of their entitlements. There is currently no mechanism available for Senators or Members to opt-out of receiving part or all of their entitlements. This bill will allow Senators or Members to provide, by written notice, that they wish to no longer receive part or all of their entitlements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australians want a higher level of performance from their politicians. All too often the political elites let everyday Australians down. Pay is no exception.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If it is the case that the major parties want to band together and allow perpetual pay increases for politicians, so be it. However it is incumbent upon those with their snout in the trough to allow those who have respect for the Australian people to opt-out of a pay rise if they so wish.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Any politician who does not vote for this bill is sending a clear message to the Australian people that they lack respect for their fellow parliamentarians to refuse a pay rise, and what is worse, they lack respect for the Australian people.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian people have the right to analyse who among those elected are the ones that want more pay, and who are the ones that are willing to take a haircut on their take home pay.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Some of us stand on the side of battling everyday Aussies, the rest will vote against this bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted; debate adjourned.
