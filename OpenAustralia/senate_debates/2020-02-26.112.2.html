         I thank Senator O'Sullivan for his question on this really important issue. I can assure this chamber that the Morrison government is absolutely committed to finalising the rollout of the National Disability Insurance Scheme and making sure that we set it up for an absolutely successful future from now on.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am really pleased to be able to advise the chamber that nearly 339,000 Australians who live with disability are now benefiting from a plan with the National Disability Insurance Scheme. But, most importantly, of that number nearly 135,000 of those people are actually receiving disability supports for the first time. These are people who have never received supports before, and that's nearly 40 per cent of the number of the people who are on the scheme.
        </p>
        <p>
         Also of particular importance is that the scheme continues to increase the number of children that it's supporting. Thirty five per cent of new participants onto the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
          NDIS
         </a>
         in the last quarter of 2019 were in the age group of zero to six years of age. That means that more than 50,000 young Australians aged between birth and six years old are now in the NDIS. Earlier this month Minister Robert released the new data that showed the backlog of accessing early childhood interventions had been significantly slashed over the last six months. On 31 December last year for children aged zero to six to meet NDIS access requirements, on average, was down to less than three days. That's down from 43 days earlier in the year. For children currently awaiting a plan it's now 44 days, down from 104. Children meeting NDIS access to receiving an NDIS approved plan is now 54 days instead of 129. So the backlog of childrenâ€”

            The Morrison government is absolutely committed to working with Australians with disability to remove as many barriers as we possibly can which may impede them from reaching their full potential. Because absolutely everybody in this country, whether you've got a disability or not, should be able to have the same opportunity to play a meaningful role in our community.
           </p>
           <p>
            Minister Robert recently announced a further $68 million worth of grants for the National Disability Insurance Agency for the Information, Linkages and Capacity Building Program. These grants will go to supporting people around Australia to support them to connect with their communities; to gain employment, if that's what they wish to do; and access the kind of health services that fit their individual requirements. We know these are issues that are absolutely vital to all Australians but particularly they are important for people with disability being able to reach their goals.

               It is absolutely essential that we, as a government, back Australians with disabilities, their families and their carers, because, as I said, we want every Australian to have the opportunity to reach their full potential, whatever that may be. We understand that the aspiration to participate fullyâ€”whether it be in the social or economic life of our nationâ€”is something that people with disability value as much, if not more, than the able-bodied population. This reformâ€”the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
                NDIS
               </a>
               â€”is a world first. It's a once in a generation reform. Since Medicare I don't think we have seen a social reform of this kind of magnitude. We will continue to work with Australians with disability to make sure that, business as usual, they are able to undertake employment and activities in our communities. We will continue to support them through the National Disability Insurance Scheme so that they can live their best lives.
