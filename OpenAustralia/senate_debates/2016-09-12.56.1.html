         I thank Senator Williams for his question and his very longstanding hard work representing those in his communities. I am delighted to be able to stand here and say today that this coalition government has delivered a highly successful round 1 of the Mobile Black Spot Program. There were 6,000 blackspots identified. Round 1 of this program has addressed 3,000 of those blackspots, with 499 towers delivering new or expanded coverage outside our communities. It is a fantastic achievement.
        </p>
        <p>
         This government is investing $220 million into improving the coverage of mobile phones across this nation. I can only say that is in stark contrast with those opposite, because when we look at what Labor did in terms of addressing blackspots and improving mobile phone coverage, it was absolutely nothing under the Rudd-Gillard government. Absolutely nothing. They delivered not one tower. They delivered not one tower and not one dollar. The contrast between those opposite—the previous Labor government—and what this coalition government is doing is amazing.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Auditor-General in the recent
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANAO" rel="nofollow">
          ANAO
         </a>
         report found that we will provide expanded coverage to 162,000 square kilometres. We are, overall in round 1, in partnership, delivering $385 million worth of investment. What did Labor deliver? Absolutely nothing. It is an indictment of the Labor government that they addressed this not once.

            I can indeed say that not only has this been an incredibly successful program in round one; it has also met its objective. Perhaps those opposite in the Labor Party might like to actually read the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANAO" rel="nofollow">
             ANAO
            </a>
            report into this, because clearly they have not. The Auditor-General found that
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            The department's approach to identifying mobile black spots was pragmatic.
           </p>
           <p>
            The ANAO went on:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            The key decisions in the assessment of proposals, including the awarding of points and compilation of the merit list were conducted by the department in accordance with the guidelines and were appropriately documented. The recommended list of proposed base stations to the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister was also consistent with the department’s assessment, merit-listing and application of the equitable distribution principles …
           </p>
           <p>
            Unlike what we saw previously from those who have not complied. Indeed, in the past there have been ANAO reports that were scathing of previous Labor ministers in this regard.

               I will take that interjection from Senator Carr saying, 'You have to turn it on.' We are turning them on; it is the Labor Party that never turned on one—not one. We are seeing them rolled out at Carlisle River, Deniliquin,
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke_Creek" rel="nofollow">
                Clarke Creek
               </a>
               , Ajana, Drake—the list goes on and on. The Labor Party cannot point to one town that has received better mobile phone coverage across the country under them, under the previous Labor government. It is an absolute indictment of them when we look at the comparisons: square kilometres of new coverage being delivered—by the coalition 162,000, Labor zero; black spots being fixed—3,000 under us, Labor zero; dollars invested while in government—by the coalition $220 million, Labor zero. I table the 499 base stations funded under round 1 and also the record of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd Labor government of mobile phone black spot delivery.
