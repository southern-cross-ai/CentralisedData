        My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Conroy. Can the minister update the Senate on international cooperation to address the global economic downturn? Will the minister outline the role Australia played in the recent G20 discussions?

         I thank Senator Hutchins for the question. We are facing the most serious global economic downturn since the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression" rel="nofollow">
          Great Depression
         </a>
         . The Rudd government understands this is a global problem, so we must do all we can internationally to contribute to a global solution. Last weekend G20 finance ministers met in London in preparation for the G20 leaders meeting early next month. Importantly, G20 finance ministers and central bank governors pledged to take whatever action is necessary until growth is restored and stated that they are committed to deliver the scale of sustained effort necessary to restore growth.

         They also endorsed a framework for dealing with the toxic assets that infect so many banks in the

         and Europe. Toxic assets on the balance sheets of large international banks are poisoning global credit flows and global growth. This framework has been put forward by Prime Minister Rudd and also the British government and we very much welcome its adoption by the international community. In addition, ministers agreed to substantial reform of the

            IMF

           , global leaders, industry groups and economists the world over all recognise the need for strong and decisive action to support growth. On 6 March, the IMF stated:

           … given the depth of the crisis, avoiding or postponing action is not a viable option …

The government has acted decisively to support economic activity through the $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy last October and the $42 billion Nation Building and Jobs Plan announced last month. Our action has been endorsed by the IMF, central banks, business groups and business economists. Most recently the

Can the minister explain how the government’s Fair Work legislation will improve the job security of Australian workers?

             The government’s new workplace relations system has been designed to serve Australia well in the good as well as the difficult economic times. The Fair Work Bill has been designed as a stable, simple, fair, flexible and productive workplace relations system for business. Working Australians do not want a return to
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_Choices" rel="nofollow">
              Work Choices
             </a>
             and they certainly do not want a return to Work Choices in the middle of a global recession. Work Choices allowed basic pay and conditions to be stripped away and meant that an employee could be sacked for no reason and without any entitlement to redundancy. That is what those opposite deliver and hanker after and are still championing to this day. This is not the kind of workplace relations system that would give Australians confidence in these difficult global times.
