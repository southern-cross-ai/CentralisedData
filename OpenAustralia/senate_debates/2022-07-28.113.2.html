            James Webster
           </a>
           spent his first years there before his family moved to a farm near Melbourne. After completing school, with two brothers at the war, he remained at home to manage the farm and serve in the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Training_Corps" rel="nofollow">
            Air Training Corps
           </a>
           before training in business and accountancy. After gaining some experience in other environments, he would join a timber, hardware and plumbing business founded by his grandfather that also undertook significant civil engineering projects.
          </p>
          <p>
           As I read the entry for James Webster in
           <i>
            The Biographical Dictionary of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Senate" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Senate
            </a>
           </i>
           , I was greatly encouraged. Following World War
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
            II
           </a>
           , and prior to joining the family business, he joined a firm of timber merchants and became a delegate to the Australian Timber Workers' Union, which, if I'm not mistaken, was a union that Senator Wong once worked for—and I'm just getting a nod: that is correct. Later, he worked as a tallyman on the wharves and became a member of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterside_Workers'_Federation" rel="nofollow">
            Waterside Workers' Federation
           </a>
           —another terrific organisation. What a sad thing that such a servant of the labour movement has passed away, I thought. So I was shocked to discover that when James Webster first entered the Senate, when he filled a casual vacancy in 1964, he was a member of the Country Party. He would go on to serve in the Senate as a member of that party until 1990. I cannot help but think that the Nationals today would be better served if they had more members from trade union backgrounds!
          </p>
          <p>
           He was also an elder of the Presbyterian church at the age of 21, the same denomination in which the father of former Labor senator
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Button" rel="nofollow">
            John Button
           </a>
           served as a moderator. But, in truth, James Webster had a strong Country Party pedigree, with his father briefly representing the party in the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_Legislative_Assembly" rel="nofollow">
            Victorian Legislative Assembly
           </a>
           , and himself joining as a member of the Young Country Party. He would later serve on the party's federal council. Entering the Senate, he spoke of how grateful he was to have the Country Party's support, and especially reflected on its policies 'aimed at maintaining a free-enterprise community with a minimum of control'. Given party leader Sir John 'Blackjack' McEwen was the foremost defender of the tariff wall, as trade minister now, I found those comments a little surprising.
          </p>
          <p>
           Like so many in his party, Webster walked both sides of the street, speaking about the importance of economic liberalism while staunchly advocating for government support for all manner of projects and schemes. Not much has changed. Bringing his business experience to the Senate meant he was interested in economic issues combined with an emphasis on the breadth of Australia's wealth created by primary industries. He spoke about the importance of recognising and supporting this. These latter comments are sentiments that I would endorse.
          </p>
          <p>
           When Webster was born his father was chairman of the local butter factory, so it was no wonder he lined up against the forces of margarine, which he thought would break the Australian dairy industry. Interestingly, in his first speech he also reflected on the growing availability of television and the need to ensure the production of Australian content. His support of the Australian film and television industry was something he would continue right throughout his career.
          </p>
          <p>
           He became embroiled in the coalition opposition's relentless constitutional attacks on the Whitlam government by seeking a High Court injunction to inhibit the joint sitting of both houses of parliament under section 57 of the Constitution following the 1974 simultaneous dissolution. The court did not find in his favour. Later, he found himself in the High Court for reasons not of his choosing, as his ongoing involvement in the familial timber and hardware business was called into question after it was awarded government contracts.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_High_Court" rel="nofollow">
            The High Court
           </a>
           found that his arrangements were not in breach of section 44 of the Constitution. This was a fortunate outcome for James Webster, not least because he was to become a minister in the Fraser government following Labor's defeat in 1975.
          </p>
          <p>
           James Webster served as a Minister for Science from 1975 until 1979, just before his retirement. In 1978 the environment was added to his ministerial responsibilities. He was fortunate to serve at a time at which there was great support within the government—and externally—for the advancement of scientific and environmental matters. Some of his signature achievements include multilateral progress in the Antarctic, a place in which he took a strong personal interest. He visited the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pole" rel="nofollow">
            South Pole
           </a>
           on two occasions, and Webster Bay, in the Australian territorial section of the continent, is named in his honour. He oversaw the restructuring of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
            CSIRO
           </a>
           , having a strong appreciation for its role in supporting rural industry. Kakadu was declared a national park during his time as minister. Whaling was banned in Australian waters. The
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef" rel="nofollow">
            Great Barrier Reef
           </a>
           Marine Park Authority came under federal control when Prime Minister Fraser placed a ban on petroleum exploration on the reef. The latter resolved an issue that had been the source of some difficulty for the minister and within the government.
          </p>
          <p>
           Concurrent with his time as minister, Webster was leader of the party in the Senate, having served as deputy leader in opposition during the term of the Whitlam government—intriguingly, at the same time as he was serving as
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_President" rel="nofollow">
            Deputy President
           </a>
           of the Senate and chair of committees. Faced with the prospect of a difficult election in 1980, James Webster offered to leave the Senate ahead of the election and became the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Commissioner" rel="nofollow">

            New Zealand
           </a>
           , a post in which he would serve for four years.
          </p>
          <p>
           James Webster was at times a contradiction: a business person who represented the Country Party; a farmer who became an environmental minister. Perhaps this is simply an illustration of the importance of a breadth of experience and ability for seeing different perspectives. This is something we can all take on board as we reflect on his life and service. The government expresses our condolences following the passing of the Hon. James Joseph Webster, and we convey our sympathies to his family and those who knew him well.

            </a>
            of the Senate for a period of almost two years, from early 1974 to the end of 1975, including a period as

             Acting President
            </a>
            . Jim was the Minister for Science and later the Minister for Science and the Environment for the Fraser government. He's remembered as an enthusiastic minister, relishing the new roles of science and the environment that had not been previously held by the Country Party. His achievements include most notably his work for the environment, for Australia's Antarctic research efforts, establishing the national marine science research centre in Hobart and the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
             CSIRO

            's Australian National Animal Health Laboratory at Geelong, which provided a world-class facility for the safe handling of exotic animal diseases, and his support for the fledgeling Australian film industry. One of the great achievements of Senator Webster was his work in ending pirate whaling. Often in the National Party, and previously the Country Party, as Senator Farrell has noted, what seems like being a contradiction is simply challenging stereotypes. And I don't think it's anything unusual for National Party or former Country Party senators to care about their environment and, when they have the opportunity as ministers in this place, to make pragmatic changes to our environmental system and efforts. He was instrumental in introducing the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean" rel="nofollow">

            whale sanctuary. Greens senators please take note: we want to achieve actual environmental outcomes, not merely virtue signalling.
           </p>
           <p>
            I wish to place on the record to the Senate a brief account of Senator Webster's formative years. Jim's family moved from Tasmania to a farm near Melbourne when he was four years old, and later, whilst a student at
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caulfield_Grammar" rel="nofollow">
             Caulfield Grammar
            </a>
            , he found himself running the family farm whilst his older brothers served in World War
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
             II
            </a>
            . In what was a clear desire to serve his country, Jim joined the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Training_Corps" rel="nofollow">
             Air Training Corps
            </a>

After the war and further study primarily in accounting, Jim joined a firm of timber merchants and became a delegate of the Australian Timber Workers Union—we love our forestry industry.

            Jim's father had served three years in the Victorian parliament, and Jim became active in the Australian Country Party, ultimately leading to his nomination in 1964 to fill a casual vacancy in the Senate. Reports suggest Jim was very much reflective of the breed of fresh-faced senators keen to put their stamp on this chamber, becoming a member of many committees and vocal in support of rural and regional areas of Victoria and more broadly across Australia. The dairy industry was the focus of perhaps his strongest and fiercest support, with Jim explaining to anyone who'd listen in the margarine industry that was seeking to break the Australian dairy sector. He rallied against dubious advertising of the margarine industry, such that one Labor senator referred to him as 'the honourable senator for margarine'.

            Jim became embroiled in events which ended in the dismissal. He was one of two senators who asked the

            to stop a joint sitting of both houses voting on a group of bills that had been the catalyst for the 1974 double-dissolution election. The bid failed, with the court ruling that the government of the day could stockpile bills that failed to pass the Senate before proceeding to a double-dissolution election.
