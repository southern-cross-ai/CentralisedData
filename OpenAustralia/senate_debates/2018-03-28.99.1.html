         OECD

        Development Assistance Committee 2018 peer review of Australia, published this week, on Tuesday, has found that cuts to Australia's international development budget have impacted on Australia's international profile and reputation and that 'Australia now needs to restore its official development assistance'. Since 2013, the Abbott-Turnbull government has slashed Australia's international development budget by well over $11 billion. Can the minister confirm that, under the Turnbull government, Australia's total spend on international development assistance is projected to fall to 0.2 per cent of gross national income by 2020-21? That's the lowest level since records were first kept.

It's a bit rich for the opposition to come in here and attack our overseas development assistance. When you were last in government, $750 million was diverted out of the overseas development assistance budget to pay for your blowout in border protection. You became the third largest recipient of your own overseas development assistance program, and this meant that assistance was cut to 25 developing countries, includingâ€”

               The Australian overseas development assistance program remains focused on delivering high-quality results within the budget determined by the government. The government does not support a prescriptive time-bound aid target as a percentage of

               Those opposite don't like to hear this, but I will go on. They were, when they were in government, the third largest recipient of their own aid budget. This meant 25 developing countries, including very small Pacific island states, had their assistance budgets cut. They cut the emergency humanitarian assistance fund by $30 million. But let me go back to the last federal election. They promised to increase the aid budget byâ€”
