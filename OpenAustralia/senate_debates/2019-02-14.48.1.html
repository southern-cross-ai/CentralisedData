       <p class="italic">
        In my maiden speech, I made a commitment to introduce a private senator's bill to abolish the student services and amenities fee.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This bill would deliver on that commitment by repealing the
        <i>
         Higher Education Legislation Amendment (Student Services and Amenities) Act 2011,
        </i>
        thereby abolishing the compulsory student services and amenities fee (S

        to abolish the Student Amenities (SA-

        The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSAF" rel="nofollow">
         SSAF
        </a>
        is a $303 compulsory tax, levied on over one million university students annually.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The SSAF is one of the few forcibly collected taxes, which is neither administered by the Commonwealth nor subject to thorough government oversight.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But it should be called out for what it really is: a Labor-Greens Trojan Horse on the way back to compulsory student unionism.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It flies in the face of the fundamental principles that we fight for: the liberty of the individual, a free market, small government and low taxes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        $303 may not seem like much money to politicians in this building, but it is for students. For example, with $303 a typical university student could buy: two weeks of rent; 505 packets of noodles; 3,060 pens; 161 cans of

        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The SSAF is unfair, unpopular, undemocratic, unnecessary, burdensome, politicised and wasteful.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is unfair because it is levied on all students, regardless of their need, willingness and ability to access the services and activities they are paying for.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is unpopular because students don't believe they are getting value for money and they want SSAF either abolished or given a say in the matter.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is undemocratic because students don't have a say in how their money is spent.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is unnecessary because, as student-run organisations in Queensland have shown, you don't need compulsory student fees to run a successful student association that provides a wide range of services and activities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is burdensome because it further increases an already significant burden of student debt.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is politicised because it continues to provide left-wing student politicians and activists an opportunity to misuse students' money on political causes and campaigns that most of students don't support.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is wasteful because there is a long and ignoble history of compulsory fees being wasted by student politicians who can't help themselves when given a big bucket of someone else's money.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If this bill passes, higher education providers will remain free to levy fees for student services and amenities, should they wish to, but the payment of such a fee will no longer be compulsory.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The amendments contained within this bill are straightforward, and allows for any outstanding transitional matters to be dealt with by the relevant Minister.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is an important reform long overdue. I commend the bill to the Senate.
       </p>
       <p>
        I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted; debate adjourned.
