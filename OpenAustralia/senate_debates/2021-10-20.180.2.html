        [by video link] Good health is something many of us once took for granted, but the coronavirus pandemic the world has lived through over the past 18 months has forced us all to take stock of our health and wellbeing. To some it has been a distraction, and regular health checks may have gone by the wayside. That's why it is important that we all take extra care to keep those appointments and have any medical concerns that we do have checked out.
       </p>

        October is both
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_Cancer_Awareness_Month" rel="nofollow">
         Breast Cancer Awareness Month
        </a>
        and Dyslexia Awareness Month, and tonight I would like to touch on both. Many of us are familiar with the pink ribbon that signifies breast cancer awareness. Despite our familiarity with the pink symbol and our unwavering support for breast cancer events, breast cancer remains the most common cancer diagnosed in Australian women, with one in seven likely to be diagnosed in their lifetime. It is also one that my family is all too familiar with.
       </p>
       <p>
        The good news is that survival rates continue to improve in Australia, with 91 out of every 100 women diagnosed with breast cancer now surviving for five or more years beyond diagnosis. One key factor in these positive survival rates is early detection, which also opens up more treatment options. The Cancer Council estimates that, in Australia, nearly 20,000 women and around 164 men will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year. It is important, for both women and men, to look for breast changes and to see a doctor if you notice anything unusual. Do not ignore the signs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another condition that benefits from early diagnosis is dyslexia. The Australian Dyslexia Association explains it as 'a persistent difficulty with reading and spelling', defining it as 'a specific learning difference that is neurobiological in origin'. The association says dyslexia 'is characterised by challenges with accurate and/or fluent single word decoding and word recognition', and there can also be difficulties with spelling.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dyslexia affects 10 per cent of the Australian population; however, the actual figure could be higher, as many individuals are not identified. Even with early intervention, dyslexia can remain a challenge throughout life. It can impact reading comprehension and experience, impede vocabulary growth and background knowledge, and cause social and emotional issues. Children with dyslexia learn in different ways, often excelling in other areas like creative thinking and leadership.

        are just some of the creative and innovative Australians who have been diagnosed with dyslexia. Jackie French wrote a letter to fellow dyslexics, urging them not to give up: 'Reading helps you understand your world, yourself and what you and the world one day may become.'
       </p>
       <p>
        This month I urge my Senate colleagues to help spread awareness of breast cancer and dyslexia in their communities. It is through those conversations that we learn more and share that knowledge.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now I want to take you back to where I started: the global coronavirus pandemic. After a long run with no COVID-19 cases, Tasmania has been in the news in recent weeks owing to two people breaching quarantine, spending time in the community and testing positive to the virus. Tasmanian residents stepped up and got tested and vaccinated in record numbers, knowing that vaccinations are the best way to protect themselves and their communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the past 24 hours, Australia has passed the total of 32 million vaccine doses administeredâ€”that is, 85 per cent of the eligible population aged 16 and over are now protected with at least a first dose. Pleasingly, both nationally and in my home state of Tasmania, today we have reached full vaccination of 70 per cent of those aged 16 and over.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to thank each and every Australian who has been vaccinated, and I urge those who haven't to make an appointment today. It is also worth noting that a variety of treatments have been secured by the government for COVID-19, in the form of oral antiviral drugs and intravenous treatments. These medicines will help protect those who contract COVID-19, but they do not replace vaccination. Quite simply, vaccinations are the way out of this pandemic.
       </p>
       <p>
        Special acknowledgement and my sincere thanks go to our health workers at hospitals,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        clinics, pharmacies and community and mobile clinics, who have worked tirelessly to ensure as many people are vaccinated as possible. None of this could have happened without their incredible dedication. Let's work together to reach our vaccination target so we can regain normality in our lives and reunite with our families and friends, and please do not overlook those other regular health checks. They are important too.
