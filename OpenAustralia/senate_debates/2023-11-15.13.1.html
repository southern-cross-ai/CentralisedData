         The opposition will not be supporting these amendments moved by the government, which have only been circulated in recent times, despite having been recommended over five months ago. These amendments should not need to be moved, because the promise should not have been broken in the first place. As coalition senators have noted, the legislation before the committee includes a very, very significant broken promise on behalf of the government. On multiple occasions before the election, the Prime Minister promised that there would be no changes to the rules around franking credits. These amendments change those rules and constitute a broken promise on behalf of the government. The opposition will not support the Prime Minister breaking an election promise that impacts retirees, mum-and-dad investors and small businesses.

              , as added by this Part, applies in relation to breaches that occur on or after the commencement of this Part.
             </p>
             <p>
              This amendment is the first legislation to deal with some of important issues that have arisen since the PwC scandal broke. Since that scandal began to unfold, Australians have come to much better understand the power of big consultants and their literally incredible influence on our tax advice and consultancy sector, as well as their huge reach into our public sector, government decision-making and so many activities of government. The size and expansion of big consultants has introduced new risks to our tax administration system, which the PwC debacle has revealed. We've seen in too many places the capture and taming of regulatory machinery, with the voice of the big four too often dominating processes of decision-making, creating very significant conflicts of interest and hobbling regulation.
             </p>
             <p>
              This amendment aims to begin the processes of unwinding that capture and those conflicts, to get those who are being regulated off the regulatory bodies. We Greens have secured government agreement to improve the system of tax administration and ensure its independence and its pursuit of the public interest to make sure it's not captive to big consultants. We need to remove both real conflicts of interest and the appearance of conflicts of interest. To that end, our amendments restrict membership of the Tax Practitioners Board to community members without vested interests.
             </p>
             <p>
              Our amendment will ensure that partners from the big four are banned from sitting on the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPB" rel="nofollow">
               TPB
              </a>
              . The TPB regulates the tax advisory industry and has the power to deregister tax advisers who engage in serious misconduct.
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greens" rel="nofollow">
               The Greens
              </a>
              amendment will ban any senior executives or partners currently working at a tax firm with more than 100 employees, or with ongoing financial links to large tax firms, from being members of the Tax Practitioners Board. Through this amendment, we're fixing the loophole that allows big consultants to regulate themselves. Through our amendment, the remaining former PwC partner on the TPB will not be able to be reappointed. We will have members of the Tax Practitioners Board who are not financially tied to those same large tax agents they are regulating.
             </p>
             <p>
              The amendment also requires tax agents not only to report to the TPB if they've breached the code of professional conduct but also to report if another agent has breached the code. This is an important amendment to prevent partners protecting other partners and turning a blind eye to unethical behaviour. It widens the responsibility for unethical behaviour from the individual to others that are aware of their behaviour. This is what happened in the PwC tax scandal. If tax agents do not report such unethical behaviour, they can now be penalised. Hopefully, this means we will not be sitting here in the years ahead trying to unpick unethical tax behaviour, who did it, who was party to it, who knew about it and who did nothing to stop it. Hopefully, the whistle will be blown early, loudly and more often. Whenever someone does the wrong thing and others have witnessed it, it will be blown.
             </p>
             <p>
              If we've learned anything from the PwC tax scandal, it's that we need to pay much closer attention to the regulation of the professional services sector in general and tax advisers in particular. The Australian public will no longer tolerate self-regulation and the capture of regulatory machinery. They want it to work fairly, ethically and in the public interest, with penalties for those who do the wrong thing.
             </p>
             <p>
              We thank the Labor government and, in particular, the Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Services,

               Stephen Jones
              </a>
              , and his staff, for his willingness to reach agreement with us on these important changes. The minister has also agreed to use his new legislative powers to implement some important changes to the tax practitioners code of professional conduct, to make sure they properly capture and describe behaviour that assists an ethical and effective tax advisory system upheld by all who work in this field. I commend this amendment to the Senate. I'm confident it's a positive and powerful step in the right direction.

But, Senator Pocock, if I might just inquire about matters of consultation, can you share with the Senate chamber which industry stakeholders you have consulted on this amendment and their view or views?

                 Through our inquiry, there's been very wide discussion with a broad range of community representatives about the changes that are proposed here, and I've certainly had extensive correspondence in relation to this. I think there's a high level of support for responding to the specific issues that have arisen in relation to PwC, and there is strong endorsement of seeing elimination of perceived conflicts of interest and actual conflicts of interest. Certainly, in the evidence that our inquiry has taken from all of the big four, there is a strong commitment to seeing ethical practice, more transparency and governance that the Australian community can have confidence in.

                            Thank you. To Senator Pocock, just to be clear: in the amendment there is reference to obligations to notify of significant breaches of the code of professional conduct. With regard to that, can you confirm that a registered tax agent will not have to report a breach if they read about it in a newspaper or a news story?

                             My understanding is that it is when a partner, a senior official or anyone in that tax agency has knowledge of something which would be in breach of the code of conduct that they should give that advice to the relevant agency. I imagine that, if the matter is public, that is in a different category, because it would be widely known. When we look at the matter that evolved within PwC, we see that, clearly, a significant breach of ethics had occurred behind closed doors and was not available to public scrutiny.

The amendments by the Greens will receive further scrutiny on how they are implemented.

                                   now makes its decisions based on the areas and the people that it consults with. Clearly, it already does that, and it will continue to do so.

                                     Firstly, I don't agree with the senator's assumption on any of those fronts. This was clearly a concern raised through our Senate process, Senator, and you know that. I think it's important to put on the record not only what the Greens have done but also what Senator O'Neill has done in terms of the inquiry that took place under the procedures of this house—that something had to change. This amendment has gone through the minister's office. It's gone through this Senate in terms of the second reading speech. If anything, I want to understand: are you not supporting this amendment? Is that what's happening here?

                                           As Senator Pocock has said, there have been many discussions on the inquiry itself and the minister's role. I'll certainly put on the record that I'm happy to bring that back from the minister's office in terms of those organisations. But we are, on this side of the chamber, very satisfied that this amendment will make the appropriate adjustments that are required as per the process that we followed through the Senate inquiry.

I've already put on the record, through the response and the second reading speech, why that is the case. We're here, and we're just waiting for your response to it.

                                                      To be fair, I think it is an answer such that Treasury officials will be well aware of whether they have consulted with significant stakeholders like the ones I have mentioned. So, my question, again, is: has the government or has the Treasury consulted with these particular organisations or others since the release of this amendment?

This is a very good amendment that has been brought forward as a result of our Senate inquiries. We all sit on different Senate inquiries, and I think we're pretty proud of the work that is done in terms of research on those and the witnesses who come forward. So, I do caution you, Senator, in terms of the words you're using to imply that something else has taken place here. This is an important amendment. Your questions only show that perhaps you don't agree with this amendment and that perhaps you're not as outraged as we on the government side have been about the behaviour of PwC.

                                                          One of the key measures we need to take is to assure the Australian public that there is no potential conflict of interest on a regulatory body like the Tax Practitioners Board, which regulates tax agents. They need confidence that those who are regulated are not represented on that board. That is what this measure does. So I am surprised that you would not see merit in strengthening that regulatory provision and ensuring that very large tax organisations and their businesses are not supported by members. It's not just recusing themselves from meetings where they're actual agents and their behaviour is being discussed. It is actually ensuring that the practice, the culture and the general meetings that are held by the Tax Practitioners Board are seen to be above conflict and actually behave in ways that are above conflict. That is what this amendment does, and I'm surprised that you're questioning the specific measures that are being proposed in this amendment.

                                                           Thank you very much, Senator Pocock. There is no need for surprise. Good ideas that are poorly legislated are in no-one's interest. That is the first point. The second point is that coalition senators absolutely support the characterisation of Senator Colbeck's contribution in the committee work that you and Senator O'Neill and others have done. The discussion here is on a committee stage of a bill, which, to be fair to the
                                                           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">

                                                           , they utilise with great effect to interrogate particular policy positions and particular legislative amendments. That is what I am doing here, because in the short exchange we have had we have found that there could be very high risk that your very good and noble idea is poorly legislated or, worse, is not given the priority of the further scrutiny process. So, Senator Pocock, in all fairness, what the coalition is doing here is scrutinising what could be a good and noble idea to make sure that, when translated into legislation, it does what you expect it to do. That is the first point. The second is that, if the government had been able to come to the chamber and say to Senator Smith, 'We have consulted with this group, this group and this group; these were the dates and these were the outcomes,' then there would be a much higher level of confidence. They have not been able to do that.
                                                          </p>

                                                           The scrutiny process that I am engaging in is necessary, is proper and is quite separate and distinct from what we all know, what we've all seen and what we're all equally outraged by, in regard to the work of the Senate references committee on the PwC scandal. This is quite a separate matter. I do not apologise for one moment if the coalition wants to satisfy itself that this has been properly and thoroughly consulted on, because, if it hasn't been and there are unintended consequences through the further scrutiny process, the government will have to come back here. The other thing, if I could say this—
                                                          </p>
                                                          <p>
                                                           I see Senator McKim mocking. Well, the Australian Greens have had a pretty poor track record when it comes to dealing with the government and the government honouring its commitments to the Australian people.
                                                          </p>
                                                          <p>
                                                           Senator McKim, you'd have to agree with me on that point. But that's not the substantive matter. We want to satisfy ourselves—and it's a very fair request—that this has been more than a deal. We want to make sure it's been thoroughly canvassed and properly scrutinised and enjoys the support of stakeholders beyond this chamber. Thus far, I've not been able to satisfy myself that that's the case.

Firstly, when this question is put shortly, we will find out whether the Liberal and National parties in this place are going to go in to bat for the big consultants regulating themselves and the big corporations in the tax advisory sector actually regulating themselves, so the fox running amok in the henhouse. That's what we are about to find out. When Senator Smith says that the normal practice of the opposition is to form a position after inquiries at the committee stages, that is most emphatically not the case. In the overwhelming majority of situations, Senator Smith well knows that the opposition have formed a view well before they get into the committee stages of any particular piece of legislation. This will be the test, and it is coming up, I believe, in the next few minutes.
                                                            </p>
                                                            <p>
                                                             We know that the Australian Greens and the government are actually going to take the first legislative step in response to what has been a disgraceful scandal regarding the behaviour of one individual, but behaviour that is symptomatic of an entire sector, the big four consultants. This behaviour was exposed by this Senate. The business model of these consulting firms is based on things like conflicts of interest and effectively insider trading. We are about to find out whether the opposition is going to back in business as usual, which has appalled and shocked millions of Australians, as the revelations have rolled out through the inquiries of this Senate and through some very good public interest journalism in this regard. We're about to find out whether the opposition is going to back in good governance and significant steps towards abolishing not just perceived conflicts of interest but actual conflicts of interest. The test is coming up now, and this will be the key for the opposition. We're about to find out whose side they're on. Are they on the side of the Australian people and good governance or are they in the pockets of the big corporations?

                                                                 </p>

                                                                  In the final two amendments in the committee stage of this Treasury laws amendment bill the opposition will be seeking to repeal schedule 4, which is the subject of amendment on sheet 2038, and then seeking to repeal schedule 5, which is the subject of sheet 2043. In doing so we are trying to do a big favour—a very, very big favour—for the government, and that is to stop it from going down the path of breaking another promise. This is not an ordinary promise. It is a promise that was made by Mr Albanese, now the Prime Minister, when he was opposition leader and a promise that was made by Dr Chalmers as the Treasurer. Before we get to the broken promises that are the core of this Treasury laws amendment bill, I will remind you of two other promises.
                                                                 </p>

                                                                  In August 2022 Mr Albanese as Prime Minister made this promise. He said that the Australian people deserve accountability and transparency and not secrecy. Unfortunately, in the previous amendments, on sheet 2161, moved by Senator Barbara Pocock and agreed to by the government, we got a glimpse of some of that secrecy. The opposition did not oppose the principle of what was contained in Senator Pocock's amendment—not at all. In fact, we agree with the principle that sits behind the amendment. But what was demonstrated in that very, very brief committee stage was that Senator Pocock and the
                                                                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
                                                                   Australian Greens
                                                                  </a>

What does that mean? That means it could go wrong. That means it could not be as perfect as Senator Pocock and others would like it to be. Why did we have some concerns about that consultation process and why did we want to draw it out in the committee stage? It was because the industry associations themselves had said that they were surprised about the amendment. It came as a surprise.

It is a committee process that is still ongoing—I am happy to stand corrected; Senator Colbeck is in the chamber. For those in this chamber who agree that the Senate process is one of the standout features of our parliamentary democracy, what we just saw was a group of people say: 'We'll just take this out of the process. We're not going to consult with anyone. We're going to drop it into the Senate and we're going to legislate it.' In further questions the government they couldn't even say whether the scrutiny process to give effect to this would be expedited. From Senator Pratt's contribution—reading between the lines—it could possibly go wrong. Really? We have a thorough Senate committee process. We have engagement with stakeholders on a broad range of issues, but on this particular issue some key stakeholders—the Institute of Public Accountants,

On three separate occasions, the Prime Minister said there would be no changes of this kind brought to the parliament. In January 2021, the Prime Minister, when he was the opposition leader, promised not to make any changes to franking credits. Remember? He did that because he remembers all too well that Australians rejected the former opposition leader

So the Prime Minister, when he was the opposition leader, said, 'The best way to protect myself and the best way to protect my party is to give a commitment that we won't touch it.' And he gave that commitment in January 2021. Then, on 30 March in 2021, the Prime Minister, as opposition leader, thought: 'I better give it to the Australian electorate again. Let me give them that commitment again just in case they haven't heard me.' He said on ABC radio that Labor won't have any changes to the franking credits regime. In March 2022, Treasurer Chalmers was on ABC radio in Perth, in my home state of

                                                                 </p>

Prime Minister Albanese, when he was the opposition leader, knew exactly what he was doing. This was not about tax. It was about raising taxes, but it wasn't about trying to give Australians a degree of comfort around tax issues and franking credits. It was a political ploy to remove one barnacle from their possible re-election—the issue of franking credits that had caused them so much harm in the 2019 election. He said: 'We'll fix this. We'll go out there not once, not twice but three times.' Then Dr Chalmers goes out there and says, 'We won't touch franking credits.' And many retirees and mum-and-dad investors thought: 'Great! What a relief. Labor has learnt the lessons from the 2019 election.' How wrong were Australian voters! How wrong were they to have trusted

How remarkable! If you read the excellent dissenting report that Senator Bragg wrote you will see page upon page of evidence from people saying that this will harm them, and it will harm them at a time when they're feeling most vulnerable with regard to their financial situation because of the cost-of-living crisis—because of interest rate rises and inflation. We think that every election commitment should be honoured, but, when I think about all of the election commitments that this government has broken in just 17 months, I would think that this is probably the election commitment that they should absolutely keep because it will take the financial pressure off retirees and mum-and-dad investors. If the Australian Greens and the crossbench let the government get away by legislating this broken promise, it will just give the government permission to break other promises or even to make promises and break them—if this Senate chamber is not going to stand up and say, 'We're not going to have it.' And the best way you hold Labor accountable is by supporting the opposition's position to repeal schedules 4 and 5.

One is in relation to the fact that the government said that it would not touch franking credits. That was a clear election commitment, and we can add that to the now growing list of broken promises of this government of broken promises. This government promised a $275 reduction in power prices, higher real wages and now, on top of those and a number of other things, the promise that it would not touch franking credits. This government is clearly now a government of broken promises. This government also promised to govern through proper process and, as we saw through the last amendment, that clearly has not happened. We will see at the end of this amendment the test of the deal that was done between Labor and the Greens on the last amendment. I have to say I find it completely objectionable that my name would be taken, as it was in the chamber during the debate on the last amendment—

The fact is that I am as outraged, as are Senator Pocock and everyone else on that committee and, I think, everyone else in this chamber, about the behaviour of PwC, but that that then translates to a simple agreement with the Greens for a solution does not fly.

I object to the fact that my name has been taken, and that because I am outraged, which I am, at the behaviour of PwC, that naturally translates to agreement with the Greens solution. It clearly has been shown that neither the government nor the Greens consulted with anybody in the design of that amendment. Nobody was consulted. They found out about it in the paper, like everybody else. The government and the Greens have done a deal. It is a broken promise of the government for good governance, Senator McKim, quite simply. The Finance and Public Administration References Committee has not completed its inquiry. It has made no recommendations, so the sense from the minister or anyone else in this chamber that this has been through some committee process and that is a rationale for the amendment that was just passed is false.

                                                                      </p>

It has made no recommendations in relation to what might happen with the Tax Practitioners Board. It may very well make recommendations. I very much appreciate the cooperative nature of the work on the committee by Senator Pocock, Senator O'Neill and Senator Pratt, which is shown in the way we are working through the issues here. We worked very closely together on dealing with this important matter. But we have made no recommendations, so any suggestion that this amendment came out of a committee process, particularly the one that I am chairing, is false. I find it outrageous that the government have to take on notice the question as to whether they have spoken to any of the bodies that Senator Smith mentioned, which are key bodies in the accounting profession. The fact the government couldn't answer that question effectively is the answer to the question. There has been no consultation, and there should have been. This is a very serious matter. The governance of the tax and accounting system through the Tax Practitioners Board is a very serious matter, and it warrants being done properly. It does warrant being done properly.
                                                                      </p>

We will be considering this matter as a part of our continued work, as we should. But I reject out of hand any reflection that, because I'm outraged, we should adopt the Greens' solution. I do make the point that this government has a record of breaking promises, which grows as we pass through every week. I've named a couple of them today. We're just about to add another two to the process through the amendments that we just passed. The test on another one will come when we come to the vote on this amendment. The two are joined at the hip as part of the deal; there's no question about that in my mind.
                                                                      </p>

                                                                       The government should consider very carefully the words of Senator Smith when he said that we are trying to protect them from themselves in breaking yet another promise when we get to the vote on this particular amendment that the opposition has put forward. The government promised that it would have a proper cabinet and consultation process. It clearly didn't. It needs to lift its game in that sense. The important matter of the regulation of the accounting and tax professions through the Tax Practitioners Board should not be a matter of clandestine deals done out the back without anybody in the profession knowing. Quite frankly, the government should be ashamed of themselves for not going through a proper process so that, as Senator Smith quite rightly said, we can get the right outcome, which is what those of us sitting around the table in the committee genuinely want in the provision of oversight of these professions that are so important to the operation of so many of our corporations in this country. It's not the matter for a backroom deal. It's a matter for a proper consultation process, and the fact that the government can't say when the consultations were or even what the consultation process will be is a complete indictment of what they've done on this particular matter.

I do think it's important that that is placed on the record. I would also like to respond to the allegations he made in relation to our process on this.

I think the allegations that reflect on the minister's conduct in this need to be withdrawn. There was certainly nothing spurious about the way this was processed and handled. I put on the record that I reject that outright, Chair.
                                                                        </p>

We certainly stand by the imputation system and franking credits. They will remain completely intact. This measure will not affect the tax treatment of regular dividends, and the overwhelming majority of shareholders will be unaffected by these measures.
                                                                        </p>

I do not have those with me. I have said—and I put it on the record here in the Senate—that they will be brought forward to you. There is nothing being hidden here, and I reject that outright. Obviously, through the Senate inquiry we've heard the concerns. At no point did I say that the Senate inquiry had been completed. We heard concerns that further targeting of the measure would be beneficial. In response to these concerns, we've done what we have done here today.

Treasury have said that the costing difference in the budget arises from the imputation system operating as intended in the absence of contrived arrangements. What is the current costing for the forward estimates?

I guess what I'm trying to understand is why there is a costing of $10 million each year when the Treasury department had said, during the committee hearing into the bill, that, in their words, 'There aren't any cases of this.'

Treasury is specifically on the record saying that the measure would continue to protect future revenue at risk if the government did not legislate this measure and that existing legislation is not adequate. They note that, if there weren't that legislation, it would send a signal that the behaviour that had been witnessed before the alert issued in 2016 could be allowed to resume. So, yes, we are looking at it in its entirety from here to 2016, and the fact that that loophole was never closed is why we're standing here today.

As I said, the Liberal government announced that they were going to close this loophole. If the government indicated that it would never be legislated, then the activity would likely start again. If you're concerned that there hasn't been any data for seven years, you'd have to take that up with the member for Cook in the other place.

Do you think there is a risk that this costing, given it's based on such ancient data, is not going to be right, particularly given the uncertainty about the way that the drafting of the bill stands and given the considerable stakeholder concern about whether it has a wider application? What is your view, for the record, about the likelihood that this particular costing is in fact not an accurate and contemporaneous costing?
