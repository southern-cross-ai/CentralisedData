        My question is to the Minister for Finance, Senator Cormann. On Monday, the minister told the Senate, 'We are absolutely committed to taking business tax cuts to the next election.' Yesterday, the minister told the Senate that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Of course we want to take the company tax cuts, legislated as an important part of our economic achievement, to the next election.
       </p>
       <p>
        Will the minister guarantee that, regardless of whether the government is able to legislate its enterprise tax plan in this term of the parliament, the government will take its full enterprise tax plan to the next election?

         As I was listening to my reported remarks, I thought to myself that I couldn't have put that better myself! I can confirm that of course we are absolutely committed to getting this very important economic reform passed through the parliament this fortnight. That is because we care about the future opportunity for Australian families to get ahead. We care about Australian families being able to get a good job or a better job, to build a career here in Australia and to get better wages over time. We understand that the future success of families around Australia is dependent on the future viability, competitiveness and success of businesses that employ them and pay their wages.

           I know the minister is worried about being rolled, but there was one question. It is the question he is avoiding. Will this minister guarantee, regardless of whether he is able to legislate the enterprise tax plan in this term, that the government will take the full plan to the next election? That is the question he is avoiding. I'd ask him to answer it.

            As senators know, I cannot instruct a minister how to answer a question as long as they are directly relevant to it. You've reminded the minister of your question, and he has a minute and 13 seconds remaining to answer.

             Straightaway, in the point of order, there it is again: the politics, the cockiness that is starting to come in. Labor think they already have the next election won.

                                 He might think they're all great, and I know that he listens to everybody, but I didn't ask him anything about that. I just asked him whether or not he agreed with Senator Molan's criticism of the government's tax plan, which was, 'We're making a rod for our own back.' That's the only question I asked.

                                   Let me be very clear: I don't agree with the characterisation of Senator Molan's comments that Senator Wong has just provided to the chamber. Let me reassure Senator Wong again: every single Liberal and National Party member and senator is committed to securing the passage of this important reform this sitting fortnight for working families around Australia, and if the Senate cared about working families around Australia then it would support it.
