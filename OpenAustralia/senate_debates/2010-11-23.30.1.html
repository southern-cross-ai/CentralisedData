        The international education sector has faced significant challenges in the last 12 months.  In response to this, in June 2009 the Prime Minister, in her former capacity as Minister for Education, announced that she was bringing forward a review of the ESOS legislative framework to ensure that international students have a positive experience and the international education quality meets the high standards expected in Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The inability to respond to these recommendations in the Spring 2010 sittings would mean that the momentum gained from the Government’s proactive initiative of bringing forward the ESOS Review will be lost.

        The first quarterly payment of the Child Care Rebate for 2010–11 will be made to families by Centrelink from 18 October 2010. With the bill on hold, the 1 July 2010 indexation of the Child Care Rebate annual cap has occurred. Passage of the bill will ensure that no over-payment of the Child Care Rebate entitlement is made to families.

        Health Insurance Amendment (Pathology Requests) Bill 2010
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Purpose of the Bill
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To improve patient choice by amending legislative restrictions relating to pathology request forms.

 Under the
        <i>
         Health Insurance Act 1973
        </i>
        , a Medicare benefit is not payable for a pathology service unless the service is rendered pursuant to a written request from the patient’s treating practitioner.

 A Medicare benefit is generally not payable unless the patient attends the pathology provider named on the request form.

 This restriction would be removed, allowing patients to take a request form to any pathology provider of their choice.

        <b>
         Reasons for Urgency
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill gives effect to a 2009-10 Budget measure which was announced to commence from 1 July 2010.

 
Passage in the Spring sittings is necessary for timely implementation of the new arrangements
.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If the Bill is not passed in the Spring sittings, implementation will be delayed.
 Increased patient choice is intended to encourage pathology providers to compete on price and convenience for patients, and if the Bill is not passed in the Spring sittings these benefits will be delayed.
