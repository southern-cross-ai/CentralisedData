        President, the first duty of any Australian government is to keep people safe, to keep Australians safe. The failure we are seeing from those opposite is a shameful failure. We have seen one of the greatest bungles with one of the most serious consequences. This government has mishandled the rulings of the High Court, the case when it was before the court and its responses to it with grievous consequences that have now endangered the lives of Australians, seeing the types of circumstances unfold that had been foreshadowed from the moment this matter became public. It has been a case of failure upon failure upon failure by the Albanese Labor government in its handling of this matter. Failure in the court case itself, where the government allowed government to speak out of both sides of its mouth. It had the

          while the government ran alternate case. Indeed, the government apparently telling the court that it could not repatriate the individual who was the subject of the case while potentially receiving advice that perhaps it could repatriate them—undermining the case that it could have run.
         </p>
         <p>
          Then of course, on the day of judgement handed down by the court, we had the government release the one individual and say they would wait to receive the statement of reasons before doing anything else. But what did they do? They failed again. They failed to stick to what they said they would do.

          An opposition senator: That's right.

          They said they'd wait, but they started the release—and release and release and release—until more than 100 individuals had been released across Australia. And let's remember: these individuals—murderers, rapists, child sex offenders, paedophiles—these are individuals—

             <p>
              I'm perfectly relaxed, President. On the day of the judgement, the government said it would wait but, instead, it didn't take its own advice—it didn't do as it said it would do—it just went on and released individual, after individual, after individual, who it was known posed a threat to the Australian community. In this place, and in the other place, we saw the government face questions from Mr Dutton, from Senator Cash and from Senator Paterson about the risks that these individuals posed, but the government couldn't stick to its own decision; it couldn't detain them and await the statement of reasons. Instead, it proceeded to release them.
             </p>
             <p>
              Then what did we see from this government, that had failed in its handling of the case and had failed on the day of, and on the days following, the statement of reasons? We saw them bring legislation to this parliament—legislation that, again, reflected calls the opposition had made for the government to look, where these individuals had been released, at how they could be tracked and followed, and what steps could be taken. What did the government do? It released the legislation at breakfast time. At 8 am the opposition were given briefings on that legislation. And what did we do in response to it? We went away and had a look to see whether we could make it tougher. The government went out publicly, and said, 'This is as tough as it gets!' That was at breakfast time. Guess what? By lunchtime they had accepted all the amendments from the opposition—all six amendments from the opposition to make the legislation tougher were accepted by lunchtime by the Albanese government.
             </p>
             <p>
              So they failed in the case's handling, failed in the immediate response and failed in the first package of legislation. We're now having to work through further packages of legislation with this government. We are taking the diligence and time to try to ensure that it is done thoroughly. It is so critical for the opposition to keep a check on this government, because they're not up to it! And they've shown they're not up to it time and time again. Minister Giles and Minister O'Neil clearly demonstrated that they're not up to it, which is why Prime Minister Albanese should at last show some leadership and sack these hopeless ministers—

                   Thank you, Senator Hughes, resume your seat! May I remind senators that when you stand on a point of order it is not your opportunity to make a statement. You simply make your point of order and resume your seat. Senator Ayres I didn't hear if you made a slur but if you did I ask you to withdraw it.

                              So it has been fail, after fail, after fail by the Albanese government and the consequences are now home, that Australians have faced the reality of a sexual assault being undertaken and of other threats being posed. These ministers should be sacked and this government should go.

                               The government will not support this suspension motion moved by Senator Birmingham. I'll come to the substance of the motion that he has moved, but this is primarily because we have agreed on a program for today. It is set out and, in fact, those opposite are eating into the time that they requested for the debate on infrastructure this morning, which they sought specifically. So, by all means, disrupt the time that you had argued for yourselves and for Senator McKenzie to have on the infrastructure bill debate.

                               On the substance of the argument that has been put by Senator Birmingham: I think it is important for those listening, and to get it on the record, that the government was required to release a cohort of detainees from immigration detention.

                               And, as Senator Cash knows, we have been seeking, for a couple of days, to brief them, on agreed terms, on the legal advice. Unfortunately, that briefing, because of Senator Cash's and Mr Tehan's program, isn't able to be done until later this afternoon. Now we have been trying since early yesterday morning to offer those briefings so that you can be provided—

                                              We are happy to bring it on. We have been ready. We have been waiting for the agreement from the opposition, and the opposition have not provided that and have sought further briefings, which are happening later this afternoon.

                                              But this government has been working tirelessly. Those ministers have been working tirelessly. I have been working with them. They have been working around the clock. They have been thrown a complex and challenging situation, which we have responded to, with terms on visas, with legislation that has already passed and with further legislation that will pass this parliament this week. That has been done in a matter of weeks.

                                              Many of these people, when you were in government for nine years, sat in immigration detention with no pathway out—not one attempt to relocate or negotiate an outcome for those. That is the situation we've inherited. The court has found that that law is wrong, and we have been responding to it.

                                               will not be supporting this motion. To say that the Senate has some particularly important matters to consider today would be absolutely understating the importance of the business that we all know is before the Senate today. With regard to what is actually happening here, let's be very clear about one thing: a race to the bottom on refugee policy—a race to the bottom on immigration detention policy—in Australia is something that we have seen time after time after time in this country over the last 25-odd years, since the

There is a dark thread that runs through the politics of both major parties in this country, and that dark thread has resulted in death and in refugees and people seeking asylum being brutalised and demonised in immigration detention, both on

Then the Labor Party is rolling over and capitulating to the Liberals and to the Murdoch media.

                                                     That is exactly what has happened over the past few weeks with regard to the government's response to the recent High Court decision that effectively ruled that indefinite immigration detention is unlawful in Australia, and that is what we are seeing played out here today. I've got some advice for the government: stop letting Mr Dutton, the Leader of the Opposition, write your policy on refugees, people seeking asylum and immigration detention, because we all know the dark path that that will lead this country down. It's about time that we collectively stood up for human rights, for proper process, for the rule of law and for the separation of powers in this country. It's about time that we legislated like grown-ups in this place, where we carefully consider our response to things like High Court decisions, not legislate in a shoddy, xenophobic, panicked way because the Labor Party is too weak and cowardly to stand up to Mr Dutton's agenda.

                                                     That is what is going on at the moment. That is what is going on in this debate. I predict that that's what's going to go on over the next 48 hours in this place. If there is one thing we know about Mr Dutton, it's that he has built a career on demonising refugees and people seeking asylum and he's not going to stop now. My last piece of advice to the Labor Party is this: when you appease someone like Mr Dutton, they will simply take everything you give them, take another giant step over to the Right and go again. That's what's going to happen, and it needs to stop.

You have one responsibility as a government—to keep Australians safe—and you have failed miserably. You talk about legal briefings. Well, guess what? We were in negotiations for a legal briefing.

The relevant shadow minister has been told that unless he drives 3½ hours—because apparently technology doesn't assist—the department can't actually get the advice to him in a confidential manner. We were negotiating with this government in good faith. We'd had one briefing yesterday morning on this, and we were negotiating with this government in good faith. But clearly that good faith has been thrown out the window this morning because you want to play political games.

Let's be clear on what this statement doesn't do. There is nothing in this statement that addresses the fundamental issue that the release of every single one of the 148 detainees was a government decision. Despite what they want to say, it was a decision based on an assessment made by the government of what the High Court had said in its NZYQ decision and a decision based on an assessment by the government in advance of the High Court's statement of reasons. The Attorney-General; the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and

Honestly, someone doing work experience in the Attorney-General's office could have drafted this. It is that pathetic of a statement—to cover their own inadequacies in this regard. Instead of resorting to this kind of petulant rubbish, quite frankly they should be standing in front of the cameras today and apologising to the Australian people for the mess that they have now got Australians in.

It was not the government's view that the law should change. The government sought an approach, in the government's approach before the High Court, that would have seen not only NZYQ continue to be in detention but also the rest of this cohort.

                                                                                </p>

It is not right to conflate broader issues of migration and of the treatment of refugees and asylum seekers with this issue. This is a cohort who have committed offences—some of them are very serious offences—and the approach of the government will be to ensure community safety. That's what we will do. It is a big mistake, in my view, for people on either side of this argument to try and conflate these. It serves the interests of some on the extremes of either side of Australian politics, but it is not in the national interest to conflate these issues.
                                                                                </p>

                                                                                </p>

We need cold calculations about what is in the national interest. We need to develop an approach to the law that is consistent with the national interest. None of that has been displayed by those opposite, who have just shouted and bellowed and talked tough and come up with nothing that is in the national interest. I look forward to seeing your conduct this week, when it really counts, as we legislate our way through this set of challenges. I look forward to seeing whether you're actually capable of acting in the national interest.

We've heard Senator Birmingham say that as well. That should be a primary focus for us in this chamber. But the way we do that matters and the way we talk about it matters. Here we are, after agreeing to a program yesterday, now having a debate on the proposed suspension. Yes, this is incredibly important. What we've seen happen in these two cases shouldn't have happened, and we have an obligation to deal with this. But where's the suspension of standing orders for the 60 Australian women and children that have been murdered this year? We talk about keeping Australians safe. Where's the urgency around that? Yes, the new government has done work on coercive control, with the new plan to end violence against women and children, and I give them credit for that.
