        My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Sherry. I ask whether the government is aware of the comments of the Canadian Minister for

        overnight where he stated that, ‘We think lowering taxes attracts investment; we think higher taxes obviously discourage investment’, and the comments of the chief executive of the Mining Association of Canada when he said the Australian tax ‘probably makes

         Kevin Rudd

          I thank the minister for the short answer. My supplementary question is: given this tax was announced without any prior consultation with industry, does the government stand by its commitment of August 2008 to act on the recommendations of the report of the Tax Design Review Panel in relation to this new tax?

           On the issue of consultation, it is simply not correct to claim that there was no consultation. I am pleased that you have raised the issue, because one of the common myths being advanced against the super profits taxation in the mining industry is that there was no consultation. If you look at the work program, the speeches and the papers that were presented publicly by the independent tax review—otherwise known as the Henry tax review—you will see that there was extensive referencing.

             There was extensive referencing to the issue of the taxation, the base of taxation and the way in which taxation should apply to the mining sector. Indeed, I understand the Mining Council of Australia made a submission in respect of the conceptual and the principle approach of taxing profits.

               As I was saying earlier, I do not accept the argument from the opposition, where they are locked arm in arm with the mining industry, and advancing the myth—and that is what it is: a myth—that there was no consultation. There was consultation. I would draw your attention to a speech I gave on Monday evening at a tax forum in Sydney, where I listed four pages of precise consultation with sections of the mining industry in the independent tax review. There was comprehensive consultation on the issue of the structure and the design of the taxation of the mining sector in this country.

                 The government stands behind its proposed tax. The increasing prices that are flowing as a consequence of the mining boom and demand in Asia come from a resource that is owned by the Australian people, and they should get their fair share—
