        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Senator Conroy. Can the minister outline the government’s fiscal strategy and how important it has been in combating the effects of the global recession?

         I thank Senator Hurley for her question. The government’s responsible economic and fiscal policy has helped chart Australia through very difficult economic circumstances. The stimulus package has helped ensure Australia has the strongest performing advanced economy in the developed world, growing over the past year when every other advanced economy has gone backwards. If it were not for the fiscal stimulus, Australia would be in a recession and hundreds of thousands more Australians would be out of work.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government’s fiscal stimulus was carefully designed to phase down as the economy strengthens. The impact of stimulus on growth has already peaked and it is already tapering away. As stimulus is increasingly withdrawn it will detract from growth through 2010, making room for the recovery in the private sector. That means fiscal and monetary stimulus will both be withdrawing as the private sector recovers.

         has said he is comfortable with the level of fiscal stimulus and its gradual withdrawal means monetary and fiscal policy would be acting consistently.
        </p>
        <p>
         While the government is focused on the tough policy decisions and responsible economic management in Australia’s long-term national interest, those opposite are all over the place. They are a policy-free zone.

           Responsible economic policy requires hard work and a coherent economic policy framework. It requires being focused on working through policy options, promulgating them, arguing them and then actually implementing them. In contrast, right across the opposition, they are devoid of policy ideas. The Leader of the Opposition in this chamber is probably the leading offender.
          </p>
          <p>
           In the spirit of

           that is coming upon us, we are running a sweep. Your choices are: whether or not Senator Minchin will actually reveal one policy before his 200th press release or whether he can get himself reshuffled out of the portfolio.

                  , on the point of order: Senator Conroy has been directly relevant to the question that has been asked by Senator Hurley. Again, I raise the issue of using a point of order impermissibly to argue their case, if badly. If the opposition do not like the answer then they can simply not listen. But, in this instance, we are capable of asking a question and being directly relevant to it and that is what is happening here.

                    The question clearly asked was: what are alternative strategies to doing hard work? Dirt digging is absolutely central to that answer—central to those opposite and certainly central to Senator Ronaldson, who likes to pride himself on being a hard man. Senator Ronaldson, there is a difference between a hard man and a man involved in digging dirt but, when you have got form, it comes back to haunt you.

                     Order! Senator Conroy, resume your seat. Your time is up. I have asked you to resume your seat because time is up. I am waiting for there to be order. Just before I call Senator Cormann, I would like to invite the Speaker of the Republic of Vanuatu to join me on the floor.
