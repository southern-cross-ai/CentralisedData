               I thank Senator Mason for his question. It has been a long time. I look forward to many more questions from him. I will say that Senator Mason does actually care about this stuff. He is actually interested. That is very unusual on the other side.
              </p>
              <p>
               Senator Mason, I would urge you not to rely upon newspaper reports about these figures because they are not the figures that the government can confirm, they are not based on government proposals; they are assumptions that are made with figures that do not bear any resemblance to the government's policy. The school should not in any way take seriously those reports because this government is not about cutting funding. As I have indicated, this is now the third opportunity I have had today to indicate this, the government's view is that no school will lose money under our plan. In fact school funding for every school—for government, for independent, for Catholic—will continue to rise under our plan for school improvements.
              </p>
              <p>
               We have always said that no school will lose a dollar of funding per student, and that is what this government will deliver. The government has indicated, and the minister and the Prime Minister have confirmed today, that no school will lose a dollar of funding per student, and that is what we will deliver. We are about ensuring that all Australians benefit from an improved education system. As a consequence, this nation as a whole benefits from an improved education system. We want to ensure that the states and territories do their fair share as well, and we are in the business of discussing with them their funding commitments in the forthcoming period. We want to make sure that no school loses a dollar of funding, and we are outlining our plans to deliver that in the next few weeks.

                , I ask a supplementary question. Given that according to modelling prepared by state government and non-government schools, more than 3,000 schools—both public and private—stand to lose funding under the government's new funding model, how could the Prime Minister and the minister claim with straight faces for months and months that no school will lose a dollar? Mr President, I asked the minister this question before, but he did not answer it. Will any school be worse off in real terms—the emphasis being 'real terms'—under its funding reforms?

Any figures that Senator Mason is quoting from the weekend's press are figures that are not those of the government.

                      Yes, it is—going to relevance. I have asked directly whether in fact there will be any cuts in real terms to school funding. It was a specific and direct question.

                         , I ask a further supplementary question. If, as the Prime Minister has repeatedly declared, no school will lose a dollar under the new funding arrangements, why has the government delayed the release of its response to the Gonski review from this week to a number of weeks from now? What does the government have to hide and what do Australian schools have to fear?

                           We have secured new funding for important programs, and we will continue this government's record—in fact, record investments—in schools and early childhood education. What we have been talking about is an expansion to $13.9 billion compared to the $8.5 billion in the last Howard government budget.

                           The opposition plans to cut $2.8 billion from school education—$2.8 billion. Senator Mason, this leaves you terminally exposed. You should send those sorts of questions straight back to the tactics committee, because they bear no relationship to the fact that you are going to cut $2.8 billion. And, of course, the Leader of the Opposition has made it perfectly clear he has no intention of acting on the Gonski reforms and has no intention of supporting extra money for schools and wants to cut—
