         I thank Senator Carol Brown for her question. The Rudd government recognises that climate change poses serious consequences for the nation’s health system and that urgent action must be taken to tackle this issue. This week the Director-General of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHO" rel="nofollow">
          WHO
         </a>
         , Dr Margaret Chan, informed the health minister that the health impacts of climate change globally are key priorities for the agency. Recent reports prepared for the

         outline a frightening list of potential health risks.
        </p>
        <p>
         More frequent and intense weather events, including drought, heatwaves, floods and bushfires, are likely to lead to an increase in deaths and morbidity, particularly for dependent, older Australians. In addition to that, you have the increased incidence of extreme natural disasters such as drought, which could also lead to an increase in mental health problems in regional and remote areas. Rates of infectious and vector-borne diseases, such as
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_River" rel="nofollow">
          Ross River
         </a>
         virus and dengue fever, and food- and water-borne diseases will also increase as changing weather conditions provide new environments for vectors and hosts. New populations may be put at risk for these diseases due to geographic changes. Ultimately stresses will be placed on our health system caused by internal migration and social disruption. Water scarcity is likely to go up, and availability of fresh fruit and vegetables may decrease. If we want to alleviate the impacts of climate change on the health of all Australians, the time to take action is now. The government is working actively and constructively with the opposition’s spokesperson on this.

           has previously indicated that changes in climate conditions can have three kinds of health impacts: (1) direct impacts, such as heatwaves; (2) health consequences, such as changes to ecosystems and biological processes; and (3) health consequences that occur when populations are disrupted or displaced. Health impacts due to climate change will affect some regions, socioeconomic groups and demographic groups more than others. For example—

            It is a shame those on the other side do not take this seriously. You have older people, who are more susceptible to extremes of temperature, and many rural and remote communities have less capacity than larger settlements to deal with the health impacts of climate change.
