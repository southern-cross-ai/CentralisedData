         NBN
        </a>
        Co. and Telstra, as they were misquoted or misunderstood by Senator Conroy. Senator Conroy asserted that, in pointing out that there was no deal to deliver a national broadband network between NBN Co. and Telstra but just a deal to try to do a deal, I had somehow not only accused the government of putting spin above substance but also by implication accused Telstra of trying to spin this announcement, which is not true at all.

         Senator Cormann, you cannot go on and repeat what you said yesterday; you can only say where you claim to have been misquoted or misunderstood.
