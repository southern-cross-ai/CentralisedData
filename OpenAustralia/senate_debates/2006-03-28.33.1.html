        newspaper on 16 March 2006 by Filipino migrant worker Mr Margarito ‘Gary’ Sorrosa that he had his passport stolen and was kidnapped by a group of five men linked to his employer, the Pangaea restaurant in Canberra, following a dispute about workplace conditions? In particular, can the minister confirm that there is an ongoing

         Senator Lundy has raised a number of issues dealing with various alleged criminal offences which, I understand, would be dealt with by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
          ACT
         </a>
         police—the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
          AFP
         </a>
         . In relation to kidnapping and the theft of a passport, I would imagine that that in the first instance would be dealt with by the ACT police. I will refer the question to the minister for police in the ACT and take on notice whether there is any involvement of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Federal Police
         </a>
         for which I have responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
         You have to remember that community policing in the ACT is carried out by the AFP under the responsibility of the police minister in the ACT government. Any allegation of theft or kidnapping would primarily come under the law in the ACT. The theft of a passport is a Commonwealth offence, and that might well be relevant. I will take it on notice and raise it with the minister for police in the ACT.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I ask the minister to tell the Senate what protections are afforded to union members, union organisers—such as Mr Bibo—and their families under the Howard government’s extreme industrial relations laws?

           In relation to the application of the law in relation to a person’s liberty and right to proceed without assault, I would have thought that it was abundantly clear that, no matter who you are, you are entitled not to be assaulted or obstructed unlawfully. In relation to the industrial relations legislation, that is a matter best directed to the minister who has responsibility for that. But, as Senator Lundy has addressed her question to me and asked what protection there is from violence and assault, I would refer to the laws of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
            ACT
           </a>
           , as it is the jurisdiction about which Senator Lundy has raised her question.
