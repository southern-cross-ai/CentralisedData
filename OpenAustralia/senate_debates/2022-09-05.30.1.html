        I've got just a couple of words to say to Senator Bragg about thatâ€”super theft!
       </p>
       <p>
        Ridding the world of nuclear weapons should be the goal of all countries that committed to a lasting global peace. It's absolute madness that in this day and age we have enough nuclear warheads to wipe out a significant proportion of the world's human population. A world free of nuclear weapons is a goal to which Australia is deeply committed, and the global community has made significant progress towards this goal, thanks to the non-proliferation treaty, or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPT" rel="nofollow">
         NPT
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite the urgency for the international security environment, it is disappointing that the 10th review conference of the NPT did not reach a consensus outcome. All state parties, with the exception of Russia, were ready to agree to a meaningful and balanced outcome across the treaty's three pillars: disarmament, non-proliferation and peaceful use of nuclear energy. Russia's refusal to join this agreement has been a deliberate obstruction of progress towards nuclear non-proliferation. By obstructing progress, Russia's actions threaten global peace and security.
       </p>
       <p>
        While the outcome is disappointing Australia remains committed to the NPT, which continues to deliver tangible security benefits to the entire world. We should not allow Russia's intransigence to deter us from continuing to pursue the complete abolition of nuclear weapons. Australia of course continues to condemn Russia for their unprovoked and completely unjustified invasion of Ukraine, and calls on them to withdraw their forces immediately from Ukraine's territory.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to just quickly thank all the other state parties for their willingness to make a constructive contribution and find a way forward for peace. I also thank the delegates for their efforts, and in particular our Assistant Minister for Trade, Senator Ayres, who led the Australian delegation.
