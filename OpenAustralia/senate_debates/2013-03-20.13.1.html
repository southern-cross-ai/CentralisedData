         I just wanted, at the start of the committee stage, to acknowledge some people. In my second reading speech I acknowledged those beyond the parliament and the government who had been instrumental in bringing the legislation to this point, but I did want to thank Senator McLucas and her office for the courtesies extended to my office and to me during this process. I also wanted to thank Senator Macklin's office and acknowledge the work of Senator Moore, as the chair of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, in stewarding the inquiry into the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
          NDIS
         </a>
         legislation. I think Senator Moore really ranks with Senator Payne when it comes to the discipline she imposes upon committees that she has chaired. I would also like to thank Senator Siewert, as deputy chair, for her contribution there. It is also important to acknowledge the committee secretariat of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, Dr Ian Holland, and his staff, who worked extremely hard in a very compressed time frame.
        </p>
        <p>
         I also thank the 1,597 people and organisations who made submissions to that inquiry. We will, in the course of this morning, see some of the fruits of the work of that committee come to bear as some of the recommendations that were made by the committee are taken up. I should also acknowledge officers of FaHCSIA, for their very hard work in bringing the legislation to this place, and Mr David Bowen.
        </p>
        <p>
         I also want to express my pleasure that the notice of motion that was circulated last night in relation to the proposal to guillotine debate on the NDIS legislation looks as though it will not come to pass. I in no way reflect on Senator McLucas in relation to that motion because I know these things are determined by others in this place with chamber responsibilities. I am sure Senator McLucas was instrumental in seeing that motion not come to pass by her internal advocacy in the government because I know she, of all people, would not want there to be any curtailing of debate on this legislation.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to move to what will probably be the least significant issue raised in this committee stage, so let me get it out of the way first—that is, the issue of the proposed name change for the NDIS. Minister Macklin, in a press release on 18 March—two days ago; I am losing track of time—headed 'Extra funding for playgroups to give kids a better start', announced on the second page in paragraph 14 a name change. This is not where I naturally would look for an announcement about a change of name for the NDIS, nevertheless, it was there. In the release it said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Ms Macklin said the Government was taking a big step this week toward peace of mind for people with disability, their families and carers with the passage of the NDIS Bill through Parliament.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         In another step that this care and support is about to become real for Australians with disability and their families, we now have a name for the National Disability Insurance Scheme—
        </p>
        <p>
         I thought we had one, but anyway it goes on—
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         ‘DisabilityCare Australia’.
        </p>
        <p>
         The release continues:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The name has been chosen based on consultations with people with disability, their families and carers, peak organisations and the general public.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         DisabilityCare Australia reflects the principles of the NDIS—that all Australians with significant or profound disability receive the care and support they need, regardless of how they acquired that disability.
        </p>
        <p>
         I was a little surprised that the proposed name change was buried—that is the only way to put it—at the bottom of a press release in relation to funding for playgroups.
        </p>
        <p>
         There was some reaction from stakeholders in relation to the proposed name change, and I will just go through a few of those. Lesley Hall, who is well known to all of us presently in the chamber, the chief executive of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federation" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Federation
         </a>
         of Disability Organisations said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         It does not represent what the scheme is about …
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The scheme is not just about caring, it's about supporting people to have to get on and do what they want in life.
        </p>
        <p>
         She continued to say:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         She said the word "care" had implied the scheme was linked to welfare and paternalism.
        </p>
        <p>
         David Heckendorf, who has cerebral palsy, said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Oh, come on guys! Really? Disability Care? Why not go all the way and call it Crip Care? …
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         It is not about caring. It is about empowering or enabling, equipping, etc. Can't we be a little more imaginative?
        </p>
        <p>
         And Jackie Softly said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I hate the name. But I worry more that the name reflects the way the powers that be see it. Now that is very scary …

         </a>
         n Legislative Council, who Senator Ruston made reference to before, said in response to the proposed name change:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         We aren't a scheme for sick people needing care—we're people with disabilities that need to be supported, assisted and enabled …
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         We don't need the NDIS name change to further perpetuate patronising attitudes.
        </p>
        <p>
         I was surprised about the manner of the announcement of the name change, and it would seem from that selection of quotes that there is some concern in the sector among some people with disability that the name might not be an accurate reflection of the nature of the scheme.
        </p>
        <p>
         My questions to the parliamentary secretary are these. Can she supply some additional background as to the process that was gone through in relation to seeking to rebrand the NDIS and whether DisabilityCare Australia is the settled name for the NDIS? Is it intended to be a trading name that will replace National Disability Insurance Scheme? Will the National Disability Insurance Scheme Launch Transition Agency be renamed to the DisabilityCare Australia Launch Transition Agency? I am interested in the process that led to the new name. I am also interested in the manner of its announcement and what the intention of the government is as to how exactly it will be used.

          Senator, in answer to your questions, I need to provide some clarity for you. This is not a name change. National Disability Insurance Scheme was the name that Mr Bonyhady took to the 2020 summit some years ago. It is a name that was then picked up by the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
           Productivity Commission
          </a>
          in their work. There have been a number of senior and key players who have had conversations about whether or not the word 'insurance' should rightly sit in that name.
         </p>
         <p>
          It was always the plan of the government to provide a name that is accessible and means something to Australians broadly, particularly Australians with disability, in the same way that Medicare comes from the Health Insurance Act in Australia. We do not have a Medicare act; we have the Health Insurance Act. In the same way Centrelink is delivered through the Commonwealth Service Delivery Agency Act—that is how we have Centrelink. So it is not unusual; it is, in fact, predictable. It is not a point that, I think, carries much weight, so can I suggest we get on with the main job. Your question was in terms of the agency. That is a matter for deliberation down the track; it is not a consideration at present.

           As I indicated at the outset, this is the least important matter that will be raised here, but given it has only arisen in the last few days and has been the comment of a number of people with disability, I thought it was worth giving the parliamentary secretary the opportunity to provide some additional context around the proposed branding of the scheme. As I think I indicated yesterday, it is not something about which the opposition wish to make a capital case, but I think it deserved some brief ventilation.

            By way of explanation of these government amendments, the government has moved amendments in the House to respond to what we have heard from people with disability and their families and carers, from service providers and from the states and territories. Many people have also provided their views to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee's inquiry into the bill, and the government is proposing additional amendments to be moved in the Senate to respond to the committee's report.
           </p>
           <p>
            The amendments in the House were designed to make it clear that a fundamental aim of the scheme is to maximise the independence of people with disability. In delivering the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
             NDIS
            </a>
            , they require that the agency supports the independence, participation and exercise of choice and control by people with disability. The amendments we are moving in the Senate also make clear that, in addition to the cultural and linguistic circumstances of people with disability, their gender should be taken into account by anyone acting on behalf of a person with a disability. That is amendment (8) and responds to committee recommendation 5.
           </p>
           <p>
            Amendments (1), (2) and (9) and committee recommendation 1 give greater visibility to the object of the scheme that relates to the Convention of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and other relevant human rights conventions. They include a specific reference to the object of maximising independence for people with disability.
           </p>

             The Senate
            </a>
            committee also discussed the role of advocacy and the NDIS in great detail, and the government is proposing amendments to acknowledge the role of advocacy in representing the interests of people with disability and to recognise that advocacy supports people with disability in a range of ways. Those amendments are (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7) and respond to committee recommendation 7.
           </p>
           <p>
            Amendments (10), (11), (12) and (15) respond to committee recommendation 18. In response to a request by the Senate committee, the amendments also clarify that where an examination is required for access, planning or reviewing in addition to medical, psychiatric and psychological examinations there can be other examinations conducted by an appropriately qualified person.
           </p>
           <p>
            Amendments (13) and (14) respond to committee recommendation 20. To respond to the Senate committee's concerns, the amendments ensure that NDIS rules can be made to deal with the mechanisms registered providers of supports must have in place for dealing with conflicts of interests. There is a risk of conflicts of interest arising, for example, if a registered provider of supports both provides supports to people with disability and manages funding for supports under plans. The NDIS rules will be able to specify approval criteria and/or ongoing obligations that registered providers of supports must meet for managing conflicts of interest. The NDIS rules will be able to provide more detail around what kind of mechanisms a registered provider who undertakes both functions must have in place.
           </p>
           <p>
            Amendments (15) and (16) respond to committee recommendation 29. Amendments moved in the Senate provide for greater representation of people with disability on the advisory council while ensuring that a diverse experience of disability is also reflected. As recommended by the Senate committee, the amendments mean that a majority of the people on the advisory council will be people with disability and there will be at least one member who has experience or knowledge of disability in rural and regional areas. This is in addition to the existing requirements that there be at least two people who are carers of people with disability and at least one person with experience or skills in the supply of equipment or services. I commend the amendments to the chamber.

             I have a series of questions around those amendments. While I commend the government for taking on a number of the recommendations from the committee, there are some that are not necessarily being done through amendments, and there are also questions around those amendments and what is in scope or not. Should we go through issue by issue, because I am sure that Senator Fifield has questions as well? I also have a few questions around amendments that were made in the House of Representatives to the compensation provisions, which Senator Xenophon also brings up, and may clarify some of the issues Senator Xenophon is trying to address through his amendments. Perhaps we could do compensation first. I am looking around the chamber to see if that is okay with people.

               I appreciate the government has already moved to deal with the issue of subrogation, which, as the parliamentary secretary will know, came up time and again. The issue that came up time and again by a number of organisations—and the chamber has a deep interest in this at the moment—was why the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
                CEO
               </a>
               still needs those powers to compel participants to seek compensation. One of the key issues that came out during the Senate inquiry was the fact that the CEO could compel. That is why the argument was there for subrogation. Can the parliamentary secretary explain why those powers are still necessary given the subrogation issue has been dealt with?

                We need to ensure that insurers, both public and private, maintain effort. The last thing we want to do is shift costs to the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
                 NDIS
                </a>
                that are in fact the appropriate costs of another insurance agency. If we were to essentially take over the responsibility of other both public and private insurers, that would put real pressure, in our view, on the fund with potential serious impacts not only in a funding sense. Insurance requires that, if something has gone wrong, the appropriate insurer should pay the costs of that event.

                 I understand that and that is the whole purpose of the compensation provisions. The point there is that if you are enabling the

                 to subrogate anyway—and I am not a lawyer so I may not be using 'subrogation' and 'subrogate' in the correct context—why still have those powers in there to compel? Does that make sense?

                  The answer to that is that you have to start from somewhere. The first question the
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
                   CEO
                  </a>
                  asks a participant is: will you go to the
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAC" rel="nofollow">
                   TAC
                  </a>
                  and make a claim, for example? There has to be a start to the process. Then, as you know, through subrogation that person may say they do not want to and then the CEO has another set of options in front of them to be able to take a matter on their behalf—and I think you understand the trickle-down options that are available following the amendments in the House of Representatives. But the answer to your question is that you have to start somewhere. So the first step is you ask a participant to take an action at the appropriate insurer.

                   I acknowledge that the amendment that the government moved and was passed in the House did go some way towards addressing the recommendation of the Senate committee, but I want to follow up on what the parliamentary secretary was saying before. A lay person reading the amended legislation would see that the chief executive has great powers of compulsion. I appreciate that the way a mechanism of this sort operates in reality may not be as blunt as it appears in the legislation. Are you saying that, if an individual elects not to pursue action themselves or they do nothing, by so doing they have in fact elected to subrogate their responsibility to the
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
                    CEO
                   </a>
                   ? Although it may look in black and white as though the chief executive is directing that something happen, in fact the way it will operate in practice is that the individual is in effect electing to make a choice and to subrogate some of their rights to the CEO.

                    I think we need to put this in a little bit of context. The first point I would make is that a person who has just been involved in a very traumatic event probably is not going to go to the National Disability Insurance Scheme Act to ascertain what their next steps are. They will be associated with their insurance company and they will be referred to the national disability insurance agency locally provided, and this will be done extremely sensitively and compassionately. That was very much the message we received from the Senate Committee Affairs Legislation Committee.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    In terms of how it will happen, there will be a discussion undoubtedly. If the case does concern legal action, there will be a discussion managed very sensitively with the individual to ascertain whether they wish to take that legal action. I imagine this will be a discussion not held on just one occasion. There will be an opportunity for there to be further discussion if the person says they are not doing that. That is when subrogation occurs and that is when there is an opportunity for the

                    </a>
                    to ascertain whether legal action is appropriate or whether they should take it on behalf of the person who has been involved in that event.

                       I think organisations such as the Australian Lawyers Alliance have visited a number of senators and given evidence to the Senate inquiry. I understand from what Senator Xenophon has said that his proposed amendments in the area of compensation reflect some of the concerns of organisations such as that. I would be interested in whether you have received any legal advice as to what the practical outworking of the proposition that Senator Xenophon has put forward may be, just to provide a little light, because being a layman I have read amendments such as his and it is not immediately apparent as to what the practical import may be.

                        I just wonder, for the operations of the committee, whether Senator Fifield would mind if we leave Senator Xenophon's package to when we are debating his amendments. Given that he is not in the chamber, I do not want to do it once and then have to do it again.

                            , as I articulated in my second reading contribution, felt that it was better to leave the funding of advocacy outside the scheme, but we still felt it was very important, and we very strongly support the committee's recommendations that the concept of advocacy be included in the

                           </p>
                           <p>
                            The role of advocacy is brought into sharp focus by the mechanisms by which each participant and others can seek to challenge and address decisions of the agency. We have supported the recommendation that launch sites should monitor this aspect. So the issue that came up was the immediate review and then going to what people felt was the more extreme
                            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAT" rel="nofollow">
                             AAT
                            </a>
                            approach. They were looking for something in between. I understand the government's concern about setting a whole new process up through the launch sites, because they want to get this up and running, which is why the committee recommended that there be this process of monitoring this particular aspect to see if there are a lot of concerns coming up during the launch site process and to see whether there is a need for an intermediate step between those two levels of what is essentially appeal. There was, of course, that call for funding of advocacy.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            So the problem here is that, yes, we totally get the weight of evidence that suggests that we should not be funding advocacy under the agency, but that then leaves out there the issue of advocacy and how we are going to fund it. The problem is that in the past—I am not pointing the figure at any particular governments here—we have seen funding for advocacy go up and down. We have had previous attempts to muzzle advocacy, and under this government there was the failure to index some of the grants to advocacy agencies—which was, I have to say, reversed, but it can be something that comes and goes, and that is not good for advocacy. So my question to government is: one of the recommendations in the report was funding of advocacy, so what is the government doing about funding for advocacy services, given that they will not be provided for through the scheme itself?

                             Senator Siewert can be assured that the government totally understands the necessity for strong advocacy services. We are moving into a new age, and people will have different questions, and many people will need to be supported through that process. So I have just moved amendments that recognise the role of advocacy, but we are working to ensure that the merits system is accessible and as non-adversarial as possible. Mr Bowen has said—I think it was at Senate estimates—that seeking a resolution to any issue has to be the first priority and that path will be taken to internally manage any question as assiduously as possible.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             As you indicated, we will be providing additional funding to advocacy organisations to ensure that advocacy support is available. We are working through the detail of that at the moment. As you know, advocacy agencies are funded in different ways around the country. We have undertaken an extensive mapping exercise with the support of our National Disability Advocacy Program funded agencies, and we have also undertaken to look at those agencies that are funded by states and territories to ensure that we have the advocacy and also the interrelationship between various agencies strengthened so that people can navigate the advocacy system as well.

                              I thank Senator Siewert for enabling me to jump in. I know she has other questions. For a variety of reasons I did not have the opportunity to speak on the second reading debate, and I hope I might have the leave of colleagues to make some general comments. In all likelihood I will be out of the building when Senator Fifield's amendment in relation to the establishment of a joint parliamentary committee is debated. With the leave of the parliamentary secretary, I will make some quick comments to that.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              Senator Fifield has said for a long time that the

                              should be beyond partisan politics. That is why he, as the responsible shadow, and the coalition in totality seek the establishment of a joint parliamentary committee to be chaired by both sides of politics. If we are going to be fair to men, women, children and families with disabilities as a nation, we must undercommit and overdeliver. If we overcommit and underdeliver then we are letting down a group of Australians who are relying on us as parliamentarians to ensure that this works. As Senator Fifield knows full well, I have the great honour of being the godparent of two young people with disabilities, and I know that their parents do not want this to be about politics. They want it to be about outcomes. That was communicated to me by one of these parents in no uncertain terms a couple of weeks ago. They want us to ensure that this is all above politics. I ask the government again to reconsider Senator Fifield's amendment, because this is, in my view, the surest way of ensuring that the politics and the heat are taken out of this.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              I think it is a very, very good amendment. It is good because it is right for people with disabilities. It is good and right for those families of people with a disability. In the strongest possible terms I urge honourable senators to enable the perception and the reality amongst the community that this is above politics. As I said before, we have a unique opportunity to genuinely make generational change, and we must never lose sight of either the opportunity or the requirement to do so. Thank you.

                               Before he leaves, I really would like to answer Senator Ronaldson's friend's plea. I will make this a bit personal too. I have been working around this stuff for over six years, and nothing is going to get in the way of delivering for people I have had the fortune of meeting who currently are not being provided a service that anyone in this country could be proud of. We have worked extraordinarily hard.

                              <p>
                               The proposal that the opposition has put is not a practical answer to ensuring that we do get the delivery that we are all seeking—including me. We have a number of governance arrangements in place that will ensure that we deliver a national disability insurance scheme starting on 1 July in your state in the Barwon region. To do that, we have worked very closely with states and territories, and a lot of those are Liberal Party states and territories. The politics has been left outside the door. I pay tribute to Minister Mary Wooldridge of your state because she has been extremely cooperative and helpful, as have her departmental officials. I say the same for Mr Constance from
                               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

                               . This is well and truly above politics. This is about getting it right for people with disability. I hope that comforts your godchildren's parents.

I really do believe that design and eligibility should be worked out cooperatively. I take on board the parliamentary secretary's comments, but I do again reinforce my very strong and passionate view that Senator Fifield's amendment is one that should be supported by the committee.

                                  Thank you for the question, Senator Xenophon. The first point I would make is: we will do everything we can to avoid the situation you have described. The intent is to try and resolve issues as close as possible to the point of difference. In answer to your question, we are working through that at the moment. Those issues are afoot and we will be able to give you a clearer answer at the point when we get to your amendments. Is that helpful?

                                      and a review. The committee report suggested that happen. I would like to clarify if you are taking up that recommendation and how that would be implemented.

                                           I will indicate the opposition's disposition towards the government amendments, taking each in turn. Amendments (1), (2) and (9) relate to more clearly referencing Australia's treaty obligations. That was recommended by the Senate committee, and the opposition have no issue with that. Government amendments (3) and (8) relate to giving a more specific reference on advocacy, which Senator Siewert has also been pursuing, and that also was a recommendation of the Senate committee. I think the form of words the government has alighted on is the appropriate form of words in this area to give appropriate recognition to the central role that advocacy plays in the lives of many people with disability to ensure that they are able to attain their full rights, but it does observe the appropriate demarcation that advocacy be separately funded.

                                           Government amendments (10), (12) and (15) make a little clearer the sorts of professionals that the

                                           can seek advice from. With the original drafting there was a concern that it might inadvertently exclude, by not listing, certain professionals. This leaves that more open, which I think is appropriate.

                                           Government amendments (13) and (14) relate to conflicts of interests in relation to service providers. Again, the Senate committee and particularly Senator Boyce had a concern that reference to organisations having appropriate mechanisms to resolve conflicts of interest and to ensure that there are not conflicts of interest should be in the primary legislation. I acknowledge that the government has taken that on board.

                                           Government amendment (16), which relates to the membership of the advisory board, I think is helpful in ensuring that there is appropriate representation. I am particularly pleased that there is the maintenance of having at least two positions for people who represent carers. I just wanted to indicate our disposition towards each of those government amendments.

                                            I have a quick question about the advisory council that Senator Fifield just referred to. You would be aware that allied health professionals have had some concerns around their level of engagement. The amendments around professionals that the

In seeking some clarification in relation to the advisory council I am not asking about prescribing certain further members, but the terms of reference do not necessarily preclude people with professional expertise in allied health or with allied health knowledge from being included on the advisory council if that was appropriate, do they?

                                             No, they certainly do not preclude involvement of people. I think the amendment we have moved today to say that at least half of that advisory council be people with disability shows the focus we have in the advice that will be received, noting also that we will require there to be two people who have direct caring experience and people from rural and remote areas who have experience in service delivery.

There were comments made in a report about looking at the possibility of a launch site. I understand the government does not want to have a specific launch site for Aboriginal and

I know through other work that I do in this space, particularly with hearing, that there is great difficulty for people incarcerated accessing services. It was raised during the Senate inquiry. Could you provide any information on whether the scheme can be extended to people in custody? If it can, how will that process work?

The agency is working with each jurisdiction to map interfaces with other systems to ensure that accountabilities are clear and that administrative processes are effective. But can I point you to the rules in schedule 1, on page 23, at 7.29(b), which state:

I am aware through a lot of following up of this through estimates that if somebody goes into custody and is already receiving the services they can continue to receive the services. But if they are assessed once they are in custody, they cannot receive those services. Will that same process apply here?

                                                           This is an area that we are working very closely on, particularly in our launch sites. We actually do have a prison in the Barwon region. A state that has established a prison system has a duty of care to the people who are in that prison. You have made the point—and I have heard it many times—that you do not know that that duty of care always extends appropriately, particularly in terms of services for people with disability. But we are working through those boundary issues. We can continue to update the committee as required, as we get more information about how that will technically work.

                                                            move on to mental health. The parliamentary secretary will be aware—and I am sure the minister is also aware—that this issue came up during the committee inquiry. That is, the issue of the process of recovery, which is the focus of mental health, and around the issues of recovery rather than seeing disability as an ongoing permanent disability. It was raised a number of times. While I think some people are pretty clear about it there is still a lot of concern, because mental health takes a recovery approach, as to whether it will be included for those people who are very strongly in their pain process looking at a recovery approach.

Similarly, there are rules around the issue of recovery that you alluded to. Current supports that recognise the recovery approach will continue to be available. This will take into account the intermittent nature of some mental health conditions. I hope that is helpful in answering your question.

For example, you may have the scenario where an individual receives support, an entitlement, through the NDIS and they go to a service that previously provided, say, a guide dog at no cost to the individual receiving that service. How will that organisation be able to identify that that individual actually receives funded support as opposed to another individual who may not be eligible for NDIS supports?

Will there be a requirement that the organisations providing the guide dogs have the individual, who will be in receipt of those services, sign a statutory declaration saying that they are or are not in receipt of NDIS supports? It would be appropriate that that individual put some of that NDIS support towards that organisation from which they might previously have received the service at no expense. What will be the mechanism for that organisation to receive the appropriate payments? Essentially, how will that organisation seek to identify those people who should be making a contribution to a service that may previously have been free through their NDIS supports?

The agency is working that detail through at the moment. The point that was made by those who visited us yesterday is a good point, and we are working through it. The legislation is quite clear that the person is entitled to supports and if they purchase something outside of the supports they have agreed to then they are liable. No, you cannot go to the guide dog society and get a guide dog if you are not entitled to one. Sorry, Senator Fifield, you cannot have a guide dog.

There will be an ongoing role for organisations through block funding and through philanthropic processes.

We are very clear that we do not want those funds not to be forthcoming from the community. We are working very closely with those organisations to ensure that the partnership we currently have and we will continue to have into the future is very clear to the community, so that the support those organisations currently receive will be ongoing.

It is relating to secure work. The next area, recommendation 21, dealt with the concerns raised by some of those representing workers and unions that came to present evidence to the committee. They were concerned around insecure working conditions and wanted to make sure that measures were put in place like enhanced skills training capacity of people working in the disability sector. What is the government doing with that recommendation? Have they taken it on board and are there any actions that you think need to be put in place to deal with that issue around the potential for insecure work, given the move to self-directed funds? They were not having a go at that move—and neither am I, I strongly support that—but I think they raise some legitimate issues.

The government appointed an expert working group to advise on the issues affecting sector capacity and workforce issues as we transition to an NDIS. Their work has been very extensive and ongoing. We are also working to continue this work as we progress, including the need for a forward looking comprehensive workforce strategy. We have had conversations with some of the unions around that question as well. This must consider the move to individualised funding and the impact of that on working arrangements, and it is also a part of the broader work we are doing on consumer directed care. That is the interface that we are talking about. It is an issue that we are very alive to, and we intend to work very closely with all relevant stakeholders as we meet and beat the challenge that is in front of us. It is a big challenge and we are growing a large workforce of people. The questions of quality are real and we will ensure that we do provide a quality workforce.

This one relates to the function of the agency. We believe that the bill includes the principle that providing reasonable ministry support extends before financial support and capacity building to include a responsibility or function to ensure that people with a disability can live independently and participate fully in the community. This function is broadly similar to the idea of systemic advocacy that is covered extensively in the committee report. We touched on it in our additional comments and we took on board very strongly the comments made by, for example, the Disability Discrimination Commissioner, Mr Graeme Innes.
                                                                             </p>

So we believe very strongly that this will enhance the functioning and powers of the agency. I commend the amendment to the chamber.

One of the concerns that I raised in my second reading contribution was that at the moment, if there is a dispute—and it will get to that, unfortunately, in some cases—there will be situations when a person with a disability will, in the absence of this amendment, simply not have the support of an advocacy service. So there may be someone who has a profound disability and has to slug it out with representatives from the Australian government—the

What this amendment states is that people with disability have a right to access independent disability advocacy support to promote, protect and ensure their full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and to enable them to participate fully in the community.

The parliamentary secretary said in the course of debate on the earlier amendments that the government were considering their position in relation to this, because simply having a phrase in the legislation that says everyone has the right to advocacy is all very well but, unless you actually provide that advocacy, you are not going to achieve the outcome that is desired. So this is consistent with the government's approach, but this is actually doing something about it, and that is why I think it is very important that this amendment be supported, because otherwise it will make a mockery of the framework that is meant to provide advocacy for those with a disability. Unless it is entrenched by this amendment, it just will not happen.
