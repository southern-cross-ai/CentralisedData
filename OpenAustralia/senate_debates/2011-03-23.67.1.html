        It is a privilege to move this motion which recognises World Veterinary Year, marking the 250th anniversary of veterinary education in the world with the establishment of the first school in Lyon, France, in 1761. To put it into perspective, that was nine years before
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Cook" rel="nofollow">

        discovered the

        of Australia and 18 years before European settlement. The first school was established following yet another horrific 18-year epidemic of the disease rinderpest throughout Europe. It was first described in 3000
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BC" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and it was only in October 2010 that the world was finally declared free of the disease.
       </p>
       <p>
        The motion honours the contribution and achievements of the profession to animal health production and welfare, disease prevention, public health and food safety and biosecurity. I quote the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Veterinary_Association" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Veterinary Association
        </a>
        ’s President, Barry Smyth, who I believe is in the gallery this afternoon, who said, ‘The greatest contribution Australian veterinarians have made to the livestock industry and indeed the country is the eradication of three major infectious diseases of cattle, being bovine tuberculosis, brucellosis and pleuropneumonia.’ Dr Smyth said this was achieved by many veterinarians in the field, in abattoirs and laboratories who worked in accordance with excellent and informed planning, devised and directed by veterinarians.
       </p>
       <p>
        The motion recognises the significant contribution and achievements of three members of our profession whose names appear in the papers. In addition, I pay tribute to some others: Professor Ken Jubb, who received a Medal of the Order of Australia in January this year for his services to veterinary science and pathology; to the memory of Dr Tom Hungerford, whose legacy was the establishment of the Postgraduate Foundation in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_Science" rel="nofollow">
         Veterinary Science
        </a>
        ; to my colleague Dr Peter Reid, an equine practitioner in Brisbane who was present when the first known hendra outbreak occurred in 1994 and who has been a constant advocate for the development of rapid tools and vaccination for horses; and to the memory of my friend, classmate and colleague Dr Chris Baldock, who tragically died in 2005.
       </p>
       <p>
        I now turn to the role played by the majority of veterinarians today, and that is in the care of our companion animals. We are a nation of animal lovers and no-one underestimates the value of the bond between humans and pets. I pay tribute to the role that veterinarians play in this relationship, taking seriously the task of preserving the health of animals to support the relationship. The motion speaks of the provision of pro bono services each year in the ethical treatment by veterinarians of unowned animals and wildlife. I wish to record that they join the many thousands of volunteers across Australia who every year help out when natural disasters devastate our communities. The horse industry is another that has been well served by the profession over many, many years. This was most evident with the outbreak of equine influenza in 2007 and its subsequent eradication.
       </p>
       <p>
        I do thank Senator Ludwig and Senator Milne for joining me in moving this motion. I commend it to the Senate.
