        It was only yesterday that I was here in this chamber remarking on the complete and utter dereliction of responsibility of this government in relation to the safety and security of Australians—of

        ns, as it turns out—by releasing 80 and possibly well over 300 people who had their visas denied and were in detention because they had not met character grounds here in Australia. They include murderers, rapists, serious criminals and, I understand, terrorists as well.

Shame on you. All Western Australians should be so angry at what you have failed to do.
