        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Housing and Homelessness, Senator Farrell. Earlier today, the Senate passed the Housing Australia Future Fund Bill 2023 and sent the bill back to the House for consideration. It is a big step towards establishing the Housing Australia Future Fund. Given this significant development, can the minister please explain what difference the fund will make to Australians needing a safe and affordable place to call home?

          Pratt
         </a>
         for her question and her interest in the issue of housing, particularly as it relates to her home state of

          Western Australia
         </a>
         . I thank her for her ongoing support for the Housing Australia Future Fund, which is now set to pass through parliament this week.
        </p>
        <p>
         A government senator: Hear, hear!
        </p>
        <p>
         Yes—hear, hear! This fund will create an ongoing pipeline to help build social and affordable homes right across the country not just for this term of government but into perpetuity, and it's supported by the broad and ambitious Albanese government housing reform agenda. We've heard from the experts how these measures will help, but the most important feedback has been from people whose lives have been changed by safe and secure housing—people like Sean and Lisa, who met with the minister for housing recently. Sean had been needing surgery, but doctors couldn't operate while he had nowhere secure to be discharged too. Lisa told us that because they finally had a place to call home—in social housing, like the homes this fund will deliver—Sean could finally access the medical care he needed.
        </p>
        <p>
         Access to housing changes lives, and the Housing Australia Future Fund will change the lives of countless Australians. That is what our work in this place is all about, and it is what the Albanese government is working for each and every day.

           nator PRATT (—) (): I know this will be welcome news to all of those in WA who have been waiting for the affordable housing the Housing Australia Future Fund will provide. Can the minister outline some details on how the fund will support Australians who are facing specific challenges in securing a safe and affordable home and those who are currently homeless?

            for her first supplementary question. The Housing Australia Future Fund will provide important supports for Australians who face significant challenges to find safe and affordable accommodation. The passage of this legislation allows us to deliver on our commitments—4,000 homes and $100 million for crisis and transitional housing options for women and children leaving domestic violence and older women at risk of homelessness; $200 million for the repair, maintenance and improvement of homes for remote Indigenous communities; and $30 million to build housing and to fund specialist services for veterans. This is a significant day for Australians who need and deserve our support to have a safe and affordable place to call home. The $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund will fundamentally change housing in Australia.

              The fund is a great demonstration of the collaborative approach the Albanese government is adopting, as the government has been working in partnership with the states and territories, local government and the not-for-profit sector to improve housing for Australians. Can the minister please provide an update to the Senate on how the news of the passage of the government's Housing Australia Future Fund has been received by our valued partners?

               for her question, and yes, I can give an answer to that question. I also thank the senator for her respect for the stakeholders who've been so supportive of the Housing Australia Future Fund. Over the last few days we've heard from them about the difference this legislation will make. As Master Builders said:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               The Housing Australia Future Fund legislation is a vital piece in the housing puzzle by encouraging investment in the social and community housing sector.
              </p>
              <p>
               And Kate Colvin from Homelessness Australia said:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               The homes delivered through the HAFF will each make an enormous difference to people who would otherwise be homeless.
              </p>
              <p>
               I want to thank the housing and homelessness sector as well as the building and construction sector and embrace their partnership in the delivery of homes to come from the Housing Australia Future Fund.
