        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition, because of the significant increase in negotiation of bilateral agreements, the review should consider mechanisms to ensure that current legislation/regulation across all jurisdictions, conforms and continues to conform to treaties.

         Response

       <p class="italic">
        The Treaties Council was established according to the Principles and Procedures for Commonwealth-State/Territory Consultation on Treaties, which were adopted by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Australian_Governments" rel="nofollow">
         Council of Australian Governments
        </a>
        (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
         COAG
        </a>
        ) in June 1996.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Council" rel="nofollow">
         The Council
        </a>
        has an advisory function to consider treaties and other international instruments of particular sensitivity to the States and Territories. The Council has in fact convened only once, in November 1997, and its advisory function is primarily performed by the Commonwealth / State and Territory Standing Committee on Treaties (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCOT" rel="nofollow">
         SCOT
        </a>
        ), which meets twice a year (and can meet more frequently if required), and comprises officials representing the Premiers’ and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Ministers" rel="nofollow">
         Chief Ministers
        </a>
        ’ Departments and the Commonwealth Departments of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Attorney-General.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Conducting effective and timely consultation between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories in regard to international agreements, as well as ensuring that legislation across all jurisdictions conforms to concluded treaties, is already a primary purpose of existing consultative mechanisms, including the SCOT. The Government believes that these mechanisms are adequate to achieve their goals, however, a review of the consultative arrangements is currently being conducted by COAG senior officials. The first session, to settle its terms of reference, was held in Canberra on 5 May 2005.

         Recommendation 3
        </b>

          Houses of Parliament

        </dd>
        <dt>
         (c)
        </dt>
        <dd>
         Both Houses of Parliament will then consider the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, and then vote on whether to endorse the Government’s proposal or not.
        </dd>
        <dt>
         (d)
        </dt>
        <dd>
         Once Parliament has endorsed the proposal, negotiations may begin. Once the negotiation process is complete, the Government shall then table in Parliament a package including the proposed treaty together with any legislation required to implement the treaty domestically.
        </dd>
        <dt>
         (e)
        </dt>
        <dd>
         The treaty and the implementing legislation are then voted on as a package, in an ‘up or down’ vote, i.e. on the basis that the package is either accepted or rejected in its entirety.

        <dt>
         (f)
        </dt>

         Australian Constitution
        </a>
        , treaty making is the formal responsibility of the Executive rather than the Parliament. However, the Government considers that it is only proper that Parliament has a role in scrutiny of trade agreements. The constitutional system ensures that checks and balances operate, through Parliament’s role in examining all proposed treaty actions and in passing legislation to give effect to treaties and the judiciary’s oversight of the system. The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties (JSCOT)—a committee initiated by this Government—provides for Parliament’s involvement. In those cases where an agreement might go beyond existing regulation, the Parliament has the right to vote on legislative change required as part of that agreement.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government considers the efficiency and certainty of the current process enables it to negotiate with its overseas counterparts with authority and credibility. This is particularly important in trade negotiations which are often characterised by offers and counter-offers, for which negotiators require some level of flexibility to respond.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government considers the report’s recommendation on trade treaties and the Parliamentary process would be unworkable. It would circumscribe the capacity of the Government to secure the best possible trade outcomes from trade negotiations. It would undermine the Executive’s constitutional authority to sign treaties. Furthermore, it is not clear why trade treaties should receive additional scrutiny to any other treaties.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government is committed to ensuring that information on trade negotiations is made readily available to the community and to consulting those likely to be affected by the Government’s negotiating position. While all treaties are tabled in both Houses of Parliament for at least 15 sitting days prior to binding treaty action being taken, since negotiations for major multilateral treaties are generally lengthy and quite public, parliamentary debate often takes place for a much longer period than this, as the issues become publicly known. In cases when implementing legislation is necessary prior to ratification, Parliament has a further opportunity to debate the treaty. The Government makes its decision on whether a treaty is in the national interest based on information obtained during consultations with relevant stakeholders. Inevitably, the final decision necessarily involves a balancing of competing interests. The Government considers that the objective of ensuring both that the Government is able to energetically pursue opportunities for trade growth, and that appropriate consultation on negotiating objectives is undertaken with the broader community, are best met by current Parliamentary and consultation processes and practices.

        It may be appropriate in some circumstances to request the Productivity Commission to undertake assessment of aspects of trade agreements. It is unlikely that any study could definitively answer all the issues addressed in the recommendations prior to commencing negotiations, in the absence of the detail of outcomes of the agreement. The Government’s approach has been to use economic modelling and analysis prior to agreements as a guide to the potential benefits available from a particular negotiation. At the same time it is conscious that there will be additional benefits and other implications that cannot be captured by economic modelling. In relation to the AUSFTA and other agreements, the Government has consulted extensively to ensure that the fullest possible account is taken of potential impacts of a proposed agreement, in order that relevant concerns and implications are reflected in the government’s objectives and the instructions given to negotiators.

        The Government does not agree with this recommendation. The scheme for limitations on liability of carriage service providers referred to in the response to Recommendation 16 provides legal incentives for carriage service providers to cooperate with copyright owners in deterring the infringement of copyright. The scheme limits the scope of remedies available against service providers where the service provider complies with certain conditions. Therefore, while the carriage service provider incurs costs in complying with the scheme, they derive a benefit by doing so. In these circumstances, it was not considered appropriate that the issuer of the notice be required to reimburse a carriage service provider for reasonable costs incurred in complying with takedown notices. To minimise abuse of the notice and takedown procedure, the scheme provides for remedies against a party issuing a notice who knowingly makes a misrepresentation.

Where a notice of claimed infringement is received from a copyright owner the carriage service provider is required to expeditiously remove or disable access to the material referred to in the notice and no independent assessment of the material is required by the carriage service provider. Expeditious takedown is also required if the carriage service provider becomes aware, by some other means, of facts and circumstances that make it apparent that the material is likely to be infringing. In this case, some assessment is required, but only in relation to the likelihood that the material is infringing.
