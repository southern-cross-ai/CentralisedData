I suppose I would make the observation that it is now Wednesday, we've been here since Monday, and it is regrettable that the government couldn't have progressed this a little more expeditiously. But I do understand that we're at a point now where we can deal with these matters.

             by leave—I'd just point out that there are over 15 bills that are being, effectively, rammed through the parliament. This motion has been circulated only in the last couple of minutes, so it's pretty ordinary conduct on behalf of the government to do this, and it's pretty undemocratic to ram this many bills through in an hour of desperation.

                I'm not impressed at all with the government actually pushing this through. It would've had the support of the Labor Party to do this. Senator Patrick is right: there are about 15 bills that are being passed here. My grave concern is on one of them, the Offshore Petroleum (Laminaria and Corallina Decommissioning Cost Recovery Levy) Bill 2021. That has been stuffed up by government. The fact is that that is costing us $4 million a week, and that should actually be discussed in this parliament to see what is happening there.
               </p>
               <p>
                These bills are going to be pushed through. Senators' statements have been wiped. Also, I've been told I can't do a budget reply speech tonight, because I'm being shut down. As the leader of a political party in this place, I am not being given the opportunity to give that speech tonight and speak on behalf of millions of people. I think that's disgusting.
               </p>
               <p>
                You have shut down this parliament. You have not allowed enough sitting time to deal with your bills that needed to be dealt with before the election. This is not being representative of the people of this nation and it's a disgrace on the Liberal Party and the National Party to actually do it.

                    You've got 15 bills here. You're going to ram it through. We've got the Labor Party here that wants to win an election. Here we go. We've got the same same already. I'm sorry, I just can't distinguish between the two of you. If you get government, is this what it's going to look like? Are we going back to the same thing? Quite frankly, you might as well keep voting for the ones over there. You've got to be kidding here. You have got to be kidding. There are 15 bills here. You're in chaos over there. Some of us would like a reply this evening, and this is how we get treated. How disrespectful! Disrespectful!

We're going to get the same crap in the next three years as we've gotten in the previous three years. It is absolutely shameful.

                        This is no way to legislate and it's no way to run this Senate chamber. There are 20 pieces of legislation covered by this hours motion. They are going to be ultimately, inevitably rammed through without debate. A large number of them are extremely complex, complicated pieces of legislation and, in some cases, they have extremely complex and complicated amendments. I know that Senator Steele-John has particular concerns about the

                        bill, which he has a number of complicated amendments to. I want to place on the record his and the Australian Greens' frustration that those amendments and amendments to other bills are going to be put through this place without adequate debate and the legislation is going to be gagged and put through without adequate scrutiny. Today is a sad day for the Senate.

                         Thank you, Senator Patrick!—so, if there is a requirement for a division, it will have to be deferred. Under the current standing orders, because this motion hasn't been passed, there is no division, so the motion is now carried.

                           Just on the ruling, this motion was moved at the normal point in terms of the transition of debate in the Senate, immediately following the conclusion of a division. To accommodate the wishes of the crossbench to put opinions leave was granted. However, leave was granted in the midst of a motion that had already been moved for the question to be put, and so I would ask that the question be put in accordance with the motion that had been put to the chamber.

                            At the moment, because we are under the current standing order, we are actually at senators' statements. I appreciate you're attempting to move a motion. Under that part of the current program no divisions can take place. We agreed that when we put senators' statements in. However, I understand that a division can take place if leave is granted. Because we don't currently have any amendment before the chair we are at senators' statements. You can allow for a division if a senator seeks leave and that leave is agreed to.

                             I am just seeking clarification. Because no division is allowed I presume that we continue with the current program, is that correct?

                               Just to clarify, I understand you have taken advice and obviously the opposition will support the ruling that's based on the clerk's advice. As I understand it, the fact that this has not been voted on means we now return to the red unamended—the government will have to consider how it wishes to deal with that—which means we'd move to senators' statements now, unless the chamber gives Senator Birmingham leave for the division to occur. I would infer from the previous contributions that that is unlikely to occur.
