        (a) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) in 1770, two members of the Gweagal people stood on the shore of the place now called
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botany_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Botany Bay
        </a>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cook" rel="nofollow">
         James Cook
        </a>
        and some of his crew approached the shore,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) the Gweagal men were holding spears and a shield and they attempted to warn off the interlopers, an action that was responded to with gunfire,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii) one of the men, Cooman, was shot in the leg and he ran for cover, dropping his shield,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iv) this shield and a number of spears and other artefacts from their camp were taken by James Cook and given to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Museum" rel="nofollow">
         British Museum
        </a>
        when he returned there, and the shield and a number of the spears remain in the Museum's collection, and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (v) a significant number of the spears taken are now also held by the Cambridge Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology;

        (b) acknowledges that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) it is a core part of Aboriginal belief that artefacts must be kept on the country they came from, as they form a part of the ongoing story of that place,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) laws covering Aboriginal cultural heritage in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        recognise the strong connection between Aboriginal people, their land and their artefacts, and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii) the Gweagal people and their descendants are the rightful and lawful owners of all artefacts produced on their territory, including the shield and spears held in the British Museum and the Cambridge Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) recognises the work done by Cooman's descendant Mr Rodney Kelly to push for the repatriation of these important artefacts;

        (d) supports the repatriation of these important artefacts to the Gweagal people; and

           The government recognises and acknowledges the strong connection of these artefacts to the Gweagal people of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
            New South Wales
           </a>
           . Australian law recognises the legal title of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Museum" rel="nofollow">
            British Museum
           </a>
           and Cambridge Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology to these artefacts. Therefore, the government cannot agree to the motion's assertion that the Gweagal people are the legal owners of the artefacts.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is encouraging to see institutions such as the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum" rel="nofollow">
            National Museum

           museums to create new opportunities for access to the significant Indigenous objects held in these collections. The government understands that the British Museum has agreed to meet with Mr Kelly to discuss his claims, and it is important that these discussions occur.
