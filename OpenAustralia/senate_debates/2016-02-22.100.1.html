            Since the Australian Building and Construction Commission was abolished, the findings of dozens of court cases illustrate that history was quick to repeat itself and the flagrant disregard of industrial law is as common as ever. The long list of unsavoury actions includes physical and verbal violence, threats, intimidation, abuse of rights of entry permits, secondary boycotts, breaches of fiduciary duty and contempt of court. When the laws are not strong enough to act as a deterrent something needs to be done.

                 , I ask a further supplementary question. Can the minister advise the Senate if there are any other recent cases of unlawfulness on the part of the construction and general division of the

                  There are unfortunately—again, including the proceedings that have now been commenced—currently 81

                  , two divisional presidents, four state secretaries, one national secretary, seven assistant state secretaries, and the list goes on. The courts have imposed almost $7 million in penalties on the CFMEU. The CFMEU is a respondent in 53 matters currently before the courts. The systemic unlawfulness in the construction and general division of the CFMEU clearly demonstrates that the current penalties are seen as nothing more and nothing less than the cost of doing business. This must stop.
