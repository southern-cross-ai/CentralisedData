I know from personal experience that, for our people, having police as first responders is often not helpful but harmful, and sometimes lethal.

        If the government were serious about negotiating with traditional owners or even just negotiating in good faith, they would be properly funding prescribed bodies corporate. They would also be properly funding native title claimants to properly negotiate on an equal footing with the government, as well as funding them to develop community-led land use plans over their country. Most importantly, they would be bending over backwards, just like they do for their big corporate mates, to protect our heritage.
