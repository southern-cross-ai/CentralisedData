        I seek leave to amend business of the Senate notice of motion No. 1 standing in my name and in the names of Senators Ludlam and Lambie for today proposing a reference to the Economics References Committee relating to the 2016 census. I also ask that Senator Dastyari's name be added as a co-sponsor of this motion.

       <p>
        That the following matters be referred to the Economics References Committee for inquiry and report by 24 November 2016:

       <p>
        The 2016 Census, with particular reference to:

        (b) the scope, collection, retention, security and use of data obtained in the 2016 Census;

       <p>
        (c) arrangements, including contractual arrangements, in respect of the information technology aspects of the Census;
       </p>
       <p>
        (d) the shutting down of the Census website on the evening of 9 August 2016, the factors leading to that shutdown and the reasons given, and the support provided by government agencies, including the Australian Signals Directorate;
       </p>
       <p>
        (e) the response rate to the Census and factors that may have affected the response rate;
       </p>
       <p>
        (f) privacy concerns in respect of the 2016 Census, including the use of data linking, information security and statistical linkage keys;
       </p>
       <p>
        (g) Australia's Census of Population and Housing generally, including purpose, scope, regularity and cost and benefits;
       </p>
       <p>
        (h) the adequacy of funding and resources to the ABS;

          This motion in its proposed amended form is in fact a hybrid of this motion and a motion in very similar terms that was to be moved by Senator Dastyari. We share similar concerns over the census and I am pleased that a consensus was reached with this motion.

                I want to echo the comments that were made by Senator Xenophon earlier: that this amended motion is now a hybrid motion of two very similar terms of reference that were placed—a terms of reference placed by the Labor Party and a terms of reference placed by another group of senators. Together, we have been able to bring in the differences. I foreshadow then that, hopefully, we will only be having one inquiry, not two. But we will get to that business soon.

                   I thank the chamber. I would also like to acknowledge Senator Xenophon for bringing these terms of reference forward, and for the collaborative way in which the opposition has sought to make sure that one inquiry, rather than two, is set afoot. Also acknowledging Senator McGrath's comments, I think it will be extremely valuable to the Senate inquiry to have the report, as you indicated, that Mr MacGibbon and his colleagues will be putting together into the technical aspects of what happened on Census night. As you will have seen, if you have seen the terms of reference that have been circulated in Senator Xenophon's, Senator Lambie's and my name, the inquiry that has been referred to the economics committee goes significantly further into the lead-up to the Census and into the steps that were put in place that created such scepticism in the run-up that it may, in fact, contaminate the dataset.

                   Personally, I am interested to know whether the Census is going to be re-run—it is that far-reaching. It is not simply a question of what happened on Census night to blow the process up, but of what happened in the lead-up to take such confidence away from what should have been a completely uncontroversial continuation of the Census process.

                    The question is that the motion, as amended, moved by Senator Xenophon be agreed to.

                    Question agreed to.
