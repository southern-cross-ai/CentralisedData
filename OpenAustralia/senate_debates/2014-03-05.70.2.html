        My question is to Senator Johnston, the Minister representing the Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development. Minister, did the government make an assessment about the impact of job losses and service cuts in regional Australia before rejecting Qantas's request for assistance; and, if not, why not?

         I say to the senator: this government is at all times concerned about regional employment in everything we do. In everything we do, we worry about regional employment. We do not just go and terminate the livelihoods of cattle farmers across the northern part of Australia and leave them to rot, not giving a fig for their livelihoods. Of course we consider regional jobs. Regional jobs are one of the most important considerations that this government has actually put on the table. I find it quite laughable that the senator would get up and ask me a question like that. Everything we do considers regional jobs.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I refer to the Deputy Prime Minister's concern in 2009 that changes to Qantas foreign ownership rules would 'potentially leave Australia without an airline committed to our interests'. Minister, what has changed?

           , someone who most of us hold in high regard, has told you where you should be on this issue. You should produce a level playing field and welcome this government's attempt to do so in a highly competitive commercial market. What is your solution to the Qantas situation?

                     It's puzzling when a party claiming to be progressive wants to compound out-dated interventionism with a market distorting loan guarantee specific to Qantas. This is a step down the Argentine road.

                      My question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister for Employment, Senator Abetz. I refer to the government's economic reform agenda, including its commitment to unshackle Qantas from restrictive government regulation. Can the minister inform the Senate of any new support for the government's commitment to repeal the carbon tax, thereby allowing Qantas to operate more profitably and compete more effectively internationally?

                         senators got over their resentment of the Australia people in their decision of 7 September and actually voted for what the Australian people want—namely, a repeal of the carbon tax.

                        <p>
                         According to Mr Joyce, Qantas is simply unable to recover the costs of the carbon tax through fare increases. So far this financial half year the carbon tax has cost $59 million—

                           in particular simply do not want to hear the truth: the carbon tax is hurting the airline industry to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars each year. And Mr Joyce's comments, of course, come on the back of the comments of the

                           Virgin Australia wants to axe the carbon tax, Qantas wants to axe the carbon tax and Australians want to axe the carbon tax. The only people that refuse to do that which is necessary are the Labor-Green opposition in this place, and they are the ones that are destroying the job opportunities of our fellow Australians.

Let me be very clear: industrial action in these circumstances is in nobody's interest. Indeed, the Qantas situation reminds me of the Tasmanian paper mill situation of two decades ago in Tasmania, where fundamental changes needed to be made. And what did the union movement do? They held a strike; they held a picket. Do you know what happened,

                                   My question this afternoon is to Senator Johnston, the Minister representing the Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development. I refer to comments by the Deputy Prime Minister, who said in December last year that in amending the Qantas Sale Act the majority of Australian people and certainly the majority of people elected to the parliament at the present time—especially in the Senate—do not favour that course of action. Given that only three months have passed, what has changed?

                                    It might come as a surprise to the senator, but the government has changed. We believe in a hand-up and a level playing field, and not a blank cheque of a handout.

This is a commercial entity that must comply with governance rules. The government is not going to hold their hand. The government's responsibility is to provide a legal and regulatory framework within which they can work properly in the commercial environment confronting them.

                                                is right: the party over there has lost its way. I quote him again. He said:

                                               <p class="italic">
                                                It’s puzzling when a party claiming to be progressive wants to compound out-dated interventionism with a market distorting loan guarantee specific to Qantas. This is a step down the Argentine road.

                                                We all know Mr Epstein's history. How is it that he can see what this is about—a commercial entity in the marketplace—yet the opposition in this place wants to start doing what it has always done when confronting every policy, and that is to write cheques. We are not in that business, and the taxpayer at long last can see some semblance of responsibility on the government benches.
