        I want to pay tribute to my dear friend and adviser Fraser Brindley, who died on 9 August, exactly one month before his 50th birthday. Fraser was one of a kind, an immense intellect combined with a warm and generous nature that many people in this building, from political and parliamentary staff to MPs right across the spectrum, have warmly acknowledged these past few weeks. He leaves behind his mother, Helen, and children Via, Isabel, Ursula and Arthur. I want to acknowledge Helen and Via, who are here with us in the chamber today.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fraser was an active participant in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
         Victorian Greens
        </a>
        from the very start. He actually nominated
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Bandt" rel="nofollow">
         Adam Bandt
        </a>
        when Adam first put up his hand for public office. Fraser served for the Greens on both Melbourne City and Moreland councils, where he honed his exceptional political skills. He had a commanding understanding of both policy and politics. He could build bridges, and he frequently did, but he could also find the political fracture points that cracked issues open and mercilessly apply pressure, and he did that too.
       </p>
       <p>
        His various plans and schemes achieved far too many outcomes for me to list in this short tribute.

        and the movements that we represent have lost a great friend and an incredible mind. We will carry his insights and the lessons we learnt from him with us, not just in this parliament but in all the parliaments to follow. We will continue his incredible legacy with the same courageous determination that he brought with him into this building every single day.
       </p>
       <p>
        We love you, Fraser, and we'll miss you. Farewell, my friend.

          I too acknowledge Fraser's mum, Helen, and daughter Via. I thank you for lending us Fraser for so many years. Fraser was loved and appreciated by so many of us in this place, including me. In this contribution I would like to share words about Fraser on behalf of my policy advisor Emma Ball. Emma says:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          I was lucky to know Fraser for about a year, as a mentor and then friend. In that short time he changed my life.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Fraser was kind and generous with his time. He'd do the legwork—like drafting a brief—but sign it off with my name. He'd plan ideas and give me the means to achieve them, but make sure I was the one doing the doing. He'd celebrate my wins with excitement and put my losses into perspective.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Fraser was a brilliant and unconventional thinker. The way he spoke about economics was particularly refreshing. His insights gave me a new lens to view the world's problems and solutions. When I said I wanted to learn more, he took me to the library and we borrowed as many books as we could carry. He believed I had the capacity to teach myself.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          He'd often come to me with an idea, and I'd inevitably respond with: "you want me to do what? That's ridiculous?!" But Fraser's conviction and enthusiasm was contagious. We'd go down a rabbit hole, come out the other side with a plan, and usually manage to pull it off.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Going forward, we will find ourselves asking "what would Fraser do?" In fact, we already said that this week. He'd be resolute that we need to stand our ground, question the status quo, build alliances, fight smarter and always work with humour.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Right now, it feels hard to continue this work without you, Fraser. But deep down I know you've given me all the tools I need. Maybe I'll even find that elusive fourth sector for you.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Rest in Serenity, Fraser. I couldn't have asked for a better friend.
