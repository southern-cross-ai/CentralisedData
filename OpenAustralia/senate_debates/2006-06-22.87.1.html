        My question is to Senator Abetz, the Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation. Will the minister update the Senate on the status of the Howard government’s measure to ensure a sustainable and profitable fishing sector in this country? Is the minister aware of any alternative policies?

         I thank Senator Scullion for his question. I note his interest in, and knowledge of, our important fishing sector. I can inform the Senate that, about half an hour ago, tenders closed for the $150 million Commonwealth Fishing Concession Buyback—the centrepiece of the Howard government’s $220 million Securing our Fishing Future package. The $220 million package, developed by my predecessor, Senator Ian Macdonald, is designed to ensure the long-term sustainability and profitability of our vital fishing industry.
        </p>
        <p>
         Probity requirements mean that I am not informed as to how many fishers have submitted a tender for either a complete buy-out or rationalisation of their fishing business. I can say that the $150 million which the Howard government has put on the table is a once in a lifetime opportunity. In fact, it is the largest structural adjustment package ever offered to the Australian fishing industry. The package was developed in consultation with the fishing industry and was designed to improve the sustainability and profitability of the Commonwealth fishing industry and to ensure that those fishers who want to leave the industry or rationalise can do so with dignity while those who want to remain can better position themselves to be profitable.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is about taking decisive action today to ensure we have a strong fishing industry tomorrow—the long-term, visionary nation-building policies for which this government is recognised. The sad fact is that a number of our Commonwealth fisheries are in trouble. Put simply, there are too many fishermen chasing too few fish. As a result, many fish stocks are under pressure and many fishermen are doing it tough. In recognition of this, Senator Ian Macdonald obtained this generous package.
        </p>
        <p>
         I was asked about alternative policies. Firstly, all sides of this chamber believe that what we are doing is the right course of action, and for that I thank all senators. However, I do want to make the point, particularly to those in this place who want more and more of our fishing resources locked up, that we as humans have an inalienable right to harvest our natural resources in a sustainable way. We as humans are a legitimate part of the ecosystem, and that extends not only to our natural resources on land but also to the resources of the sea. Fishing is a great contributor to our regional economies and seafood is of great benefit to human health.
        </p>
        <p>
         What this package provides, as do other measures such as the new south-east marine protected areas, with which Senator Colbeck was actively involved, is a sensible balance between the legitimate needs and our responsibility to conserve for future generations. This is the hallmark of this government’s approach to managing the environment: balance. We did it in the Tasmanian forests and we are now doing it in our oceans. It is expected that successful tenders to our restructuring package will be announced in early August. I look forward to updating the Senate on the outcomes when we resume at that time.
