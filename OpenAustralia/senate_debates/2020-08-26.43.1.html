        My question is to the Minister for Defence, Senator Reynolds. Can the minister outline to the Senate the economic recovery measures announced by Defence today and how they are contributing to the Morrison government's COVID-19 recovery efforts?

         I thank Senator Molan not only for his service but for his continuing support of our forces—thank you. This morning the Prime Minister and I had the great delight of announcing a $1 billion package to support Australia's economic recovery from COVID-19. This package of 22 discrete projects will support around 4,000 Australian jobs right around our nation while complementing Defence's

        <p>
         Firstly, we are accelerating existing capability projects and programs. This $200 million investment will support 445 Australian jobs. Secondly, we are delivering a national estate works program right across Australia, including in bushfire affected areas. This $490 million investment will support 2,950 Australian jobs. Thirdly, we're enhancing sustainment for existing capabilities. This $200 investment will support 440 Australian jobs. Fourthly, we are also boosting funding for defence industry grants and defence innovation hubs to support businesses, particularly small and medium businesses, to strengthen our skilled defence industry workforce. This $110 million investment will support 150 Australian jobs.
        </p>
        <p>
         I'm so proud and pleased to report that Australia's defence industry here in Australia has demonstrated remarkable resilience and versatility during this pandemic. We have worked very hard to keep defence capabilities, and our Australian economy, moving. I commend the

            Again I thank Senator Molan for his question. Today the Prime Minister and I made the announcement at Datapod, a Canberra based company that's been selected to deliver additional deployable data centres to support defence operations. Datapod is a 100 per cent Australian owned and operated company. This decision will provide job security for Datapod's highly skilled workforce and over 80 manufacturing subcontractors. Datapod is a great Australian success story. It has adapted its business from mining to, now, defence and other industries both here and overseas. Datapod is providing opportunities for some of our most talented young

               say again that I am incredibly proud of our reserve forces, who have made such an important contribution to our nation's defence. They have served with great honour both in operations overseas and increasingly now in domestic support operations such as Operation Bushfire Assist and now Operation COVID-19 Assist.

                Defence Force

               reserves. To support these Defence Force reserves who are now doing it tough during COVID-19, we're increasing the annual reserve days by 210,000 this financial year and we are providing support to recruit an additional 500 Defence reserves. The Morrison government is backing ADF reserves who have lost their primary form of civilian income, and today's measures will ensure we are best placed to meet the high-risk weather season.
