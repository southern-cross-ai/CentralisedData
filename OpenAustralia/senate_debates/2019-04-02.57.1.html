        My question is to the Minister representing the Deputy Prime Minister, Senator McKenzie. The Leader of the Nationals, Mr McCormack, has refused to commit the Nationals to putting
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Nation" rel="nofollow">
         One Nation
        </a>
        last, stating a decision would be made 'closer to election day, when all the candidates are known'. In response to the most extremist positions articulated by One Nation, former Nationals leader
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Fischer" rel="nofollow">
         Tim Fischer
        </a>
        has called for One Nation to pay a price, declaring, 'I'd put them last.' Why is Mr McCormack refusing to demonstrate leadership by committing to put One Nation and extremist parties last?

         Thank you for the question. For your information, Senator Chisholm, the National Party is a federated party. We've been saying this continually. We are a federated party, and that is matter for our state divisions.

          Order! On my left—Senator O'Neill and Senator Wong. Senator Wong, I can't hear Senator McKenzie's answer, so I'm going to have trouble ruling on Senator Chisholm's point of order.

             State divisions will be making decisions on preferences once all candidates are known in seats, and that is entirely appropriate and is what we do each and every time. But I tell you what: we do make our preference decisions based on what is best for regional Australia. The Deputy Prime Minister has been clearly outlining the threat to the two industries that underpin our local economies in regional industry—that actually underpin our national economy—with 70 per cent of our exports: agriculture and mining. I can tell you that those industries, which employ millions of Australians, most of them out in regional Australia, are under threat from the Labor Party and their coalition partner, the Greens. So I would be saying to
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Shorten" rel="nofollow">
              Bill Shorten
             </a>
             : 'If you really back the coalminers of Rockhampton, of Dawson, of Flynn—if you really do—let them know where you stand on preferencing the party that wants them all to lose their jobs.' You just heard the Leader of the Greens stand up in this place and argue for the end of the coal industry, of the mining industry.
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_I" rel="nofollow">

             , I'd be calling Bill Shorten today. I'd be standing up and saying: 'Do you know what? My members deserve to have prosperous, sustainable jobs in the regions as part of a strong, well-regulated mining sector, which has built this economy and built our regional communities.'

                   Again, we have the process. I've laid it out. You're trying to somehow conflate a preference deal with people in the National Party condoning racism, a behaviour we find reprehensible. MP and senator after MP and senator from the National Party have stood up against racism, and have stood up against intolerant, extremist behaviour and comments. But to actually then conflate that with preference decisions that are 'ho-hum, oh-so-boring, what we do every election'—we're not changing our process internally just because you can't actually come clean with who's on the bottom of your preference deals.
