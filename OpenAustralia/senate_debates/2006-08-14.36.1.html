        My question is to the Minister for Immigration and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicultural_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Multicultural Affairs
        </a>
        . Is the minister aware that a mere 18 per cent of refugee arrivals have accessed the short-term torture and trauma counselling service provided as part of the new integrated humanitarian settlement strategy since the contract began in October 2005? Is the minister also aware that 53.7 per cent of entrants under the previous contract accessed the equivalent service? Does the minister know why refugees and humanitarian entrants are not accessing this essential service upon their arrival in Australia? What specific action is the minister now taking to ensure that this problem is addressed?

         I thank the senator for the question; while she has not been in the parliament that long, she has had a consistent interest in refugee resettlement interests. I do not have the specific figures at hand, Senator, but, as you know, we have changed, as your question outlines. There has been a change in the delivery of services, and we expect at any time to have transitional and settling-in issues. The figures you raise are figures that I will have a look at and come back to you with a further answer on.

            Yes, exactly. Mr Robb said that the percentage of people resettled from Africa was around 70 per cent in 2005-06 and that refugees arriving from Africa have higher rates of torture and trauma. Given the high number of refugees arriving from Africa—whom the minister’s own parliamentary secretary recognises as having higher rates of torture and trauma—why is it that still, since October last year, over 80 per cent of arrivals are not accessing the counselling services? Surely this was contemplated when the contract began?

             I thank the senator for the question. Mr Robb is entirely correct in what he says. That is why Australia saves its places for refugees for those most in need. That underlines exactly why we are strong on border control. One of our key reasons is so that spaces are available for those most in need. And why do you think, Senator, that 70 per cent of our refugee intake for the last year has come from Africa? It is because people on this side of the chamber recognise that they are the most in need. The proportion will decline a bit for last year and this year because we have been advised by the United Nations High Commission for Refugees that the Karen people on the Thai border with Burma, or Myanmar, are in similar high need; we expect our refugee intake from that area to increase. So, Senator, to point out that there are people from Africa with high need does not really distinguish them at all from the other refugees that we want to bring in. Australia’s position as the second largest taker of people in need of resettlement is that we will take those in most need first.
