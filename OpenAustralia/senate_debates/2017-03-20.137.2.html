          This motion relates to the vexed issue of ticket scalping and the need for a new approach—a national approach—in respect of it. In respect of the amendment I have just moved from the floor, it is, in substance, substantially in the spirit of the former clause 2 of the amendment, but it does make reference to United Kingdom legislation. I do so after discussions—useful discussions—with the opposition. It was their approach that the motion be amended in those terms to make reference to the United Kingdom and to make reference to the need for legislation along the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
           UK
          </a>
          and the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
           US
          </a>
          lines. It is for those reasons that I move this amendment with such short notice, but it does not affect the substance of the motion because references made to the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom's" rel="nofollow">
           United Kingdom's

          consumer rights act in the substance of paragraph 1 of the motion, in particular 1(f). Essentially that is what this is about.

            <p>
             The Australian Consumer Law already extends to purchasing and onselling tickets. In particular, the prohibition against misleading or deceptive conduct in the consumer guarantee provisions are relevant. There are also a number of state laws and regulations that cover this issue. The
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
              ACCC
             </a>
             is aware of the issues and will continue to monitor them. Senator Xenophon's minority recommendation in the Senate Economics References Committee report that there ought be federal laws amending the Australian Consumer Law to outlaw ticket scalping was not supported as there was no basis for considering a regulatory response at that time.
