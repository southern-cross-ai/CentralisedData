        My question is to the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Sinodinos. I refer to the Assistant Treasurer's responsibility for business law and practice and a statement of ministerial standards which demands that ministers, in their private conduct, must uphold the laws and demonstrate high standards of personal integrity. Can the Assistant Treasurer confirm he was a director of Australian Water Holdings and an office-bearer of the New South Wales Liberal Party at the time Australian Water Holdings was making major donations to the Liberal Party? Does the minister consider that this conduct merits referral to ASIC?

             , on the point of order: clearly Senator Abetz did not listen to the question. The question was about certain corporate conduct and whether the matter should be referred to ASIC. It does not matter whether it was in the previous life of a senator; this is a matter relating directly to corporate conduct, and the minister has responsibility for corporate law. I ask you to dismiss the point of order and ask Senator Abetz to listen to the question in future.

                  Yes, but I do give people the call, if you listen to the way this chamber operates. I have ruled that part of the question that has no bearing on your ministerial responsibility out of order. Only that part that might refer to your ministerial responsibility—

                    , I have a further supplementary question. Can the Assistant Treasurer confirm that, at the time his company was using

                    money to make donations to his party, his company was unable to pay its tax commitments as they fell due? Does the minister consider this conduct merits referral to ASIC?
