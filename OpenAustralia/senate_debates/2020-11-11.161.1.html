           On 19 October 2020 the Minister for Defence made a public interest immunity claim in response to general business notice of motion No. 786. The claim was made on the grounds that provision of the requested document would harm the Commonwealth's ability to achieve value for money, negotiate
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARC" rel="nofollow">
            ARC
           </a>
           arrangements and meet Australia's broader strategic objectives. Commercial-in-confidence and national interest issues are the grounds for public interest immunity and have been recognised by successive governments. The government affirms the public interest immunity claim made by the minister.
