        My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Cormann. New data released today confirms that already stagnant wages growth has slowed further since the election. Can the minister confirm that today's ABS wages data reveals that annual wage growth has fallen to a low of just 2.2 per cent and, at just 0.5 per cent, Australian workers experienced no real wages growth in the September quarter?

         The good news is that wages continue to grow faster than inflation. When Senator Gallagher, in a rather misleading way, seeks to focus on the nominal growth, she ignores the fact that inflation is also comparatively low. What I can confirm is that the wage price index rose by 2.2 per cent through the year to the September quarter; private sector wages grew by 2.2 per cent through the year; the private sector
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WPI" rel="nofollow">
          WPI
         </a>
         , including bonus payments, grew by 2.8 per cent; and public sector wages grew by 2.5 per cent. What I can also confirm is that real wages grew by 0.6 per cent, higher than the 0.4 per cent through the year when Labor lost government, and 0.6 per cent is higher than when Labor lost government and is indeed in line with the 20-year average.

           The 20-year average of real wages growth in Australia is 0.6 per cent. But obviously when inflation runs higher that 0.6 per cent, on average over the long-term, leads to a higher nominal growth figure than it would in the context of the current low inflation environment. That is very obvious. The situation is stronger than it was under Labor.
          </p>
          <p>
           I also make the point that average weekly ordinary time earnings for full-time adults rose by 3.1 per cent over the past year, the strongest growth in six years. And, on 30 May 2019, as you might recall, the independent Fair Work Commission announced its decision to increase the national minimum wage rate by three per cent from 1 July 2019. The increase is higher than the economy-wide wage growth and higher than inflation. And—

             Today's poor wages data is more bad news for hardworking Australians, who are working harder and yet going backwards. After more than six years in office, why does the government still have no plan to deal with low wages?

              When we came into government, we inherited a weakening economy, rising unemployment and a rapidly deteriorating budget position. The unemployment rate is well below where it was when we came into government. Employment growth has been incredibly strong, running at about 2.6 per cent or 2.7 per cent over the last couple of financial years and 2.5 per cent over the most recent year, well above the 1.8 per cent long-term average. I would again refer to what happened to the lowest income earners in Australia under Labor.

                 On the point of order, Senator Wong: I was listening carefully to the minister's answer.

                      Australians are struggling, weak consumption is being driven by stagnant wages, household debt is at record highs, almost two million Australians are underemployed or unemployed, and retail trade has had its worst result since the 1990s recession. When will the Morrison government come up with a genuine plan to restore wages growth, which continues to deteriorate under its watch?

                       I completely reject the premise of the question. Real wages growth is stronger today that it was in Labor's last year in government. And, indeed, we turned around the rapidly rising unemployment rate that we inherited from the Labor Party, with about 1.5 million new jobs created. Workforce participation is the second highest on record, female workforce participation is the highest on record and welfare dependency of the working-age population is the lowest it's ever been.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       But, of course, Australia is facing some global economic headwinds. We are dealing with some significant domestic economic headwinds, including, of course, significant drought in large parts of regional Australia, which is having an impact. And, yet, do you know what? The Australian economy continues to grow. We are in our 29th year of continuous growth. If we had adopted the policy prescriptions of the Labor Party—the socialist, high-taxing, antibusiness agenda that Labor took to the last election—the economy today would be weaker. Employment would be higher, and wages would be lower.

                               Order! On the point of order: I was calling the minister to order, as I do, when the clock hit zero. The point was made by Senator Wong. If there were less noise in the chamber, I am sure people approaching the clock would actually be able to hear my ruling. Senator McMahon.
