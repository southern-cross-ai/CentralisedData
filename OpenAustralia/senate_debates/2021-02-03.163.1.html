           We strongly support the sentiments in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this motion. Australia's priority is to suppress the virus and deliver the vaccine. As the member for Hughes said in a statement today:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           This morning I had a meeting with the Prime Minister.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           The Prime Minister reinforced the importance of ensuring public confidence in the Government's vaccine strategy. I agreed to support the Government's vaccine rollout which has been endorsed by medical experts.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           I have always sought to support the success of the nation's public health response during the pandemic.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           I believe that the spread of misinformation can damage the success of our public health response during the pandemic.

              opposes this motion. Senator Watt is on thin ice talking about mistruths. Only yesterday, Senator Watt said on Twitter that resource workers could rely on Labor. Just two hours later in the Senate he voted against a new coal-fired power station in the Hunter. Senator Watt might be happy to throw beleaguered MP Joel Fitzgibbon under a bus in
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
               New South Wales
              </a>
              , yet the senator threw resource workers in our own state under a bus when he and Labor voted against a coal plant for Collinsville in north Queensland. The truth is that resource workers cannot rely on Labor. That's why Labor is now misdirecting to deflect attention away from selling out the old Labor Party's heartland, the real Labor Party's former base.

               Before I put the motion, I'm going to remind all senators that the privilege of making a one-minute statement on behalf of one's party colleagues is a privilege granted by the unanimous consent of the entire Senate. It is a courtesy that is granted to explain a party's position on a motion that is being put without debate. It is not considered to be an opportunity to debate other matters or indeed to substantially debate the issue itself. Any single senator can deny leave, and I'm not obliged to name the senator that denies leave. I remind senators that this section is one based on courtesy rather than the standing orders.
              </p>
              <p>
               I will now put the motion as requested. I've been asked to put clause (a) separately, so I will put that first. The question now is that clause (a) of the motion standing in the name of Senator Watt be agreed to.
