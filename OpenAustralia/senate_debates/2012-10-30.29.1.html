        My question is to the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_Education" rel="nofollow">
         Tertiary Education
        </a>
        , Skills, Science and Research and Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Evans. Following my colleague Senator Milne's questions yesterday, I also have some questions relating to the Asian century white paper. As one of the first steps towards strengthening its place in the Asia-Pacific region, Australia needs to properly value and resource its public education system. Can the minister guarantee that the government will implement the Gonski review via a significant boost in funding to public schools? Exactly what is the level of this investment, and will it be set out in legislation that comes before this parliament by the end of this year?

         I thank Senator Wright for the question and I am happy to have a go at the answer. I point out, though, that Senator Kim Carr represents the education minister and the portfolio, but I am happy, in representing the Prime Minister, to respond probably in more general terms. I can indicate, as the government have made very clear, that we are absolutely committed to the National Plan for School Improvement arising out of the Gonski report. We are intending to legislate and introduce legislation to support that, and we are intending to make a substantial financial commitment to respond to the Gonski report's assessment that we need to invest more heavily in our schools if we are to lift the standards and opportunity across both the public and the private systems.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are absolutely committed to responding to the Gonski report in a way that makes a real difference for Australian students and helps us to meet the objectives laid out in the Asian century white paper, which has the ambition for us to be among the top five school systems in the world. That is because we understand absolutely the need for Australia to have a highly educated and innovative workforce. That is where Australia's future is. That can only be driven off the back of a quality education system and a system that provides opportunity for all. That is what we are doing in the school system but also in my own area of tertiary education, where we have widened access so as to give everyone a chance to participate in tertiary education if they have the commitment and skills and also to make sure that we are increasingly graduating more people who can contribute to that highly skilled and innovative workforce.

          I thank the minister for his answer and I have a supplementary question, but I note that the minister's answer did not say when or how much, which was what I specifically asked about. To follow up the minister's contradictory comments yesterday about the government's renewed focus on Asian languages despite it ending the National Asian Languages and Studies in Schools Program last financial year, can the minister please provide details of exactly how the government will improve Asian language literacy in schools throughout Australia, particularly public schools? Will this funding be in addition to the Gonski funding?

           I think Senator Wright's question was phrased a little uncharitably, but as I indicated yesterday the $62 million investment for the National Asian Languages and Studies in Schools Program has continued to fund more than 450 projects across schools, universities and language organisations, and this will be continuing to fund activities into 2013. We are absolutely committed to building on that program to support the objectives in the white paper. I point out to the Senate that the white paper is a statement of the government's policy, and the Asian Century White Paper makes it very clear that engagement with Asian languages and culture is a key part of what we are going to need to do as a country to maximise the benefits from this change that is occurring in world economic power.

            , I ask a supplementary question. The Asian century is now—we are actually standing in it. It is time for action, not just aspirations and grand rhetoric. Although the minister has not provided details of action on new funding for public schools or Asian languages, can he at least please provide some time frames for when we will see substantive and not merely aspirational policy announcements on what are very important issues.

             I begin to rile a little bit about being lectured by the Greens on aspirational statements without funding backing them up. I must admit that could get me going a bit, but I will resist the temptation to do that.
            </p>
            <p>
             The white paper is clearly a long-term plan and framework for the direction of Australia. It is deliberately designed to try to build a momentum and a whole reshaping of the way Australia looks at itself and its role, to make sure we focus on the opportunities coming from the Asian century. It is not just about government; it is about a whole shift in mindset throughout Australia. Government will be bringing forward specific propositions that deliver on those objectives, but this is a white paper that was released a couple of days ago, and I think it is fair that we examine that first.
