           The foreign minister has registered Australia's deep concerns about the violence in Rakhine state, including the targeting of civilians. Those responsible for atrocities must be held to account. The foreign minister has called for restraint by Myanmar authorities, the protection of civilians and unfettered access for humanitarian workers. The Australian government welcomes Myanmar's commitment to implement the recommendations of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kofi_Annan" rel="nofollow">
            Kofi Annan
           </a>
           -led advisory commission. Full humanitarian access must be granted promptly. Australia has provided up to $5 million to help respond to the crisis, bringing Australia's assistance for Rohingya and affected communities in Myanmar and Bangladesh to over $50 million since 2012.

              What is happening in Myanmar now is absolutely devastating and is a textbook example of ethnic cleansing. The Rohingya people have lived in Myanmar for many, many generations and are now being run out of that country by the Myanmar government and the Myanmar military. Nearly 400,000 people have fled their homes into Bangladesh since 25 August and many more are still hiding in the mountains. Aid agencies are warning of a humanitarian crisis. The Australian people want our government to act. There has been a petition signed by many thousands of people delivered today. On Saturday, over 1,000 people in Melbourne rallied for the Rohingya people. We must publicly call on
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi" rel="nofollow">
