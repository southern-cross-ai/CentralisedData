       <p>
        [by video link] Dementia is one of the greatest health challenges facing Australia. With 472,000 Australians living with dementia and 1.6 million Australians involved in their care, many Australians, including me, have had some personal experience with the disease. Many people with dementia face stigma and discrimination, which leads to social isolation. This, of course, has been exacerbated by the COVID pandemic.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dementia Australia is working to overcome this with their Dementia-Friendly Communities program. There are currently 51 dementia-friendly communities across Australia, including two in my home state of Tasmania. They involve activities which aim to improve knowledge and awareness about dementia, reduce stigma and discrimination and promote social engagement. One aspect of the program is becoming a dementia friend. So far, 33,000 Australians have signed up as dementia friends and have watched short videos and read resources to better understand how to engage and socially connect with people living with dementia. People with dementia have described dementia-friendly communities as life changing. I congratulate Dementia Australia on this initiative. I'll continue to work with the wonderful Kath Shearer and Di Carter from Dementia Friendly Tasmania to help them maintain a dementia-friendly community in Greater Hobart.
       </p>
       <p>
        With the short amount of time I have left I wish all of my parliamentary colleagues, as well as all my constituents across the great state of Tasmania, a happy and safe Christmas and new year. This will probably be the last speech I make this year. I'm disappointed not to have been able to attend parliament due to my health, but I thank every colleague who sent me well wishes. I'm hoping to be back next year, all going wellâ€”fingers crossed. Also I thank my wonderful staff and my local community for their amazing support throughout the year. I'm looking forward to the new year, to the upcoming federal election and to making my contribution to the election of an Albanese Labor government.
