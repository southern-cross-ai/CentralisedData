         I thank Senator Paterson for that question. I'm pleased to advise the chamber that this year's budget shows that we, as a nation, are turning the corner on Labor's legacy of deficit and debt. Our economy is strengthening, more jobs are being created, our budget is getting back into surplus and we can now start to pay down the debt that was accumulated on the back of unsustainable spending growth locked in by the previous Labor government—in particular by the previous Labor finance minister, Senator Wong.
        </p>
        <p>
         Funding for essential services is guaranteed within the budget through increased revenue on the back of stronger growth—rather than through higher taxes—and more jobs, and by ensuring that the government lives within its means. The budget is the sixth consecutive update that charts a course to surplus by 2020-21. As a country, we are no longer borrowing to fund recurrent expenditure. Real expenditure growth has been limited to 1.6 per cent over the forward estimates per year, the lowest of any government in the last 50 years. Under Senator Wong, it cost four per cent per year on average above inflation.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are projected to pay down more than $232 billion of government net debt over the next decade, taking government net debt down to 3.8 per cent as a share of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
          GDP
         </a>
         over the medium term. The budget is projected to return to balance in 2019-20, one year earlier than previously expected, and with surpluses growing to more than one per cent of GDP from 2026-27.

            As a result of our sound economic and fiscal management, we are now able to provide tax relief to reward and encourage working Australians: to help them deal with cost-of-living pressures; to address bracket creep, which is a drag on economic growth; and to simplify the tax system. Our seven-year personal income tax plan prioritises low- and middle-income earners, who will be provided with tax relief of up to $530 per year. Our plan also delivers a tax system that encourages aspirational Australians to get ahead, to take on additional work and to seek advancement knowing they can keep more of their extra income. We're extending for a further year the $20,000 instant asset write-off for small businesses with a turnover of up to $10 million, and, of course, we have legislated tax cuts for small and medium-sized businesses.

               The biggest risk to our economy, to jobs and to getting the budget in a stronger position into the future is Mr
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Shorten" rel="nofollow">
                Bill Shorten
               </a>
               . We have to remember that when Mr Bill Shorten and Mr Chris Bowen lost government in 2013 they left behind a weakening economy, rising unemployment and a rapidly deteriorating budget position that was deteriorating by $3 billion a week. They haven't learnt from their past mistakes. Bill Shorten's anti-growth, anti-jobs agenda would take Australia back to where we were in 2013: a weakening economy, rising unemployment and a rapidly deteriorating budget position, because lower growth means less revenue for government and higher expenditure on people on unemployment benefits, and that is precisely what Labor caused when they last were in government. That is not where Australia needs to go.

                My question is to the Minister for Finance, Senator Cormann. In question time yesterday, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer both refused to tell the parliament the separate cost of each of the three steps of the Turnbull government's personal income tax plan. Will the minister now tell the Senate the separate cost of each step of the government's seven-year personal income tax plan?

                 We have provided information to the parliament and to the Australian people in relation to the cost of our measure on the same basis that that sort of information has been provided by governments of both political persuasions over a very long time. Indeed, it is entirely consistent with the Charter of Budget Honesty. The cost over the forward estimates is $13.4 billion, and in an abundance of openness and transparency we've also let the Australian community know that the cost of our income tax relief package for hardworking Australians is $140 billion over the medium term.

                   In question time yesterday the Treasurer twice refused to provide the parliament with the year-by-year cost of the government's personal income tax plan over its seven years. Will the minister now tell the Senate the year-by-year cost of the government's personal income tax scheme over those seven years?

                    We've done better than that. Instead of providing the information over seven years, we've provided it over the medium term, which is budget year plus 10. Over the budget year plus 10 the cost is $140 billion. This is the latest shifty political strategy by the Labor leader, a Labor leader who wants to increase taxes on every Australian, a Labor leader who wants to increase taxes by more than $220 billion on electricity, driving up the cost of electricity; on small and family business; on investments; on income; on housing; on savings; and on retirees. There is nobody in the Australian community who would be safe from Labor's high-taxing agenda, which would hurt the economy, hurt families and cost jobs. This is all just a great Labor diversion. Labor yesterday was found out.

                      Why is the government refusing to tell the parliament and Australians how much its enterprise tax plan will cost, how much each element of its personal income tax plan will cost and how much it's personal income tax plan will cost each year? Does the Turnbull government think that the parliament and the Australian public don't deserve to know how much its policies will cost?

                       What the Australian people want to know is whether or not the Labor Party is going to stand in the way of income tax relief to reward and encourage hardworking Australian families. Is the Labor Party going to support our plan for lower taxes for hardworking Australians, or are you going to push higher taxes, again, on every Australian? That is what the Australian people want to know. They're not interested in your political games. We have a leader of the Labor Party who every Australian now knows cannot be trusted.

                          please finish the ruling, and then make another point of order if you want. The minister was directly addressing the question—not in the term that all senators may like—at the commencement of his answer. He has 14 seconds to return to that.

The Australian people know they can't trust a single word he's got to say. This is all just part of the distraction.
