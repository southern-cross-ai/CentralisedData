         Pricing carbon is a major economic reform and it is one that should be undertaken in an economically and fiscally responsible manner. Regrettably, that is not something that the opposition is doing, because what has been disclosed today is that the opposition’s so-called direct action policy will in fact cost nearly three times more than they told the people before the last election—in fact, $20 billion more than they costed at the last election. How embarrassing. This party pretends to be—

          How embarrassing: a party that claims to be fiscally responsible now is found out, now is caught out. A policy that was supposed to cost just over $10 billion will in fact cost $30 billion, another addition to your budget black hole. How embarrassing. One wonders what happened. Did Mr Robb not check the figures before the policy was released before the last election? Did they all—Senator Cormann and others—just rely on Mr Hunt to do it right? Well, he has led you up the garden path, and it is utterly embarrassing.

              , I understand why they want to shout, because they do not want to hear this because it is embarrassing. You go to the last election and you say, ‘We’re going to meet the five per cent reduction by 2020.’ You say, ‘We’re going to cost it at $10-and-a-bit billion.’ You are now found out: $30 billion, a $20 billion black hole on top of your previous black holes, and this is the coalition that already started behind the eight ball. You already had a budget black hole; you are just adding to it.

                Not only would the coalition’s so-called direct action plan increase the budget black hole; it will also leave the average Australian family some $720 worse off. That is because your plan takes from taxpayers and gives to polluters, with very little environmental gain. It is inefficient. That is $720 per year that the average Australian family will be worse off under your policy. So, next time you do one of your stunts and go along to a fruit stall, picking up apples and saying, ‘Oh, these will be more expensive,’ why don’t you tell the truth and say, ‘What we’re actually going to do is put our hands into the wallets and the purses—

                      Why wouldn’t the opposition be upfront and say, ‘Actually, our policy is to put our hands in the purses and the wallets of Australian families and hand it to polluting companies for questionable environmental gains’? That is your policy.

                        and Energy Efficiency say it is not a good idea. Where are the economists who say it is a good idea? Really, I think Mr Turnbull had it right. Mr Turnbull essentially said that there are no economists who can be found to support your policy. You are a party that pretends to be economically and fiscally responsible. You have put forward a policy with a bunch of black holes associated with it, which will cost three times more than you told the Australian people, $20 billion more—$720 from Australian families—and you have no economic basis, no economic credibility and no economic rigour to your policy whatsoever. And Mr Turnbull and other people in your party know it.

Is the minister aware of a national survey that has found that 83 per cent of businesses intend to pass on the cost of Labor’s carbon tax through increased prices?

                                           I am asked about price impacts. As the Prime Minister has said, once you price something that is currently free, which is polluting, there will be price impacts. The carbon price is paid by big polluters but, yes, we have acknowledged there will be price impacts, which is why, under the approach we will be taking, households will get assistance. The Prime Minister has been clear about that. For Senator Bernardi’s information, it is one of the key differences between the government’s approach as proposed and the opposition’s approach. The opposition takes from taxpayers and gives to polluters. The government levies a charge on pollution, recognises the price impacts and provides assistance to Australian households. No amount of the sort of scaremongering and inaccurate information that Senator Bernardi and others in the opposition put forward will make us resile from this basic fact: we want to price carbon. If you do not price carbon, you do not effectively tackle climate change. There will be price impacts. The government has said that, which is why we have also said that we would be looking, as the first priority, to assist households.

                                            , I thank the minister for the answer and I ask a supplementary question. Given that the government intends to compensate Australians for the cost of this tax, isn’t this just a massive exercise in socialist wealth redistribution, driven by a Greens ideology through an inefficient bureaucracy at the cost of millions of dollars to Australian businesses?

                                                     , I ask a further supplementary question. Given that this carbon tax will cost Australian households as well as businesses millions of dollars, why is the government introducing a tax that will destroy Australian jobs, hurt Australian families and fail to achieve its stated goal of emissions reduction?

                                                      The government have made clear our view that climate change is a challenge that needs to be responded to. We believe that pricing carbon is an important economic reform. We believe that the most efficient way of doing that is to put in place a market mechanism to impose such a price and to ensure that there are proper measures to assist households as well as businesses through the transition. This is about meeting one of the challenges of today that is a challenge of tomorrow. It is about looking to the future. It is about trying to ensure in years to come that we look back and we say, ‘We did manage the transition to a clean-energy, low-pollution economy’—whereas people will look back on this
