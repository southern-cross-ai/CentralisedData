        My question is to the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Johnston. Will the minister provide details of what the government is doing to combat the devastating effects of illicit drugs within the community? And how is the government going about detecting the importation of drugs into Australia?

         I thank Senator Patterson for her outstanding contribution in this place over many years and particularly for her longstanding interest in the area of combating the deleterious effects of illegal drugs in our community. I can tell all senators that the government will do everything, and is very committed to doing so, to win the battles in the war against drugs in our community.

           I am pleased to say that yesterday officers of the Joint Asian Crime Group took part in a successful operation which culminated in the seizure of 141 kilograms of cocaine, with an estimated street value of approximately $68 million. This is the fifth largest cocaine seizure in Australia, which will put a significant dent in the trafficking of illicit drugs into Australia. This successful operation testifies to the technology, the dedication and the teamwork of all members of the Joint Asian Crime Group.

              revealed a white powder concealed in the subframe of one of the systems, and initial testing identified that powder as cocaine.

                   Australian Federal Police
                  </a>
                  ’s extensive and effective international network as part of the investigation to identify the man allegedly involved. By using the combined expertise of the various agencies that are members of the Joint Asian Crime Group, we have been able to disrupt the importation of a very significant amount of cocaine, the fifth-largest ever, into Australia. This successful operation demonstrates clearly the strength of inter-agency cooperation both internationally and between federal and state agencies. I can report to the Senate that, since our first day in office, the government have taken a very strong and tough stance on drugs. I make no apology for that. The government will continue to maintain our strong stance in the fight against this insidious scourge in our community.

                   Indonesian National Police

                  , which resulted in the discovery and seizure of one of the world’s largest clandestine laboratories. On 4 December 2006, a passenger on a flight from Bangkok was apprehended with 696 grams of heroin. On 15 November 2006, a passenger on a flight from Thailand was apprehended with approximately two kilograms of heroin concealed in luggage. The fight goes on. We are winning the fight and we will continue the fight.
