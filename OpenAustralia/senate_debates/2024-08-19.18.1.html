        I seek leave to move a motion relating to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Greens
        </a>
        and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
         CFMEU
        </a>
        , as has been circulated in the chamber.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave not granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        Pursuant to contingent notice standing in my name, I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent me moving a motion to provide for the consideration of a matter—namely, a motion to allow a motion relating to the Australian Greens and the CFMEU to be moved and determined immediately.
       </p>
       <p>
        The motion circulated in this chamber seeks to highlight what has been a very conspicuous silence from the Australian Greens in relation to the CFMEU and seeks to draw out the position of the Australian Greens in relation to the CFMEU and particularly in relation to taking donations from the CFMEU.
       </p>
       <p>
        The main story of the whole CFMEU saga of lawlessness, thuggery and corruption has, of course, been the absolute failings within the CFMEU, the damage it's caused to the building and construction industry, and, of course, the shameful neglect of the Labor Party over the years in relation to their engagement with their partner, in the CFMEU. But underneath that main story there has been a subplot, and that subplot is the tale of the magical missing Australian Greens. Maybe the magical missing Australian Greens are on some of their magic mushrooms or the like. But the reality is: the Greens have been suspiciously, conspicuously, totally absent from the debate about the CFMEU, and I move this motion to really present the question of why: Why have the Greens checked themselves out of this debate? What is their real position? Why the silence from the Greens? Why won't they stand up to union thuggery? Why won't they stand up to union corruption? Why won't the Greens stand up to union lawlessness? What is it that the Greens are hiding in their silence?
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greens" rel="nofollow">
         The Greens
        </a>
        have long lined up with Labor to oppose tackling corruption and problems in the construction industry. The Greens were there opposing the establishment of the Australian Building and Construction Commission. The Greens were there opposing the establishment of the Registered Organisations Commission. The Greens were there opposing and, tragically, defeating the ensuring integrity legislation brought to this parliament. So the Greens have been there at every step of the way, blocking every single effort to try to hold corruption, lawlessness and thuggery in the union movement to account. The Greens have been there every step of the way in that regard. Of course, if they hadn't been and if they had engaged constructively on these issues over the years, then the CFMEU, its members, Australia's building and construction industry and Australia's productivity would not be facing the same sorts of problems today as we are, because of the opposition of Labor and the Greens acting in concert to stymie any and all action.
       </p>
       <p>
        But all of that opposition over the years that we'd been accustomed to—seeing the Greens and Labor sidle up on these matters—has gone from bad to worse through the course of this last year in particular. We saw in relation to the demerger legislation that passed through this parliament, with the government and the opposition working to pass that demerger legislation, that the Greens remained an obstacle to that every single step of the way—never mind those workers who had argued strongly for their rights to be able to get out of the CFMEU and to be able to get away from it. No, the Greens wanted to force them to stay in place, suspiciously blocking and delaying the demerger legislation. Now, in relation to the administration legislation, there is an effort—insufficient though we think it may be, it is at least an effort—to try to clean up the problems in the CFMEU.
       </p>
       <p>
        From an opposition perspective, we've engaged with the government. We've negotiated amendments. Those negotiations are continuing. We want to see this legislation passed. We want to see legislation passed that is strong, gives guarantees that this administration will work, gives guarantees it will clean up the CFMEU and ensures that, when it comes to the duration of administration, the transparency of administration or political donations, these are dealt with before the legislation passes, such that we can all have confidence.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Greens aren't part of those negotiations. Do you know how many Greens senators have spoken on the legislation to date? Absolutely none—not one of them has spoken on the legislation to date. I cannot think of another example where the Greens have been so conspicuously and so suspiciously silent. The Greens' silence leaves us all asking: Why? Do we need to follow the money trail? Where do they stand on political donations?

         I'll indicate briefly two points. The first is that the government denied leave because we don't believe the Senate's time should continually be taken up by suspensions. We want to get on with debating legislation. I do think it's interesting that the opposition want to talk about this but not actually talk about how we might regulate the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
          CFMEU
         </a>
         . I hope for your sake that the delay over the weekend, which has been caused by Senator Cash's stubbornness, has not led to money being transferred that we then find out about.

            <p>
             We have been clear on that too. The second point I would make is that the government is minded to support the motion, and I would propose to Senator Birmingham that we allow one more speaker from the government on the substance. We would allow a speaker from the Greens, and then we would put the motion to have the vote because we don't want legislative time taken up by further debate on this suspension.

                    I've put a proposition to the chamber. It didn't include a further speaker from the opposition, for the reasons I've outlined. I'm suggesting a speaker on the substance from the government and the Greens, and then that the motion be put.

                     is proposing in relation to the suspension motion. I seek to understand what is being proposed if the suspension motion is carried, as the Leader of the Government in the Senate seems to indicate that the government's predisposition is to allow it to pass. What is the government's position in relation to the substantive motion? Obviously, it would then be moved by the opposition. There would be—

                      This motion is an extraordinary misrepresentation of the position adopted by the party. Rather bizarrely, the motion is being moved to prevent the second reading contribution that I'm keen to give on the bill. Rather than me being able to give a second reading contribution on the bill, we're dealing with a suspension motion. The suspension motion will then become a substantive motion. The substantive motion will then take an hour and prevent a substantive contribution to the second reading debate. Is that seriously the coalition's point? Do you want to spend the next hour preventing the second reading contribution that I want to give on the bill by saying, 'We're not giving a second reading contribution on the bill'? Who in your tactics team came up with that grand plan? No wonder there's a sea of media representatives out there—

                        They are watching Senator Birmingham's cunning plan to prevent me speaking on a bill and saying that you want to prevent us speaking on a bill. Look at the sea of cameras waiting to see the cunning Birmingham plan, saying how you're preventing me from speaking on a bill. You want me to speak on a bill, but you don't want me to speak on the bill. And you want to have another debate after this, to prevent me from speaking on the bill. Who is the genius in the coalition party room who came up with this? All credit to you. It's probably the same genius who's giving Senator Watt the idea to respond to a substantive issue with memes. The government's response to a substantive issue, and issues of principle, is a bunch of Labor Party memes.

There are no doubt issues—and we would like to get to this discussion in the second reading debate—incredibly important and very concerning issues about union behaviour. They're absolutely, deeply concerning. But we're not talking about them now; we're talking about the

We very much encourage both the coalition and the Greens to support the legislation and also to stop putting up delaying tactics, like the one that we're in at the moment, so we can get onto that legislation. Having said all of that, we will be supporting the motion moved by Senator Birmingham because we do think that it is a valid question. We do think it is a valid question: why are the Greens so unwilling to support legislation that would enable the CFMEU to be put into administration? I think the answer lies, probably, in a sound, and that sound is 'cha-ching'. It's the money. It's the money that the Greens so desperately want. We know, Senator Shoebridge, that you more than anyone have been running around parliament telling everyone that you're looking forward to taking money off Labor and into the Greens' pocket. We know that.

                                            The point of order is: misleading the Senate. There are multiple standing orders that the minister just offended, and, as my colleague just contributed, you're the ones that have been taking the money, not us. So how very dare you make those baseless allegations? Retract them now.

There's a very easy way for the Greens to demonstrate that they do oppose violence in the workplace: they could vote for our bill. There's a very easy way that they can demonstrate that they oppose misogyny in the workplace: they can vote for our bill. But they don't want to do that, and why is that? They want the money that comes from it.

Senator Birmingham made the point that in the entire debate about this bill, which is now into its third day I think, we haven't heard a single Greens speaker, up until now, debate this bill. They keep pushing and pushing themselves down the list, desperately hoping that they won't have to reveal their position. It would be nice to hear from the Greens as to why they don't actually support this bill, but, instead, they've spent the best part of three days curling up into a little ball, hoping that this argument can avoid them and hoping that they don't have to take a position. Well, I'm sorry, but you're going to have to take a position. You're going to have to take a position on whether you're prepared to support the government to clean up the CFMEU once and for all, to stamp down and stamp out violence, thuggery, corruption and criminality in the workplace that, unfortunately, have infiltrated a very strong and important union in Australia and that need to be dealt with. You do have to take a stand, and that time will come when we do get to a vote on this bill, as I hope that we will be doing, coalition, sooner rather than later.

I'm not going to disclose the negotiations that have been underway with the Greens about this legislation, but I did notice an article in one of today's papers saying that the Greens have admitted that their concern about our legislation is:
                                                                 </p>
