         May I thank Senator Fawcett for his question and also take this opportunity to very briefly acknowledge the deep and longstanding interest of our colleague Senator Back, who has today announced his retirement from this place, in matters of defence. Your contribution, Senator Back, will be surely sorely missed.
        </p>
        <p>
         Thank you, Senator Fawcett. I can indicate that during the recent
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AUSMIN" rel="nofollow">
          AUSMIN
         </a>
         talks in Sydney last week we of course affirmed that our alliance with the United States is at the core of our defence and security arrangements. We in Australia are of course responsible for our own security and our own prosperity; there is no higher task for government. But we are stronger when we work with our partners and our allies to address these challenges. The strength of our alliance with the United States is based on shared values, including our strong commitment to the security, stability and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific region. Indeed, as the Prime Minister said in his statement on national security today, our regional strategic environment is more uncertain than it has been in 75 years.
        </p>
        <p>
         These commitments and shared values were underscored during the AUSMIN meeting, which was held, as I said, in Sydney last weekâ€”the first under the new US administration. It is our premier forum for discussing bilateral foreign affairs, defence and strategic issues. Our recent meeting was very timely, given the dynamic strategic environment in which we find ourselves in this region and more broadly. The meeting with foreign minister,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Bishop" rel="nofollow">
          Julie Bishop
         </a>
         ,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Secretary_of_Defense" rel="nofollow">
          US Secretary of Defense
         </a>
         , Jim Mattis, and US Secretary of State,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Tillerson" rel="nofollow">
          Rex Tillerson
         </a>
         , again underscored the strength and breadth of our unique relationship as we committed to further developing our interoperability, continuing our close collaboration across a range of key foreign affairs and defence issues.

         for Defense and I also focused on addressing the rising threat of violent extremism in our region. It is an issue I have raised repeatedly at each counter-Daesh coalition ministers meeting, chaired by the US Secretary of Defense, since I was appointed in this role.

            Indeed, we are focused on measures to address violent extremist organisations in this region, as I adverted to in my previous answer. We are also working through the alliance more broadly to make a significant contribution to regional security. During the consultations the secretary and I affirmed our joint commitment to fully implement the Force Posture Initiatives in northern Australia. It is a very valuable opportunity to not only improve the capability of our own forces, but also to improve our ability to respond to regional crises and to deepen our Defence engagement with regional militaries. In fact, during the current marine rotation we will conduct approximately 10 major exercises, and, in that context, engage a range of our regional neighbours including China, Indonesia, Japan and
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
             New Zealand
            </a>
            . In 2017 we have also seen the commencement of the Enhanced Air Cooperation initiative, which will further increase our air interoperability with the United States. Out of this and our other activities, we will continue to work together with our partners and allies across the Indo-Pacific to ensure stability and prosperity of our region.

               As very close allies we already have, between our armed forces, a high level of interoperability that allows us to work seamlessly together as we are doing, for example, in the

                Middle East

               . At last week's

                AUSMIN
               </a>
               meeting the secretary and I committed to further strengthening that interoperability, and, importantly, to continuing our close cooperation on capability development and defence technology. Over the coming years Australia will continue to invest alongside the United States in platforms and equipment, which will provide us with unparalleled interoperability in the years ahead. For example, through our Naval Shipbuilding Plan and the Future Submarine program we will ensure our future maritime forces can work together seamlessly.
              </p>
              <p>
               Later this month we will commence the landmark Australia-US Exercise Talisman Saber in

               : over 30,000 troops, 35 ships, and 150 aircraft all working together to increase that operability and that ability to seamlessly integrate as required. The exercise platform is a very effective way of doing that.
