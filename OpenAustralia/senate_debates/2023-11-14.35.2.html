        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong, and relates to the High Court's ruling on immigration detention. This morning the
        <i>
         Australian
        </i>
        newspaper reported that one of the individuals released from immigration detention following the High Court's ruling last week is 'a violent sex predator with a record of attacking elderly women in their own homes so chilling a judge branded him "a danger to the Australian community"'. Today the
        <i>
         Guardian
        </i>
        newspaper reported that one of the detainees who was released was convicted of two counts of rape and one of sexual assault. The
        <i>
         Gua
        </i>
        <i>
         rdian
        </i>
        reports that the offence occurred at the victim's workplace when he held the victim 'up against a shelf in a blind spot without cameras in a retail store about 4 pm on a Thursday afternoon'. Last night the
        <i>
         Australian
        </i>
        newspaper reported that one of those released was a person who was convicted of abducting a 28-year-old woman and 'fatally shooting her in a forest on the outskirts of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur" rel="nofollow">
         Kuala Lumpur
        </a>
        and blowing up her body with military-grade explosives'. What other types of offences were committed by those who have now been released?

         I thank the senator for his question. I would make the point that the individuals who have now been released as a result of a High Court decision—which the government took a different view on in terms of the submissions; we expressed a different view—were obviously in detention at the time and no action was taken by those opposite to remove them from Australia. Of course, the Leader of the Opposition was the Minister for

           You tell me. Why couldn't they be? I'll take that intervention. Maybe you should ask Mr Dutton that. Why could they not be removed from Australia? He didn't choose to take those steps.

             I refer to the Leader of the Government in the Senate's failure to answer a question from Senator Cash yesterday relating to the High Court ruling on indefinite detention. What are the consequences if one of the 80 people so far released under the High Court's orders violates the visa conditions the government has imposed on them? Can they be detained for breaching those conditions?

               Well, I would like to invite you, if you would like to, to make a contribution about what you would do if faced with this High Court decision, bearing in mind that these people were in detention under your watch, and no resettlement, removal from Australia, was arranged.

               Such conditions can include the restriction of types of employment, requiring regular reporting to authorities and requiring released detainees to report their personal details, including social media profiles, which are being actively monitored. In addition, the government has imposed daily reporting requirements for those with the most serious criminal history. This is in addition to any reporting requirements or orders imposed by state or territory laws.

                 Minister, your government has moved with lightning speed to release these individuals in advance of the High Court's reasons. Australians now need to live with this risk, but the community still has no idea what you're going to do to protect them. Why can't you tell us what concrete steps you are taking? Why are you so quick to release these detainees but so slow to protect Australians?

This is a constitutional democracy, whether we like the decision of the High Court or not.
