We said parent power rather than Canberra control. What we will be doing with this new funding—and might I add replacing funding that the then Minister for Education, Mr Shorten, ripped out of the funding envelope with the connivance of the then minister for finance, who has been similarly rewarded by a leadership position in this place. So the two leaders of the

Is the promise to guarantee no school will be worse off, or is the new promise—to cover a broken promise—that there is no need for a school to be worse off under your broken system?

                   Those of the 'there will be no carbon tax under a government I lead' party hardly come into this debate with any credibility when it comes to honouring promises to the Australian people. The leader of the opposition can turn her chair around because we know well and truly who was the architect of that disastrous Labor policy.

                     , I rise on a point of order relating to relevance. It was a specific question about a promise. We are waiting to hear that answer.

                      There is no point of order at this stage. I believe the minister is addressing the question. The minister still has 36 seconds remaining.

                       I can understand the Labor Party's sensitivity in relation to the 'no carbon tax' promise because that was the issue on which they lost the last election, and they are still going to stand in the way of its repeal in this place, in the event that media stories are correct.

                      <p>
                       Coming to the specific issue of education, can I indicate to the honourable senator and leader of the opposition that we are a party—I have said this before and I will continue to say it—that has every intention of keeping our promises.
