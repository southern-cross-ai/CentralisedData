        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Senator Ronaldson. Under the previous government, the Enterprise Connect program provided almost $1.4 million to 104 small-to-medium firms in Tasmania to help improve their business performance. Minister, given the continuing job losses in this region, why has the government automatically excluded these Tasmanian firms, and any others previously assisted by Enterprise Connect, from the Entrepreneurs' Infrastructure Programme unveiled last week?

          thank the senator for the question. I am not entirely sure whether that was a full saving or a reduction. But if you are telling me it was a reduction, then I am prepared to accept that. But if I can please just turn, if I may, to the situation in Tasmania and what the government is doing in relation to Tasmania itself. You have asked me a question about what needs to be done in Tasmania. As the honourable senator would appreciate, the Tasmanian economy, as a result of 16 years of Labor and then a Labor-Greens alliance, has the highest unemployment in the country and the lowest retention rates in the country. And that is why we have put together the Tasmanian Major Projects Approval—

                   copper mine on Tasmania's west coast. The west coast is an important part of the Mersey-Lyell region, which is already identified as one of the most economically vulnerable in Australia. Why is the government cutting vital assistance to small employers in this region?

                    Thank you, Senator. But if you are going to look through the budget papers, can I suggest that you do not selectively pull out things for political purposes. The Entrepreneurs' Infrastructure Programme is a $484 million program. The Industry Skills Fund, which, of course, will benefit everyone in Tasmania, is part of the government's initiatives. What we are not prepared to do is sit back and watch what happened over the last six years in relation to these plethora of programs that were achieving nothing but costing a lot.

                   <p>
                    You asked me about the copper mines of Tasmania. As you know it—oh, you did not ask me about that; I am terribly sorry!

                     . The point of order is around relevance. My question was: why is the government cutting vital assistance to small employers in this region? And I would ask that the minister be directed to answer.

                        , I ask a further supplementary question. Given the economic challenges facing Tasmania's Mersey-Lyell region, can the minister guarantee that the innovation centre in Burnie will remain open to assist small-to-medium businesses in that area?

                         ) ( ): Clearly, the honourable senator would know that, as the representative minister, I will have to take that on notice. But what I do not need to take on notice is a question on some of the initiatives in this budget that are going to help the people of Tasmania. I do not need to tell you—and if you have not read it, you should do so—but you should look at the government's proposals for Tasmania. There is a quite specific Tasmanian project office which is going in there.It is a quite specific attempt to undo 16 years of diabolical mismanagement by a party of which you are a part.
