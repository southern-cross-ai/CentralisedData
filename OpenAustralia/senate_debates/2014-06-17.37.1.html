         I thank Senator Stephens for her question. If one wanted to talk about money being removed from schools funding in Australia, I think the best place to start would be the removal of $1.2 billion from schools funding by the previous government when they failed to reach agreement with all the states and territories. That would have meant there was no additional funding for students in Queensland,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         —a small technical point that it appears those on the other side are trying to avoid. What is in fact the case with our education announcements in the budget is that we are investing a record amount of $64½ billion in recurrent funding for government and non-government schools over the next four years. The coalition has not only matched school funding dollar for dollar over the quadrennium of the previous government but increased it. That includes $1.2 billion for schools, from 2014 to 2017, over and above the funding committed by the previous government.

            do not miss out. That of course means—

             New South Wales
            </a>
            were in a good position, the position that was committed to by the previous government. The position now sees the other states and territories—which were not included by the previous government;, and $1.2 billion was removed from that funding—on an equal footing with states like New South Wales,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
             South Australia
            </a>
            and so on. That is the most important aspect of our funding program—to ensure that we are increasing funding, which we are, by a record amount of $64.5 billion in recurrent funding for government and non-government schools over the next four years.

              I thank Senator Stephens for her supplementary question. I think it is very important for the chamber and those opposite to recognise that schools in Australia, no matter what state or territory we are talking about, have not been short-changed. We have met our commitment to provide funding certainty over the next four years from 2014 to 2017. As I said in my previous response, this is $1.2 billion more than schools would have received under the previous government. That is a convenient omission that they continue to make.

               , on relevance: this is the second occasion on which this minister has been specifically asked whether she agrees with the assessment by her colleague Minister Piccoli that schools in regional areas, as well as disadvantaged and Aboriginal students, will be the hardest hit. That is the only question that she was asked in the first supplementary. She has not come close to that question. I ask her to return to the subject matter, which she is trying to avoid, about which she was asked.

I ask: won't cutting funding for regional schools for learning support for children with special needs and Indigenous students force up the costs of regional university courses and hurt people in

                   Let me refer initially to funding for students with a disability—students with special needs, in large part. The Australian government has already introduced a funding loading to support students with a disability, which began this year, 2014. It has provided for students with a disability, no matter where they live or where they go to school, so an assertion that students in regional areas with special needs are somehow disadvantaged by those opposite's interpretation of the government's budget measures is in fact fallacious and should be rejected. It is a scare tactic. It is not going to work, because it is simply not true. That is the bottom line. Those opposite do not want to think about the truth or utter the truth; they wanted to avoid the question.
