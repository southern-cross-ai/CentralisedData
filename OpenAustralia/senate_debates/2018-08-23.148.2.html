        That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Education and Training (Senator Birmingham) and the Minister for Indigenous Affairs (Senator Scullion) to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today.
       </p>
       <p>
        Let me say from the outset: the members opposite were unable to explain to this Senate how many ministers there are in the—is it the Turnbull government? Just tell us. That's what you're there for. You're there to take questions on notice, to stand and defend what is meant to be the government of this country, to be able to say to this Senate that you know the answer to that question. And then we heard the Minister for Indigenous Affairs go through a rollcall of what was important about the coalition relationship, when even he could not even say who the Nationals would support, in terms of a Prime Minister for this country. The minister,

        , could not stand up and support the Prime Minister,

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nationals" rel="nofollow">
         The Nationals
        </a>
        say they won't enter into the debate. We heard that in the minister's reply this afternoon—a reply that got shut down so many times, in fact, that we didn't really know where he was going most of the time.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's also interesting to note that these events in Canberra are bringing back memories for many in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        about the infamous midnight coup—the coup that wasn't—against then Chief Minister Adam Giles. Let me remind you of those events in February 2015. It was also a government in crisis, a government of rich conservative incompetents, a government whose self-interest and infighting failed the people of the Northern Territory and ultimately led to the near annihilation of the

        . There are lessons to be learned about democracy in this country. To have the House adjourn, closed to the people of this country, is an absolute disgrace. To have democracy in this country mocked to the extent that the opportunity to question and debate is denied to the members of the other house—and, even more importantly, the Australian people—is an absolute disgrace. Australians have been affected this week; Australians expected pieces of legislation to be debated. We are talking about important bills in here, like one about the cashless debit card or one about

        in Sydney there was a gathering attended by some 30,000 Muslims. But the parliament and the people of Australia wouldn't know it, because it wasn't talked about. Many braved the cold winter morning to conduct a special rain prayer for the worst affected areas in this country. Prayers were conducted throughout the states of

        , Victoria and Queensland. While instability, self-interest, self-indulgent conversations and backbiting were taking place here, Australians out there were reaching out to fellow Australians, to our farmers, to the regions of Australia suffering through drought. But you wouldn't know that huge story was taking place, because there was too much focus on what was going on in here—or, in fact, not going on in here: leading this country, governing, being responsible as elected members representing the people of Australia. There were 30,000 Australians Muslims out praying for rain for our suffering farmers, but you wouldn't know it. Compare that story to the one in here.

         I too rise to take note of what was discussed at question time today. First of all, yesterday here in this place I said I was deeply saddened and distressed by what had happened over the last 24 hours—now 48 hours—in my own party. I'm even more greatly distressed and disturbed by what has happened in my own party since I spoke in the chamber yesterday, particularly last night and this morning. Some of the behaviour I simply do not recognise and I think has no place in my party or in this chamber. Whatever happens over the next 24 hours, I cannot condone or support what has happened to some of my colleagues on this side in this chamber in this place.
        </p>
        <p>
         The tragedy of the madness that has taken hold of a number of my colleagues is that this has been a very good government. A government is always more than a leader. The leader is only ever the sum of those he or she serves with. I would like to remind this chamber why, together, the executive and all Liberal parliamentarians have been such a good government.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have cut taxes for 3.3 million small to medium enterprises and delivered tax relief for all working Australians. We have cracked down on multinational tax avoidance. We have delivered record jobs growth. Over one million Australians now have jobs—over 400,000 last year alone. We're getting Australians off welfare. We have the lowest level, for well over two decades I think, of working-age Australians on welfare. We're returning the budget to surplus a year earlier than we initially said we would do. We've delivered the biggest reforms to child care in this nation's history, which is now benefitting one million Australian families. We've delivered new export trade deals, which are now coming to fruition. We have more people exporting than ever right around the country, which is creating jobs right across the country. We've listed or amended 1,700 medicines on the PBS. We've guaranteed Medicare, with record funding and record
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">

         bulk-billing rates of 86.1 per cent. Something I'm particularly proud of is that we are in the process of completely revitalising our
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Defence Force
         </a>
         and the defence industries, with a $90 billion investment in our shipbuilding program alone. Personally, probably the thing I'm most proud of is that we've secured our borders again and no longer are people dying at sea. We have closed over 17 detention centres and we are holding secure our borders. We've delivered important workplace reforms to stop the corrupting payments between big businesses and unions. We are fully funding the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
          NDIS
         </a>
         and we are doing so many more things for this country.
        </p>
        <p>
         I say to everybody in this place and to anybody who may be listening: I do not recognise my party at the moment. I do not recognise the values. I do not recognise the bullying and intimidation that has gone on. I hope that, whatever happens after midday tomorrow, we can find a way to get back together again, because it is not just the leader, the Prime Minister, but all of us in the team who have been such a successful government. We have delivered for this country and up until now we have been a united and very effective party.
        </p>
        <p>
         In conclusion, whatever happens tomorrow, this is a sad day for my party and for our nation. I just hope that, whatever happens tomorrow, the behaviours we have seen and the bullying and intimidation, which I do not recognise as Liberal in any way, shape or form, are brought to account and we can find a better way, all of us in this chamber, to deal with each other, and, most importantly, to represent the people of Australia, because that is what we are here to do. We are not here to squabble with each other. We are here to serve the people of Australia. I feel ashamed that we are letting our nation down.

          I have to be really clear here: it is a wonderful opportunity to attack this dysfunctional and embarrassing government that we have. But I'm not going to. I'll tell you why I'm not going to. There are a few things I want to say that I want the people of Australia to hear and really understand. There are some very good people on that side of the chamber—people whom I have a close relationship with but would never agree with on most things in politics—who are hurting, and hurting badly. For the other side—and I know, because I've read this book, seen this movie and lived this—this is a shocking time. The worst part about this for the other side, with the greatest respect, is that they will not recover from this, because there is so much hatred and backstabbing and sniping going on.
         </p>
         <p>
          I want to spend just one minute—I really don't want to waste oxygen on this, but unfortunately I have to—on that appalling contribution from Senator Hanson, while our farmers are out there doing it darn tough. I know, because for 13 years I have been on the Rural and Regional Affairs and
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Committee" rel="nofollow">
           Transport Committee
          </a>
          and for over 10 years I have chaired the committee, and I have worked with some of the best that the other side of parliament can put up, and some of the best on this side. Richard, my old mate from Tassie—I'm saying it as it is, fair dinkum—you are fair dinkum about farming people, as are Senators Williams and
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Sullivan" rel="nofollow">
           O'Sullivan
          </a>
          , from the other side, and former senator
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Heffernan" rel="nofollow">
           Bill Heffernan
          </a>
          . How can Senator Hanson slap the Labor Party and bring farmers into it? In her two years in this chamber, she has never once attended one single hearing of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Committee. She has never come to any of our regular meetings at 8 am on Wednesday mornings. She has never attended hearings of the references and legislation committees to contribute anything worthwhile on how she could help our farmers, whether they're battling through drought, through poor prices or through biosecurity issues. What a disgraceful episode from that senator! I don't wish to even mention her name in the time I have left or, in fact, in the rest of the time I'm here in the Senate, hopefully.
         </p>
         <p>
          But let's go back to where we are at this stage. The saddest part here—I hate to say this there—is that there is not unity. A government was elected. A government was thrown out, and in came another government. I said to a few of my Nat and Liberal mates—and I will not mention who they are—up in Roma one day back in January 2015: 'My goodness me! The sniping has started on your Prime Minister. Didn't you see what it did to the Labor Party when we went through that shocking period?'
         </p>
         <p>
          There are marginal seat holders out there, and I'd like to see the marginal seat holders lose their positions to Labor people through an election. Make no mistake about that. That's what we do. But we've seen how hardworking backbenchers who put their lives on hold for three years are treated the way they're treated, usually by ex-ministers—I don't have to mention the names of Mr Abbott and others—who are normally in safe seats or holding the No. 1 position on the Senate ticket and still have another four years to go. They spend two or three years undermining their mates.
         </p>
         <p>
          So I have a different tack there. I say it from the heart: the best thing we can do, the best thing that can come out of this—unfortunately for some of the really good people on the other side—is an election. The Australian people do not deserve this. This is so embarrassing, and it's humbling to hear Senator Reynolds's contribution, because, Senator Reynolds, I know how you and a lot of your mates feel. The best thing that can be done now by whoever leads the dysfunctional coalition government in the next 24 hours or so is to call an election. That is the most humane thing they can do and the most decent thing they can do, because it will not be resolved. This will not be patched. There are friendships that will be destroyed for life. There is no going back. We've seen it and heard it, and it's personal. That is the best thing that can be done by the leader, the incoming Prime Minister, who will not have the full support of the party room. There'll be a lot of speeches, because those poor buggers over there will have to make those speeches to try to get the unity back. But they are going to have to do the decent thing: get in the Comcar, head to Yarralumla, approach the Governor-General, call an election and let the Australian people decide. This has been 10 years. I didn't think it could get worse after 2010.

           It is difficult to follow two speeches such as we've just heard in the chamber about the circumstances that we're in, and it's pretty clear to anyone that this is not the finest hour of the government. It is a very difficult time, and I know Senator Sterle feels that from the heart, because he lived that for six years between 2007 and 2013. It is difficult, but it has to be resolved. But just racing off to an election isn't the solution to where we sit today. Getting over what's occurred this week is going to take some effort. It's going to take a lot of hard work and a lot of goodwill by members on our side. If you look at the way that the Labor Party are operating at the moment, they've obviously had to deal with some significant internal issues post 2013, and we're going to have to do the same.
          </p>
          <p>
           What the Australian people have been telling me this week—and I've said this a number of times publicly—is that they just want us to focus on them. We have to get past this, we have to deal with the issues that we're dealing with at the moment, but they clearly want us to focus on them. Quite frankly, I don't believe they want another election, certainly not on my patch, because we just had one. The Labor Party and the coalition went head-to-head and we fought a nil-all draw, effectively. I think 88 votes moved after that long, 11-week campaign. I don't think the Australian people want another election. They want us to get back to focusing on them and governing for them. I'm proud to say that this government, despite what we've seen this week, has a very good record in that space. It really does. We have achieved things that governments for two decades haven't been able to achieve, and through some of the ministers in this chamber. For example, the media reform that was passed by this parliament has eluded governments of all persuasions for 20 years. It's a credit to Senator Fifield that he was able to negotiate with the industry something that they could all support and that could then be passed through this parliament. So this is a government of achievement.
          </p>
          <p>
           We were told that we wouldn't be able to do those things. We were told that the crossbenchers would be too difficult to deal with, that we wouldn't be able to get our legislation through this parliament. But we have. We've legislated for tax cuts for individuals, and we're proud of that. We've legislated for tax cuts for small business. We've also legislated for tax cuts for businesses with turnover up to $50 million. We know that if the other side are successful at the next election they will put taxes back up. We've legislated for tax to come down to 25 per cent for businesses with turnover up to $50 million. The Labor Party's policy, even though it's masked in tricky language, is to put that tax rate back up to 27½ per cent. So Australians know, and Australian business knows, that under the Labor Party they will pay more tax.
          </p>
          <p>
           I can tell you that the nans and pops in my neck of the woods know that they could lose up to 30 per cent of their income, their total income, through the Labor Party's nan and pop tax proposal. They're going to use that money to pay for tax cuts for everyone else, but I don't know anybody who wants their nan and pop to lose up to 30 per cent of their income so that they can get a tax cut. And Labor are going to raise billions of dollars through that measure. They don't understand that somebody will lose up to 30 per cent of their income just so that someone else can get a tax cut. It's an outrageous policy. Even on our worst day—and, let's be fair, this hasn't been a cracker for us—I think we're better than the other side. So we will work our way through this and we will provide the opportunity for the Australian people to vote for us at the next election.

            skit from those opposite with that performance. The reality of what we've seen today, in question time here and in question time being cancelled in the other place, is that this government is illegitimate. That's what was proved in question time today and that's why they cancelled question time in the House of Representatives. They know that the Australian people know the gig is up. We saw in question time how illegitimate they are. We've seen it through the course of this week in their actions in undermining the elected Prime Minister, and we'll see it in the way things are going to end tomorrow. The reality is that the Liberal Party have proved themselves incapable of being a party of government. No matter the personality issue or the policy issue, they are divided on every single one of them. On every significant policy issue that is of concern to the Australian people, the Liberal Party are divided. There is no leader within the Liberal Party who is actually capable of uniting their team and coming up with policy solutions for the Australian people.

            One of the first things that was drummed into me when I first got involved in politics was that if you can't govern yourselves you can't govern your country. That is the Liberal Party this week: they can't govern themselves; they can't govern the country. On every policy issue, they are divided. No matter who becomes the leader after 12 noon tomorrow, they are hopelessly divided. Be it personality or be it policy, this is the Liberal Party in 2018.

            What we saw from the slapstick performance from the

             Leader of the Government in the Senate

            today was that he could not tell the parliament which ministers had resigned. This is extraordinary: the Leader of the Government in the Senate could not tell the parliament which ministers had resigned. When we look at that, these are the ministers who have resigned; these are the portfolios: Finance, Health, Trade, Jobs, Communications, Human Services,

            , and

            </a>
            , and we have an acting home affairs minister—not insignificant portfolios. The Leader of the Government in the Senate stood in this chamber today and could not tell us whether there were actual ministers for those portfolios. That's what he said. He came in and said, 'We've got people representing them as senators.' But do we have actual ministers for those portfolios?

            They lost all pretence of being a government that actually represents the Australian people. They have been completely consumed by their internal differences, by their personality clashes and by their policy differences. They have given up any pretence that they are actually governing for the Australian people. When it comes to policy dysfunction, that's been on display throughout the course of the last couple of weeks. We know what happened with the National Energy Guarantee. For 12 months they were working on a policy that was solely focused not for the Australian people, not for Australian workers, not for Australian businesses but on getting an energy policy through their backbench, and they still couldn't achieve that after working on it for 12 months. They finally got defeated in relation to the corporate tax—the money they were going to hand out to big banks and big business. They finally lost.

            So we end this week basically without a Prime Minister. We know there'll be a contest within the Liberal Party. But we also end this week as a country with no direction from this government. They don't actually have an energy policy at the moment; they can't tell us what it is. They don't actually have an economic plan; they can't tell us what it is. Think about those Australian people who are out there observing this today, and this is the government that is supposed to be representing their interests. For those people who can't afford to pay higher power bills because of the inaction of this government—and the government had five years to do something about that—the government has abandoned them. For those people out there looking for work and looking for a job, the government has abandoned them. For those people who live in regional areas and are concerned about funding the future of their kids through school, the government has abandoned them. On any significant policy area that matters to the Australian people, this government today has abandoned them. The only solution that is available to them, no matter who wins tomorrow, no matter who we end up with as leader—and with each hour that goes past there are more and more people putting their names forward—is to go and call an election. That is the only way this can be solved. The

            this week have proven themselves incapable of governing. They can't govern themselves and they absolutely can't govern the country.
