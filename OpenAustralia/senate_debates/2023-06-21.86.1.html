           I remind senators that, once again, the interjections across the chamber were disorderly and did not give Senator Steele-John an opportunity to ask his question, nor the senator to whom it was directed the chance to hear it. I'm asking for silence. Senator Steele-John, if you wouldn't mind starting again.

            Thank you. Israel's government is the most far right and extremist in the nation's history. Two of its most senior ministers, Ministers Smotrich and Ben-Gvir, are proud and open racists and bigots. Finance Minister Smotrich has said:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            There is no such thing as Palestinians because there is no such thing as a Palestinian people.
           </p>
           <p>
            He has called for a Palestinian town to be wiped out. He is also a proud, open homophobe. National Security Minister Ben-Gvir has attended so-called 'beast parades' against gay pride, at which individual religious activists lead goats and donkeys through the streets and hoist banners calling queer people 'impure'. He has also pledged to crush Palestinians 'one by one'. When will the foreign minister issue a boycott of any Australian government representative meeting with these two individuals?

             The first point I would make, if I may, given the question goes to Israel, is to express that we are obviously deeply saddened by the murder of four Israeli citizens in a terror attack overnight. We condemn this act and make the point that terrorism and violence against civilians can never be justified, and we urgently call upon all parties to exercise restraint. I would again say what I've said many times, which is the reminder for leaders to work together to foster the conditions necessary for tolerance and peace.
            </p>
            <p>
             I don't propose to respond to all of the propositions you put to me. The fact that we engage with a country does not mean we agree with every statement made by an officeholder of a country. You've heard me say, for example, in relation to China, that we will cooperate where we can, disagree where we must and engage in our national interest. We have a view as a government that engagement matters. We will continue to engage with members of the Israeli government as is appropriate and necessary, and we intend to judge the government on the policies it pursues and to make our views known when we need to. Australia has been and is a friend of Israel, and that means we can also indicate our view on matters on which we disagree.
            </p>
            <p>
             I hope you wouldn't need me to respond to some of the propositions you have made with an indication that, obviously, I and the members of the government do not agree with some of the views in relation to
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBTQI" rel="nofollow">

               Speaking of the policies pursued by the state of Israel—these individuals are members of a government which is enacting a system of race based oppression and domination towards Palestinians. There is a name for such a system, Minister: apartheid.

               recognises it, Palestinian and Israeli human rights groups recognise it and the Greens recognise it. When will the Australian government recognise the reality of Israel's system of apartheid?

                I will make a number of points. The first is that we, as a responsible international actor, will continue to encourage all parties to engage in negotiations for a just and enduring two-state solution. The Australian government is committed to a two-state solution in which Israel and a future Palestinian state coexist in peace and security within internationally recognised borders.
               </p>
               <p>
                I would make this point also: I understand that there are many people living in this country who feel deeply about these issues, on both sides of the debate. Just as I was critical of Mr Morrison's move during the Wentworth by-election, I would also urge all parties now not to use sensitive issues to play domestic political games. This is a very difficult issue; this is—
