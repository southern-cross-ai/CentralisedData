        I know—agriculture! My question is to the Minister for Trade and Tourism, Senator Farrell. Australian consumers are paying high prices for airfares and would benefit from increased competition. The transport minister has rejected

        </a>
        ' request for an additional 21 international flights a week. Minister, given the impact additional international carrier competition can have in lowering airfares for Australian passengers, increasing tourism to Australia and delivering lower freight costs, what advice did you provide to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and

I'm pleased to say that bit by bit we are turning the situation around from the situation we inherited from the former government, where the level of seats on aeroplanes coming to Australia was very low and the cost was very high. We haven't entirely resolved that issue in the time that we've been in government, but, bit by bit, we are working towards returning the situation to what it was pre the pandemic. There are some countries where we are, in fact, getting more people into Australia than—

             , for the point of order. The Australian government considers, of course, a range of factors when determining whether an expansion of bilateral air rights is in the national interest.

                               I raise a point of order about the question. I ought to have raised it, but with the interjections I couldn't hear the first supplementary. I think the senator is asking this minister in his primary portfolio capacity. I think asking this minister the reasons for a decision of another minister is not in order, because it is not a matter in his portfolio. My recollection is the senator did not ask the minister in his representing capacity, so I will just make that point but I don't object to the question. I ought have raised this in the first supplementary.

                                 On the point of order, indeed, I am assuming the question was asked in relation to the trade and tourism portfolio as well. President, it would be a very narrow ruling to suggest that a minister with a portfolio such as trade and tourism that clearly is directly impacted by decisions of government in relation to aviation access to Australia cannot be asked questions about those decisions of government, the impacts of those decisions or the rationale for those decisions of government, particularly when they are cabinet decisions, ultimately, for which all ministers are accountable.
