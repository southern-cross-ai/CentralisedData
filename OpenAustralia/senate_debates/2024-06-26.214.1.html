       <p class="italic">
        That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Finance (Senator Gallagher) to a question without notice I asked today regarding the incoming Governor-General's salary.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since 1974 the parliament has approved the salary for each incoming Governor-General. The salary level has conventionally been commensurate with that of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice" rel="nofollow">
         Chief Justice
        </a>
        of the High Court. The last time a Governor-General was paid less than the Chief Justice was in 2008, when Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd appointed
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quentin_Bryce" rel="nofollow">
         Quentin Bryce
        </a>
        with a salary $20,000 less than that of the Chief Justice. Precedent does call for consideration to be 'given to any pension received by the incumbent for previous employment'â€”for the incumbent, not for the person coming after the incumbent.
       </p>
       <p>
        The annual salary during Michael Jeffery's term was $365,000. Quentin Bryce's salary was $394,000. General

        </a>
        was paid $425,000, which included a small reduction because of his military pension. General Hurley was paid $495,000. General Hurley is in receipt of a military pension as a result of his lifetime of military service. Sam Mostyn is not entitled to a military pension for her lifetime of service to the culture wars. The huge increase offered to Sam Mostyn takes her salary to $70,000 above that of the High Court Chief Justice, despite Labor themselves setting a precedent that less can be paid in hard times, such as in 2008, during the global financial crisis.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2024 we have the crisis of the Albanese government's runaway inflation. The inflation rate has increased again to four per cent, announced a few moments ago. This persistent high inflation gives a hint as to why the incoming Governor-General got such a large wage rise. The government knows what bad economic news is coming for everyday Australians in the next five years and sought to insulate its appointment from that ruinous inflation. This Labor government simply doesn't know the value of money and is clearly confused when the public call the government out for it. Sam Mostyn has got a huge increase in salary. Her pension is now hugely increased, and she will have that pension for every day of every year of her life.
