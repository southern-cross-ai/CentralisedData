        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Housing, Senator Evans. Given that former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd described the issue of homelessness as a national obscenity in 2008, how does the minister describe the situation now that the number of homeless people has increased by 17 per cent over the past five years of this government according to the ABS 2011 census figures?

         I thank Senator Payne for the question because it is a very important issue in our community. We know that there are too many Australians who are homeless. That is why this government made it a priority on coming to government, through the inaugural white paper, which makes it clear that by 2020 we want to halve overall homelessness and provide supported accommodation to all rough sleepers who seek it. That was a very important goal that this government set because we take this issue so seriously. To back that commitment, the Labor government has invested an unprecedented $5 billion into support for homelessness services and programs since 2008.

         Senator, it would have got a lot worse if we had followed you and done nothing. But we do take this issue seriously. You had no housing minister and no policy. We have been working with the states and territories and with business, charities and the community to reduce homelessness in Australia, and we are delivering through the National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness over 180 new or expanded homelessness services.
        </p>
        <p>
         As we indicated last week, the ABS statistics did release a complex picture. The headline figure showing an increase in the rate of homelessness of eight per cent is disappointing. But a more in-depth analysis reveals some promising signs.

         It is a complex picture, Senator. The report speaks for itself. The rate of people sleeping rough has fallen by 13½ per cent and that is encouraging. The number of people in supported accommodation has risen by 23 per cent.

           As I was saying, it is a complex picture but there are some encouraging signs in the sense that, for instance, the number of people in supported accommodation has risen by 23 per cent. So more people are in supported accommodation.

            , I ask a supplementary question. Why will the government only commit to funding the National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness for one year after the current agreement expires on 30 June 2013? How does that actually provide any certainty for service providers and for homeless people themselves?

             , as I understand it, on Friday the Minister for Housing and Homelessness reached agreement with state ministerial colleagues, subject to their own cabinet processes, to commence negotiations for a new partnership agreement on homelessness. Those decisions on a future national homelessness partnership will be based on evidence and performance information to ensure that strategies beyond June 2013 are effectively targeted. These negotiations are expected to take time, so the Commonwealth has put money on the table for our half of the cost to continue services for another 12 months. We are calling on the states to make clear as soon as possible whether they will match this funding to ensure that the sector and the homeless clients they serve have certainty for the next year. It remains a priority of this government and we have put an offer to the states and put our money on the table.

              , I ask a further supplementary question. Given that the government has a $120 billion black hole in its federal budget following its series of multibillion-dollar spending commitments, can the minister explain why the government has made significant promises to some sectors of the community but provided only one year's extra funding for homelessness service providers, thereby denying them certainty in their operations?

              <p>
               I made very clear that this government remains committed to action on homelessness and had made an offer to the states. What is not clear is whether the opposition actually have developed an interest in this issue and are going to make any commitment at all to tackling these questions. Under the Howard government we know there was no minister responsible, there was no funding and there was no attempt to tackle this deep-seated social issue in our community. We know that this government is committed, has invested heavily and is seeing some positive results, but the problem remains a difficult and complex one.
              </p>
              <p>
               We have put an offer to the states to say: 'We want to continue this work. Programs are seeing results. Will you commit to continuing the program?' I would be interested in Senator Payne explaining whether or not the opposition will commit to the program.
