         Australia is a vibrant multicultural nation and generations of migrants have contributed to our national prosperity. The Gillard Labor government understands this and we appreciate the values that so many migrants have brought to this country. This has been reinforced by our multicultural policy and it is why we have proudly identified the multicultural affairs portfolio initially as having a parliamentary secretary and now with a minister.
        </p>
        <p>
         When migrants settle in Australia we want to make sure that they have the best chance to get a job, just like their fellow Australians. That is why the Gillard government recently announced changes to the overseas temporary worker 457 visa system—because we knew the system was being exploited. When the 457 visa system is exploited it ultimately means that all Australians, including permanent residents and migrants, miss out on jobs right here in Australia. There are already more than 100,000 temporary workers here—

           . There are already more than 100,000 temporary workers here in Australia—a 22 per cent rise on a year ago. At the same time, skilled workers living here are looking for work. Let me be very clear: the Gillard government wants to make sure Australians—permanent residents and migrants whose home is Australia—get first dibs on Australian job opportunities. We need a 457 visa system that is fit for purpose, but for genuine demonstrable skill shortages—that is what was designed to be. We do not want it to be misused to the detriment of people for whom Australia is home.

                . Perhaps I should conclude on the point that, in contrast, the Leader of the Opposition has made his position clear: he wants to flood Australia with people on the temporary overseas worker plan, taking away the permanent job opportunities available.

                  Last sitting period we had yet another clear example of how the opposition will not stand up to protect Australian wages and conditions, with the introduction of the Employer Sanctions Bill which they voted against. This is an opposition that talk tough when it comes to so-called illegal immigration and cynically exploit an incident, which is currently before the courts, to cause fear and unrest in the community but, when it actually comes to a specific opportunity to do something about employers exploiting our overseas temporary skilled worker program to the detriment of employment opportunities and to the detriment of those temporary skilled workers involved, they are nowhere to be found. They had an opportunity in this place to support the EmployerSanctions Billand they chose not to do it.

                    Thank you for the second supplementary question. Members of the opposition have said that the reason they opposed the Employer Sanctions Billin the Senate—a bill which would enable the government to successfully prosecute members who wilfully ignore their responsibility—was that it would increase red tape for employers. That was the argument presented. I can tell the Senate again that not one extra requirement on employers, not one piece of red tape, not one additional process for employers to go through, occurred as a result of this legislation—not one; not a single new requirement for employers. This was made clear before the debate and during the debate and yet the opposition still opposed the bill. So there goes their smokescreen. Not only are they hypocritical on matters such as this is but they also cannot help themselves in opposing everything this government puts forward that is both constructive and fit for purpose and is designed to strengthen the system of our overseas temporary skilled worker program.

                     and Ageing, Senator Ludwig. I refer the minister to the announcement of the Aged Care Workforce Compact last Tuesday. Minister Butler stated at the Aged and Community Services Australia's national conference in Hobart in September 2010, 'We will be working with the sector to consider a proper and deliberative transition period for any reforms that we decide to introduce'. How can the minister contend that he has achieved consensus when all peak aged-care industry bodies and providers boycotted his announcement of the workforce compact on 5 March? Indeed, is it a fact that the minister could not find a single provider out of the 2,725 aged-care facilities across the country to host his announcement?

In dealing with aged-care more broadly, this has, by and large, been a bipartisan issue, but the opposition are now seeking to play politics with it. What this government has done is increase the incentives for investment in aged care, which is vital to ensure that there is a sufficient supply—

Instead he had to do it in the front of a church and then wrongly accused the local priest of stealing a car—

                         Thank you. Mr Butler announced a very significant public policy for aged care, and what the opposition are now doing is focusing on the event rather than the policy that underlies it. The policy that underlies it is a very significant improvement for aged care. Those opposite continue to want to denigrate the aged-care area, where Mr Butler has lifted and improved the outcomes for aged care—and that announcement underpins that.

                         The announcement provides significant funding for aged care. Increasing incentives through investment in aged-care is vital to ensure that there is a sufficient supply of aged-care services to meet the needs of an ageing population. That is the underlying issue, and this government is addressing that in aged care. Those opposite could do better by coming on board and joining with Mr Butler with respect to the policy rather than complaining about the event. But that is not surprising,

                            It is disappointing to see in the area of aged care—where we face significant challenges with an ageing population—that all the opposition want to do is to go back to their

                            campaign around industrial relations. That is what Senator Fierravanti-Wells is underlining with her question. What you do not want to do is expose your true policy around industrial relations. If you look at the way the government has continued to support wages in aged-care facilities you will see that the government recognises that the employees play a vital role in aged care, in ensuring that frail older Australians receive the care and support they deserve. While the government has an overarching role as funder of programs and services, aged-care providers are responsible, together with their staff, for negotiating wages and conditions.

                             , I ask a further supplementary question. According to Aged Care Services Australia, only 40 per cent of aged-care providers operate in the black. With so many providers battling viability, can the minister confirm how many of the 352,000 aged-care workers will actually receive an increase in wages from this compact?

                              Those opposite again ignore the facts. The Living Longer. Living Better aged-care reform package provides $3.7 billion over five years. This includes $1.2 billion to strengthen aged care—unlike when the Howard government was in office, when Mr Abbott ripped a billion dollars out of health. It seems that the opposition only want to hark back to those days. They liked them so much that the premise of the question seems to suggest that they want to do the same here—and we will not.
