        ) Bill 2011.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        An honourable senator: It is one of your pet subjects!
       </p>
       <p>
        That is right. I have been keeping a very close eye on this matter and I am very pleased to be making some presentations today. This bill outlines changes to the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009, which introduces, first, a requirement for lenders to provide a key fact sheet for standard home loans. Second, it introduces reforms to lending terms for credit cards, which was the government's election policy announcement, by, firstly, prescribing rules for approval of the use of credit cards above the credit limit; secondly, specifying an allocation hierarchy for payments made under credit card contracts; thirdly, restricting credit providers from making unsolicited invitations to borrowers to increase the credit limit of their credit cards; and, finally, introducing a requirement for lenders to provide a key fact sheet for credit card contracts. The coalition will not oppose this bill; however, we do have concerns over some of the elements contained within it.
       </p>
       <p>
        By way of background, I think it is important to advise the chamber that, as part of the 2010 election campaign, the Labor government introduced a Fairer, Simpler Banking policy which, among other things, aimed to more closely regulate the issuance, limits, fees and charges, and product disclosure of credit cards in order to enhance the protection of consumers. This was then followed by Treasurer Swan's announcement in December of last year of the government's Competitive and Sustainable Banking system, which included a key fact sheet for new home loan customers. This was in response to the coalition's nine-point banking plan. The National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Home Loans and Credit Cards) Bill 2011 deals with both of these policy announcements.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are a number of issues associated with this matter, Mr
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_President" rel="nofollow">
         Deputy President
        </a>
        —and I congratulate you on your appointment today to that very high position. This bill is an unsatisfactory response to perceived issues within the banking industry. While some elements within the bill such as changes to the hierarchy of payments under credit cards contracts are worthy of consideration, the other sections relating to credit card reform seem to be poorly drafted. Industry concerns seem not to have been fully addressed. At the eleventh hour, the government decided to listen to industry and put forward some substantial amendments to this bill in the House of Representatives. These amend­ments are embarrassing for the government as they had previously refused to listen to industry concerns—a matter I would have thought of extraordinary embarrassment to this government given their behaviour in relation to this matter.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill sets out the following changes. First is a key fact sheet for standard home loans. This measure was initially set to apply from 1 September 2011. Following con­sultation with industry, the deadline has now been extended by the government—I have to say it was at the eleventh hour through amendments—to 1 January 2012. The contents of the key fact sheet will be prescribed by regulations which are yet to be released by the minister. We expect them soon—unless they have already been prescribed, which I do not think they have; I am sure the parliamentary secretary would have told me so. It is another delay, and these regulations are yet to be prescribed. The government has also chosen to remove in their amendments the strict liability which applied to this section—a concern which was consistently raised by industry and institutions.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will now turn to reforms to lending in terms of credit cards. Firstly, in relation to prescribing rules for the use of credit cards above the credit limit, the government has chosen to remove the sections relating to the default buffer limit at 10 per cent of the credit limit, as well as the allowance for a supplementary buffer. These reforms were to prevent consumers from exceeding an agreed-upon limit. However, industry bodies and institutions expressed concern that the bill could send a message to consumers that they may in effect have a 10 per cent higher credit card limit if they choose. The government has now removed this section through its eleventh-hour amendments and replaced it with a requirement for consumers to be notified if a credit card is used in excess of its credit limit and an express requirement for no fees to be imposed and no higher rate of interest to be charged if a customer exceeds their credit limit, unless they have provided explicit consent for a fee to be charged.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second reform specifies an allocation hierarchy for payments made under a credit card contract. This section of the bill requires credit providers to apply relevant repayments first to the part of the consumer's balance that attracts the highest credit rate, and this seems to be a reasonable reform. The third restricts credit providers from making unsolicited invitations to borrowers to increase the credit limit of their credit card. Some institutions have stated that a potential unintended consequence would be to force credit providers to push borrowers towards higher initial credit limits than otherwise would have been offered. The fourth intro­duces a requirement for lenders to provide a key fact sheet for credit card contracts. Concerns about this section of the bill are similar to those for the key fact sheet for standard home loans.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would now like to turn to Greens amendments rejected in the House of Representatives—and that, of course, is the Greens political party, who are in a political alliance with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Labor Party
        </a>
        that we are all acutely aware of. We have seen the outcomes of that in the last 36 hours and undoubtedly we will see a lot more of that relationship between the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Greens
        </a>
        and the Australian Labor Party as they head, in coalition, to thoroughly and completely destroy this country. Mr Adam Bandt MP, the member for Melbourne, moved amend­ments seeking to have divisions 5 and 6 apply to transactions and payments made under a credit card contract entered into before or on the date of the legislation coming into effect. Division 5 relates to the use of a credit card in excess of the credit limit and division 6 relates to the order of application of payments made under credit card contracts, which is a reasonable reform. The coalition opposed this amendment in the House of Representatives. The amendment was retrospective on existing contracts entered into prior to the legislation coming into effect.
       </p>
       <p>
        In summary, the coalition will not oppose this bill. The amendments moved in the House of Representatives are embarrassing for the government and highlight the deficiencies in their approach to this policy matter. It is not just with this that we have seen this sort of lack of detail and lack of understanding about what is required to properly govern this country. We have seen time and time again this government dragged kicking and screaming into having some sensible policy responses to key issues. Why is it that they are so inept that they require others to do their work for them? I look at the work that Senator Cormann has done in relation to this. I look at the work the shadow Treasurer has done in relation to this. Again the coalition is required to fix the govern­ment's messes—time after time after time. Industry and institutions have warned on a number of occasions throughout the legislative process that some of the elements contained in this legislation would have unintended consequences—a fact that the government have chosen to take on board at the eleventh hour. The unintended conse­quences were not news to them; they had been told about them and they chose to do nothing about it until the eleventh hour, when again the coalition addressed their deficiencies and told them how to best rectify the matter.
       </p>
       <p>
        The coalition believes that the govern­ment's approach of imposing additional regulation and interfering in commercial decisions of banks is not the preferred approach when addressing market deficiencies. The coalition stands by its call for a root-and-branch review into Australia's financial system as part of the nine-point banking plan announced in October last year. Of course, that nine-point banking plan was the coalition again proactively putting forward some policy proposals to address issues. Again there was a requirement for the coalition to do the policy work for an inept government. Again the coalition was required to go out and say to industry and others: 'We've got some solutions. We will work with you to make better legislation'—and that has been the outcome today. So I congratulate Senator Cormann and the shadow Treasurer for again being in a position to get bad laws made better. We will not be opposing this bill, but I hope the government finally starts to learn some lessons about its completely inept handling of legislation and of the economy.

         I indicate my support for the second reading of the National Consumer Credit Protection Amendment (Home Loans and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_Cards" rel="nofollow">
          Credit Cards
         </a>
         ) Bill 2011, but I foreshadow that I will have a number of amendments that I will ask the Senate to consider seriously. This bill follows the Treasurer's announce­ment in December last year that the govern­ment wanted to 'promote a competitive and sustainable banking system to give every Australian a fair go'. Under this bill, yes, some good measures are being introduced. Consumers will be provided with fact sheets prior to entering a home loan or a credit card contract. Lenders will not be able to offer unsolicited invitations to borrowers to increase credit limits they may not be able to afford. This is something that as a member of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
          South Australian
         </a>
         parliament I cam­paigned for and it is an important issue in terms of basic consumer rights in the face of that sort of aggressive behaviour by some lending institutions. Also, over-limit fees will be prohibited, and credit card payments will pay off higher interest debts first, which I think is a good and innovative solution. These are good measures.
        </p>
        <p>
         But if the government is serious about ensuring a competitive and sustainable banking system then it needs to seriously reconsider its blanket ban on exit fees. I acknowledge that this chamber recently debated a motion—moved by my colleague Senator Cormann, for the opposition, and by me—to disallow the government's regu­lations which came into force on Friday, 1 July. However, I wish to highlight again my concerns about the impact this blanket ban will have on small lenders and the con­sequence for competition in the banking sector.
        </p>
        <p>
         At the outset, I make it clear that I do not support the excessive exit fees that have been imposed by lenders to date. While the government might have the right intention, a blanket ban on exit fees is not the solution. Banning exit fees across the board was the government's knee-jerk reaction late last year to public demand for greater competition in the banking sector. The only way to ensure competition in the banking sector, however, is to support the smaller players. All the govern­ment's ban on exit fees will do is reduce competition in the longer term because smaller players will be severely impacted as a result and there will simply be cost-shifting in where the fees are being charged.
        </p>
        <p>
         The simple fact is that small lenders need to be able to cover their costs of lending, which the big banks are able to offset in other areas of their business. The big banks also have much greater flexibility in their ability to raise finance. Smaller lenders are forced to pay third parties to complete the administrative necessities of a home loan such as valuations, legal fees et cetera. These costs usually total between $1,000 and $2,000, so fees are applied to cover these costs should borrowers leave their mortgages in the first few years. Unlike the big four banks, small lenders are not able to offset these costs in other ways. By banning exit fees, small lenders will have to either bear the costs themselves or lift their rates, making them uncompetitive against the big banks that can absorb these costs elsewhere.
        </p>
        <p>
         While the government's ban may have been intended to improve competition, it will actually have the consequence of reducing competition by severely impacting on the non-bank lending sector and, as a consequence, interest margins on mortgages will rise over time. To address this, I foreshadow I will be moving amendments in the committee stage of this bill so that the ban on exit fees will only apply to lenders and their subsidiaries who hold a particular market share or greater to ensure that smaller players are able to, within reason, apply fees to their own customers.
        </p>
        <p>
         There will be an overarching consumer protection provision, which this bill has not addressed, because the amendments I will be moving will have a reasonableness test. There must be some materiality for all fees and charges relating to the provision of credit. For instance, that reasonableness test would also apply to credit card fees.
        </p>
        <p>
         I welcome the measures in this bill, but I think the government needs to seriously think about its blanket ban on exit fees if it truly wants to promote a competitive and sustainable banking system to give every Australian a fair go. My concern is that the government's changes will have the effect of further reducing the competitive pressures within the banking industry. It will further, since the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GFC" rel="nofollow">
          GFC
         </a>
         , consolidate the power in the big four banks.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is something fundamentally missing here and that is the issue of unfair contract terms. At the moment, ASIC needs to give some guidance in unfair fees. I think the current test is simply too vague. The amendments I will be moving will ensure there must be a link, a reasonableness test, a materiality test, between what is being charged by any lending institution in the provision of credit with respect to any penalty fees and the like. I think it is important that there is substantial consumer protection reform. Simply giving consumers information is not enough. You need to give consumers protection so that what they are being charged is reasonable and so that the fees being charged are materially linked to the cost of providing that service. This bill does not do this and that is why I will be moving amendments during the committee stage to improve this bill.

              Is leave granted for Senator Xenophon to deal with this as two separate amendments?

              We will deal with the first one first. We will call it No. 2 on sheet 7110.

                      16 per cent,

                       ANZ

                       Commonwealth Bank
                      </a>
                      22.5 per cent. There is no question that there is a real concern about the lack of com­petition in Australia's banking sector because of the dominance of the big four. It is vital therefore that small lenders are given as much support and assistance as possible to ensure that they are able to continue to offer consumers alternative banking choices, and I believe that an unintended consequence of the government's blanket ban on exit fees is that small lenders will be pushed out of the market.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Unlike the big four, who can offset costs and who have much greater capacity for borrowings, the small lenders need to be able to charge basic fees to keep them in the market. The fact is that small lenders pay third parties to complete the administrative necessities of a home loan such as valuations and legal fees, and small lenders cannot offset losses like the major banks and there may well just be a case of cost-shifting.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      But what concerns me is that since the
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GFC" rel="nofollow">
                       GFC
                      </a>
                      , with the guarantee that the government has put in place—which of course was welcome and was the right thing to do—the nuances of that in terms of the imple­mentation of that were that it simply strengthened the power of the big four. They increased their market share in business banking and the home loan sector and I fear that, unless we provide some support for those small lenders, consumers will ultimately be worse off.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      So effectively that is what this amendment relates to. This amendment applies the ban on exit fees only to big banks with more than 10 per cent of market share and their subsidiaries, which are defined as being owned 51 per cent or more. That is the gist of this amendment and I urge my colleagues to support that. I am not sure what the coalition's view would be, but it would be not inconsistent with the measure that I co-sponsored with my colleague Senator Cormann on behalf of the opposition that sought a blanket ban on exit fees. It is not in the same form—I acknowledge that—but it is true to the general intent there about the impact that it would have on small lenders.

                       I indicate that my remarks apply to the other amendments, Senator Xenophon, so I do not want to unduly take the time of the chamber and be repetitive. The government will not be supporting the amend­ments. We do understand your inten­tion, Senator, in moving the amendment and your commitment to a better deal for consumers. You have been very consistent in that approach over many years. However, the government cannot support the amendments, as they duplicate laws we have already created and would put their enforcement at risk. The government has already banned exit fees for all lenders, not just the big banks. Making any further regulation in this space is therefore unnecessary. It would create significant difficulties for our financial regulators in enforcing an exit fees ban on new home loans.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       The government has already given ASIC the power to prosecute any fee in any credit contract that is unfair or unconscionable to consumers. These powers are contained in section 128F and 12CB of the ASIC Act. Duplicating these laws with inconsistent tests and definitions would put at risk ASIC's ability to prosecute under our existing laws, and that in turn would risk letting the banks off the hook and hurting consumers. Therefore we cannot support Senator Xenophon's motions to amend.

                          I fear a distant one, Senator. We are opposed to differential regulation as it creates market distortions and market-distorting regulations will eventually reduce the efficiency of markets and cost consumers more. Differences in fee structures based on market size will make comparison of products harder and will create confusion for consumers. The coalition favours a level playing field where consumers are able to select between products with certainty and clarity.

                           I am disappointed but not surprised. I can indicate that I have introduced a bill which I hope will be dealt with by committee, particularly in relation to the next amendment, and I hope that there will be a modification of the position of my collea­gues on both sides at some stage in the future. I indicate that Senator Ronaldson of course is quite correct: it is not identical but it would have, I believe, a similar effect in relation to the market distortion that has occurred as a result of the blanket ban on exit fees. If the ban were applied only to the big four, that is something that they could easily absorb, but the disproportionate impact on the smaller players in the market is one that is of concern. We have seen the contractions since the
                           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GFC" rel="nofollow">

                           , in part because of the way that the guarantee was structured. That was something that was raised in the banking inquiry of the Senate Economics References Committee, very ably chaired by Senator Bushby, and I supported the coalition in their concerns about that blanket ban on exit fees.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           This is a slight modification, but I think it will have the same effect in terms of those small operators in the marketplace. I under­stand that this amendment will go down. I will not be seeking to divide on it. I think we need to carefully monitor the effect of the blanket ban on exit fees, including whether consumers get slugged with other fees—so in the end consumers are not any better off; they are simply affected some other way. That is something that I believe my next amendment will substantially remedy.

                             Code and is entirely consistent with what this legislation is trying to achieve—that is, to empower consumers, to give them more information and to level the playing field for consumers. The current rules state that ASIC has the power to strike down any unconscionable terms in relation to early termination fees for residential loans, unconscionable fees and unfair contract terms. This provision seeks to introduce a reasonableness test into the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009 for any credit fee charge payable by a debtor to a credit provider.

                             I know there have been concerns about the level of bank fees, not just exit fees, that are charged. This amendment states that any fee or charge that relates to the provision of credit, whether it is a personal loan, a mortgage or a credit card, must be reason­able as compared to the cost of undertaking the activity by the credit provider. That means that smaller lenders may have a different fee structure. They might be charging more for termination fees or penalty fees than a bigger institution. Having a reasonableness test—so there is some material link between what is being charged and what it is actually costing that institu­tion—is entirely consistent with the National Consumer Credit Protection Act in its current form. It is about giving some certainty. It is about having a specific test that targets the whole issue of unreasonable fees.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             The whole issue is one of materiality. ASIC's

                             issued in November 2010 is welcomed but it does not give the clarity that I believe is required. You need to have a link between the materiality of charges that a lending institution is hitting a consumer with and the issue of reasonableness. To say that you must apply the test to consider the issue of materiality I think would make a big difference. This amendment states:

                             I understand that the government and the opposition do not support this, but I would like to hear them say whether there is enough specificity and clarity under the current ASIC guidelines. This is a reasonable amend­ment that will give clarity and cer­tainty to lending institutions and consumers and will prevent the sort of gouging we see with various credit fees.

                              We will be opposing this amendment. The National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009, which came into effect in July 2010, already deals with uncon­scionable or unfair fees and charges. Borrowers can already complain to ASIC or to an external dispute resolution scheme. The borrower or ASIC can seek a review of fees by a court. This proposal would require ASIC to determine what is a reasonable fee, which is beyond the current scope and role of the regulator. As each credit provider's average reasonable costs would be different, this would require extensive ASIC resources and high costs in each case. These higher costs would need to be passed on to consumers or funded by the taxpayer.

                               I referred earlier in my contribution that the government would not be supporting this regulation. The government has given ASIC the power to prosecute any fee in any credit contract that is unfair or unconscionable to consumers. That is contained in sections 12BF and 12CB of the ASIC Act. As I mentioned earlier, duplication and inconsistent test definitions are inappropriate. We will not be supporting the amendment.

                                Again, I am disappointed but not surprised. I am just trying to understand the coalition's point of view. Senator Ronaldson, I apologise if I misheard you but how would it cost taxpayers more if there were greater clarity in the test? How would it be a burden to simply have guidelines that say there must be some materiality between what has been charged and the cost, and to measure that as a yardstick of reasonableness in terms of interpreting the ASIC guidelines?

                                 I am sure that Senator Xenophon and my colleague Senator Cormann can have a longer discussion about this at some time in the future, but the point I was making is that the increased costs that might be imposed on ASIC would require extra resourcing from somewhere.

                                  For a man of Senator Ronaldson's calibre, I am surprised that this is the best he can come up with. I have a lot of respect for his powers of argument and putting up a cogent case—but honestly! He is saying do not add an extra layer of protection for consumers because ASIC will not have the resources to do so. In fact, this would make it easier. Let us put this argument to rest. Having a clearer test would mean less uncertainty. If you have clearer guidelines and a clearer test it would arguably lead to a lessening of the resources needed by ASIC to deal with what is currently very vague. I am not sure if that will convince Senator Ronaldson to change his view in relation to this. He seems unmoved, so I will not pursue it.

                                  The minister says there is a regulatory guide. Since the guide came out in 2006 how many actions have there been, how many warnings have been sent out and how many prosecutions have there been in relation to breaches of unfair contract terms that we are supposed to interpret with this regulatory guide?

But there are plenty of opportunities to find out. ASIC attend estimates on three occasions during the year, and I am the representative minister at those hearings. They also attend two or three meetings of the

                                        I just thought it was a weak argument! And Senator Ronaldson said that I have a weak argument. He is not shy in coming forward, and I respect that. But let us wait and see, I guess. I still believe this amendment has merit. It is about tying in a test to make it clearer as to what is reasonable or not. It does not seem unreasonable to have a material link between the actual costs of providing a service and what a consumer is charged. Some banks and credit institutions charge a fee that is completely disproportionate to the cost of providing that service, and that is what this amendment is intended to provide clarity on. The minister has indicated that he will provide an answer in due course in relation to the matters raised. I think ASIC has one hand tied behind its back by virtue of the vagueness involved in these current regulations. So I will maintain this amendment and, if there is another voice with me, I will be seeking a division.

The minister at the time, Senator Faulkner, said that the legislative mechanics of establishing a correctly constituted military court was of the highest priority. Unfortunately, like most high priorities for this government, we have neither seen nor heard of a successful piece of legislation arresting this problem since. Two years later, here we are and nothing has been achieved. Minister Smith, in his second reading speech on 10 May 2011, acknowledged that there would be new legislation but that it was still in the formulation stage.

It is a stopgap measure to provide for the appointment and also the remuner­ation and other entitlements of statutory office holders—namely, the Chief Judge Advocate and two judge advocates, each of whom are full-time members of the

It expires in September this year and, accordingly, this bill is necessary to continue the remuneration and entitlements of those statutory office holders.

                                             The Australian Military Court was established in 2007 by legislation supported by both sides of the parliament. The court's establishment followed a series of

I was involved in the 2005 Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade military justice inquiry, which made a number of very important and serious recommendations touching on the issue of the administration of military justice inside Defence. As I said, on 26 August 2009, the

                                             1982, establishing the Australian Military Court, were invalid because the Australian Military Court purported to exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth without meeting the requirements set out in chapter 3 of our Constitution.

                                             As I said, the defence minister at the time said that the mechanics of establishing a correctly constituted military court were a priority. Here we are, two years later, and we are still waiting. This legislation is necessary because of the wait—because of the dilatory performance of the government on this. All stakeholders are keen to see the permanent establishment of a properly constituted military court to administer justice inside Defence.

                                                 On behalf of Senator Brandis, I indicate that the amendments proposed by the bill amend the ASIO Act to align the definition of 'foreign intelligence' with the definitions in the IS Act and the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 and amend the ASIO Act to clarify that a computer access warrant authorises access to data held in the target computer at any time while the warrant is in force, and that is not limited to data held at a particular point in time, such as when the warrant is first executed. This does not change the law but ensures consistency within the computer access warrant regime. The bill's provisions amend the ASIO Act to exclude the communication of information concerning the engagement or proposed engagement of staff within the Australian intelligence community from the security assessment procedures in the ASIO Act and put ASIO on the same footing as other intelligence agencies in relation to sharing information relevant to employment within the community.

                                                 The provisions amend the IS Act to permit the Defence Imagery and Geospatial Organi­sation specifically to provide assistance to the Defence Force in support of military operations and to cooperate with the ADF on intelligence matters. This is for clarification to ensure consistency with the

They amend the IS Act to clarify that the immunity provision in section 14 is intended to have effect unless another law of the Commonwealth, a state or a territory expressly overrides it, and they make a corresponding amendment to the computer offences in part 10.7 of the Criminal Code.

                                                 The amendments to the act proposed in this bill are relatively procedural and non-controversial. However, because any amend­ments in relation to enhanced intelligence gathering on Australians or conferring immunity in respect of otherwise criminal activity should be subject to close scrutiny this bill was considered in detail by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. That committee reported very recently and I think it is worthwhile making some reference to that report.

                                                 The majority of the committee agreed that the proposed amendments would improve the practical operation of some key provisions in relevant legislation while maintaining sufficient safeguards where appropriate. The committee expressed confidence that the oversight by the IGIS to review the legality and propriety of activities of agencies within the Australian intelligence community—including monitoring, inspec­tion and inquiry powers—is a sufficient and appropriate safeguard. I respectfully agree with the views expressed by the committee. However—and this is an important qualification—the committee had serious reservations about the quality of the explanatory memorandum produced to accompany this bill. It found:

                                                 , particularly in relation to the proposed foreign intelligence amendments, did not assist the committee in undertaking its consideration of the legislation. The EM does not provide a detailed explanation of the need for the provisions and how the expansion of ASIO's powers will assist it and other foreign intelligence agencies to perform their functions, nor does it mention the safeguards in place that will ensure appropriate use of the enhanced powers.

                                                 Unsurprisingly, the committee considered this a significant omission. It found that the information subsequently provided by the department to the committee was extremely helpful and should have been included in the EM in the first place. The committee there­fore recommended that the Attorney-General's Department revise and reissue the explanatory memorandum to the bill as a matter of urgency to specifically include all additional information contained in the department's submissions relating to the proposed foreign intelligence amendments in items 3, 7 and 13 of schedule 1 of the bill, including detailed justification and explanation of why the amendments are considered necessary; specific examples of how the expansion of the definition of 'foreign intelligence' will assist ASIO and other foreign intelligence agencies to perform their functions; and an explanation of the safeguards in place to ensure appropriate use of the foreign intelligence collection function.

                                                  . We have very strong reservations about the bill. I will go through the parts of the bill that we believe are extremely controversial and also touch on those that are not. Senator Humphries has managed to skirt around most of the main issues that the Australian Greens have concerns about and, with just a shift of emphasis, has informed us that the coalition sees no problem in waving this bill through.

                                                  We have very serious reservations about this and it is the intention of the Australian Greens to vote against this bill, more or less on the single ground that I will identify now. The bill authorises the Attorney-General to issue a search, computer access or listening device warrant to

This is a sharp contrast to the current conditions for a search, computer access or listening device warrant, which occurs when the Attorney-General is, 'satisfied that the collection of that foreign intelligence is important in relation to the defence of the Commonwealth or to the conduct of the Commonwealth's inter­national affairs'.

                                                  This bill also redefines 'foreign intelligence' to mean, 'intelligence about the capabilities, intentions or activities of people or organisations outside Australia.' What we have before us this evening is a significant departure from the current definition that is 'intelligence relating to the capabilities, intentions or activities of a foreign power'. A foreign power is currently defined as, 'a foreign government, an entity that is directed or controlled by a foreign government or governments, or a foreign political organisa­tion'. That is the definition we have at the moment. The amendments would change the definition to, simply, 'people or organisations outside Australia'.

                                                  got through the assessment of this bill and took the evidence that we did and, at my insistence, held a hearing which took about 90 minutes on a sitting day, and did not find that the provisions have radically expanded the scope of work that ASIO can now undertake. Most of the other clauses in this bill are more or less inoffensive, and some of them we strongly support. But the fact of the matter is that we have completely widened and opened up the mandate of this intelligence service, which has operated until now on very strict definitions of what it can and cannot investigate, and these strict definitions have been there for very good reason.

The Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, of which I have now been a full member for three years and one day, fast-tracked this inquiry and nobody was able to tell why. Our initial reporting date was September, and I am going to call on the minister when we go into the committee stage to explain what on earth was the rush, why the committee was required—and, I propose, probably instruc­ted—to report three months early, just as we had identified these very serious concerns.

                                                  The Law Council expressed strong concern in their submission and at the hearing, which was eventually held, as I say, during a sitting day. I was only able to attend because a particular bill that I was working on was pulled, and it still has not returned to the chamber; otherwise, I would not have been able to attend at all. ASIO, who you would argue is probably the most important agency with respect to this bill, did not appear. They were too busy on that day, so we did not take evidence from them. The questioning that I put to ASIO during the last round of budget estimates was curtailed by the chair. She informed us that the agency would report to the committee when it held its hearing, and of course that did not occur. So there has been quite a serious breakdown of process, on a really important matter, and I do not think we should overlook that.

We will splatter that mandate all over the landscape and allow them to simply go wherever they like. It will make it incredibly difficult for oversight agencies to tell whether the agency is within its mandate or not, because it is going to be very difficult to tell what that mandate is henceforth.

                                                  Currently, the threshold test for obtaining a warrant domestically is much more stringent. The minister must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that it 'will substantially assist the collection of intelligence … in respect of a matter that is important in relation to national security'. So there is an implied test in there which is about to go missing. The Law Council indicates this is significant broadening of the range of circumstances where listening device warrants, computer access warrants and surveillance and search warrants are available about any person or group outside Australia whenever those activities are considered to be somehow relevant to national security, foreign relations or economic wellbeing—for heaven's sake. We have dramatically expanded the scope of this agency's reach, at the stroke of a pen.

                                                  of Intelligence and Security is seriously undermined because, ultimately, the ASIO Act provides the framework against which that Office assess the lawfulness and appropriateness of ASIO’s activities.

                                                  We repudiate these views, I think, at our peril. It will be very, very difficult to unpick this or constrain ASIO if this sails through the parliament again on this bipartisan consensus that I am wearily used to on anything with 'national security' in the title. I think the committee process in this case—and it is unusual for me to say this—has actually failed us.

                                                 </p>
                                                 <p class="italic">

                                                  So she is going to just wait and see. She has clarified in subsequent correspondence to the committee that that was not intended to be a concern, that she was not anticipating or proposing that there would be a radical increase in warrant applications; she was simply stating the facts of the matter. If there are suddenly a flood of warrants, that will be an indication that the power is being interpreted too broadly. By then it will be too late.

                                                  come in here with a private senator's bill proposing to restore the situation to that of the present day, there will be nine of us on this side and everybody else on the other. I can be fairly sure of that. It is important to get this right now because, once these powers are expanded, it will be extra­ordinarily difficult, as we have seen since September 11, to bring them back into some kind of proportionality.

                                                  The Castan Centre also registered concern that the amendments permit ASIO to investigate a far wider range of individuals and organisations, even where Australia's defence interests and international relations are not at stake. That is what is happening here. They explain in their submission that most non-state actors that threaten Australia are captured by existing notions of 'foreign political organisation'. That was the pretext provided in the—as Senator Humphries outlined, manifestly inadequate—explana­tory memorandum. We found during the committee work and during estimates hearings that the most difficult thing was to establish exactly what it is that the government proposes by way of these amendments. What is it ASIO needs to do that it cannot currently do? Nobody has been able to tell us that. The hearing descended into farce, as far as I was concerned, when the officer at the table simply was not able to tell us what ASIO would be able to do that they currently cannot. I can give the minister a heads-up now that that is the first thing I am going to ask him when we go into the committee stage.

                                                  Under existing law, the collection of foreign intelligence is confined to the collection of intelligence concerning the activities of foreign governments, organisa­tions they control or foreign political organisations for the purpose of the defence of Australia or the conduct of international affairs. That is how ASIO have been doing the work that they have been doing in tracking al-Qaeda and tracking terrorist organisations that are much closer to home operating in our neighbourhood. They have these powers. They use them extensively. It is the sole justification that has been given to us for why their staffing and their budget quadrupled in the last decade. It is precisely because they have the range of powers that they need to track non-state actors who mean Australians harm or mean to pursue violent political activities in other countries. They have the powers that they need. When we asked what exactly this was all about, nobody was able to tell us.

                                                  What it does do is that it permits ASIO much wider scope to investigate the activities of Australians who are overseas and who do not necessarily pose a threat but perhaps do have implications for foreign relations, such as

                                                  organisation. WikiLeaks and Mr Assange obviously have implications for Australia's foreign relations. Things falling out of the document drop were on the front page of every newspaper in the country day after day after day six months ago, and even now those shock waves continue to reverberate through the diplomatic community. So there is no way that you can say that there are no implications there for Australia's foreign relations. But should that entity be spied on by ASIO? Should our clandestine Cold War era spy agency be tracking down Mr Assange, maybe his family if they travel abroad, people working for that organisation, journalists, or people he is talking to or that that organisation is involved with? It appears that the reason that this bill has been known as the 'WikiLeaks amendment' in the Attorney's department is that that is precisely what is intended. The committee simply did not address that issue, and neither did the officer at the table when we asked during the inquiry. This is one example of how a person or organisation outside Australia, combined with the notion of Australia's foreign relations, very considerably expands the scope of ASIO's activities. Australians working overseas for firms that are major rivals to key Australian industries would also be covered. They would be caught by the economic wellbeing argument. If the government has a counterargument to this, it would be delightful to hear it.

                                                  Finally, the Australian Greens object very strongly to the committee reporting three months early so that this bill can be rushed through the Senate. What is the hurry? Why must the committee report on 22 June and not on 21 September, our original reporting date? Why is this bill being passed today? I was told in the hearing by the department: 'While I cannot reasonably talk about specific cases here, I can assure you that this is very important.' That is the clarification that Senator Humphries and the rest of the committee were seeking. We were told, 'It is very important, I can assure you.' We have to take that as read without any justification at all. Eventually in the Attorney's third submission they came up with the example of illegal fishing. This whole process smells fishy, so it is interesting that that was where they landed—illegal fishing, for heaven's sake. What is it meant to mean that the shorthand term for this bill in the A-G's department is the 'WikiLeaks amendment'? The fact is ASIO are already empowered to obtain, correlate and evaluate intelligence relevant to security and they may obtain warrants for this purpose. That is what they do. That is what this agency is up to day to day. The current definition of 'foreign intelligence' includes intelligence relating to the capabilities, intentions or activities of foreign political organisations, whether or not they are connected to or sponsored by a state. The power is there already, so what is this bill about?

                                                  In their evidence to show how the amendments would operate in practice and in their second and even third submissions—it is quite unusual for a department to have to come back with a third submission because the first two were so inadequate—the depart­ment were not clear on what additional targets they envisaged being picked up by the amendments. They do not explain—and I do not think they can explain—what legiti­mate targets of spying would not get picked up by the current definition of 'foreign political organisation'. Please do not give us illegal fishers, for heaven's sake. The answers, I think, have been quite embarrass­ing. They have been the subject of media attention as a result, and I think that has been entirely justified.

                                                  's committee system is pivotal to the thorough scrutiny of legislation. I have enjoyed serving on the committees that I have served on in the last three years. I think it is an incredibly powerful role of this chamber through the committee work it does. It is mostly extremely collegial. The work is mostly collaborative. To a degree party allegiances, if the bill is not too polarising, get left at the door and we can do the jobs that we were elected to do and that we are paid to do. When the committee process is short-circuited, we are all the poorer for it because there is no other line of defence in here. When this vote is taken, we will have missed the opportunity.
                                                 </p>
                                                 <p>
                                                  The inquiry process solicits expert opinion. It takes evidence in public hearings. It was absolutely not appropriate to hold a rushed public hearing in 90 minutes on a sitting day. I think that was completely out of order. The process is meant to assist in weighing up whether laws afford the right balance between security and civil liberties and whether they are necessary and proportionate. Something that the new independent terrorism legislation monitor is going to be giving a great deal of his time—his very limited time as a part-time appointment—to assessing is whether the laws that we have guiding the agencies that are tracking, challenging and shutting down terrorist activities in Australia and in our neighbourhood are proportionate, whether they are necessary and whether they are doing what the government said. If you wanted to get a headline on being tough on security and if these laws were put through on a bipartisan and not cross-party basis, are they actually serving a function? Do they make us safe? If they make us safe, let us leave them there and let us review them, assess them and approve them. If they do not—if they are simply about attacking civil liberties or pursuing other agendas under the guise of national security, which is a term I think is now far too loosely interpreted under the amendments that we are considering tonight—then let us at least take a good, cold, hard look at what we are doing, because it is extraordinarily difficult to roll these things back once they are in force.
                                                 </p>
                                                 <p>
                                                  I for one am very concerned that we are simply following the United States down the path of the Patriot Act—that anything at all can be justified in the name of national security. I invite the opposition and the government to contemplate the amendments that we will move in the committee stage. They are no more or less than what the Law Council proposed. They do nothing more than go after the definitions that I have been speaking on tonight. They do not go into any of the other non-controversial or quite sensible aspects of the bill. They are very tightly constrained. So I invite both the opposition and the government, when we move into the committee stage, to consider pausing and paying attention to what the Law Council and other witnesses told us on this extremely important matter and not just to wave this bill through because it has 'national security' in the title.

                                                   I would like to acknow­ledge and thank senators for their contri­butions to the debate on the Intelligence Services Legislation Amend­ment Bill 2011. Before I make my concluding remarks about the bill, there were a couple of points raised during the debate that I would like to take the opportunity to respond to.
                                                  </p>
                                                  <p>
                                                   Firstly, I would like to acknowledge and thank the members of the Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legisla­tion Committee for their work in examining and inquiring into the bill. The committee tabled its report on 22 June 2011, making one recommendation, which was that the explanatory memorandum be revised and reissued in order to include more detail on the foreign intelligence amendments. The government accepts this recommendation, and I have the replacement explanatory memorandum which includes this additional information.
                                                  </p>
                                                  <p>
                                                   In respect of at least some of the matters that Senator Ludlam raised, there has been a lot of interest in and speculation about the amendments in this bill relating to
                                                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">

                                                   's foreign intelligence function. I will take just a moment to reiterate that this is not about expanding ASIO's functions so that it can do a whole range of new activity; it is about ensuring that ASIO's limited foreign intelligence role is consistent with the foreign intelligence functions of Australia's other intelligence agencies.
                                                  </p>
                                                  <p>
                                                   ASIO has long played a role in and is intended to complement the foreign intelli­gence role of the other intelligence agencies. These roles have not been completely aligned, because legislation was drafted at different times, reflecting different threat environments. The amendments in this bill will complete the process of aligning the terminology in the Intelligence Services Act and the ASIO Act. This continues the government's commitment to more seamless cooperation between relevant agencies, which was recognised in the National Security Statement and the Smith review.
                                                  </p>
                                                  <p>
                                                   ASIO's core function is to obtain and assess intelligence and advise government in relation to matters relevant to security. This will not change. In addition, ASIO has a limited function to obtain foreign intelligence within Australia under warrant issued by the Attorney-General at the request of the Minister for Defence or the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who are responsible for Australia's foreign intelligence agencies. This is separate from ASIO's security function and is not initiated by ASIO.
                                                  </p>
                                                  <p>
                                                   Currently, the definition of 'foreign intelligence' in the ASIO Act differs from that in the Intelligence Services Act. This could create intelligence gaps because it would mean that foreign intelligence collected within Australia would be a narrower range of intelligence than the foreign intelligence agencies are able to obtain in exercising their functions outside Australia. With the rise of individuals and non-state or non-political organisations engaged in activities such as the proliferation of nuclear, biological, chemical and conven­tional weapons and related technologies, it is increasingly important to address this issue.
                                                  </p>
                                                  <p>
                                                   There are a range of safeguards and accountability mechanisms that apply to ASIO's foreign intelligence function. These are outlined in the replacement explanatory memorandum. In particular, I emphasise that ASIO can only exercise its foreign intelligence function under warrant or auth­orisation issued by the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General must be satisfied, on the basis of advice from the Minister for Defence or the Minister for Foreign Affairs, that issuing a warrant or authorisation in a particular matter is in the interests of Australia's national security, Australia's foreign relations or Australia's national economic wellbeing.
                                                  </p>
                                                  <p>
                                                   These are serious matters of significant national interest. These matters have provided the construct and limitations for the functions of Australia's foreign intelligence agencies since these functions were enshrined in the Intelligence Services Act in 2001. ASIO's foreign intelligence function, as with all its activities, is subject to rigorous oversight and accountability, including by the

                                                   of Intelligence and Security. The inspector general has access to all of ASIO's records and warrant documentation and is able to examine the legality and propriety of ASIO's activities.

                                                   In addition to the foreign intelligence amendments, the bill makes a number of other important amendments to improve the operation of the ASIO Act, the Intelligence Services Act and the

                                                     In the few minutes remaining to us I think that, rather than moving the Greens amendments, I might just put a fairly simple question to the minister. Maybe the government has had a bit of time to think about this one now: what will this bill allow

The ASIO Act is currently limited to intelligence about foreign powers, which may not cover the same range of intelligence about individuals and non-state or non-political organisations that are covered by the Intelligence Services Act, so I emphasise that 'foreign powers' could be taken to read as being different from intelligence about individuals and non-state or non-political organisations.

The examples are: the proposed amendment will enable foreign intelligence collection agencies to better counter the activities of weapons proliferators. The proliferation of nuclear, biological, chemical and conven­tional weapons and related technologies is a complex global issue, and those involved include individuals and companies working in and across multiple countries.

                                                        I understand we were in the middle of having a conversation about cyber­security. In considering the cyberattacks on Australian government and commercial infrastructure related information networks, I understand that cyberattacks are an emerging threat to Australia's national security and national economic wellbeing. There is also a concern about major organised crime syndicates and their capacity to be effective in attacking the Australian banking sector. That would mean that there would be a significant loss of confidence in the banking system, and that would have collateral effects through our whole financial and economic system and in that way would do considerable damage to our national economic wellbeing. I understand that was the point that Minister Sherry was halfway through when we broke for dinner. From this moment onwards I am happy to take questions as I hear them.

                                                         I have a couple of questions before I discuss and then move the set of amendments I have proposed. The issue that I had put to the minister before we got up for dinner was the purpose of the bill—what it is actually for—because nobody has really been able to satisfactorily identify what you need
                                                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">

                                                         to be able to do that it cannot already do. In the pursuit of its quite legitimate surveillance and intelligence-gathering activities on organisations engaged in politically motivated violence, terrorism and so on, I do not think there is anything controversial about ASIO going ahead and doing that. What becomes controversial is when we quadruple its budget and staffing allocation, build it a fortress down on the lake and then completely open the floodgates to the kind of investigative work that it can undertake.

That was something that the minister said before we rose for dinner to try to ease my mind that ASIO was not getting any new powers here. That is not the point. What they are being given is the ability to exercise the powers that they currently have across a vastly broader range of groups, individuals and now, I think quite clearly, civil society organisations.

You have thrown the baby out with the bathwater. You have gone so far that there will henceforth be no benchmarks against which to assess whether ASIO is acting legitimately or not, because you have so broadened the range of targets that it may now surveil.

                                                          I thank the senator for his question. While your question is a reasonable one, I do not accept your conclusion. The first point I would make is that the amendments to the foreign intelligence collection provisions are not too broad. We must remember that
                                                          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">

                                                          's foreign intelligence role is a role that is defined by and complements the functions of the other existing intelligence agencies, which are also responsible for obtaining foreign intelligence. ASIO's foreign intelligence function is intended to enable similar intelligence to be collected where it is necessary to collect foreign intelligence within Australia. For the ASIO foreign intelligence function to operate as a truly complementary function, it needs to reflect the same intelligence and purposes for which that intelligence may be obtained under the Intelligence Services Act 2001. If they are not aligned, there are some potential gaps in Australia's intelligence coverage.
                                                         </p>
                                                         <p>
                                                          I would also make the point that the threats that are identified to Australia in this space are forever changing, and it is our challenge as legislators to make sure that the agency remains continually equipped with the powers it needs to discharge the function we all require of it. So the ASIO Act being currently limited to intelligence about foreign powers may mean that ASIO is not able to cover the same range of intelligence about individuals, non-state and even non-political organisations and actors that are covered by the Intelligence Services Act.
                                                         </p>

                                                          The obvious issues we need to turn our minds to in that respect are the proliferation of nuclear, biological, chemical and conventional weapons. Of course, what flows from that is the need to have a look at related technologies in a complex global environment and the multiplicity of actors that might be operating in that space, and that then may mean individuals and com­panies working across multiple countries. I know, from having listened to you talk about nuclear proliferation issues in the past, you are utterly familiar with those questions. In addition to those, it will facilitate oppor­tunities to detect cyberattacks. Cyberwarfare, I guess, is an increasing focus not just of commentators, not just of intelligence organisations, but also of us legislators. So my answer is that, as ASIO's role needs to countenance new technologies, the internet and increasingly complicated networks that may span non-state actors, for all of those reasons this legislation is giving ASIO powers that accord with its traditional task but enable it to move across the changing environment of organisations and non-state actors that it must keep an eye on.

                                                             Minister, I just wonder then whether, as a courtesy, you could put that question to the officers from the department who are sitting immediately on your left and who are paid by the responsible minister to know answers to questions like this one, which goes to the heart of the question that I put to Minister Sherry before we got up for dinner: what is this bill allowing you to do that you cannot already do?
                                                             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">

                                                             has been able to track non-state actors' handling of weapons of mass destruction, precursor materials and things involved in exactly that kind of trafficking, which are legitimate targets of clandestine intelligence agencies. You have been doing that for 60 years. Can you please tell us what has changed.
                                                            </p>

                                                             There is nothing in this bill—unless you can point it out to me; there is certainly nothing controversial—that addresses the medium; there is nothing that addresses cyberattacks. It is about the people and the 'who' we can go after, not about the medium or the vector that we might be being attacked behind. There are a couple of questions rolled in there, but I am still trying to get to the heart of what this amendment actually allows ASIO to do that it cannot already do. Just by way of an aside, I do not think the example of tracking of weapons of mass destruction or their precursor materials is a legitimate example. Our intelligence agencies are already perfectly capable of doing that, and they have been doing that for decades.

                                                             </p>

                                                              and then it is set out in paragraphs (a), (aa) and (b). I think we see there a codification of some of the issues that you are looking for.

                                                              I guess that when one contemplates the Cold War one is contemplating an environ­ment that is dramatically transformed today. We are obviously not today working in an environment where there is something of a global contest between two clearly discerni­ble ideologies and constellations of nation states. What we are looking at today is, firstly, a multipolar international environ­ment where non-state actors are particularly relevant and, secondly, an environment which has been transformed by technology. So the sorts of materials you were talking about and the sorts of tools that are required to monitor the movement of those materials, I think, have greatly changed, and as legislators we need to make sure that that is something we remain abreast of.

We saw the extraordinary violence inflicted by non-state actors on the people of the United States on September 11, and the subsequent attack that killed Australian citizens. We have been in this fluid security environment, you could say, at least since the late 1980s or early 1990s. What does this bill do, after all that period of time, that our intelligence agencies have not been able to do for the last 15, 20 or 30 years? I still feel absolutely no closer at all to understanding that.

At a Senate estimates hearing on 25 May this year, the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department stated that that was not the department's view and that the officers of the department did not refer to this amendment as the 'WikiLeaks amendment'.

For those of us who are students of political history, we will find that the Greens are not unique in seeking to make sure that these intelligence organisations are subject to the proper controls. That is a tradition to which my own party belongs as well.

I am happy to spend a moment talking about those. Firstly, safeguards under the Intelligence Services Act are applicable because ASIO's foreign intelligence function is performed at the request of the Minister for Defence or the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and they are responsible for Australia's foreign intelligence agencies. Before a request is made of ASIO to collect foreign intelligence within Australia, requirements under the Intelligence Services Act need to be complied with. These include requirements to obtain a ministerial authorisation if the agencies undertake an activity for the purpose of producing intelligence on an Australian person. You would have to agree that is of signal significance. A ministerial authorisation may be granted by the Minister for Defence or the Minister for Foreign Affairs only if they are satisfied that the Australian person is engaged in certain specified activities. There is a range of other safeguards that apply in the event that a ministerial authorisation is given, including time periods for that authorisation, being six months. In addition to all of that, the defence minister or the foreign affairs minister must be satisfied of the basis of the request for ASIO to collect foreign intelligence. The relevant minister would provide sufficient information for the Attorney-General to be satisfied as to why the request is in the interests of Australia's national security, foreign relations or national economic wellbeing.
                                                                       </p>
                                                                       <p>
                                                                        In making a decision regarding the discharge of its foreign intelligence function, ASIO has to comply with relevant guidelines and ministerial directions about how it should perform its functions. ASIO must also comply with internal protocols and procedures, which have been carefully drawn with a view to ensuring that their powers are exercised carefully and appropriately. ASIO also has to consider this in the context of its limited resources and other intelligence priorities. It is not resourced to the point that it can engage in intelligence frolics.
                                                                       </p>
                                                                       <p>
                                                                        Warrants are submitted to the Attorney-General for approval only after they have been through an exhaustive system of checks within ASIO and the Attorney-General's Department. If ASIO seeks to procure a foreign intelligence collection warrant, ASIO has to make a case with supporting material when putting a warrant request to the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General must be satisfied on the basis of advice received from the relevant minister that the collection of foreign intelligence relating to a matter is in the interests of Australia's national security, Australia's foreign relations or Australia's economic wellbeing. All of these are significant matters of national interest.
                                                                       </p>

                                                                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Director" rel="nofollow">

Similar reporting requirements apply to the foreign intelligence agencies under section 10A of the Intelligence Services Act. This provides further assurance that foreign intelligence collection by ASIO is appropriate and being used for legitimate purposes.
                                                                       </p>

So, Senator, I suppose the government's position here is that there are strong protections and strong safeguards and this is not an undue or unwarranted, let alone frivolous, expansion of the powers of our intelligence agencies.

This is where we find ourselves. Chair, I will seek your advice about whether I should seek leave to move amendments (1), (2), (3) and (4) together or just (1), (2) and (3).

They oppose the definition of 'foreign intelligence' and the language around the collection of foreign intelligence in two clauses. I will subse­quently move amendment (4), which makes consequential amendments to the Tele­communications (Interception and Access) Act which then change the definition in that act to provide for that consistency that I think all parties are very keen to see remain on the statute books. So, without further debate, I will commend those first three amendments to the chamber.

I listened to the exchanges between Senator Ludlam and Senator Feeney, and the opposition joins with the government in being of the view that the safeguards provided for in the ASIO Act and the mechanisms of institutional scrutiny through the director-general of intelligence services and parliamentary scrutiny through the joint parliamentary committee provide for an appropriate and thorough range of safeguards. There are also—and this is a point that Senator Feeney made—statutory protections in the ASIO Act itself which are unaffected by this legislation. So, on a statutory basis, from the point of view of parliamentary oversight and from the point of view of institutional oversight through appropriate oversight agencies, the opposition is well satisfied that we have the appropriate balance between giving ASIO, the particular agency in this case, the operational flexibility it needs and ensuring that it does not overreach its functions and that, were there to be any overreach or inappropriate use of power, that overreach or inappropriate use of power would be identified and arrested by institutional and parliamentary scrutiny.
                                                                               </p>

The effect of the amendments is to oppose the proposed amendments to the ASIO Act which change the definition of 'foreign intelligence'. Let me deal with them seriatim. The first of the amendments opposed by the Greens would insert a new definition of 'foreign intelligence' into the ASIO Act. The new definition would define foreign intelligence as 'intelligence about the capabilities, intentions or activities of people or organisations outside Australia'.
                                                                               </p>
                                                                               <p>
                                                                                The current definition of 'foreign intelligence' in the act, which would be replaced by that definition, is intelligence relating to the capabilities, intentions or activities of a foreign power. A foreign power in the ASIO Act is defined as a foreign government, an entity that is directed or controlled by a foreign government or governments, or a foreign political organisa­tion. The term 'foreign political organisation' is not defined. There is no question at all that the effect of this amendment would be to expand the scope of foreign intelligence that might be lawfully gathered by ASIO, in particular, by identifying individuals which the current act does not provide for and expanding, by making more generic, the character of organisations which might properly be the subject of intelligence gathering by ASIO.
                                                                               </p>
                                                                               <p>
                                                                                I am bound to say that in the changed national security and international security environment, particularly with the growth of terrorist organisations of a very amorphous form, many of them identified with individuals and inspired by individuals, and those organisations which are unstructured and represent a much less easily defined character of threat to Australia and its interests, it seems to the opposition to be absolutely prudent for the definition of foreign intelligence to be made more flexible than being defined merely by reference to foreign governments or foreign powers, given the rigidity of the definition of 'foreign powers' in the ASIO Act. There is much talk, as we know, in this area of policy about non-state actors, but non-state actors can assume a variety of forms, and it is because of the variety of forms which non-state actors may represent that it is, in our view, important that the intelligence capability of ASIO be made more flexible. None of the safeguards in the act is affected by this amendment. This is a jurisdictional amendment to reflect the realities of the practice of international terrorism in particular. It leaves the protections in the ASIO Act entirely unaffected.
                                                                               </p>

                                                                                The other two government amendments to the ASIO Act which are opposed by the Greens are amendments to sections 27A(1)(b) and 27B(b) of the ASIO Act. They have a common form. In both cases, they extend the interests which might be the subject of a ministerial directive from the interests as currently defined which are—and I will paraphrase—limited to the collection of intelligence relating to matters important to the defence of the Commonwealth or the conduct of the Commonwealth's inter­national affairs—that is the language of the current act—to intelligence relating to the interests of Australia's national security, Australia's foreign relations or Australia's national economic wellbeing. Apart from the substitution of the term 'Commonwealth' for the use of the word 'Australia', there are two substantive changes effected by those amendments. The first is to broaden the first category from Australia's defence to Australia's national security.
                                                                               </p>
                                                                               <p>
                                                                                I will pause here and challenge Senator Ludlam to tell the chamber why it is that it is unwise to define the proper subject of a ministerial directive to the Director-General of ASIO as a matter relating to Australia's national security rather than Australia's defence. National security has a broader connotation, but surely what ASIO is concerned with is protection by the gathering of intelligence in relation to Australia's national security—'national security' being a somewhat more comprehensive and more modern term—rather than Australia's defence in a purely military sense. That seems, to the opposition, to be the very thing that ASIO ought to be concerned with.
                                                                               </p>
                                                                               <p>
                                                                                The second respect in which these two proposed amendments of the ASIO Act expand the scope of a ministerial directive is to include a new category—that is, Aust­ralia's national economic wellbeing. Senator Ludlam, who could possibly imagine that in the modern world in which economic warfare, in particular cyberwarfare, is identified by any intelligent observer as one of the great threats to a nation's wellbeing, there is something wrong or perverse or overreaching in character about identifying a new category—that is, Australia's economic wellbeing—as a matter properly to be within the purview of a ministerial directive to the director-general of intelligence? For those reasons the two material changes, the second and third of the government amendments which you oppose, are appropriate amendments by redefining defence as national security and including a new category—that is, the protection of Australia's economic wellbeing. These seem to the opposition to be entirely suitable amendments and, for that reason, the opposition supports the government's amendments and opposes your amendments which would seek to delete them from the bill.

I am not as comfortable as Senator Brandis and his colleagues in the coalition or the Labor Party with the idea that corporate espionage is now an entirely legitimate activity for ASIO. They must be doing something in that giant complex that is under construction on the other side of the lake; they are not in there quite yet, but we now have a better idea, albeit still shrouded in complete ambiguity, of what ASIO will be up to. I do not share the opposition's comfort whatsoever that we are not about to vote through a very significant expansion to ASIO's mandate. I will not detain the chamber further. I commend the amendments.

First of all, we have discussed like matters in the past—not these particular matters but like matters—and I entirely accept your good faith in relation to this. As the saying goes, I know where you are coming from. I think you understand that I always cast a sceptical eye over any legislation which significantly expands the policing power of the state, including the intelligence-gathering power of the state. With all due respect, I urge you not to adopt the Pavlovian response that, merely because a piece of legislation expands the mandate of a national security agency, it is ipso facto to be opposed. There are materially changed circumstances.
                                                                                 </p>

We do have a broader understanding of what national security consists of—beyond merely military defence—than we did when this provision was written into the

We do have a more acute awareness of the extent to which damage to the economic wellbeing of Australia is itself a matter which has a direct bearing on the Australian national interest. As I said earlier, the practice of attacking our important and vital trading interests through cyberwarfare—a phenomenon we have seen in recent years—has a direct bearing on our national wellbeing.
                                                                                 </p>

You are probably not a good Liberal, Senator Ludlam; you are probably a good Green—whatever that means. But Liberals do have a presumption against the expansion of state power. It is therefore a non sequitur that any statutory amendment which brings up to date and contemporises the powers of a national security and policing agency is ipso facto a bad thing. On this occasion, on a considered and reflective view, the opposition agrees with the government that these are beneficial and appropriate amendments.

Indeed, I thank the opposition for their position with respect to these amendments.

                                                                                      </p>

Earlier in the debate, Senator Ludlum indicated that his amendment would remove any inconsistencies and certainly would not give rise to any new inconsistencies. Unfortunately, it is the government's view that this is not the case. While the government's bill ensures that there is consistency with the Intelligence Services Act, the act that governs the collection of foreign intelligence by other agencies, Senator Ludlum's amendment would introduce a further inconsistency between these acts.
                                                                                      </p>
                                                                                      <p>
                                                                                       Further, the amendment of 2010 was particularly important for ensuring that Australia's national security agencies were able to obtain interception warrants, to gain intelligence necessary to protect our national interests, not just from traditional sources but from challenges posed by foreign individuals and organisations operating without any government support, whether it be for economic or personal gain.
                                                                                      </p>

I simply repeat the point that has been made several times during this debate: the plethora of nonstate actors and the development and evolution of new threats and new technology threats are all things that the government remains keenly concerned about and the legislative framework should reflect that fact.

The bill amends the Migration Act 1958. The purpose of the bill is stated to ensure that anyone who is charged with a criminal offence whilst in detention is found to have failed the character test. From the date of commencement, a person will fail the character test if they have been convicted of an offence committed in immigration deten­tion, during an escape from immigration detention, during a period where a person has escaped from immigration detention or if the person has been convicted of the offence of escaping from immigration detention, whether the conviction or offence occurred before, on or after that commencement. Where a person fails the character test, the delegate has the power to refuse the grant or cancel a visa on these new character grounds.
                                                                                          </p>

However, we will be seeking to make an important amendment which I will return to later in my remarks. In the coalition's position, the bill is too little too late and it has only become necessary because of the deliberate policy of the former Rudd and the current Gillard Labor governments to soften the coalition's tough but fair border protection policies. All this bill does is create provisions to ensure that anyone inside a detention centre will fail the character test if they commit a crime that attracts a custodial sentence of less than 12 months duration. These changes are in part in response to the criminal behaviour during the recent disturbances at the

It is stated that it is intended that these changes will also provide a disincentive for people in immi­gration detention from engaging in violent and disruptive behaviour.

The important point to remember is that the minister currently has the powers to do that but he has failed to avail himself of those powers. After the Christmas Island riots, which began on 12 March 2011, the minister gave a press conference where he stated:
                                                                                          </p>
                                                                                          <p class="italic">

It will be taken into account by our decision makers and ultimately by me.
                                                                                          </p>

When the minister uttered those words he was admitting that he is currently personally able to make a decision to cancel a person's visa pursuant to section 501(3) of the Migration Act. In such a case, the decision is not subject to the rules of natural justice, nor is it reviewable on the merits and nor is the minister bound, in Australian law, by any of the matters set out in ministerial directions. I again state for the record: the minister has failed to make any decision to refuse or cancel visas using the existing powers. In fact, despite these powers, the history of

Those are provisions which are in place and which the current minister, if he chose to, could avail himself of.
                                                                                          </p>

Why?—because he is a minister who is weak, spineless and completely out of his depth when it comes to the immigration portfolio. One of the fundamental flaws of this bill is that the amendment proposed by the government will only apply to a limited number of people. Whilst the coalition support the new criminal provisions we believe they do not go far enough in that they do not apply to every non-citizen. In fact, the government have failed to provide an explanation as to why the provisions do not apply to every non-citizen.
                                                                                          </p>

                                                                                           The government is very good in its rhetoric when it talks about wanting to strengthen the current border protection policies in Australia but this bill only goes part of the way. The coalition want to see this bill go all of the way and will help the government. We will help the government strengthen border protection in this country. We are going to propose an amendment to ensure that all visa holders are subject to the same requirement. Every visa holder convicted of a crime that attracts a custodial sentence of less than 12 months will also be found to be of not good character and liable to visa cancellation.
                                                                                          </p>
                                                                                          <p>

The current laws entitle the minister, if he chooses, to cancel someone's visa. But he does not choose to do that.
                                                                                          </p>

The minister is not bound by these directions, nor is his decision subject to appeal on the merits. Under section 499 of the Migration Act the minister may give written directions to decision makers, including the Adminis­trative Appeals Tribunal, on how they are to exercise powers under the Migration Act. The direction requires no act of parliament or regulation. It is issued administratively by the minister and is legally binding on all decision makers.
                                                                                          </p>

                                                                                           In June 2009, Minister Evans, the then immigration minister, issued direction 41 under section 499 in relation to visa refusal and cancellation under section 501 of the Migration Act. Minister Evans's direction revoked the previous direction 21 issued by Minister Ruddock in August 2001. The three primary mandated considerations established in the Ruddock directive for determining whether discretion should be used under section 501 to deny a non-citizen from remaining in Australia were (a) protection of the Australian community and members of the community; (b) the expectations of the Australian community; and (c) the best interests of the child or children, where they are involved.
                                                                                          </p>
                                                                                          <p>
                                                                                           The Evans directive abolished the 'community expectations' mandatory con­sider­ation. This requirement would have had special relevance to the recent riots and incidents in our detention network, where, surprisingly, under the coalition's directive, it would have demanded action. However, under Minister Evans—under the Australian Labor Party's watered down directive—there is no community expectation test.
                                                                                          </p>
                                                                                          <p>
                                                                                           In addition, under the 'protection of the Australian community' mandatory con­sideration, the Evans directive abolished the subcriteria that 'visa refusal or cancellation may prevent or discourage similar conduct (general deterrence)' as well as specific reference to serious crimes against the Migration Act. This is also telling, given that the minister is now saying to the people of Australia that he wants to provide a general deterrent against misbehaviour in the detention network.

These are elevated to mandated primary considerations in all cases when exercising discretion. In the previous Ruddock directive they were listed to be considered only where relevant and they were subject to an overarching qualification that Australia's national interest take precedence. Paragraph 2.24 in the Ruddock directive stated:
                                                                                          </p>

The responsibility to determine who should be allowed to enter or to remain in Australia in the interests of the Australian community ultimately lies within the discretion of the responsible Minister.

                                                                                          </p>

Whilst it is clear that the Evans directive weakened the grounds, it would not have prevented the minister acting in relation to the SIEV36 bombers or Christmas Island rioters should he have chosen to do so. The only reason we are debating this piece of legislation in the chamber today is that we have a minister that, despite having certain powers available to him, declines to exercise those powers and make a decision. We have a minister that is weak. We have a minister that fails to exercise the discretionary powers that he is able to under an act.

They had the issue under control and yet they chose to make policy changes and created the problems that we are faced with today.
                                                                                          </p>

Notwithstanding the current bill, former Prime Minister Rudd and current Prime Minister Gillard have an appalling record, and their lack of strong, decisive or appropriate action continues to confirm that the Australian Labor Party is failing to protect Australia's borders.

After listening to Senator Cash's contribution, I am still unclear as to why the opposition are voting for this legislation. While I and the Greens have a very different reason for why we will not be supporting this legislation, the point was made very clearly by Senator Cash that the powers that the minister has spoken publicly about and that this bill would give him already exist within the current legislative framework. We know that he already has powers to ensure that people who hold convictions for serious criminal acts can be judged on that in terms of their character test when applying for permanent protection or permanent residency in Australia.

I agree: the government does not need this piece of legislation. I think it is simply for show. It is a knee-jerk reaction by the government of the day, in the aftermath of some pretty awful and horrific events in detention centres on

The Migration Act as its currently stands already enables the minister to delegate or to consider past and present criminal conduct in determining whether to exercise discretionary powers under the existing character test outlined in sections 501 and 500A.
                                                                                           </p>

In the past four to five years the minister has used this particular section no more than three times. I take the point that Senator Cash made when she said that, under Minister Ruddock, some 500 applications for visas were cancelled. I think that probably says more about the government of the day and the minister—that is, the 'lock up the kids and throw away the key' minister,

                                                                                           </p>

We know that. People have been able to do that in the past. The minister could do that now. This legislation simply goes to punishing people—vulnerable people—twice over because of their situation. If somebody is in serious doubt of an individual's character or the minister does not believe that a person should be given permanent protection and residency in this country, the minister already has the power to make those decisions. The proposed amendments will impose another tier of punishment on a person in addition to the punishment imposed by the court.
                                                                                           </p>

This bill will take the power away from the court and the minister will decide whether somebody, simply because of one minor offence, should be subjected to a lifetime of fear, uncertainty and anxiety. That is what this bill will do.
                                                                                           </p>

This is not a bill that should be introduced by a government that understands the funda­mental principles of human rights. This is not a bill whose passage a government should be asking for if that government fundamentally believes in our principles and obligations under the refugee convention. This government wants to ship people off to Malaysia—expel vulnerable men, women and children to a country that has not signed the refugee convention and that cannot guarantee their rights. This government is doing everything it can to undermine Australia's obligations to the refugee convention.

I totally agree that the people responsible for the destruc­tion of property, the burning of buildings, the rioting and violence that we have seen in immigration detention centres need to feel the full force of the law. That is what the law is for; that is what the courts are for. Let them do their job. Since when should the immigration minister be above the courts? Since when should the immigration minister, simply because of the political will of the day and the knee-jerk jumping at the ghosts of

That is what this legislation does. It does not follow that this piece of legislation would be upheld by a government that believes in the principle of justice and the principles of law. It is likely to hand down lifetime sentences that are absolutely disproportionate in terms of punishment for the offence committed.

During the Senate inquiry into this bill, not only did the government try and push it through and give us only an hour and a half to inquire into this legislation late on Thursday night in the middle of a Senate sitting, but they did not receive one supportive submission to this piece of legislation except their own submission from the bureaucratic department. No-one else believes that this is a good idea. Speak to the legal experts: no-one thinks that this is a good idea. It undermines our basic principles of justice. It says that because this government is jumping at the ghosts of John Howard and Philip Ruddock—and we can see why; we can see the opposition jumping up and saying, 'You're not tough enough'—we have this government saying, 'We are going to start giving punishment above that of the laws and courts in our land.'

We already have these laws, they already breach our obligations and this government wants to extend them even further without any justification, without using the existing laws thus far, all simply to grab a headline to say: 'You know what? We can be as tough as John Howard and Philip Ruddock were.' Bollocks.

No-one is suggesting that they should not, but the current laws allow for the minister to use that, to understand that and not to grant a visa if that is the case. We simply do not need something that extends this beyond the laws that already exist.

We should in this country, as other countries who are signatories to the refugee convention do, accept people's case for protection regardless of their mode of arrival. If somebody comes by boat, or if somebody comes by plane, the place from which they fled, their reasons for fleeing and their need for protection are not different simply because they came by boat rather than coming by plane.

It is because people who arrive by boat in this country are automatically thrown into immigration detention. We know that the current process means that they are in immigration detention for longer. It is prolonged detention—indefinite detention for some, especially those who have arrived since 7 May. It actively discriminates against people who are in immigration detention and those people who have had to take the most desperate avenues to reach our country.

The weight is on what happened to them, what they did and their behaviour while locked up for months and months and years on end. Of course that is going to disproportionately affect people who come here as asylum seekers and are immediately subject to our mandatory detention laws.
                                                                                           </p>

It is absolutely not. It is about deterring behaviour that could simply be deterred if we did not have 6½ thousand people locked up in immigration detention centres in remote locations around the country and, of course, on Christmas Island.

Amnesty International further highlights that, unlike punishment in the criminal justice system, such as imprisonment, being denied a visa may have unquantifiable, ongoing, long-term consequences. Of course that is the case. Very vulnerable people who are subject to long-term detention, mental health deterioration, anxiety and confusion about their case do unfortunately do desperate things and take desperate measures.
                                                                                           </p>

It says that, regardless of the circum­stance, we will automatically deny you protection simply because we lock you up and put you in a situation where you are so desperate that the only cry for help you can make is to sew your own lips together and cause disturbance—whatever the definition of that is—in the small, confined space that you have been locked up in for months and months.
                                                                                           </p>

These are very desperate people. I absolutely agree that if people are convicted of serious criminal acts then of course we need to be looking at their character. But the laws already exist for us to be able to do that. That is not what this piece of legislation is about. This legislation is saying that if you act in disturbance in an immigration detention centre, regardless of your personal circum­stance, regardless of how long you have been there and regardless of the lack of service provision and access to independent support and advice that you have—who cares?—we are not going to let you into our country. We are not going to give you the protection of the convention that for some reason Aust­ralia's signature still sits on.
                                                                                           </p>

That is not what the refugee convention is about. That is not what signatories to the refugee convention should be showing. Australia can do better than that. Australia should be showing the way in our region as to what a serious business being a signatory to the refugee convention is. When we start playing with our laws and saying that one minister should be above the courts of our land, we have a problem. If the courts want to give somebody a serious conviction, that should, of course, be taken into con­sid­eration. That is what the current laws allow.
                                                                                           </p>

We do not even know what that means. We totally under­mine it. We are trashing our reputation in the inter­national sphere because of laws like this which this government wants to introduce. We are trashing our obligations to the ref­ugee convention, and it makes it very, very difficult for countries like Australia to argue that others in our region should sign up to the refugee convention when we do not even prove or show what that obligation really takes: commitment to human rights, justice, fairness and, of course, the rule of law.
                                                                                           </p>

                                                                                            This is a terrible bill, and the Greens will not be supporting it. I think the government has to seriously consider how far it wants to go simply to undermine our basic principles of law and access to justice, the principles of a democratic justice system and, of course, our international obligations. It is an appalling piece of legislation and it should not proceed.

                                                                                             I rise both to speak to the amendment of Senator Cash and the opposition and to sum up the government's position. Firstly I thank all honourable senators for their contributions to this second reading debate on the bill. I remind senators that the purpose of the Migration Amend­ment (Strengthening the Character Test and Other Provisions) Bill 2011 is to ensure that a visa applicant or holder will fail the character test should they be convicted of any offence committed while they were in immigration detention. The bill will also increase the maximum penalty for the manu­facture, possession, use or distribution of weapons by immigration detainees from three to five years imprisonment. I remind senators that this strengthening will provide a more significant disincentive for criminal behaviour inside our immigration detention centres now and in the future. I note from the contributions of both the opposition and the Greens that there does at least appear to be a unanimity of view that it is not okay for immigration detainees to destroy property, to start fires, to throw roof tiles at staff and so forth. Senator Hanson-Young herself spoke to this point, and on that basis I think that is something we can all agree on.
                                                                                            </p>
                                                                                            <p>
                                                                                             The Australian community expects non-citizens who seek to remain in Australia to be of good character. To meet this expec­tation the government must not only have the ability to act decisively and effectively to deal with criminal behaviour by people in immigration detention but also have the legislative basis to refuse to grant a visa or to cancel a visa for those non-citizens who are not of good character. Where the character test is failed, it would, however, remain a matter for the minister or the minister's delegate to consider the factors in relation to the nature of the conviction, any sentence applied and countervailing considerations before deciding whether to exercise the discretionary power under sections 501 and 500A of the Migration Act to refuse or cancel a visa. In other words, a determination that a person does not pass the character test under the new ground would enliven the discretion to refuse or cancel a visa but would not dictate the outcome of the exercise of the discretion.
                                                                                            </p>
                                                                                            <p>
                                                                                             There is a vitally important point here, and I could not help but reach the conclusion on the basis of Senator Hanson-Young's re­marks that it had been lost on the Greens. That is that the ministerial discretion exists only when considering the case of a person who has been convicted. I refer to the explanatory memorandum. It states very clearly:
                                                                                            </p>
                                                                                            <p class="italic">
                                                                                             The amendments to sections 501 and 500A have been drafted to ensure that, where applicable, they apply only to persons who have been convicted of an offence by a court. The amendments made to sections 501 and 500A would not apply to a person who is charged before a court with an offence or offences, and the court is satisfied, in respect of that charge or more than one of those charges, that the charge is proved, but has discharged the person without a conviction on that charge, or any of those charges. That is, there must be at least one conviction for the amendments to sections 501 and 500A to apply.
                                                                                            </p>
                                                                                            <p>

You are right: it is not enough to accuse a detainee of making a disturbance. You are right: a minister is not above the courts of this land. You are right: it is a foundation principle of our legal system. It is a question of what is right and proper. I think that, when you absorb that critical point, you must by your own logic find yourself in support of this bill.
                                                                                            </p>
                                                                                            <p>
                                                                                             The amendments to the character provisions also do not change the existing arrangements relating to natural justice or review rights in relation to the character test. The measures are intended to send a strong and clear message—a message that those opposite have agreed with and a message that the Greens party and Senator Hanson-Young's contribution agree with. That message is this: the kind of unacceptable behaviour recently seen at immigration detention centres will not be tolerated by this government.
                                                                                            </p>
                                                                                            <p>
                                                                                             I turn to the opposition's amendment found on sheet 7100. In considering this, I make the point that this amendment has already failed in the House of Repre­sen­tatives. I trust it will do so here too, because this is an amendment that, amongst its many failings, seeks to introduce a test that is effectively impracticable. The oppo­sition have flagged an amendment which would amend section 501(7) so that all people who have ever had a conviction for any offence with a custodial sentence would have the character test enlivened.
                                                                                            </p>
                                                                                            <p>
                                                                                             There are some four million permanent and temporary visa holders and applicants to Australia each year. The amendment would mean that, for instance, somebody applying to visit Australia on a tourist visa who had been sentenced to a custodial sentence in their home jurisdiction, even if that were 40 years previously, would fail this character test proposed by the opposition. It would mean that every single tourist to this country, regardless of visa type, would then have to be considered by the department in that light. This of course would have a significant impact on the tourist industry, let alone the regulatory and administrative burden that the opposition flings so blasely at the Australian government.
                                                                                            </p>
                                                                                            <p>
                                                                                             The amendment would also apply to skilled workers coming to this country under the 457 visa program, so many employers would be affected through that, and student visas would also be affected. I would like to see the impact on processing times. A regulatory impact statement on the oppo­sition's amendment, I am sure, would bring tears to all our eyes. The opposition has not thought this through. That is why the amendment has failed the common-sense test in the House of Representatives and why I trust it will fail that same test here.
                                                                                            </p>
                                                                                            <p>
                                                                                             It is appropriate that, if you are in immigration detention, you have a very clear understanding of your obligations, because offences in immigration detention—even offences which do not attract a penalty of 12 months or more—involve damage to Com­monwealth property, risk to other detainees, risk to Commonwealth staff and risk to staff of service providers. We have seen all of this in recent times. They are serious offences and it is appropriate that this parliament and this government send a clear message about that sort of behaviour.
                                                                                            </p>

I agree with that; the coalition agrees with that. However, what I would say to the minister in relation to that statement is: if you expect non-citizens who remain in Australia to remain of good character, why are you proposing a bill that only applies to certain non-citizens, and they are those non-citizens who are in immigration detention? The bill as it is currently drafted does not apply to all non-citizens; it only applies to a certain class of non-citizen.
                                                                                             </p>
                                                                                             <p>

The coalition's amendment will ensure that the Migration Amendment (Strengthening the Character Test and Other Provisions) Bill to strengthen the provisions relating to general criminal conduct under the character test will apply to all persons who are not citizens, not just to those who are or should be held in detention. In other words, the amendment would actu­ally achieve what the government has stated that it wants to do, which is to ensure that all non-citizens who remain in Australia remain of good character. The amendment that the coalition puts forward would enable this same test to apply to those on one side of the fence, in immigration detention, as it would to those on the other side of the fence, not in immigration detention. If the government were of a mind to ensure that we had clear standards about acceptable conduct and behaviour—and the minister has stated that that is what the government does have—it would apply these provisions across the board by supporting the coalition's amendment.

The department is currently gridlocked due to the continuous arrival of boats. It simply, at this stage, does not have the resources to properly deal with the processing of most types of visas. Delays are being experienced, as we have heard in evidence at estimates hearings, across most visa categories. Why? Because of the govern­ment's failure to control Australia's borders. Turning specifically to the amend­ment the opposition has put forward, the allegation that it would cause a collapse of the electronic travel authority and would somehow cause chaos within the processing system is simply wrong.
                                                                                             </p>

It is not provided in section 501 of the Migration Act, which the coalition's amendment specifically relates to. Regula­tions relating to the 976 ETA visa stipulate—and I suggest the minister read this—that regulation No. 8528 is a condition that must be imposed with respect to that visa. If you go to regulation 8528, it clearly sets out:
                                                                                             </p>

                                                                                             </p>

They are two completely separate processes.
                                                                                             </p>

I am very surprised at the minister's statement in relation to persons that are convicted of an offence with a sentence of less than 12 months. The implication of what the minister has said is that that makes them less of a threat to Australia. The coalition does not subscribe to that position. If you have been convicted of an offence carrying a custodial sentence of 12 months or less, quite possibly you are just as much a threat to Australia, and that is why we are moving these amendments.
                                                                                             </p>

                                                                                              We also need to bear in mind, in relation to the amendment put forward by the coalition, that—surprise, surprise—we are not the first country, and I would pre-empt that we will not be the last country, that has a requirement to notify of criminal convictions carrying sentences of less than 12 months. This is not a novel idea that is being put forward by the coalition. It is a standard requirement in China, India, Russia, Canada and the United States. If the minister actually wants to stand by the statement that he made that the government expects non-citizens who remain in Australia to remain of good character, supporting the coalition amendment would be a very good start.

Firstly, Senator Cash, you are quite right. This bill does have a narrow goal, if I can put it in those terms, and that is to deal with questions pertaining to persons in detention. It is not seeking to deal with the much wider class of persons that can be described as non-citizens. That is deliberate on our part and it is our continuing intention that that is the appropriate way for this legislation to operate.
                                                                                              </p>
                                                                                              <p>
                                                                                               On the question of boat arrivals and the workload of the department, I guess I would simply make the point that we believe the bill that we are offering to the Senate is practicable. We think that the amendment you are proposing would have a number of consequences, as I have already outlined in my summation of the second reading debate, that would render this legislation gravely flawed.
                                                                                              </p>
                                                                                              <p>

We think the phenomenon you described is in fact a strengthening rather than a weakening or a distraction of the legislation.
                                                                                              </p>

It has been commonly found across legislation for many years. It was the same standard that applied when the coalition was in office and when

That is why the coalition has put forward its amendment. But having a narrow goal is clearly inconsistent with the statement I believe that you made to the Senate, which was that the government expects non-citizens who remain in Australia to remain of good character. The more precise statement should have been that the government expects a certain class of non-citizens who remain in Australia—

I point to the fact that this bill adds to the existing regulatory and legislative framework; it does not replace or subtract from the framework. What I mean by that is that we are, with this bill, pro­viding the government with additional legislative powers with respect to non-citizens who are detained, but that in no way changes the existing obligations, or rights for that matter, of non-citizens found throughout the country. The existing pantheon of rules, laws and regulations will continue to apply to those persons. We would say to all of them that we expect them to remain of good standing in this country.

I would merely state that you are right; it was. However, the fundamental difference, as I outlined in my speech during the second reading debate, was that Minister Ruddock took it upon himself to undertake and use the discretionary powers that were available to him in, I believe I stated, over 500 circum­stances, which is fundamentally, diamet­rically opposite to the use of the powers by ministers under a Labor government.

The coalition supports the purpose of this bill, which is to address potential constitutional issues with Australia's current legislative framework for registering proceeds of crime orders. The coalition supports the aim of the amend­ments, which is to ensure that the framework for providing assistance to foreign countries and international tribunals in registering proceeds of crime orders issued by them continues to operate as intended.

The act provides a scheme to trace, restrain and confiscate the proceeds of crime against Commonwealth law. The act allows in some circumstances for it to be used to confiscate the proceeds of crime against foreign law or the proceeds of crime against state laws. The act also permits confiscated funds to be returned to the Australian community in an effort to prevent and reduce the harmful effects of crime in Australia.

This is a matter I have raised on numerous occasions in Senate estimates and I am mystified still that no action has been taken to ensure that Mr Hicks does not profit from activity that, on any objective assessment, was seriously criminal and, by his own admission, related to the support of terrorism. The only thing the government will say is that it has commenced an investigation into the applicability of the legislation for Mr Hicks's publication that details his support for, and participation in, a terrorist organisation.

The failure of the government to pursue the matter is symptomatic of its slowness to act and its inability to make difficult decisions, preferring instead to brush an issue under the carpet until someone drags it out and confronts them with it. Even then, the government will prevaricate and delay. So I use the occasion of the second reading debate on this bill to once again call upon the government to take the action available to it against Hicks and, in particular, to call upon the Attorney-General to issue the instruction which he is enabled to issue under section 8 of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act to require the commencement of appropriate literary proceeds proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act.

Under the New South Wales legislation the court had no discretion whether to hear from a person affected by the order, and there was no statutory provision available which allowed the person affected to challenge the making of the order.

                                                                                                    </a>

Because there are similar mandatory provisions in the relevant Commonwealth legislation, there is an obvious need for the amendments proposed by this bill so that the Commonwealth legislative scheme does not fall foul of the High Court's decision. The amendments in this bill aim to ensure that the legislative regime providing a court with the power to register and enforce foreign orders continues to function as intended—that is, in conformity with what the High Court decided in the International Finance Trust Company case.
                                                                                                   </p>

The amendments will allow a court greater discretion when deciding whether a foreign order should be registered and enforced in Australia and whether or not to hear an application for registration on an ex parte basis. The amended provisions will require a court to register a foreign order unless it considers it would be contrary to the interests of justice to do so. In deciding whether registration of a foreign order is in the interests of justice, the court is to give due regard to the primary intention of the system. The bill will also insert an objects clause into subdivision A of part VI of the Mutual Assistance Act in order to clarify the intention of this system. The purpose of the subdivision is to allow Australia to give effect to foreign orders in circumstances where property related to serious foreign offences is located in Australia.
                                                                                                   </p>

They aim to ensure Australia is able to provide the same level of assistance to other countries as we would expect of them. As I have foreshadowed, the amend­ments proposed by this bill are necessary and desirable. More than that, they are probably essential to the continued operation of the proceeds of crime regime as it applies to mutual assistance matters. Accordingly, they have the coalition's support.

Increasingly, the proceeds derived from a criminal enterprise are being moved offshore and hidden in other countries in an attempt to thwart law enforce­ment authorities in their investi­gations and prosecutions. In these situations, it is imperative that law enforcement authorities in different countries can cooperate with each other to register and enforce the proceeds of crime orders issued in one jurisdiction where the subject of the order is located in another.
                                                                                                    </p>
                                                                                                    <p>
                                                                                                     The proposed amendments in this bill, as we have heard, will make sure that Australian authorities can continue to offer efficient and effective assistance to their foreign counterparts in enforcing proceeds of crime orders issued by foreign courts. This ensures that criminals cannot escape the consequences of their actions by hiding their illicit gains in Australia. These measures will allow Australian authorities to continue to assist in returning property to its rightful owners. It will also send a strong message of deterrence to potential criminals and where you have derived material gains from the commission of a criminal offence, law enforcement authorities will strip you of that benefit.

I remember that afternoon well, as I asked Angus those questions. No-one should be surprised that, regardless of the consequences, he answered forthrightly and honestly. The headline 'Houston, we have a problem' was inevitable. The no-nonsense approach that day was typical of Angus Houston, who has earned and deserves such a strong reputation for his integrity and decency.
                                                                                                        </p>

This has been clear to all—unfortunately far too often—when we have lost soldiers, killed in action in Afghanistan. The pain for families on their loss is searing, but Angus has always provided comfort to grieving families and grieving soldiers. He knows this to be a critically important and heavy responsibility for our nation's military leader.
                                                                                                        </p>

Angus has the highest standards and the highest expectations of our defence personnel, but, to be fair, they have not always been met. Angus Houston has driven major cultural changes in the ADF. He has not tolerated bullying, bastardisation or sexual harassment. I am sure he would have preferred to have seen current inquiries, such as those into

His commitment to the men and women of the ADF has always impressed me—even his use of language. He would always say 'our people'. He had no higher priority, and everybody knew it.

I have seen firsthand how influential and respected Angus was in international forums, particularly with our partners in the International Security Assis­tance Force in Afghanistan. I thank him for that strong and effective advocacy. I would also like to acknowledge his close working relationship with secretaries of the Depart­ment of Defence and other senior Australian public servants that he worked with as CDF. He respected the Defence diarchy and was committed to making it work. I know too, of course—it goes without question—that he had the absolute respect of all three services.

I simply say tonight to Angus: I sincerely thank you for your help, support and steadfastness to me and my staff when I was defence minister. It was a real pleasure to work closely with you.
                                                                                                        </p>

I think Australia, his adopted nation, owes him a great debt of gratitude. He has done his country proud. I also thank his family, particularly his wife, Liz, for all her support over so many years of service. I sincerely hope that Angus and Liz will now have time to do all the things together that were never possible over the past 41 years.

Level 3 is the highest level of palliative care service there is. These services are at the St Vincent hospice service, which has 30 beds, 18 of which are public, and the Metro South Palliative Care Service, which currently has seven publicly funded beds located at Canossa Private Hospital. Both these services provide high-quality care and services, and both are working to full capacity.

The beds announced in the budget must be additional beds if the government is to call them 'new beds', not beds taken away from another service.

Patients of Canossa palliative care unit—people who are terminally ill—and their families and friends, cannot praise enough the level of care that it provides. These patients know what they are talking about because they have had very considerable experience within the hospital system in all its incarnations.
                                                                                                         </p>

Patients say that the staff are simply wonderful. Staff are compassionate because they have a deep understanding of what patients and their families are going through. That is what good palliative care means—well trained and understanding staff. It is worth remembering that it is not only the patients who need the physical, spiritual and emotional support but also family members. That is what good palliative care means—a holistic approach to the impending death of a loved one. Otherwise family members are left to process not only their loss but also the way in which their loved one died.

These are all absolute necessities for good, holistic palliative care.
                                                                                                         </p>

These are much needed skills which will cease to be taught at Canossa if the state Labor government has its way. Research has shown that medical specialists treat the underlying condition but often overlook taking care of the palliative care needs of a patient, such as ensuring the most basic of things like managing pain appropriately or managing the support needed by a patient's family.

It identified huge gaps in knowledge and the services available to Australians living with pain. Amongst those gaps was the inadequate pain relief for end-of-life care.
                                                                                                         </p>

It is not uncommon to see palliative care patients, sometimes in chronic pain, waiting for hours in accident and emergency wards in Queensland hospitals and then being admitted to an acute ward that does not have the skill set to deal with palliative care patients.
                                                                                                         </p>

In Queensland, the total population is just over 4½ million and the Metro South Health Service District, which Canossa Private Hospital falls under, has a catchment population of 1.34 million people. As I said, not only is our population growing, but it is ageing. It is therefore inconceivable that the Queensland government plans to take away these desperately needed palliative care beds from South Brisbane. Something is seriously wrong with both our federal and state health systems and our priorities if I have to make this argument.
                                                                                                         </p>

I refer to the people power I spoke about earlier. That was partly the reason for a delay to the closure but, as I said, the other reason for the delay was the ineptitude of the Queensland government, which could not get anything else happening.
                                                                                                         </p>

It outlined a study conducted in 2008 of 33 high quality systematic literature reviews and 89 intervention studies and concluded that there is strong to moderate evidence that palliative care improves important aspects of end-of-life care, such as reducing a patient's distressing symptoms and relieving some of the burden on caregivers. Any of us can put ourselves in the situation and think about what it actually means when we talk about relieving the distressing symptoms of a terminally ill person or assisting their care givers. I think that would give us a better picture of what we have to do here.

That is not a common occurrence right now.

Students will no longer have to leave the Territory and their homes to become a doctor. For many kids in school aspiring to be doctors, the practicalities have become much less challenging. As well as being great for future students, by association, this is a great step forward for the future of health services in the Northern Territory. I have heard the Chief Minister champion many times—and with his generosity I will reiterate his sentiments this evening—the fact that, for the very first time in the Northern Territory, whether you are Indigenous or non-Indigenous, you can now go to preschool, primary school, secondary school and then university and come out as a qualified doctor. For us that is a great step forward when it comes to the provision of health services in the Territory.

What this means, we would hope, is that a doctor trained in the Territory is much more likely to remain and practise in the Territory. And we desperately need more of them. Moreover, the new centre and its medical program is going to have a focus on Indigenous health and the needs of Indigenous communities. It is already showing dividends for the Northern Territory. Currently, only 1.6 per cent of the national health workforce is made up of Indigenous people. When the

Remote Australia is sorely in need of more doctors and healthcare workers. I am quite confident that a good proportion of the 24 students currently enrolled will end up working in the Northern Territory, and hopefully in the bush, where they are most needed. I have now had the pleasure of meeting these students twice—on the very first day they started this course in February and, of course, back in June when we opened the physical location in which they now continue their course. Already, several of them have indicated to me their desire to stay in the Northern Territory once they have completed their training. This is the start of making a tremendous difference to health outcomes for Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory.

The Royal Darwin Hospital's Emergency Department is the busiest in the country, and this is largely because of a shortage of GP services in Darwin and Palmerston. This new facility at Charles Darwin University will help take pressure off Territory hospitals by producing more GPs for the Territory.
                                                                                                          </p>

Our first-year students enrolled in this combined course with Flinders University watch and participate in lectures given at Flinders University with 100 or so other first-year students by teleconferencing over the internet. They now have the capacity to watch what is happening at a hospital in Adelaide or at Flinders University via the internet techniques and the state-of-the-art technology that has been put into this new medical facility. So it is not only forging a path when it comes to training more Indigenous and non-Indigenous doctors for the Northern Territory but it is also state-of-the-art when it comes to tele-health, e-health and internet service facilities for educational provision.

The general practice side of the superclinic places an emphasis on providing the best care to the patients as well as teaching the new generation of doctors. It provides fantastic hands-on learning oppor­tunities to medical students in a clinical environment, and an incentive to studying, training and ultimately working in the Territory.
                                                                                                          </p>

This silly policy decision by the opposition would have negatively impacted the Northern Territory for generations. In fact, one of the reasons we are struggling for doctors today is that the Howard government capped the number of places across the country for students to study medicine. But this government's national health reform ensures doctors, nurses and allied health professionals are trained and equipped to work in areas where they are most needed. This new facility is an important part of our aspiration to train 6,000 more doctors in Australia.

The Northern Territory got a further $150 million surcharge in health infra­structure, a massive boost that will not only provide much needed health infrastructure but also have the added benefit of stimu­lating the local economy and creating jobs. Through the Health and Hospitals Fund, the federal government is providing $70 million to go towards a hospital for Palmerston, with the Northern Territory government providing the additional $40 million. Not only will the Palmerston hospital reduce patient waiting times, encourage patients to get treatment and reduce the number of hospital admis­sions but it will also focus on improving Indigenous health.

Since the Senate debate on 16 June on the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Amendment (Fair Indexation) Bill, my constituents and those of senators in other states have expressed frustration and anger at the bill's failure. I understand this. Their indexation campaign has been a long one, and I have worked over the years to help promote it.

I took part in the debate on 16 June to point out some of the problems of this bill and why I was voting against it. In summary, this bill did not provide a sustainable, fair and funded solution to the inadequacy of

Unfortunately a lot of misinformation has since been circulated, either from ignorance or malice. One of these myths is that before the last election I and the Labor Party had promised to vote for this bill.

This indexation would include a wage related or MTAWE factor, which the coalition government had so strenuously opposed throughout its 11 years of government. However, before this announcement the then Minister for Finance and Deregulation had announced that our government, the Labor government, had accepted the Matthews report and its recommendations. In essence the Matthews report recommended that the method of indexation for Commonwealth defence and civilian pensions should remain indexed by CPI alone, unless:

The shortcomings of the CPI alone as a measure of the cost of living have been acknowledged—even by Matthews! The government in introducing its new index for the aged pension (the PBLCI—Pensioner and Bene­ficiary Living Cost Index) acknowledged this also, so it is not a point of argument.

Of course they deserve it, and of course we owe a debt to those who have served Australia, but we should not seek to water down this campaign, or to divide those involved, by choosing to benefit only one group and not the others. I agree with David Jamison and the DFWA that this political football with veterans should stop.

I thought it fairly ironic to see that Senator Nick Minchin, who throughout the 11 years of the Howard government so vigorously opposed any change whatsoever to the indexation of military and civilian pensions, was on 16 June paired on the side of supporting the private member's DFRDB indexation bill.

This has included setting up a campaign section on my website. Through this website we have been able to gather information and ideas, to compile some case histories and case studies, and to gauge major areas of need, such as those on the lower pensions. I thank contributors who have made constructive suggestions and comments and those who have raised legitimate criticisms and aired their frustrations.

                                                                                                            Unfortunately, because of recent inappropriate, inaccurate and abusive comments which unfairly reflect on many passionate and constructive advocates for fair indexation, I have decided to close this comments section for the time being. Of course, I could have filtered out the abusive comments, but that would bring accusations of censorship. Those interested in the history of the campaign to date can still access it on the website, and comments can still reach me by mail or email.
                                                                                                           </p>

Our work in persuading our colleagues of the merits and necessity for this action has, I think, been hampered by a daily barrage of abusive, sometimes racist and inaccurate emails apparently sent to all senators and members as well as staff. This is counterproductive to the campaign, and it has been recognised by the DFWA, who have apologised and disassociated their organisation from such action.

They partic­ularly noted the benefits, such as the increase in the low-income tax offset, the increase in the tax-free threshold for low-income earners and the 50 per cent tax discount on interest on savings and deposits of up to $1,000. Those on ComSuper and Defence pensions, like others in the community, benefited from the economic stimulus plan and received either the $900 tax bonus payment or the earlier Economic Security Strategy payments to pensioners and carers of $1,400 for singles or $2,100 for couples. They have shared the benefits of the Labor government's investments in health reform and aged care services. Australians in general, including those on Commonwealth defence and civilian pensions, would not have fared so well under a coalition government and its cuts.

That the CPI no longer provides fair indexation is no longer in dispute, and I have sought advice on the development of a new analytical living cost index, or

A priority of my advocacy within government will be to make the case for recognition of specific cost of living impacts on Commonwealth defence and civilian superannuants and to alleviate the tax burden of those on the lowest incomes. This is a campaign I feel very strongly about, and I commend this issue to all of my colleagues and believe that the campaign is at its best when it is bipartisan in its character.
