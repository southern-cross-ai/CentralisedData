        I rise to ask a couple of questions of the Minister for Superannuation, Financial Services and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Economy" rel="nofollow">
         Digital Economy
        </a>
        about this. But, before we get there, it is worth reflecting on where we are in the process of this debate. Yesterday, without notice, the government moved to crunch debate on three very important bills—three bills that relate to a superannuation system worth $3 trillion; three bills that go to the financial interests of every working Australian; and three bills that, in combination, have the potential to disadvantage three million Australians by as much as $240,000 at retirement, a consequence of shoddy drafting, shoddy policy work and an ideological obsession with supporting their mates in the financial services sector at the expense of the evidence. I think it is a pretty pathetic indictment of this government that a system as important as Australians' superannuation system is the subject of endless petty partisanship.
       </p>
       <p>
        For eight years, every bill on superannuation that has been brought before this parliament has been marred by a fixation with an ideological war, at the expense of the evidence. Nothing this government ever does in relation to superannuation is in the national interest. Nothing this government ever does in relation to superannuation relates in any way to the interests of working people. It is just one endless petty culture war after the other. It is a fixation driven by people on the other side who cannot bear the idea that industry super funds even exist, that this system, which is the envy of people all over the world, exists and works, and that this system allows businesses and workers and their representatives to direct their own financial interests, make investments and make some contribution to the structure of business and of capital investment in this country. This system, which works so well, has delivered for so many people and has lifted so many people into a dignified retirement, is the thing they can't bear. And why not? It is because the idea that ordinary people might have a say or might have a seat at the big table is anathema to these people. These people think that that right ought to be preserved for the merchant bankers—the business people in the really nice suits. It's not for the working types, not for people who do an ordinary job, nor for the people who get up early, go to work and do hard labour. It's not for them and their representatives; it's just for people like those on the other side.
       </p>
       <p>
        I had actually thought it might come to an end when Ms O'Dwyer left the portfolio. I had thought that perhaps things might get better. But the performance yesterday and what I expect to happen today don't suggest that anything has changed at all under this minister, because Minister Hume is stubbornly persisting with a program of legislation that everyone has told her is flawed. When you've got Innes Willox—not a notorious socialist—from a key employer group, out begging the government to put aside ideology and look at the evidence, it should be a signal to you, Minister, that you have a problem. When you've got Innes Willox saying that people like Andrew Bragg, who likes to chat a lot on this topic, might need to put aside the eight years of hostility to superannuation that he built up during his time at the Financial Services Council, it might be an indication that the government has a problem, because your credibility on super is shot.
       </p>
       <p>
        Every time a superannuation bill comes before this chamber, the one thing that we can be absolutely certain of is that the interests of ordinary people won't be in play. There'll be a weird set of interests from the Liberal Party. There'll be a weird set of internal stakeholders who've got some nutty conspiracy theory about how industry superannuation works. There'll be Andrew Bragg with an entirely misconceived idea about how industry super's investments work. There'll be the Financial Services Council, who've got a particular set of views that you're always ready to listen to. But there'll never be an examination of the evidence. There'll never be an engagement with the findings of Commissioner Hayne, who was very clear about which parts of the superannuation system required particular and additional attention and which parts were working okay. There won't be an engagement today with the evidence from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Productivity Commission
        </a>
        that there is a whole section of the superannuation industry that will be left unregulated by this bill and that is letting workers down. None of that is to be engaged with, if we are to take at her word the contribution the minister made last night.
       </p>
       <p>
        The thing is we don't know what we're really dealing with today, because a deal has been done. Last night Senator Hanson, Senator Roberts and Senator Griff gave their vote to the government to crunch all this through, to make sure that the terms of the debate today would be very narrow, that the time for the debate would be very narrow, that senators in many instances would be in a position where they were voting on amendments that they had only just seen and where the time allocated for discussion was very, very limited indeed. Why is this government so allergic to scrutiny, Minister? That might be something that you address in your first contribution.
       </p>
       <p>
        The final thing I want to come to is the amendments that are before us to the bill that we are now dealing with. Senator Hanson has circulated three amendments. One of them goes to improving tax concessions for a small number of very wealthy people. Curiously enough, the age at which this measure kicks in is 67. Senator Hanson was willing to give the government the support to bring all this on last night, and it happens, if we're to believe Wikipedia, that Senator Hanson herself has only recently turned 67. What a coincidence. The question I have for you, Minister, is: will you be supporting her amendment? Is this the deal that's been done? We know a deal's been done, but we don't know its terms, because you haven't been willing to be upfront about that. So I'm inviting you now to tell us the terms of this deal and, in particular, to tell us what the government's voting position will be on each of the amendments that have been circulated on this bill in this chamber in the name of Senator Hanson.

         , for that contribution. There are a number of amendments that are going to be put forward today from right across the chamber on all three bills. The government has a different position on each one, as you would expect. On the three amendments that are coming from Senator Hanson today, there are two that the government will be supporting and there is one that the government will not be supporting.

              Minister, thank you for that. It's a very obtuse answer to my question. We can assume that you've secured the support of three senators for crunching your legislation through. What are the terms on which you have secured their support? What have you offered them, what can the Australian people expect, and what do senators need to know before they make their position clear on this bill?

Removing the ECC charge to excess super contributions will help simplify the superannuation system and also cut red tape. It's imposed on people even when they breach their cap through no choice of their own, such as in situations where their employer pays more than the 9.5 per cent superannuation guarantee rate. Twenty-six per cent of employees are currently on agreements where their employer pays in excess of 9.5 per cent. The proposed amendment would remove the ECC charge but leave intact the existing integrity arrangements which ensure that any excess contributions continue to be taxed appropriately at an individual's marginal tax rate.

                        So this has been the subject of negotiation between yourself and Senator Hanson? It is a change which delivers a benefit to high-income people who get paid more than the standard superannuation rate. That sounds exactly like the situation of most senators. Why is it that Senator Hanson can come in here—she's not even here, actually. She can't be bothered to come and defend her own amendments. You're here carrying the can for her, Minister. But you've agreed to this. Why is it that you think that approving an amendment that directly benefits Senator Hanson is appropriate?

                          Yes, I understand that the government intends to support this change. I'm inviting you to tell the people of Australia why people who go over the cap, which is quite generous at $27,000, a little bit over, need a tax cut. Because, honestly, if I think about the people that I know in my community, there aren't many tipping more than 27,000 bucks into their super every year. That is a very elite group of people. How many Australians are going to benefit from this, Minister? Why is it that the remainder of Australians, who don't benefit from this, should bear the costs of the change that you're proposing?

                              Minister, your advice just now is that you are in here committing the government to vote for an amendment that will benefit a very small group of Australians and that will cost the budget, and you've got absolutely no idea by how much?

                                I concede, Minister, that that gives you a generous period of time to get around to this. But is this the new standard that we're going to see for governance? You come in here, you do a deal with Senator Hanson to ram your bills through, and the price of that is an amendment of uncertain cost that you're willing to tick off on despite the fact you've got absolutely no idea about the consequence for the budget? This is the problem with the way you are dealing with superannuation. It is a toy. It is a thing for endless political games. It is the subject of deals which you're very reluctant to discuss, but you can't even do the basics.
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                What government would come in here and ask senators to support a proposition where you've got absolutely no idea of the fiscal impact? The superannuation system does actually have a pretty substantial impact on the budget. You won't see this side of politics wandering out there making propositions about super without thinking that question through. It astonishes me that you would come in here and give government support for something that was dreamt up by Senator Hanson, in her own interest, without even bothering to cost it. Will this be the standard you'll be setting for all of the other amendments that are before us today?

                                      It certainly does affect a very small number of people and a lot of people in this chamber. Do you think this is what the Australian public expect from us? Do you think they expect us to come in here and spend time debating amendments that, in your words, affect a very small number of people and provide a benefit to a very small number of people, most of whom earn very generous incomes? Do you think they expect you to just tick that off without looking at the impact of the cost on the budget or without thinking through the kind of benefit that's going to be offered to the people sitting around you?

                                       I think the Australian people expect a superannuation system that serves them rather than the superannuation funds that administer it. The government uses its quite considerable constitutional powers to compel Australians to sequester nearly $1 in $10 of everything they earn potentially for up to 40 years, and yet they do so in a highly inefficient system. Everything that the government has done in its entire time in this parliament has been to improve the efficiency of the system through reducing the number of duplicate accounts out there—having duplicate accounts means there are two sets of fees and two sets of insurances—ensuring insurances are appropriately applied and can be claimed on; ensuring that there is competitive tension that drives fees down; and ensuring that the long tail of underperforming superannuation funds that people languish in for years and years is eliminated from this system. Indeed, the bills that are before us now are about making superannuation more flexible, specifically for older Australians who haven't had the benefit of compulsory superannuation throughout their working lives. We will continue unapologetically to do so.

                                          Does it not concern you, Minister, that you are potentially signing taxpayers up to many billions of dollars as a result of supporting these crossbenchers, because you don't know what the cost is? You say we should wait for the budget update, but today's the day when you're about to put people on the hook. If we're about to see the parliament deliver tens of billions of dollars of taxpayers' funds to a very small number of people, I would have thought we were entitled to know that.

                                           The government will always make a decision on amendments based on their individual merits. Indeed, in regard to the cost of those amendments, it would be very helpful to government if those who were proposing amendments would do their own costings. For instance, I understand that there is an

                                           amendment to this legislation that's before us now. Again, I don't know what the cost effect of that would be. Should the government have chosen to support that amendment, again, the costs would be outlined in MYEFO, as is usual practice.

                                            Isn't the difference, though, Minister, that, as is my understanding, the government is not supporting any of the Labor amendments—or is supporting a very small number of them at best—but it's the government that is choosing to back in crossbench amendments? So isn't it a little bit more relevant to have some idea of the cost of amendments that are going to pass with the government's support than of any other amendments that anyone might be moving that are going to go down? That's the issue.

                                             The government makes decisions about whether to support or not support amendments that are made by the crossbench or, indeed, the opposition very carefully and considers the effects on the underlying legislation. The opposition have put forward their many amendments to these three bills today. If they have provided any costings themselves attached to those amendments, then the government might take them more seriously.

                                                 It is worth explaining to the chamber, is it not, what just happened? What just happened was that the government voted against reporting their own bill out of the committee stage—the bill they drafted. And why did they do that? It's very unusual. I don't think I have ever seen the government vote against their own bill. As far as I can tell—and I will be interested to see how this unfolds—this was to give Senator Hanson, who was running late and who's now appeared in the chamber, the chance to move her amendments, which benefit her. This is exactly about the government using all of their numbers to protect the financial interests of Senator Hanson. What a disgrace! What an embarrassing abuse of chamber process—to prevent your own bill from exiting committee to help one person on the crossbench move amendments designed to financially benefit her. What a disgrace!

I don't know whether this has ever happened before and I'd be very interested to find out. It's certainly not something that I've witnessed either in the Senate or in my many, many years in the Tasmanian parliament. The government has actually voted against the progress of its own bill in order to allow Senator Hanson to move her amendments.

So there it is: this is simply the result of a dirty deal done between the government and

                                                      Sterle, for doing this. I do admit that what happened was because of me; it wasn't the government holding up the legislation. I admit when I'm wrong, but I will tell the truth, unlike a lot of other people in this chamber. The whole fact is that it came time to actually move the amendments, and I ran to get to the chamber in time to actually move the amendments. So that is the truth. It's got nothing to do with the government whatsoever.
                                                     </p>
                                                     <p>
                                                      I do have a concern with one of my proposed amendments. I've just discovered it has not been printed to my wishes correctly. Therefore I am considering what to do with this. Unless I have confirmation from the government that it can be changed, I am of the opinion that I don't think it can be changed. That was the amendment on sheet 8983 revised 2. The amendment says that if you're aged 67 years or over you get $5,000 to put into your superannuation account. That was basically for all Australians, because 67 years of age is the retirement age. We are struggling to keep people in the workforce, so it is basically an incentive for all Australians. It doesn't matter who you are or what work you do—whether you're a truck driver, whether you're someone who works in a retail business or whether you're someone who works in the mines—if you're 67 years of age, it's to have an incentive to put an extra $5,000 into your super.
                                                     </p>
                                                     <p>
                                                      What we find now is that a lot of people are actually drawing out their super at retirement age, paying off their homes, going for holidays, spending the money and ending up on the pension. It was an incentive to keep people in the workforce regardless of who they are—for all Australians, those battlers, everyone. But, as I see now, it was supposed to be only $5,000 a year, not increased by $5,000 every year. That was not what I wanted to see written here. Therefore I'm in a bit of a dilemma.
                                                     </p>
                                                     <p>
                                                      I still believe that Australians over the age of 67, those older Australians, should be able to put the money into their accounts and stay in the workforce, which we need. Just because you're 67 and you're of retirement age—I'm proud to say I am 67 years of age. I turned 67 yesterday. If Senator

                                                      </a>
                                                      thinks that I'm staying here for an extra six years for $30,000, he doesn't know me. I don't need to be in this place with a lot of pusillanimous politicians for the next six years for an extra $30,000. It's about the battlers. It's for people out there to be able to stay in the workforce from 67 years of age, and to give them some incentive for why they should. They're worth their weight in gold. Most of my employees in my office are over the age of 67. I'm proud to say that. The people who worked in my fish and chips shop were also of the older age group, and they are worth their weight in gold.
                                                     </p>
                                                     <p>
                                                      This is about the battlers. Those people were given the opportunity to take their money out of superannuation to use in the time of COVID. This is now going to give them the opportunity to put that money back in without any penalties up until 2030. Give those people who have used the money the opportunity to put it back into their superannuation funds so they will have that money when they come to retirement age. Was that Labor's policy? No. They're not worrying about those battlers. The battlers, those hardworking Australians, utilised taking money out of their superannuation accounts thanks to the government giving them that opportunity. But now that they're back in work it's about allowing them the opportunity to put that money back into their accounts. I'd like to see how Labor's going to vote on that one, because they've been knocking back the opportunity for all the battlers to put money back into their accounts.
                                                     </p>

                                                      The next point is about the concessional contribution of money into your superannuation. If you are over the $26,000 or $27,000 that you put into your super at the moment from your employer—anything over that and you're paying the full tax rate on that money. And then you have the opportunity to pull it out. But, again, you are taxed at three per cent for drawing your money out. You're drawing out money that you paid full tax on and they want to hit you again for another three per cent. It's about getting rid of that three per cent, considering you've already paid your tax on it.

                                                      If you think that I'm moving this is because of me, and for $30,000—come on, mate, you just don't know me. I've probably paid more tax in this country than you ever have. I've done more work for the people of Queensland, and I have actually achieved more for Queensland in the past five years than some of the Queensland senators in this parliament. I am fed up with the lies, the misrepresentation and the people who put a spin on so many issues here. Talking about the casualisation of those in the mines: it was

                                                      that actually got the government to get rid of casualisation, allowing those Australians to actually turn around and ask for full-time employment after 12 months of working in a job. That was One Nation. That was me. That was not Labor. That was not Labor and it definitely wasn't Murray Watt pushing for that.

It's up to you how you want to vote for this. If you want to play your politics in this place—I'm sick and tired of it and so are the Australian people. Stop damn well twisting and saying anything.

That even further explains your actions in moving this amendment. When I spoke on this last night I realised that you were 67 and that that was the reason you were trying to move a tax benefit for people who are 67 or older. What I didn't realise was that you were moving the amendment to benefit 67-year-olds on the day you turned 67. That is ingenious! How long did you spend working out how you could manipulate the system to give yourself a pay rise on your birthday? I've heard of a lot of people out there who like to buy themselves a birthday present on their birthday because they're not sure what they're going to get. I've never heard of a politician coming down to Canberra to move an amendment to use taxpayers' money to give themselves a birthday present on their birthday, but that's what Senator Hanson did just yesterday, on her birthday. That is extraordinary!

                                                        Senator Hanson, you said that you ran down into the chamber. I can understand why you ran down into the chamber, because you were so desperate to move this amendment to give yourself a birthday present—not only a $30,000 pay rise but a $30,000 birthday present at taxpayers' expense.

                                                        were going to do that, I would be running down to the chamber as well. But do you know what's different about you and me? I don't run down to the chamber to give myself a pay rise. I didn't get elected to Canberra to give myself a pay rise. I got elected to actually look after battlers, not bullshit to them like you do, constantly.

                                                          man, unlike Senator Hanson, you and I did not get ourselves elected to Canberra to give ourselves a pay rise. We don't run around our respective states misleading people and pretending that we care about them only to get ourselves elected and give ourselves a pay rise, like Senator Hanson has done. The truth about what we've just seen this morning is that Senator Hanson has been caught out. Senator Hanson has been exposed as the fraud that she always has been, in claiming to support battlers but, in fact, only trying to help herself. She has been shamed into coming down into this chamber—running down into this chamber, by her own admission—to try to fiddle with this amendment that she put together yesterday, because she's been caught out trying to use taxpayers' money to give herself this pay rise.

                                                          Those of us who are from Queensland and have been watching Senator Hanson in action have been used to her having her snout in the trough for a very long time. She has had her snout in the public trough for over 20 years. Usually it's to try to access electoral funds that are meant to go to her party to use instead for her own personal benefit. What's different this time—

                                                         <p>
                                                          is that she's got her snout in the trough to benefit herself personally.

I think, Senators, that we can all get very passionate in this place, and none more than me at times. I would encourage you, Senator Watt, to reflect on your comments there. There are plenty of opportunities to get your point across. Senator Watt, I probably would ask you just to contemplate a retraction. I am asking that. It's entirely your call. Senator

I think she may also considering withdrawing some of her remarks.

Let's—sorry, Senator Roberts, just let me finish please. I will come to you. I would ask both senators if they would have the ability to contemplate a retraction of accusations across the chamber. I can't control your doing that, but I'm asking. Senator Watt.

Of course, Senator Hanson, unlike most people in this chamber, just happens to tick each box: high-income earner and 67. What a nice wicket!
                                                                        </p>

We have calculated that, over the course of a six-year Senate term, it amounts to $30,000, but there are other calculations that have been performed this morning which suggest that, in fact, it could be up to the value of $150,000. But let's be generous to Senator Hanson and assume she's only trying to give herself a $30,000 pay rise. What sort of politician, what sort of political representative, sets out, when they're thinking about what they want to achieve in Canberra, that their top priority is to give themselves a pay rise? What sort of person does that? What sort of person goes around to Queenslanders, misleading struggling battlers and trying to tell them that they're on their side, when, in fact, what they do is they secretly come down to Canberra and circulate amendments under the cover of darkness which are intended to give them at least a $30,000 pay rise? I'll tell you what kind of politician does that: Senator Hanson does that, and she has form.
                                                                        </p>
                                                                        <p>
                                                                         Whether you look back over her recent political career or her longer-term political career, one consistent thing we have seen from Senator Hanson is a laser-like focus on targeting public funds to enrich herself. She's done it before with electoral funds. She's doing it now with taxpayers' funds on superannuation.

I think what we saw yesterday from Senator Hanson will go down in history as one of the biggest attempted rorts and one of the biggest attempted swindles of the public purse that Australia has ever seen from a federal politician. It will go down in history as 'Pauline's Payday'. That's what yesterday was. That was about Senator

That's what happened yesterday. And I can understand why Senator Hanson is now desperately running to the chamber to try to tidy up this mess; it's because she's been caught out.
                                                                          </p>

I've never felt it more strongly than I feel it today, because not only is she trying to enrich herself personally but she's doing it at the expense of the very battlers whom she was elected to this parliament to represent. It is a shameful day, even for Senator Hanson. The government is complicit. We know there's been a dodgy deal done between the government and

Already, people in Queensland know very well what you've been up to here, Senator Hanson. They're only going to know more about it. You can laugh, if you think it's funny to rip off taxpayers' funds.

I think it's a very serious matter that Senator Hanson should be completely ashamed of, trying to rip off taxpayers in this manner.

                                                                              </p>

These amendments will allow those Australians who have withdrawn their money the opportunity to put that money back into their account by 2030. This is a way of saving—for people to put their money back into their account with no penalties. I think it would be great for the Australian people to actually have the opportunity to put it in.
                                                                              </p>

Therefore, I take it that Labor are totally opposed to people being able to put their money back into their account without any penalties over the next 10 years. They are going to vote against those people who had to pull money out due to not having work and finding it financially difficult. It is important to these people back in the workforce now, these Australians, these battlers out there, to get as many savings away into their superannuation as they possibly can.
                                                                              </p>

They pay tax on it on the way in. Actually, if they pay over the $25,000 threshold, they are paying full tax on it. They are given the opportunity to pull that money out in a certain period of time after the end of the financial year, but they are penalised another three per cent. Remember that they have already paid their full tax on it, and you want to penalise them again by having them pay another three per cent on that money. This will get rid of that three per cent and they can draw out their money within a specified period of time. So I think it would help a lot of people if they want it to.
                                                                              </p>

I hope that Labor will actually support the battling Australians on these amendments that I'm putting forward and give Australians the opportunity to put their money back into their accounts and save for their future retirement years.
