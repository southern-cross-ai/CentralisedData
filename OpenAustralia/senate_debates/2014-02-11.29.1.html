        My question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister for Employment, Senator Abetz. I ask the minister: what is the government doing to uphold the rule of law in the construction industry and to tackle infiltration by criminal elements in that industry?

         The government is determined to reintroduce the Australian Building and Construction Commission, which has been delayed by yet another Senate tactic by the Labor-Greens alliance.

         </a>
         is absolutely critical to address the problems of corruption and standover tactics which have now been revealed, chapter and verse, in the gush of revelations by the ABC and

         and whistleblowers.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         I am reminded of a photograph, which I table, of a bikie gang sergeant-at-arms marching in the infamous anti-Grocon rally in Melbourne wearing his
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
          CFMEU
         </a>
         jacket over his Comanchero t-shirt. The person he was walking next to in this picture was the Victorian assistant secretary of the CFMEU. That was the dispute where police officers were bashed, and workers at the site—CFMEU members—took out an advertisement against their own union bosses, seeking protection. And Mr Shorten? Deathly silent. Instead of intervening to condemn, he was silent. When the Victorian CFMEU and the Comancheros were making house visits to builders, Mr Shorten was again completely silent. Even worse, the next thing Mr Shorten did as minister for workplace relations was to legislate to expand the right of entry of these types of people onto construction sites.
        </p>
        <p>
         The best way to deal with thuggery, intimidation and violence on building sites is by re-establishing the Australian Building and Construction Commission, a matter for which we have a very clear mandate from the Australian people.

           has demanded that union leaders outlaw the entry of anyone wearing bikie colours or badges into building and construction site across the country.
          </p>
          <p>
           In other words, he was promoting a mufti day for the bikies! He does not want to change the people going into the sites, just what they wear. He does not want to change their behaviour; he just wants to change what they wear so they cannot be identified with outlawed bikie gangs. This is Bill Shorten's, the great Labor leader's, answer to corruption and thuggery and intimidation in workplaces and on construction sites: 'Change your clothes. Wear a different jacket and everything will be all right.' What we need is a change of culture. We need a change of personality. We need a change of—

              The government is on the side of honest trade-union members who have been let down by dodgy union bosses. We got an interjection from the other side saying that nobody seems to know what a royal commission would do. Funny, that. Your former Labor Attorney-General,

               Robert McClelland

              person that blew the whistle knows what a royal commission would do. But those over there who have been engaged in the union movement will not see and attend to that which needs to be cut out of the union movement to protect those honest union members who want to see the reputation of the trade union movement flourish and not diminished by the sorts of rackets the Labor Party—
