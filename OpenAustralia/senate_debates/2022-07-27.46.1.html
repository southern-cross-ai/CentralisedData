        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. In May the Australian people voted for a Labor government with real plans to build a better future. Can the minister update the Senate on how the government is working towards that goal?

         Thank you to Senator Walsh for the question. It's rare to get an interjection on a dixer but I know it's early days in the process of dealing with the change of government on that side.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would say this: as we start this new term I hope all of us in this chamber recognise the privilege with which we have been entrusted in whichever roles we have, and that is no less than the opportunity to change people's lives for the better. Those of us on this side of the chamber understand that good government can do this. Good government can keep us safe. Good government can provide help to those who need it and support when times get tough. And, importantly, good government can open the doors of opportunity. If you listened to the remarkable first speeches we've been hearing in the House from such a diverse, fantastic group of new Labor MPs—and I look forward to our new senators' as well—you hear the stories of the extent to which Labor governments have changed people's lives for the better and have enabled opportunities to be opened to people for their betterment. You see, good government can enable aspiration. It can enable people to achieve their dreams.
        </p>
        <p>
         Nine weeks ago Australians did vote for good government. They voted for a better future. Labor has come to office at a time of great uncertainty. We've got an inheritance from the other side. They might not like to hear it, but it includes $1 trillion of debt from a government that wasted 10 years. It includes rising cost of living. It includes low wages growth. It includes climate change and its devastating impact, which they're still having a fight about.

            Labor has not wasted the day in securing a better future. One of the things that is critical to a better future is, of course, to deal with climate change. I know those opposite are still whirling around in their division on this issue, despite losing so many seats.

             Well, you lost seats to the teals because the centre of mainstream Australia want action on climate change. We have already updated, formally updated, Australia's nationally determined contribution under the Paris Agreement, a 43 per cent reduction in emissions, and we are introducing legislation to make it law. I would say this to the opposition: it's not just the right thing to do for our climate; it's an economic opportunity, and Australians understand that.

                The Albanese Labor government wants to make sure Australians get the opportunities they deserve. We want to bring people together. We want to unite Australia. We've announced the Jobs and Skills Summit and today we are introducing a bill to create Jobs and Skills Australia, because we want to make sure Australians can get the skills employers want.
               </p>
               <p>
                Good governments can also make sure that the most vulnerable Australians are not left behind. COVID took a devastating toll on Australians in aged care and their families, and those opposite should hang their heads in shame about how this was dealt with. We know that aged care was in crisis well before the pandemic struck. I'm not surprised that the interjections have stopped, because it was a decade of neglect under those opposite. We are beginning the work of fixing aged care.
