         I thank Senator Moore for her question and for her interest as a Queensland senator in the impact of climate change. The Queensland government has released a report called
         <i>
          Climate change in Queensland: what the science is telling us
         </i>
         .

          It is interesting that we have interjections from the other side, because this is a report that deals with the impact of climate change in Queensland and I would hope that all Queensland senators, not just those on our side of the chamber, might take an interest in what scientists are telling us is its likely impact.
         </p>
         <p>
          The report is another serious warning about the impact of climate change. It tells us that Queensland will suffer less rainfall, more severe droughts, more sea level rises, more intense tropical cyclones and an increased risk of storm surges. The report highlights that over the next 20 years the number of days above 35 degrees will rise dramatically. So Senator Joyce’s constituents might be interested to learn that in St George there will be 19 extra days each year above 35 degrees. Senator Brandis’ constituents might like to know, even if he does not, that heat related deaths in Brisbane are estimated to be between 800 and 1,400 in 2050, compared with just 134 10 years ago. Senator Macdonald might like to be aware of the fact that the report suggests that Queensland is projected to have the greatest decline in gross state product because of drops in agricultural productivity and exports; that sugar output is expected to drop 12 per cent and beef output 20 per cent over the next 20 years; and that there is likely to be an impact on the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef" rel="nofollow">
           Great Barrier Reef
          </a>
          and the great tourism industry that has been built around it, which, as you know, generates nearly $5 billion a year and employs tens of thousands of people. These will be some of the impacts of climate change on Queensland unless we take action now.
         </p>
         <p>
          Those opposite neglected to prepare for climate change when they were in government, just as they neglected to invest in skills and infrastructure to deal with capacity constraints in the Australian economy, just as they failed and squibbed it on the great economic challenges when it came to the capacity constraints in the economy—so too did they squib it on climate change. They failed to do what was needed when they were in government. Now that they are in opposition they are content with playing short-term politics. What this report highlights, yet again, is how we need to change the way the economy works. We have to move from a high-emission economy to the low-emission economy of the future, and, of course, the economically responsible way to do this is through an emissions-trading scheme.
         </p>
         <p>
          I have outlined on previous occasions the decision-making process the government will go through on this front. There was previously bipartisan support on the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETS" rel="nofollow">
           ETS
          </a>
          but it is quite clear that the opposition now no longer know whether they are coming or going when it comes to the issue of climate change and when it comes to the issue of the emissions-trading scheme. We have seen on the front page of the
          <i>
           Australian
          </i>
          today a range of different positions from opposition frontbenchers and from Mr Nelson. Simply, they do not know what their position is. In government they were prepared to have an ETS; they were prepared to argue for maximum coverage. Now they do not know whether they agree with it, what should be in it or when it should be introduced. They do not even know—and of course Senator Minchin is amongst them—if they believe that climate change is real. You have no credibility. Those opposite have no credibility on the issue of climate change.
