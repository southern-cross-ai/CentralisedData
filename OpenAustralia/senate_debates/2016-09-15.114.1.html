        My question is to the Minister for Indigenous Affairs, Senator Scullion. I refer to the minister's answer in question time on 1 September 2016. When asked about his failure to act on earlier reports of abuse at the Don Dale Youth Detention Centre, the minister claimed there was a 'huge gap' between what was contained in earlier reports and what was shown on

        . Does the minister stand by this statement?

         Indeed. I was referring also to media reports at the time, and I think is pretty self-evident that there was a vast difference between what was in the media reports that everybody had access to and what we saw on

         on the night of the airing. I think the principal difference was that, for the first time in any reports in the media up to that point, there was no

           I refer to the Children's Commissioner's report, which was made public, published in September 2015, that cited precisely the same footage shown on the

           report—precisely the same footage—in which a youth justice officer says, and I quote partially: 'No, let the'—expletive—'come through because when he comes through he will be off balance, I'll pulverise, I'll pulverise the little'—expletive. Does the minister still stand by his statement that there is a 'huge gap'?

            Indeed, I think there is a significant gap, as every Australian will agree, between seeing the footage, and having the footage cited and one part of the footage quoted in a report.

               I do not accept I misled the Senate, and I will say again: there is a vast difference between citing a report in writing and making a selective quote out of that, and the vision that we all saw. The vision was deeply disturbing, and to say that there is an equality between a cited paragraph within that report and seeing the
