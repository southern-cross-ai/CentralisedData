        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Senator Watt. The Albanese government's proposed changes to workplace relations laws will deliver much-needed job security and wage increases after a decade of neglect by the Liberals and Nationals. How will the 'Secure Jobs, Better Pay' bill support small businesses to bargain with their workers, and what does this mean for workers?

         , who is, again, one of the people on our side of the chamber who has a long history of standing up for the rights of workers, and also of forming very co-operative relationships with business in her career in the union movement. Senator White is a great example of what our government is trying to do, which is build partnerships between unions, workers and business for the benefit of the economy, for the benefit of those businesses and also for those workers.

         I understand it's a foreign concept for those opposite, who just thrive on conflict and want to keep us in that conflict driven environment that we've been in for 10 years, but some of us actually want to move on. And, do you know what? So does small business. Let me just give one example of the small businesses out there that are actually looking forward to the kind of multi-employer bargaining that we are proposing to have. Nowâ€”

              On the one hand, the opposition demands examples of small businesses that support the system we're trying to bring in. But the minute we try to do it they don't want to hear about it. That's because the opposition are intent on keeping our country in a conflict driven model that does not work for anyone.

                 Thank you, President. Ms Price, who represents hundreds of community owned childcare centres, made the point that the agreement they had struck across a range of enterprises covers just under 60 services in Victoria. It delivers better wages, 16 per cent above the award, and she goes on to say that the centres are community owned, managed by boards and volunteers, and they don't have the financial resources and the expertise in

                 to be able to negotiate an agreement themselves.

                        There are persistent points of order which actually go to the content of substantive debate. We're happy to have substantive debate, but this is time for question time. This is not the way in which points of order have traditionally been used nor should be used. If the senator wants a debate, we can have a debate.

                          Thank you, President. Isn't it terrible to see the coalition not want to hear from employer groups? You really would have thought that, of all the parties, they would support employer groups. But they don't support the ones that support multi-employer bargaining. The ones that oppose it are fine, but the ones that support it are terrible. Mr Scavera saidâ€”

                            It's about not having a race to the bottom, to put it bluntly. At the moment the major construction projects don't have any regulation in relation to pay. So you have a mixture of people on a site that will be either enterprise agreement covered, award covered or covered by whatever other means people are creating. We're hoping that through this mechanism we can have an industry agreement through multi-enterprises. That's what we're aiming for: to regulate the market a bit more.

Senator Pocock and Senator Lambie, we all know that you have important decisions to make about this legislation in the coming days, and I encourage you to think about the arguments that we are putting forward and that small businesses are putting forward. Or you can decide to line up with that rabble over there, who want to continue to keep Australia in conflict, with low wages and low productivity.
