         In April

        this year I visited the Ulverstone
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCYC" rel="nofollow">
         PCYC
        </a>
        . The club was started in 2019 and it has over 30 members. The ages of these young people are from 12 years old and upwards. The club is there to support these people. If they can't afford the costs of joining the club or participating in an event, then the club helps them to pay for it or pays the costs for them.
       </p>
       <p>
        I met Corey there, who has

        â€”autism spectrum disorder. He has been attending the club for over a year. He does not speak to people very often, and he often does not look people in the eye, but he told me, as he looked me in the eye, that his confidence has grown and that this has helped his schoolwork and helps him to manage his anger. His mum drives him from Devonport every Tuesday and Thursday night to attend.
       </p>
       <p>
        The message that I took from my visit was that the club is all about the community, helping young people and providing a safe haven for those who are going through a difficult time. Ross Coppleman and Craig Aitken have been instrumental in getting the club to become the success that it now is. Troy Dean is the senior constable who supports the PCYC. Craig and I worked together many years ago at the Simplot factory as process workers. He then went on to teaching, and for many years worked with vulnerable young people. A big shout out to him for his support to our Braddon youth. Craig and his family have now moved to Queensland. Our loss is certainly their gain, but the PCYC is still going strong and is a fantastic club in my home town providing support to young people and their parents when they need it. They are serious about discipline and operating as a team, and the young people respect that by their actions when they attend the club.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to congratulate all those involved, and I hope that the club continues to go from strength to strength, which I'm sure it will under the guidance and leadership of Ross.
