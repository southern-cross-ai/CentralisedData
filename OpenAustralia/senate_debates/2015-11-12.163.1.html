         Review of Administration and Expenditure: No. 11 and No. 12—Australian Intelligence Agencies
        </i>
        ' was completed by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security (the Committee), the Government has successfully introduced the
        <i>
         National Security Legislation Amendment Act (No. 1) 2014
        </i>
        and the
        <i>
         Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Act 2015
        </i>
        . Further, the Government has committed to introducing a Telecommunications Sector Security Reform scheme prior to the conclusion of the data retention implementation period. These reforms properly equip the Australian Intelligence Community to fulfil their mandate in a contemporary, evolving security environment and ensure the Australian telecommunications sector is properly protected.

         The Government

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I also note that in addition to these specific legislative measures equipping the Australian Intelligence Community to meet the challenges posed by current and emerging technologies, the Government also introduced the Co

        and the
        <i>
         Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (No 1) 2014

        . These tranches of legislation enable the Australian Intelligence Community and broader national security agencies, in particular the

        In the 2015-16 Budget the Government announced it will provide an additional $7.6 million over four years from 2015-16 to the

        ) and an additional $0.7 million over four years to the Office of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security (OIGIS) by exempting the agencies from the Efficiency Dividend. This national security measure underlines the Government's commitment to a safe and secure Australia and its commitment to accountability and oversight of its national security agencies.
