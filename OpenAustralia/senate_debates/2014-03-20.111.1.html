        My question is to the Acting Assistant Treasurer, Senator Cormann. I refer to the government's proposed changes to the financial advice legislation which removes the ban on sales commissions and other conflicted remunerations. Is the minister aware that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kohler" rel="nofollow">
         Alan Kohler
        </a>
        has described this ban as:

       <p class="italic">
        … the outlawing of a corrupt practice that has cost consumers billions of dollars and lowered trust in the entire financial advice industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        Minister, why is the government bringing back a corrupt practice that hurts everyday Australians?

          I thank Senator Bishop for that question. With all due respect to Mr Kohler, he is wrong. That is not what we are doing. We are restoring some balance in the regulatory framework for financial services. The previous, Labor government was guided by one thing and one thing only—and that was how best to promote the vested interests of union dominated industry funds. The one thing that the Labor Party was focused on was how to leverage its position as the government of Australia using legislation to impose one business model across the whole of the financial services market—the union dominated industry fund model.
         </p>
         <p>
          We are committed to ensuring the financial services sector is as efficient, transparent and competitive as possible—

               I know that the Labor Party do not want to listen to any of this, but it is a very important context for the question that was asked. The premise of the question is wrong. We are not reintroducing conflicted remunerations for personal advice. We are ensuring that there is an appropriate level playing field and a competitively neutral financial services regulatory framework when it comes to the provision of general advice. Guess what? The Labor Party gave a special deal to their friends in union dominated industry funds. They said, 'You can provide fund advice. You can charge a fee which is not disclosed or transparent to every member of that fund, irrespective of whether they access advice or not. You can keep going.' But they did not want anybody else to be able to—

                   The interest that this government is putting first is the public interest. The interest that this government is putting first is the consumer's interest. You know what? Consumers have an interest in having affordable access to high-quality financial advice. It is very important that we get the balance right for the appropriate levels of consumer protection by making sure that access to high-quality financial advice remains available and remains affordable.

                   We understand that there is a particular commercial interest that is close to the heart of people on the Labor side, because every single one of those senators is a member of a union. Maybe some of them have been trustees on industry super funds in the past. Maybe some of them are lobbied from time to time by union-dominated industry fund trustees, because they do have a particular interest in a regulatory framework that makes it harder for others to compete.
