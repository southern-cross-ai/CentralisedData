        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, Senator Cormann. Several members of parliament have repeatedly expressed concerns around Australia's liquid fuel security, given we now import more than 90 per cent of our transport fuels—up from 60 per cent in 2000—and, according to Department of the Environment and Energy data, we had a mere 21 days of petrol stock, 16 days of diesel and 19 days of aviation fuel as of December 2017. In a submission to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committee" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        on Electric Vehicles, which I'm chairing, the former deputy chief of the

        could play a significant role in improving Australia's energy security by reducing the demand for foreign sourced liquid fuels and by providing a significant increase in transport system resilience in the event of a fuel supply disruption.
       </p>
       <p>
        Has the government given any consideration to the role electric vehicles could play in improving our fuel security?

         I thank Senator Storer for his question. The government takes the issue of fuel security very seriously. A number of coalition members and senators have also raised the importance of national fuel security with the government. That's why, to help deliver affordable and reliable energy, the government is undertaking a review of Australia's liquid fuel security by the end of 2018. The comprehensive review will look at how fuel is supplied and used in Australia, including our resilience to withstand disruptions both overseas and in Australia. The review will identify whether the government should take further steps to ensure Australia's domestic fuel supply is reliable and inform our plan to return to compliance with the International Energy Agency's emergency stockholding obligations by 2026. I remind the Senate that Australia's domestic supplies of liquid fuels have not been impacted by a significant supply disruption for the past 40 years. The review has strong industry support. Making sure we aren't complacent is the prudent and proper thing to do. That should not be construed, though, as Australia having an actual fuel security problem. The government has emergency powers and an agreement with states and territories which sets out the arrangements to effectively manage a national liquid fuel emergency.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Storer raised the potential contribution of electric vehicles to reducing Australia's reliance on liquid fuel. In that regard, I note that Senator Storer is actually chairing the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committee" rel="nofollow">
          Select Committee

            The Australian government is providing support to the rollout of electric vehicles around Australia, including financial support through the Australian Renewable Energy Agency and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation.

            's focus has been on supporting emerging technologies and helping to move them closer to commercial reality. Progressing new and innovative energy technologies from early-stage research and development through to commercial deployment is critical to ensure that Australia remains at the forefront of technological progress and enjoys the benefits that advances in technology can bring.
           </p>

            The Clean Energy Finance Corporation has acted as a catalyst to increase investment in clean energy investment. In the five years that the CEFC has been operating, around $5 billion of capital has been deployed, and the CEFC has directly invested in more than 110 individual transactions and delivered finance for over 5,500 smaller-scale clean energy products.

               As I've indicated in response to the primary question, the government has commissioned a review of liquid fuel security, and I do not want to pre-empt the conclusions and the findings and possible recommendations of the review. But I'm sure that the respective trade-offs between various energy security options will be canvassed as part of the review and form part of the recommendations that are put to the government in due course.
