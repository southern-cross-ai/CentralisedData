        The Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee has extensive knowledge, background and history on the military justice debate; former Defence Minister Hill tasked the Committee with regular six-monthly reviews on the implementation of the Government's response to the Committee's 2005 review into the Military Justice system. Given that experience, and the fact that the new model is so different from that it replaces, it would be prudent to have the Bills considered by that Committee.
