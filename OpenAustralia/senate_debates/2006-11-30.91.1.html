       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Not supported. The bill (now Act) indicates that an order is made and call out of the ADF activated only when a domestic security incident occurs or is likely to occur that exceeds or is likely to exceed the capacity of the civil authorities to deal with the incident.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        is satisfied that this provision (which is consistent with the 2000 legislation) provides the necessary safeguards for the call out of the ADF.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The central principle underpinning Part IIIAAA is the provision of aid to the civil authorities. The authorising Minister(s) therefore need only be satisfied that the capacity of the civil authorities is overwhelmed, or will likely be overwhelmed, by a domestic security incident before authorising call out. However the inclusion of a statement of intent that the Part should apply only when all other avenues have been considered and rejected introduces additional layers of complexity that an authorising Minister(s) would be required to consider before call out. In particular, as all other avenues could apply to authorities, capabilities or agencies outside the scope of the civil authorities of a State or Territory, the inclusion of such a provision would go beyond the current purpose and construction of Part IIIAAA. This could potentially delay the making of an order and therefore inhibit the requirement for a flexible and effective ADF response to a domestic security incident.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         RECOMMENDATION 2
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee recommends that a stronger proportionality test be included in Schedules 1 and 3.
       </p>

        <b>
         Government Response:
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Not supported. The concept of proportionality is already evident in the current legislation under Section 51T. Specifically, the use of ‘reasonable and necessary force’ is in essence a proportional response to an incident, where an ADF member is authorised to take appropriate action in relation to an incident. That is, an ADF member operating under Part IIIAAA is not automatically authorised to apply the most extreme form of force, but must apply a test of whether that force is both reasonable and necessary (and therefore clearly proportional) in responding to an incident.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Furthermore, this proportionality is subsequently captured in Defence processes, including
