         I thank the senator for her question and for her contribution over a long period of time to the

         . I was asked last week by my Prime Minister to travel to Baghdad. There I met with Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and other senior government officials. During these very collaborative meetings I had the opportunity to discuss the current challenges faced by the Iraqi government in Baghdad in dealing with ISIL, or Da'ish as the Gulf countries call them. Iraq is a country that we need to be helping right now. I met with the newly formed government, which is a cohesive, inclusive one that is also intent on stabilising and regaining control of their nation. Australia, as many of us know, is standing ready with more than 40 other nations to help the Iraqi government disrupt and degrade the ISIL death cult. There are now an estimated 1.8 million internally displaced people in Iraq, with an estimated 600,000 having been displaced in August following an upsurge of violence in various parts of the country.
        </p>
        <p>
         During my talks with the Iraqi Prime Minister I reaffirmed to him Australia's commitment to the international effort to disrupt and degrade ISIL and to help the Iraqi security forces to take the fight to these terrorists. I also reaffirmed this commitment in meetings with

         officials who were in Iraq. It is of course in Australia's very best interests that we stand ready with the world to help the Iraqi government and to protect the people of Iraq.

           Thank you, Senator, for the question. Following my visit to Baghdad, I had the opportunity to meet with

            Middle East
           </a>
           . I had the honour of speaking with many of our outstanding men and women and reiterated to them that their role was to assist and advise the Iraqi forces as part of an international coalition in regaining the security of Iraq. I also reminded our personnel that Australia has foreign fighters on the ground in Iraq fighting alongside and within ISIL. This is not just a threat to Iraq but also a direct security concern to Australia. On behalf of the Australian people, I thanked them for their enduring professionalism and readiness and reminded them all that they have the full support of both the government and the opposition. I thank the opposition for their support in the motion before the chamber earlier today. While in the

             What we are fighting is not just a terrorist organization, but the embodiment of a malicious ideology that must be defeated intellectually.

             The world must unite behind a holistic drive to discredit the ideology that gives extremists their power, and to restore hope and dignity to those whom they would recruit.
