           The Australian government acknowledges the impact of the drought and bushfires that are continuing to have an effect across regional communities. The government is getting on with the job of building new water infrastructure to meet the needs of regional Australia, and we've established the National Water Grid Authority to oversee a national approach. We reject the assertions made in section 3 of this motion as the government has committed up to $3½ billion through the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund and National Water Infrastructure Loan Facility to build dams, weirs and pipelines. To date the government is committed to the delivery of 21 projects, including the Dungowan and Wyangala dams in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
            New South Wales

           , and the government is actively working with state and territory governments to identify priorities for Commonwealth consideration. The Eurobodalla project is currently being considered under round 3 of the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund, with outcomes expected shortly.
