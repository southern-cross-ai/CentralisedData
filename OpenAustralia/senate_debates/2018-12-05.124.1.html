           That's taken hard work, Senator Macdonald, as you know. Our government's 2013 promise to put in place the policies to deliver one million jobs to Australians within five years was actually reached earlier than planned. Our unemployment rate is now at five per cent. It has fallen to five per cent. And, if you look at the percentage of working-age Australians on welfare, it has fallen to 15 per cent. This is the lowest rate of welfare dependency in over nearly a quarter of a century. But, on top of putting in place the right economic conditions to create jobs, what we are also doing—in response to Senator Stoker's question—is ensuring that we have in place programs that will support older Australians in need of a hand to stay in the workforce, or for those who are looking for new opportunities.
          </p>
          <p>
           We are looking at putting in place a skills checkpoint. We want to make sure that older Australians have access to the skills they need not only for the jobs of today but also for the jobs of tomorrow. And we are increasing support for older Australians to upskill or transition into new careers through our new Skills Checkpoint for Older Workers Program. Senators may be interested to know that the definition of a mature aged person is actually 45, so I think the majority of us in this place would actually be interested occasionally in looking at the Skills Checkpoint for Older Workers Program. We are actually providing eligible Australians—

             I understand that the government has also put in place the Skills and Training Incentive for older workers. Minister, how does this work? How is it able to be accessed? And why are initiatives like this so important for creating a strong economy, more jobs and greater opportunity?

              Again, older Australians are the most experienced people we have in our workforce and, as we know—considering it is all of us—they contribute greatly to the economy. But what we are also doing, in addition to the skills checkpoint is, from 1 January 2019, we have the Skills and Training Incentive. If you qualify, you will go through the skills checkpoint and you will work with your program manager to identify a skill that you may require or you identify a training opportunity linked to your current job, a future job opportunity or an industry occupation or skill in demand, and you will be able to put forward and access up to $2,200 from the government to fund reskilling or upskilling opportunities, and this funding will be co-matched by either you, if you want to, or, alternatively, your employer. This is all about ensuring that older mature aged Australians have the skills the economy requires.

                 As I was saying, eligible individuals are those between the ages of 45 and 70 who are currently employed or who have fallen into that category of being at risk of entering the income support system or recently unemployed but haven't yet registered for assistance through the Australian government employment services programs. Participants will undertake individually tailored assessments of their skill levels. Skills checkpoint providers will then work with them to develop a career plan to assist participants to identify gaps in their skills, if they are wishing to transition into a new career or undertake a new role in their current occupation, or skills that they could develop or enhance to increase their capacity to perform in their current role. This is all about ensuring that the policies are in place to create the jobs and about ensuring we have the programs in place to support Australians so they have the skills they need for the jobs of today and of tomorrow.

                     Yes, a point of order on relevance. This is a serious issue. I've simply asked if the minister has met with these volunteer organisations to address their concerns, and, if she has, what she has done.

                         The changes announced by the government in June 2017 require trainers and assessors to meet the new credential requirements by 1 April 2019. Volunteer groups have advised that this will place an unnecessary burden on their volunteer assessors to keep the training system afloat and could have an impact on public safety. Will the minister commit to removing unnecessary bureaucratic and onerous training requirements on emergency service volunteers?
