        I take this opportunity at the end of the 2008 sittings to thank all senators for their cooperation and assistance this year. My thanks, also, to my colleagues the temporary chairmen of committees for their contribution to the work of this chamber. I would particularly like to thank the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_President" rel="nofollow">
         Deputy President
        </a>
        and Chairman of Committees, Senator Alan Ferguson. Senator Ferguson was President for much of this year, and I know he would join me in thanking the many staff who support the operations in this place.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are many people in the Department of the Senate whose hard work deserves our thanks, including the Clerk of the Senate,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Evans" rel="nofollow">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Rod" rel="nofollow">
         Black Rod
        </a>
        , the Deputy Black Rod and the senators’ services staff; the chamber support staff and, in particular, the attendants and the mail attendants; staff of the Committee Office, the Table Office, the Procedure Office; and all other Department of the Senate staff, including Senate
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT" rel="nofollow">
         IT
        </a>
        , printing and transport.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to thank staff of the Department of Parliamentary Services, led by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Thompson" rel="nofollow">
         Alan Thompson
        </a>
        , including the staff of Landscape Services, Art Services, Facilities management, the guides service, and IT, Broadcasting and Hansard staff. My thanks also go to the Parliamentary Library, under the direction of Roxanne Missingham; to the Parliamentary Relations Office and Parliamentary Education Office; to those who work in security and for Protective Services at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        , in particular Superintendant Mark Andrews of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
         AFP
        </a>
        , who has been Protective Security Controller at Parliament House and who will be retiring after five years of service in that position; to the Health and Recreation Centre staff; to the Speaker and his staff; and, of course, to the staff of my own office, including those in Queensland.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of all senators, many thanks to all the other people who work in Parliament House and in electorate offices right around Australia. I wish you all a happy and peaceful Christmas period, and look forward to seeing you all at the next sitting, in 2009.

But also I want to say thank you to the many others—the Clerk and the deputy clerks and all of those people who make this place tick over. It has been an interesting year, I think you could say, for us all. It has had its challenges. My thanks to all, and I wish you a happy Christmas and a safe

This year has, I think, demonstrated that for all to see. In conclusion, I say to the opposition and the Greens, to Senator Fielding and Senator Xenophon, and, of course, to the government: happy Christmas and a safe New Year.

          , can I begin by thanking you very much for your wise stewardship of this chamber in the period in which you have presided over us. You have done it, I think, with great wisdom, calmness and patience for the period in which you have been there, despite some duress. Also, on behalf of the coalition, I particularly want to thank the former President and now
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_President" rel="nofollow">
           Deputy President
          </a>
          , Senator Alan Ferguson, for his great service to this chamber throughout 2008, a service which we all honour and respect. I also want to add my thanks along with yours and the government’s to our Clerk,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Evans" rel="nofollow">
           Harry Evans
          </a>
          , and all Senate officials, particularly Andrea, who is of course leaving us this year. Again, it has been a remarkable display of professionalism and loyalty to all that is best about this chamber from our Senate officials. And, of course, to all
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
           Parliament House
          </a>
          staff: we thank them.
         </p>
         <p>
          It has been my observation in my time here that the Senate displays a level of decorum and civility unfamiliar to the House of Representatives. While we might not always be perfect in our behaviour, I think the behaviour in this chamber is far superior to that of our colleagues in the other place. I think that has been on display in 2008 and I look forward to that continuing in 2009. As part now of the non-government side of the chamber, I thank the other non-government senators for their cooperation on a range of issues that have come before the chamber throughout the course of this year. In conclusion, I just want to wish every senator a very happy Christmas.

                by leave—I do not wish to upstage Senator Ludwig, who I am sure did a terrific job in my absence. I am sorry I was out of the chamber when this started. Thanks to all who contributed to the working of the Senate. I wish everyone a peaceful Christmas break. I think everyone deserves a decent break. As I say, I wish everyone all the best for the festive season and we will see you all back here far too soon, the first week of February.
