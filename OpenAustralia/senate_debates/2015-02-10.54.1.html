         n representatives on the coalition side—are absolutely committed to getting the very best defence capability for the best value from the Australian taxpayer. The discussion between the Prime Minister and Senator Edwards I was not privy to. If there are matters that the Prime Minister would seek to add to my answer, I will advise him of the fact that this question has been raised. But, put very simply, as I understand it, there is an agreement or a consensus between them as to what needs to be achieved for Australia.

           The government's policy is clear that there will be a competitive evaluation process for the submarine replacement that will take into account capability requirements, cost, schedule, technical risk and value-for-money considerations. Any Australian company that can credibly meet these criteria will of course be considered on merit. I would say to Senator Conroy that given his track record in relation to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
            NBN

           and other matters, he would not understand what a rigorous, proper process is for a very important procurement project such as submarines.

               The simple fact that Senator Conroy had to withdraw part of his prepared question is indicative of the hyperventilation that the honourable senator is engaging in in relation to this issue. The fact that the deputy leader would be the defence minister of this nation, he who trashes the reputation of honourable men and uniform at Senate estimates, who pretends to come into this place has some concern about defence procurement when his own record on the

It has nothing to do with Senate estimates and nothing to do with the opposition. It has everything to do with whether the Prime Minister misled Senator Edwards.

                   , I ask a further supplementary question. Can the minister confirm that not even the most senior officers in Defence know what is meant by a 'competitive evaluation process' and can the minister point to anywhere in the Defence Procurement Policy Manual where the term is used? Given the chaos, dysfunction and confusion which has surrounded this morning's submarines announcement, can the minister inform the Senate on what day good government will actually start?

                    When we as a government talk to the Australian people we do not need a 'policy manual' to tell us what words we are or are not allowed to use in discussing matters.
