        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. After nine long years of cuts and neglect, how is the Albanese Labor government investing in Medicare and, importantly, making it easier to see a doctor?

         Thank you, Senator Polley. Thank you for your support for Medicare and for your continued advocacy for public health and public health measures, alongside all of your Tasmanian and Labor colleagues. What we know is: Labor built Medicare. We will always protect it and we will always strengthen it.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are some differences between those on this side of the chamber and those on that side. We can go through them. Top of the list is Medicare. We are the party of Medicare, and we know that you have opposed it and sought to break it over many years, including under Mr Duttonâ€”I'll come back to you. In this budget, this Albanese Labor government is making historic investments in Medicare. We believe Australians should be able to access affordable, reliable health care. That is why we are investing $5.7 billion to build a stronger Medicare.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our priority is to invest in Medicare and make it stronger. Their priority was to cut Medicare. Those opposite left measures in the budget on a time line to be cut, and they failed to address the needs of Australians, particularly our most vulnerable. This government is investing to ensure the tripling of the bulk billing incentive. This is the largest increase to the incentive in the 40-year history of Medicare, and it will benefit Australians. It will benefit pensioners. It will benefit Commonwealth concession card holders. It will benefit Australian families. We've wasted no time making medicines cheaper, establishing Medicare urgent care clinics and investing in practices to employ more nurses and allied health professionals. We've committed $219.4 million to extend public dental services because we understand Medicare must always be protected.

           What a stark contrast. Following a sharp decline in bulk billing under the Liberals and Nationals, can the minister please outline to the Senate what the government is doing to boost bulk billing?

            Thank you for the question. Of course, we understand how important bulk billing is. What we also know, and what Australians know, is that for over a decade those opposite made decisions that eroded Australia's world-class healthcare system, and they weren't upfront with the Australian people on the bulk billing rate, which has been in decline. Let's remember that they're led by a man who doctors voted the worst health minister in decades. The principle that all Australians should have access to affordable care underpins Medicare. That is why, as I said, the centrepiece of our Strengthening Medicare package is a $3.5 billion investment to triple bulk billing incentives for

             GP
            </a>
            visits. This means five million children and their families, and seven million pensioners and concession card holders, will be able to see a GP without an out-of-pocket expense.

               tax. Let's remember that the man who will front the parliament tonight saying he's going to talk about families was the health minister who sought to impose a tax on Australians going to GPs. The GP co-payment which Mr Dutton sought to impose is something every Australian should remember when he stands up tonight and claims he speaks for Australian families. That is why we know it is only those on this sideâ€”
