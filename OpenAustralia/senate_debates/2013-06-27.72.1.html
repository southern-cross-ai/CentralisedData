        These are most comprehensive changes to the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004, and I just want to put it on the public record that it is an utter disgrace that this chamber has been given four minutes to discuss these, including amendments by my colleague Senator Xenophon. The coalition does support the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Military Compensation Review and Other Measures) Bill 2013. The coalition will not be supporting Senator Xenophon's amendments, but I want to make one thing very clear: we support the principle of Senator Xenophon's amendments. Our only concern is in relation to the implementation of them and a legislated change to processing times.
       </p>
       <p>
        As Senator Xenophon knows, in Senate estimates this matter was pursued. The new secretary of the department has undertaken to investigate the issues surrounding these processing times. At 155 days on average, they are 30 per cent longer than the PBS
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPI" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        s, at 120 days. I say to you, Senator Xenophon: if there is a change of government then the coalition will work with you in relation to this issue. Our concerns are that a legislated change at this time may have an impact in relation to potentially unintended consequences or to deliverability. We would work with you in government to address an issue that you and I both share.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to enable you to have some time to speak on this. This government is in complete and utter disarray. With four minutes, this is a slap in the face for veterans and for due process. The government stands utterly condemned. Quite frankly, changing leaders does not change a bad government, and veterans will be appalled at the treatment they have received today. I want to give Senator Xenophon at least a minute and a half to speak on his amendments.

         It will be less than a minute. I am grateful for the indication of support for the principle of changes to require the department to adhere to time limits in dealing with military compensation claims. This has been triggered by the awful way that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veronica_Wadley" rel="nofollow">
          Veronica Wadley
         </a>
         was treated. I will not be able to speak to these matters. I did speak with Minister Snowdon earlier today and he did indicate that he will be tabling some undertakings in respect of this, but I am very grateful to Senator Ronaldson for the matters that he has raised. This is a farce. I am not going to be able to deal with these matters. It will not do justice to Veronica Wadley and what she went through, and this must never, ever happen again in this chamber. This really is a disgrace when we are dealing with such important legislation.
