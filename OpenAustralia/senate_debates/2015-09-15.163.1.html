        I rise tonight to mourn the passing of a great Territory man, radio presenter
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Davies" rel="nofollow">
         Pete Davies
        </a>
        , who passed away recently after a long battle with cancer. Pete has gone from us in body but he is still with us in spirit. We are still coming to terms with not having his distinct voice and passion on our airwaves every day. He is sorely missed in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_End" rel="nofollow">
         Top End
        </a>
        of our country and further afield. My deepest condolences go to Pete's family: his wife, Vicki; their two sons, Shannon and Brodie; and Shannon's wife, Courtney, and their children.
       </p>
       <p>
        Pete was in our homes, our cars and trucks, our boats and our workplaces in the mornings and throughout the week over months and years as a radio presenter on Mix 104.9 and in particular, in more recent years, at the helm of his current affairs program,
        <i>
         360
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Pete was a champion of social justice. He was passionate about working to assist people who suffered from depression, also called 'the black dog', which he also battled through the years. His work with beyondblue and advocacy work around mental health was heartfelt, consistent and important. I have no doubt he saved lives through his advocacy and his companionship, whether it was over the airwaves, at the pub or out fishing. Pete's wife, Vicki, asked me to include this verse on her behalf tonight:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        While on this ride called 'life', you have to take the good with the bad, smile when you're sad, love what you've got and remember what you had. Always forgive, but not forget. Learn from your mistakes, but never regret. People change. Things go wrong. Just remember, the ride goes on.
       </p>
       <p>
        Pete's tag line was 'Pete Davies and 360—he may not agree with you but he will always let you have your say', and he did, regardless of whether it was on the radio or in the street. It was a tag line for his democratic resolve for his Territory listeners, and he was very much loved for his ability to ask the questions that he knew his listeners wanted answered.
       </p>
       <p>
        Pete was a champion of the building of the Palmerston hospital right from the start, both as a radio presenter and as an alderman on the Palmerston City Council. Probably more than any other Territorian, he kept the hospital on the agenda and kept us Territory politicians accountable. It would be a fitting tribute—and I really like this suggestion from Territory Labor leader
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Gunner" rel="nofollow">
         Michael Gunner
        </a>
        —that we name the Palmerston hospital, when it is eventually built, in memory of Pete: the Pete Davies Memorial Hospital.
       </p>
       <p>
        Pete very much enjoyed giving daily updates on the weather and sea conditions on our 'great northern pond', our beautiful Darwin Harbour. He loved fishing. My friend and former federal member for Solomon Damian Hale was a great mate of Pete's and had this to say about him:

        Pete Davies was a true Territorian up front and honest. Regardless of whether you agreed with Pete or not, you couldn't help but admire his passion and love for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">

        and willingness to represent the best interests of those who didn't have a voice.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        He took them all to task,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Ministers" rel="nofollow">
         Prime Ministers
        </a>
        and Ministers, Departmental Heads or leaders from the Private sector, he treated them with fairness and let them have their say.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Pete had a sharp intellect and a quick wit on air however away from the cut and thrust of morning radio he was a gentleman and a true friend to many people.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I worked with him when I was a

        , to put issues effecting the Territory front and centre in the minds of his listeners, we enjoyed a beer together and a good laugh.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I miss Pete Davies, a great friend and Territorian who loved his wife Vicky, his boys and the Territory lifestyle. Rest in Peace Pete Davies.
       </p>
       <p>
        There will be a public memorial service for Pete at the

        turf club at 1 pm this Friday. As I am committed to a Senate committee hearing on Friday, I will not be able to attend and I send my sincere apologies to Vicki and the rest of Pete's family. I know it will be very well attended because Pete was well loved by everyone. I will always remember Pete by his own words. 'If you don't make any noise, then you don't get heard,' he used to say. Pete, you were heard, mate, and you gave Territorians a chance to be heard as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        Pete gave so much to Territorians, and there have been many moving and heartfelt tributes. So I want to finish by giving Territorians a voice in this place this evening, in the same way that Pete gave them a voice on our airwaves every single day: good on you, Pete; we miss you, mate. May you rest in peace.
