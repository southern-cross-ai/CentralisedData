On 22 November 2011, I sent the President a 138-page submission on the actions of Senator Brown and the Greens to assist Mr Wood's purchase of the Triabunna woodchip mill. On 23 November, the President gave precedence to a motion, passed by the Senate on 24 November, for this matter to be inquired into by the committee. Lawyers in their submission on behalf of Senators Brown and Milne claimed that I conflated Senator Brown's negotiation of the $1.6 million donation from Graeme Wood, which occurred in May 2010, with Mr Wood's efforts to buy the Triabunna woodchip mill—

          , what Senator Kroger might be going to say—and we are not clear about that yet because we have not heard—is clearly quite different from what Senator Hanson-Young has said. I appreciate Senator Hanson-Young and the Greens coterie down there—who, we note, are obviously planning a leadership coup, and good luck to you—but I do not think that there is anything in the point of order and, indeed, Senator Kroger is quite within her rights to talk about the general issue of the subject of her speech.

            Just as a matter of clarification, I am making some observations on the report that was brought down by the Privileges Committee. Mr Wood's efforts to buy the Triabunna woodchip mill in mid-2011 is something, it was claimed, which could not possibly have been foreseeable at the time of his donation. This is absolutely false. My submission clearly stated that the $1.6 million was negotiated in May 2010 and that this funded the Greens ad campaign at the 2010 election. I did not submit that this negotiation was some incredibly prescient bribe but rather an arrangement which led Senator Brown to advance Mr Wood's commercial interest when the Triabunna purchase arose. In terms of Privilege Resolution 63, it was an arrangement which had the effect of controlling Senator Brown's independence. In short, it was a significant, personally negotiated donation, indeed, the biggest ever in Australia's history and by his own words, Senator Brown said—

               Senator Brown's own words were that he would be 'forever grateful'. I know that Senator Rhiannon agrees with this. Mr Wood said he had made a good investment, and they are his words. My contention was that this arrangement dictated Senator Brown's subsequent actions and by virtue of his position—

                     As I was saying, it was by virtue of his position of influence as Leader of the Greens and that of other Greens, principally Senator Milne. My submission did not suggest that Senator Milne acted corruptly, though certainly this implication was drawn in relation to Senator Brown's behaviour. The committee's report noted that each paragraph of the terms of reference required it to consider whether an improper arrangement was sought or put in place. I reiterate, I did not assert that Mr Wood improperly offered his $1.6 million donation. Nor did I assert that Senator Brown improperly sought it.

                     The committee report also observes that, while I offered evidence that conduct occurred that aligned with Mr Wood's interests, I did not provide evidence of a causal connection. But I did demonstrate that Senator Brown acted at every turn to advantage Mr Wood's bid and damage his competitor's. Senators Brown and Milne explained this behaviour as nothing but the pursuit of longstanding policy objectives, while the Privileges Committee report discusses conduct 'which aligned with Mr Wood's interests'. But, on no fewer than 17 occasions, Senator Brown, Senator Milne and Greens took action in the Senate, the media and elsewhere which favoured Mr Wood's bid. This saw contortions whereby Senator Brown and the Greens opposed Gunns getting—

                      , I draw your attention to standing order 193(3) and I submit that by rehashing this ground Senator Kroger is indeed making an imputation of improper motives. I think that any fair person listening would actually see that that is what she is doing by re-traversing ground which has already been the subject of the Privileges Committee report, at which point it was found that there was no evidence for any imputations.

                        . This saw contortions whereby Senator Brown and the Greens opposed Gunns getting any money from the Tasmanian Forests Intergovernmental Agreement when Gunns were negotiating to sell their woodchip mill to the Aprin logging consortium. But, inexplicably, they did not oppose Gunns getting money when they sold the mill to Wood. For 10 days Senator Brown railed against

                        receiving money from the IGA as settlement of its claim against Gunns, only to change his criticism after Gunns reached a settlement with the Tasmanian government which involved $11.5 million being paid to Forestry Tasmania.

                        Significantly, the committee states that my submission only contained circumstantial evidence and that it must therefore prefer the accounts of Senators Brown and Milne. Well, I say the circumstantial evidence is very, very strong and, I would argue, insurmountable. I believe the test is whether or not Senator Brown would have at every turn acted to advantage Mr Wood's bid for the woodchip mill if Mr Wood had not given the Greens the $1.6 million donation. Would any other senator have gone to the lengths that Senator Brown and the Greens did to advantage a businessman's purchase of a specific property in which he gained a $6 million benefit on the purchase price?

                         , I raise a point of order. I draw your attention again to standing order 193. The senator is clearly reflecting on motives of Senator Brown and Senator Milne, and indeed other members within this place, incorrectly. This issue has been canvassed by the Privileges Committee. There has been a decision. It is not anyone else's fault but Senator Kroger's that she continues to be the puppet of Senator Abetz in this issue and continues to prosecute this case despite the fact that it has been knocked out of the park.

                             , suggests that the committee was also focused on this issue rather than the public advocacy and manoeuvring on behalf of Mr Wood's interests. Given so many of Senator Brown and Senator Milne's actions on behalf of Mr Wood's purchase happened outside the parliament, perhaps we may have to wait for Senator Brown's parliamentary integrity commissioner—a part of the Labor-Greens agreement which seems to have slipped his mind—in order to examine these events more fully.

                             While on this point, though, the submission on behalf of Senators Brown and Milne states that there is no basis for the allegation that the sale to Triabunna Investments was conditional on any compensation being paid to Gunns.

                                        I will return to the submission of Senators Brown and Milne. It cites the Gunns stock exchange announcement that their sale of the woodchip mill to Wood's Triabunna Investments was to complete on 15 July 2011, before much of the Greens' manoeuvring on Wood's behalf. Much turns on this. Yet the glib arguments on this point by lawyers for Senators Brown and Milne studiously ignore the fact that Gunns had a hold over the sale, that there were two successive 60-day priority notices lodged over the woodchip mill's transfer to Wood's Triabunna Investments, and that the transfer of this property had still not been registered as at 11 October 2011.

                                        The committee has accepted Senator Brown's word that his actions were not influenced by the donation. By his own account, Senator Brown first learnt of Mr Wood's proposal to develop the woodchip mill on

                                        can confirm that players in the environment movement floated the idea of a consortium to buy the Triabunna mill in order to shut it and develop the site for tourism.

                                        The idea to form a consortium to buy the Triabunna mill and develop the site for tourism was around in the Tasmanian environment movement at least a month before Senator Brown claims he heard about it.

                                                  I do not believe we have heard the last of this matter. I am going to conclude this speech now because of the disgraceful interjections being made while I am reflecting on a report that I was denied leave during the week to respond to. It was a report that I had initiated and now I have to seek time in adjournment to make observations on the report. We clearly have not seen the last of this. The behaviour of those on the crossbenches diminishes them hugely and I think they will find that in time to come.
