        My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Given the government’s decision last year to give the green light to Chinese apple imports—making it the first time since 1921 that apples can be imported into Australia—and given the serious concerns that Chinese apples may carry the suzukii fruit fly, can the government explain why only five per cent of Chinese apples are being sampled by quarantine authorities for testing, particularly given that countries such as Japan, Vietnam and Thailand have already had to increase their testing of Chinese produce after discovering high levels of chemicals?

         for a question within my portfolio. It is one that the opposition has not raised very recently. Of course, we take biosecurity very seriously and we need to make sure that Australia remains properly protected from pests and diseases. Strong exports are critical to the future of Australia and we are committed to meeting the highest standards possible to protect Australia’s plant, animal and human biosecurity. I understand that the first shipments of Fuji apples from China have arrived in Australia for retail sale and I can confirm that the advice from relevant biosecurity officers is that all consignments complied with Australia’s import requirements. The process leading up to the importation of Chinese apples included a rigorous risk analysis of the quarantine risks, in-country verification of China’s biosecurity system, and checking that the necessary quarantine measures specified in the final import risk analysis report have been properly implemented. All consignments being exported to Australia are inspected by the

         officers in China to ensure that they are free of any pests of quarantine concern.
        </p>
        <p>
         This importation of fruit from China is not a new development. Pears have been imported from China since 1999. The pests and disease risks for pears from China are very similar to those for apples, and that is why I add that information for your assistance. To date, there have been no pests or disease incursions resulting from this decade-old trade relationship.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Given that many Australians may wish to buy only Australian grown apples to support Australia’s $400 million apple industry, which employs more than 4,500 people in regional areas, is the government aware that the current labelling laws do not in fact require imported apples to identify their country of origin, and what plans does the government have in place to fix this loophole to ensure that Australian consumers are not left deceived?

           promotes Australian apples, as do I as a Queenslander. I was in Stanthorpe last year and I have been to Tasmania and spoken to a range of producers. I think people should continue to support Australian apples, which are the finest in the world—there is no doubt in my mind about that. Consumers should continue to select Australian apples as their fruit of choice whether they be Tasmanian apples or Queensland apples. I can assure consumers that the apples they buy in Australia will continue to be of high quality. Australian consumers in these issues do have a choice—

            asks a very reasonable question about labelling and identification. I think everybody, especially senators from Tasmania, might be interested in the answer.

              Australian food standards require that a label identifying the country of origin must be provided on or in connection with the fruit at the point of sale. This applies to all fruit, whether imported or grown here. So there is an opportunity for Australians to buy Australian apples.

               , I ask a further supplementary question. Given that the first container of Chinese apples arrived last month just as many farmers were suffering from enormous flood damage, what financial support is the government planning on giving Australian apple growers, in addition to financial support already in place for flood victims, in order to ensure that Australian farms can remain competitive and are not forced to close down during this time?

                I will not deal with the situations where growers have been flood affected or where they have suffered damage. The Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements are available and affected growers will be able to access those, so I will not go into that detail. On the issue of supporting Australian apples, I would ask everyone here and everyone in the Australian community to buy Australian apples. They are the finest. Consumers can check labels on apple displays. They can ensure that they are buying Tasmanian apples or Queensland apples. They can look to the labelling which from 1 January 2011 is allowed to include a ‘grown in’ claim when products are not only made in Australia but also grown here. Australia has a hard-won, world-renowned reputation for the quality of its produce. Australians should, by buying Australian produce, support local producers and the jobs and communities they support. Australian farmers are among the most innovative in the world.
