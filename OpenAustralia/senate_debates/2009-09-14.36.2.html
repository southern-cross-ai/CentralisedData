       <p class="italic">
        Introduction and passage of the bill in the 2009 Spring sittings will enable the Asian Development Bank to increase its short term response to the impact of the global recession in the Asia-Pacific region by ensuring further and early increases in lending.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia’s early subscription to the capital stock, whilst not impacting the Budget, will enable the Asian Development Bank to provide additional concessional lending to the Asia-Pacific region immediately whilst maintaining appropriate prudential standards.  This additional lending will help fill the finance gaps created due to the financial crisis in the Asia-Pacific region.  Australia will also encourage other member countries to fast track their subscriptions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia, through the G-20, has committed to ensuring that multilateral development banks have appropriate capital for their resourcing needs.  Early subscription of capital stock at the Asian Development Bank will demonstrate Australia’s leadership in this important area.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Failing to subscribe to an increase in capital stock early would limit the Asian Development Bank’s ability to respond decisively and comprehensively to the global recession.  This may deepen the impact of the global recession in the Asia-Pacific region.

         Corporations Act
        </a>
        to urgently address deficiencies in the regulatory framework governing the payment of termination benefits to company directors and executives.

       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Reasons for Urgency
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Passage of the Bill is sought in Spring 2009 to urgently enhance the regulatory framework governing the payment of termination benefits to company directors and executives.  The Bill was passed by the House of Representatives on 9 September 2009.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Termination benefits are a unique component of remuneration which warrant greater shareholder scrutiny and approval, particularly as the company and shareholders generally derive little or no value from such payments.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Currently, termination benefits can reach up to seven times a recipient’s total annual remuneration before shareholder approval is required.  This is a very high threshold.  Urgent action is required to reduce this threshold to better empower shareholders to reject excessive payments where they are not in the best interest of the company.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The reforms will also address growing community concern on termination benefits and provide businesses with certainty on this issue.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The legislation also coincides with the global initiatives being progressed by the G20 to secure the integrity of the global financial system.
