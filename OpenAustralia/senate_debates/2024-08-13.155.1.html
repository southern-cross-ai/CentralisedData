        Watching the sad events currently unfolding and underway in the United Kingdom, one can be forgiven for thinking we'd descended into the dystopian world so long predicted in the classic literature.

        is just one warning, which ironically appears to have been become an instruction manual for the political left. An interview with George Orwell recently surfaced in which Orwell thought there was a possibility

        could happen in the

         Keir Starmer

        reads as follows:

        In our world there will be no emotions except fear, rage, triumph, and self-abasement—

       <p class="italic">
        There will be no loyalty except loyalty to the Party. But always there will be the intoxication of power. Always, at every moment, there will be the thrill of victory, the sensation of trampling on an enemy who's helpless. If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face, forever. The moral to be drawn from this dangerous nightmare situation is … don't let it happen.

        , from American science fiction writer
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Vonnegut" rel="nofollow">
         Kurt Vonnegut
        </a>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IQ" rel="nofollow">
         IQ
        </a>
        citizens were punished with earpieces that played loud sounds every 30 seconds to prevent them from thinking so they did not outshine low-IQ people. The strong were literally weighted down with ball bearings to reduce their strength to that of the worst weakling. The attractive were forced to wear ugly masks so nobody was made to feel uncomfortable gazing upon someone more attractive than themselves. A quote to explain his predication, which is often incorrectly attributed to Dostoevsky, simply reads, 'Tolerance will reach such a level that intelligent people will be banned from thinking so as not to offend the imbeciles.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Vonnegut's view was mirrored in an interview with a former resident of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union" rel="nofollow">
         Soviet Union
        </a>
        that was described to me. It consisted of the fellow drawing three stick figures on a piece of paper, two at the same height and one taller, then saying, 'In the Soviet Union everyone is equal,' before taking his pencil and drawing a line across the top of the two smaller figures thereby severing the head of the third. 'Such is life in the Soviet Union,' he said. Keir Starmer's communism is the victory of those who have lost their humanity, morality and faith or, as Orwell describes them, 'those who thrill in the delight of the kill'. Perhaps UK citizens would agree it's time to add a footnote to the famous quote from Descartes, 'I think therefore I am—arrested.'
       </p>
       <p>
        It's just like the young man in Belfast who was recently arrested for observing a protest, only to have District Judge Rafferty and the Belfast Magistrates Court decide that someone's presence, including as a curious observer, involves them in such disorder as to justify the refusal of bail. And off to jail he went. That young man had never been in trouble with the police before and had even left when the event became violent. There's no provision in common or statute law that reads, 'Injustice is allowed if it exists to make an example of one to intimidate others into disobedience,' yet here we are.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_Newman" rel="nofollow">
         Campbell Newman

        reminded the internet last week of the
        <i>
         Areopagitica
        </i>
        , which carries the full title:
        <i>
         A speech of Mr.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Milton" rel="nofollow">
          John Milton
         </a>
         for the Liberty of Unlicenc'd Printing, to the Parlament of England
        </i>
        . This was a pamphlet published in 1644 to protest a parliamentary order of the previous year requiring government approval and licensing of all published works and pamphlets. This measure was introduced after Milton's treatise in favour of divorce upset the king,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I" rel="nofollow">
         Charles I
        </a>
        . History appears to be repeating—the uniparty's misinformation disinformation censorship bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Areopagitica, Milton defends the free circulation of ideas as essential to moral and intellectual development. Furthermore, he asserts, to attempt to preclude falsehood is to underestimate the power of truth, a lesson for our eSafety Commissioner, who clearly believes the reverse is true. While the immediate objective of the Areopagitica repeal of licensing was not obtained for another 50 years, the tract has earned a permanent place in the literature of human rights.
       </p>
       <p>
        Repeal took 50 years because, as it turned out, each new government kept that power in order to protect themselves from criticism. Power freely given is never freely surrendered. Here we are 380 years later and Australia is making exactly the same mistake, but One Nation isn't. The rest of the parties in this place are.
       </p>
       <p>
        Keir Starmer famously took the knee during Black Lives Matter riots and now puts English lives matter demonstrators on their knees. The start of the trouble was the murder of three young girls at the hands of a suspected Islamic terrorist. If you want to look for the cause of the frustration being demonstrated among everyday Brits, look no further than a failure to keep the public safe. It is basic. Fear used as a weapon of control during COVID has bitten the hand that created it. There is an opportunity cost to arresting citizens for thought crimes like: praying in public; watching—but not participating in—a protest; making posts on social media critical of the government—posts which do not incite violence or incite the breaking of a law; posting up first-hand stories of vaccine harm; and of course, criticising the religion that can't be criticised using nothing but their own words.
       </p>
       <p>
        That opportunity cost is the policing of real crime. Over the last 10 years, according to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK's" rel="nofollow">
         UK's
        </a>
        statistics office: assault with grievous bodily harm is up 100 per cent—doubled; assault with an injury is up 80 per cent—almost doubled; rape of an adult female up 370 per cent—almost five times; rape of a minor is up 100 per cent. In fact, the conviction rate of rapists in the UK is currently five per cent and not all of those even go to jail. Only last week a migrant was given a suspended sentence for raping a 13-year-old British girl. The court accepted his defence that he did not know that an adult raping a child was against the law in the UK. Imagine being that child's parents. Imagine being that child. Is it any wonder the Brits are demonstrating this two-tiered justice system? The commentariat, who are denying the right of people to protest peacefully, including many of the usual suspects in here in Australia, are commenting on a world their wealth and their elitist lifestyles insulate them from.
       </p>
       <p>
        A Merseyside chief constable made a comment last week, apparently unaware this is the exact upside-down policing, the exact two-tier policing, the public are protesting about. They said, 'What I would say to those people who think they have gotten away with being involved in disorder, we are coming for you. We have hours of social media and closed circuit
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">
         TV
        </a>
        footage. I have officers working around the clock to identify you. We know who you are and we know where you live and where you work.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Why is this relevant to Australia? Because our law enforcement have been equipped with the powers to do exactly the same thing. The Identity Verification Services Act together with the Digital ID Act, which Labor minister
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katy_Gallagher" rel="nofollow">
         Katy Gallagher
        </a>
        passed through the parliament this year, allows law enforcement to obtain the image of any person anywhere any time from traffic cameras, security cameras, closed circuit TV and main roads, even in supermarkets. All this with a spurious 'suspected of a crime' justification. It then allows law enforcement to go through the video, one frame at a time, to extract a photo of each attendee and run them through the national identity database, which currently contains data on 17 million Australians. Our police will indeed know your name; address; where you work, live and visit, and, once fully implemented, the system will be able to locate you from traffic cameras, payment scanners in shops and public transport touchpads in real time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Welcome to your digital prison. One Nation warned you directly, loudly and often. During the next manufactured social and medical crisis, there's no doubt our law enforcement will commit the same abuse of civil rights as we see happening in the UK right now. One Nation believes human rights should not be made subservient to the greed and hubris of those who would stamp on the face of their fellow citizens in the acquisition of wealth and power or, perversely, in the name of social justice. Measures to facilitate this censorship and destruction of human rights are winding our society back to the time of Milton, 380 years ago. The irony is this is the same Left who accused One Nation of wanting to wind the clock back!
       </p>
       <p>
        As a closing remark, let me make it clear there's no excuse for violence on either side of a protest. Equally, the actions of a few do not justify the removal of rights from the many. The actions of the few do not justify the removal of rights from the many. Human rights are universal, part of being human, inherent in each and all of us from birth.
