        , Senator Evans. I refer to the announcement by the Prime Minister during his recent visit to Japan proposing to establish an international commission on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, to be co-chaired by former Australian foreign minister
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Evans" rel="nofollow">
         Gareth Evans
        </a>
        . Can the minister indicate whether any money has been allocated for the functioning of the commission and whether the commission will consist of a properly staffed secretariat? Does the comment in the joint statement of the Japanese and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Prime_Ministers" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Prime Ministers
        </a>
        that ‘the Japanese side welcomed the idea’ indicate that the Japanese have formally agreed to participate in the commission? What other counties have been approached and have agreed to participate in the commission and in what capacity? Can the minister provide a formal terms of reference or any other job description, if you like, that has been developed for the commission, beyond the few sentences contained in the Prime Minister’s original statement?

         I thank Senator Bartlett for the question. I will help him as much as I can and if he wants further information I am happy to take it on notice. He is right to identify that we as a government have sought to propose an international commission on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. We think it is a very important initiative. The objective of the commission is to reinvigorate the global effort against the proliferation of nuclear weapons and to seek to shape a global consensus in the lead-up to the 2010
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPT" rel="nofollow">
          NPT
         </a>
         review conference. The commission aims to strengthen the NPT, the most significant and successful arms control instrument of the nuclear age. But we all acknowledge that recently it has been under significant strain. I know from my own dealings as a former resources and energy spokesman for the Labor Party that that strain was really beginning to show in how one dealt with these issues and in the lack of participation and commitment to the NPT shown by some countries. The 2010 review conference is an opportunity for Australia and like-minded countries to ensure the treaty continues to provide a robust framework for nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.
        </p>
        <p>
         I think there is broad agreement that the NPT does need strengthening—it is under increasing pressures. We have seen countries develop nuclear weapons outside the framework.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea" rel="nofollow">
          North Korea
         </a>
         has stated it has left the treaty in order to develop its nuclear weapons capability. Iran continues to frustrate the agency responsible for enforcing the treaty, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAEA" rel="nofollow">
          IAEA
         </a>
         . We need to ensure a robust framework for nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation that can meet the proliferation challenges of today, and combat any further changes to the regime.
        </p>
        <p>
         The senator asked about the composition of the commission: it is yet to be determined, but we are engaging in a dialogue with like-minded countries, including Japan, to seek their participation in the commission. The Prime Minister has already announced that the former foreign minister—and my predecessor in this role—
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Evans" rel="nofollow">
          Gareth Evans
         </a>
         , will co-chair the commission. A secretariat will be established in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFAT" rel="nofollow">
          DFAT
         </a>
         over the coming weeks to support the commission’s work. Of course, it will not prevent the government from concurrently pursuing other disarmament and non-proliferation initiatives. We see the entry into force of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensive_Nuclear_Test_Ban_Treaty" rel="nofollow">
          Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty
         </a>
         and the commencement of negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty as immediate disarmament projects.
        </p>
        <p>
         We will continue to urge all states that are yet to do so to sign and ratify the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CTBT" rel="nofollow">
          CTBT

         and we will continue to work within the

          UN
         </a>
         Conference on Disarmament to begin negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty. We think this is an important initiative. We do think there needs to be new energy and new activity around the nuclear non-proliferation objective. We hope that this will make a significant contribution over the next period to aid that. More information will come to hand as we further develop the concept, but the building blocks are in shape, and I am confident that Australia can play a very serious and constructive role in this task.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for his answer. Is he able, either now or on notice, to indicate any date for a formal establishment of the commission and also whether the commission will have the scope to propose alternatives or changes to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, or the establishment of a new treaty to supersede the existing one that he has acknowledged has some problems? Can he also, as part of the statement he has made confirming the government’s commitment to increasing the effectiveness of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, reconfirm the previously stated position of the government that it will not support uranium exports or sales to India or any other country that is currently outside or not signatory to the

           I will get whatever further information I can for Senator Bartlett. As I indicated to him, I think the debate he refers to about sales of uranium to India is one of those areas which has caused people to question the effectiveness of the treaty and whether it is currently serving our needs. I think this is important and that is why we have made the initiative that we have. I will ask the Prime Minister’s office and see what further information I can get for the senator.
