        , which is to provide greater certainty regarding the lawful conduct of air security officers. The legislation proposes to amend the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 and the Civil Aviation Act 1988 so that the new regulations under this legislation permit air security officers to lawfully discharge their firearms without risk of prosecution. Clearly there was some uncertainty in that area. Any legislation that clears up that uncertainty to ensure that they can go about their duties lawfully is important.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is one area that the opposition does have some concerns about. There is no point in providing support under this legislation for what we call air marshals and providing them with further certainty about doing things like lawfully discharging firearms and basically going about their core business if we cannot get some guarantee from the government about the tenure of this program. We need to guarantee that this program is going to be ongoing. The minister may be aware that earlier this year there was a spate of media articles flagging that the number of air security officers is to be cut by one-third. We all read things in the media. Of course we cannot necessarily take those at face value, but the opposition did take the opportunity to ask Senator Ludwig about this on 14 February. I understand those questions were put by the shadow Attorney-General, Senator Brandis. Those questions failed to receive any assurance that the Rudd government would not cut the air security program by the levels flagged in the media.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are not sure exactly where this is going to go. On a number of occasions we have sought assurances from the Rudd government that this is to be a program that is not being wound down. This is a program that we support completely. On none of the occasions that have been given to the government have they taken that opportunity to guarantee the future of the air security officer program. There is an opportunity now—a very significant opportunity—for the minister to provide a response in this debate on the second reading. We would be more than happy to support the legislation, but we would really like some assurances. This is a great opportunity for the government to give assurances that the air marshal program is a fundamental part of our border security and that this government, the Rudd government, is absolutely guaranteeing the Australian people that this is not going to be wound down. Can the minister provide some transparency with regard to that guarantee?
