         Response

       <p class="italic">
        The Government has established a Space Policy Unit in the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research to coordinate and be the central point of contact for Australia’s national and international civil space activities.  The Space Policy Unit will liaise with Government agencies on space matters and serve as a focal point for the exchange of information and the development of new policy.  The Space Policy Unit will convene, on an as-required basis, a forum of national security agencies to assess security and intelligence aspects on civil space matters.  The Department of Defence will continue to have the lead on defence and military space related matters.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government is committed to improving Australia’s capacity to independently develop and utilise space technology.  In this regard, the Government is establishing an Australian Space Research Program to support space research, innovation and skills development in areas of national significance.  This program will be managed by the Space Policy Unit.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In its 2009 Defence White Paper, the Government has recognised the importance of being able to protect Australian space-based assets from counter-space technologies and from accidental damage caused by space debris. While the Government noted that we rely on the United
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State" rel="nofollow">
         State
        </a>
        s for much of our space advantage, the White Paper identified that we should also seek ways to develop our nascent but growing expertise in space capabilities, including by strengthening Australia’s space situational awareness and mission assurance capability, and developing a career stream for space specialists in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Defence White Paper also places a high priority on assured access to high-quality space-based imagery to meet Defence’s needs for mapping, charting, navigation and targeting data. In addition, the Government announced its intention to improve Australia’s intelligence collection capabilities by acquiring a satellite with a remote sensing capability, most likely to be based on a high-resolution, cloud-penetrating, synthetic aperture radar.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government considers that Australia derives considerable benefit from arrangements with other countries and commercial bodies that facilitate access to space technology and the data derived from its applications.  Such arrangements will remain an important component of Australia’s space capability.  The Government notes that risk mitigation measures, such as treaty provisions embedding Australian personnel at foreign-owned space tracking stations, are in place to protect Australia’s interests in these arrangements.  The Government will continue to consider, as appropriate, opportunities to improve the efficacy of such arrangements.

         Recommendation 3
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee notes the wealth of expert, well informed evidence received by the committee. Despite some deviations, the overwhelming majority of witnesses strongly supported the formation of a government unit to coordinate Australian space activities, including those in the private sector. The committee supports this conclusion and notes that there must be a proper balance between industry and government involvement.

        Ensuring Australia’s energy security is a high priority for the Government and to this end the Government has undertaken a number of initiatives, including the development of a National Energy Security Assessment (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NESA" rel="nofollow">

       <p class="italic">
        On 26 March 2009, the Hon Martin Ferguson AM MP, Minister for Resources and Energy, released the NESA which identifies the key strategic energy security issues currently facing Australia’s liquid fuels, natural gas and electricity sectors, and those likely to influence energy security in 5 (2013), 10 (2018) and 15 (2023) years.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Energy White Paper will include a review of the Government’s energy policies and the development of a policy framework through to 2030 to ensure cleaner, adequate, reliable and affordable supplies of energy to support the functioning of the economy and social development. In March 2009, the Government released the Energy White Paper’s Strategic Directions Paper which sets the scene for the development of the Energy White Paper by broadly mapping out its intended scope and identifying some of the specific work being undertaken.

       <p class="italic">
        6.14 The Western Australian Government should conduct an internal analysis of the effectiveness and appropriateness of the legislative framework to deal with periods of energy crisis in Western Australia. Issues such as the government’s capacity to invoke emergency powers in the public interest and the effectiveness of government intervention in a market-based industry should be analysed. In particular the response to emergencies under the Energy Coordination Act 1994 (WA) and the emergencies under the Emergency Management Act 2005 (WA) legislation should be assessed for their appropriateness following the experience of the Varanus Island gas explosion crisis.
