          This motion is about recognition of the terrible tragedy that we have seen unfolding in Bangladesh over the last two weeks with the collapse of the Rana Plaza building and the subsequent civil disobedience that we have seen around that in Bangladesh. It is also a recognition of the role that we as consumers play in Australia and how we are linked to that and what we can do to prevent these things happening in the future. We often talk about fair trade and free trade in this building. This tragedy is a recognition that this is very real and that there are certain things that we can do to make a difference here. So the motion also calls for a move in the retail and fashion industries to look at things such as product certification so that consumers can be aware of where clothing items come from and how they are made. These types of arrangements should be incorporated in trade arrangements.
