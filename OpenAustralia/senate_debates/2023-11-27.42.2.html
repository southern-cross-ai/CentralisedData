        President, my question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Farrell. On 18 November, the defence minister released a statement regarding a 14 November incident in which a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_People's_Liberation_Army" rel="nofollow">
         Chinese People's Liberation Army

        naval vessel engaged in actions that injured Australian defence personnel from the

        <i>
         Toowoomba
        </i>
        whilst it was operating in international waters—indeed, in waters within the Japanese economic zone. On what date was the Prime Minister, Mr Albanese, informed of the Chinese People's Liberation Army naval vessel's actions?

         Thank you, Senator Birmingham, for that question. I am aware of the statement by the Deputy Prime Minister in respect of the events in relation to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS" rel="nofollow">
          HMAS
         </a>
         <i>
          Toowoomba
         </i>
         . I am not aware of the date that the Prime Minister was advised about the matter. I'm assuming—I'm trying to think back over the period of time—it would have been when he was at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APEC" rel="nofollow">
          APEC
         </a>
         meeting in the United States, which I also attended. But I would have to seek some advice on that, Senator Birmingham, and come back to you with a response.
        </p>
        <p>
         As you say, the Deputy Prime Minister made a statement. He did express the Australian government's serious concerns to the Chinese government following what we believe to be an unsafe and unprofessional interaction with the People's Liberation Army destroyer. That was on 14 November 2023. HMAS
         <i>
          Toowoomba
         </i>
         was in international waters, inside Japan's exclusive economic zone en route to commence a scheduled port visit. But as to the specifics of your question, I would have to seek further advice on that.

           I thank Senator Farrell for taking that on notice. On 18 November, the Prime Minister confirmed publicly in a press conference that he had met with President Xi Jinping at the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APEC" rel="nofollow">
            APEC
           </a>
           summit and that the discussions at the APEC summit had included topics such as the relationship between the two countries, trade sanctions imposed by China and a potential visit next year by Chinese Premier Li to Australia. Given the Prime Minister's willingness to identify these topics of discussion, did the Prime Minister raise with President Xi Australia's concerns about the actions of the Chinese naval vessel?

            I thank Senator Birmingham for his first supplementary question. In his original question he referred to the very clear statement made by the Deputy Prime Minister about what he had said in respect of this particular event. My understanding is that the Australian government raised this issue and our concerns about the unsafe and unprofessional interaction with the People's Liberation Army through all of the appropriate channels. I think the Prime Minister himself has made it clear that there were no formal bilaterals with President Xi.

             <p>
              Minister, why won't Mr Albanese or the government be transparent with the Australian people about the Prime Minister's handling of this matter, his failure to confirm whether or not he personally stood up for Australia's interests and confirm whether or not he did so? Mr Albanese was happy to list a number of topics he discussed with President Xi. Why won't he be upfront about whether or not he raised this one? Is it simply because he did not raise it?

                 I'll pick up Senator Polley's interjection. We're not going to take advice from the opposition about either transparency or how we deal with foreign governments. You've only got to look at the absolute mess that our foreign policy was left in after the years of the Morrison government. The truth of this matter is that we have raised our concerns, starting with the comments of the Deputy Prime Minister about what happened at this event. We've raised our concerns through every channel that is appropriate in these circumstances.
