        My question is to the Assistant Minister for Health, Senator Nash. Minister, too often we have heard about a national diabetes epidemic. Could you inform the Senate about the seriousness of this epidemic and how the government plans to address it?

         I acknowledge the senator's very keen interest in this issue. The prevalence of diabetes alone has more than doubled since the 1990s. Results from the latest Australian health survey indicate that 5.1 per cent of Australian adults have diabetes. While four per cent of adults have a known diabetes condition, another one per cent have an undiagnosed case of the disease. A further 3.1 per cent of adults have impaired fasting glucose levels, which indicates a high risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Of particular concern, diabetes has been found to be three times more common in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
          Indigenous Australians
         </a>
         . Tragically, Indigenous Australians are around seven times more likely to die from diabetes than other Australians.
        </p>
        <p>
         Type 1 diabetes accounts for one in every 10 cases of the disease. Gestational diabetes occurs in more than five per cent of pregnancies in Australia. The human cost is significant and so is the cost on the Australian health system. Expenditure on diabetes is expected to increase by over 430 per cent over the next two decades. The direct cost of diabetes to our health system is currently over $1.5 billion a year.
        </p>
        <p>
         Part of our plan is to establish a national diabetes strategy, which the Minister for Health,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Dutton" rel="nofollow">

         , announced yesterday at the 2013 World Diabetes Congress in Melbourne. I also addressed the congress, and I acknowledge former Senator Guy Barnett's contribution in this area and note that he is in the chamber today. The national diabetes strategy will be supported by expert input from key stakeholders to ensure that health spending can be better targeted to address the prevention, treatment and management of this chronic disease. The strategy's advisory group will be co-chaired by the Hon.

         and Professor Paul Zimmet. Together they bring a wealth of knowledge to diabetes prevention and medical research. The resulting policy framework will be action oriented and will focus particularly on tackling the impact of diabetes on our children.

           The incidence and prevalence of type 1 diabetes among children in Australia is among the highest in the world, which is extremely concerning. This will be a focus of the national diabetes strategy. The coalition government has provided an additional $1.4 million for the Type 1 Diabetes Insulin Pump Program to provide insulin pumps for 136 children. This is in addition to the 68 pumps already available under the program and it will benefit more than 200 children and their families over the next year. The pumps, which deliver a continuous level of insulin throughout the day, help to improve the management of diabetes for children and their parents and teachers. As well, the government has promised a $35 million grant to support the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation's Type 1 Diabetes Clinical Research Network in its efforts to help find a much-needed cure for type 1 diabetes.

             Research has long been the foundation of our national efforts in diabetes prevention and care. In the past decade more than $475 million has been invested in diabetes through the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHMRC" rel="nofollow">
              NHMRC
             </a>
             . The Prime Minister and the Minister for Health recently announced $559 million for NHMRC council grants—17 of which are focused on diabetes. As well, the government has an ongoing commitment of up to $1 billion over five years towards universal access for all Australians with diabetes to self-management products and support through the National Diabetes Services Scheme. We will also continue to support Australians with diabetes and other chronic diseases through the PBS and

              MBS
             </a>
             so that they can access medication, services and equipment to help treat and manage their condition.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have no doubt that the recent listing of four new diabetes medicines on the PBS by Minister Dutton would have been widely welcomed. Further, the government will invest in rebuilding primary care specifically through the teaching, training and education initiatives—
