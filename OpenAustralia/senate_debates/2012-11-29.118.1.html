        As we end 2012 we see a government in shambolic disarray, a government that has no agenda other than spin; a government that is being led around by the nose by the

         Australian Greens
        </a>
        ; a government that promised there would be no carbon tax and then foisted a destructive carbon tax on all Australians; a government that promised every year 9 to 12 child access to their own computer at school, a plan announced on 14 November 2007, a plan that failed to reach its targets, a plan was abandoned this year; a government that promised to take over public hospitals if the states did not act by mid-2009, a plan announced before the 2007 election, where the deadlines have not been met and the plan now thoroughly abandoned; a government that promised that the Commonwealth share of hospital funding would increase to 60 per cent. That was announced by Ms Gillard on 29 November 2010 and abandoned on 11 February 2011.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a government that promised to establish a citizens assembly on climate change, a plan announced on 23 July 2010 and abandoned on 7 October 2010; a government that promised Grocery Choice and Petrol Watch, both abandoned; a government that promised an

        solution and a Malaysian solution, both in tatters; a government that promised to build 64
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        Super Clinics, a plan that was abandoned after only 36 were built; a government that promised to establish a department of homeland security, announced prior to 2007, a plan that was abandoned within days of Labor taking office; a government that promised to establish 260 new childcare centres, a plan announced before the 2007 election. They funded 38 centres and the plan has now been completely abandoned.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a government that promised to require full mandatory precommitment technology for all poker machines, announced in September 2010, abandoned in January 2012; a government that promised to establish a trade centre in every Australian secondary school, announced before the 2007 election, a plan that has now been abandoned; a government that promised a real increase in the defence funding base by an average of three per cent each year through to 2017-18, a plan announced in August 2010, abandoned in the budget of May 2011.
       </p>
       <p>
        And if that is not enough, this is now the government that seeks to spin and promise a National Disability Insurance Scheme, a dental scheme, a Gonski schemeâ€”all hollow, cynical promises. Australians are deservedly distrusting of this government. And why wouldn't they be? Mr Rudd does not trust the Prime Minister, she who claims that she was foisted into the job of Prime Minister, yet conveniently overlooked that she had prepared the acceptance speech 14 days beforehand. People with private health insurance know they cannot trust this Prime Minister and government. Mr Wilkie, the member for Denison, knows that he cannot trust this Prime Minister and government over poker machines. The car industry knows that they cannot trust this government with a more than $6 billion plan, a plan which has now been absolutely slashed. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Israel" rel="nofollow">
         State of Israel
        </a>
        knows that they cannot trust the Australian government, and of course all Australians know that they cannot trust this government because of that broken promise in relation to a carbon tax.
       </p>
       <p>
        So as we end the year 2012, we have a government that is in shambolic policy disarray. We also have a Prime Minister who is in personal credibility disarray given the revelations today that have blown out of the water all her pathetic defences to date in relation to the

What he did is an absolute disgrace. He is the only politician in this chamber who had to apologise to the chamber and the Australian public.

He comes in here and talks about people acting with credibility. He was the guy who had to apologise to the chamber and apologise to the Australian people because of his behaviour.

                   , I rise on a point of order. The senator is misleading the chamber. Senator Abetz is not leaving the chamber. He should withdraw those remarks.

                     , I have a different point of order. The motion we are debating is that we take note of answers to questions by all opposition senators. There was no question and no answer mentioned, related to, referred to or anywhere near the topic that this senator has continually talked about. I ask you to bring the senator to order.

                       The topic before the chair, as I understand it, is the behaviour of politicians. If ever there was an issue on behaviour of politicians it was Senator Abetz and it was the former Leader of the Opposition Malcolm Turnbull, who lost his job because of the behaviour involved. Senator Abetz was up to his neck in it. I just will not accept any lectures from Senator Abetz about the behaviour of politicians or political parties, given his behaviour.

                       subsidising my private health insurance payments. That is what the coalition are arguing. The cleaners in Parliament House should not be supporting the subsidy for private health insurance for me or any senator here. It was an absolute disgrace. Who supported that? Who wanted the cleaners in Parliament House to be subsidising the richest people in the country? It was the coalition who were doing it. So do not talk to me about policy. I have not heard a word about policy from the coalition. Senator Abetz got upâ€”and he is supposedly going to be a senior member in a coalition governmentâ€”and there was not one issue on policy. He has not said to the Australian public how they would pay for the policies that they have announcedâ€”and I use the word 'policies' advisedly. He did not get up there on one constructive issue.

                       Who was it that put the issue of national disability insurance on the agenda? It was Labor. For 11Â½ years the coalition did nothing. Who increased pensions to historic highs in this country? It was the Labor Party. Who had the courage to take on the vested interests in this country to tackle climate change? It was Labor. Who are the apologists for the mining industry in this chamber? It is the coalition. Who gets flown around the world by

                       </a>
                       ? It is the National Party. Who are the people who suck up to big business, saying to them that they will do something about labour flexibility, which is code for ripping away workers' penalty rates, ripping away workers' allowances, ripping away their annual leave and leaving them with no control over what they achieve in their workplaces? It is the coalition.

                       . Well the public did determine and they threw you lot out on your backsides. That is what will happen continually when you guys want to take from ordinary workers in this country. That is what you are about. Do not give us any of the nonsense that Senator Abetz put up. You are absolute policy vacuums.

Senator Joyce, you have the call.

                                        , the Prime Minister's ex-boyfriend, has said, 'Well, what happens is that Ralph Blewittâ€”he's a funny blokeâ€”used to bury the money in the backyard.' Of course, why do we need a bank when you have got a perfectly good backyard! That is where you put money these days. You put money there because you want to be transparent and you want to be above board. What was the source of this subterranean benevolence? Where did it come from? Why would people be burying money in a backyard? I do not know, but they were probably getting it from somewhere. Who would know? Anyway, there is a bit of a pattern here, and it goes with the

                                        story and it goes with the

                                        story and it is all part of this 'there's something that's not right'. The Australian people wake up and go: 'Who on earth is running the show? Who are these people? Where did they come from?' Let us go back. Imagine we had a story of Menzies or someone and somebody said, 'Oh, yes, and then he had this mate who was a bit of a one.' You see we have the description of Ralph Blewitt by the Prime Minister: he was 'an imbecile', he was a 'sexist pig' and he was 'an idiot'. They are the sorts of thing that I want to hear my Prime Minister say at a press conference! That is the sort of character I expect to be running the country! And who was their associate back in the 1990s? Well, it was a person who was getting money from somewhere and just hanging around the petunias burying the dough. There might be still a bit there. We should go and have a look and we could give it back to the

                                        and probably back to the members. That is probably where it could go. Maybe it could go back via the way it got there, through this slush fund. That is possibly how it could go back there. So this is running the country! The country has descended into anarchy. It is totally and utterly out of control. This is why we can find ourselves $252.9 billion in debt as I speak now. This is why we borrowed in excess of $3 billion last week, because of this absolute pandemonium palace and every day just when you think it could not get any stranger, that it could not get any stranger than Craig Thomson or that it could not get any stranger than Peter Slipper, Bruce Wilson then comes out to help the Prime Minister out and, by gosh, didn't he help her! What help! Such friends like that!

                                        There are still some serious questions that need to be asked and I will ask just one. So there is only one question and it is serious: did the Prime Minister witness the power of attorney? I do not want to hear the answer that she has witnessed lots of powers of attorney and she has witnessed lots of documents. Did she witness the power of attorney that was responsible for being able to move a house from Mr Wilson's name into Mr Blewitt's name and what was the reason for that? Did she witness it on the day and at the time that they signed the document? I ask because if you do not witness it at the time they sign a document, then, as any solicitor will tell you, you have done something very, very naughty. Anyway here we are and we have got the

Mr Deputy President, I ask you to make him withdraw, and he ought to when he is on his feet withdraw the outrageous statements he made yesterday. For a man who seeks to be the chief law officer of the nation, his performance over the last few days has been an outrage and disqualified him from the job. Mr Deputy President, we should not allow what occurred yesterday to again be repeated today. It is an outrageous inference on the Prime Minister and it ought to be withdrawn.

The matter of yesterday is not before the chair. Senator Brandis, I do ask you to withdraw that comment concerning the Prime Minister. It did adversely reflect on the Prime Minister.

There was a reflection, adversely, on the Prime Minister in your brief comment. How you contribute to the debate after this is fine. The matters before us about yesterday are irrelevant, in my view. I ask that you do withdraw that comment that you made about the Prime Minister.

                                                           . This is our nation's parliament and it should devote most of its time to debating policy, to the contest of ideas. That is what the Australian people seek and expect from us as representatives. They want to know what our plans are for the nation, where we will take the people over coming years. Three weeks ago, I had the great pleasure of visiting Mungindi, a town that borders
                                                           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

                                                           and Queensland. I was there to open a trade training centre, a $2.4 million investment by this government in a hospitality and metalwork trade training centre to provide better skills development for the town.

                                                           Anyone who has visited Mungindi would know that it is a town with very big social problems. It has a very large Indigenous population. While I was at Mungindi Central School to open this trade training centre, I met a young girl, an Indigenous student, in year 10 who explained to me that she was so excited about becoming a chef because of the hospitality trade training centre that had been placed in her school. Her teacher was teaching her how to become a chef and she was just about to begin her apprenticeship. She was telling me that the school had developed a vegetable patch at the back of the school and that they were teaching the kids not only how to cook but how to cook healthy food. This young Indigenous girl would then go home to her family and was teaching her mother how to cook healthy food.

That will not show up in any of the statistics that we see published on education or on indifference in this country. But that is real social change. What people have to understand, and what the Australian public are coming to understand, is that those opposite and

This wonderful school with a wonderful principal, Sheree O'Brien, who is passionate about special-needs education, had put all of their BER money into building two special-needs classrooms. I was there to open that facility. At the morning tea after the opening of those wonderful new facilities, where kids with severe Down syndrome and autism are now getting an education, I spoke to some of the parents. One of the parents came up to me and said, 'Can you send my thanks to

She explained that she had moved her family all the way from Perth to get her son into East Maitland Public School because she had heard how passionate that principal was about special-needs education and because the school was investing in special-needs education.

                                                           Any special needs classroom has two teachers and at the very least a teacher's aide. When you talk about $1.7 billion worth of cuts to education, have a guess what positions will go first in those cuts. They are going to be those teachers' aides that assist those teachers providing special needs education in public schools throughout the country. That is the difference between a Labor government and a Liberal government when it comes to education. That is what this Senate and this parliament should be focusing onâ€”the future of our schools, our hospitals and our nation.

Senator Evans, on the point of order: in light of Senator Brandis's comments earlier, on which I ruled that he needed to withdraw, I was listening very carefully. I do not believe he does on this occasion. Senator Brandis was using language that I believe was satisfactory in the debate.

                                                                                      </p>

The document advertises that the auction is to take place on 13 February 1993. It is not in dispute that the auction did take place and that the property was knocked down to Mr Wilson, who purported to acquire it in the name of Mr Blewitt. Mr Blewitt at the time the power of attorney was ostensibly executed on 4 February 1993 was in Perth. Ms Gillard, who witnessed the power of attorney, lived in Melbourne. It is not impossible that on 4 February 1993 Ms Gillard was in Perth personally present with Mr Blewitt. Nor is it impossible that on 4 February 1993 Mr Blewitt was in Melbourne personally present with Ms Gillard. It is even possible that the two of them were together somewhere else. But it would be a fraud and it would be a crimeâ€”it would be the crime of creating a materially false and misleading documentâ€”if in fact that power of attorney was backdated.

She could simply have said yes. But she did not. She declined to do so. She said, 'I've witnessed thousands of powers of attorney in my career as a lawyer.' If this document were not a falsification why didn't she just say 'yes'?

What he brings is dirty, low-grade accusations. Yesterday he did accuse the Prime Minister of criminal activity. He accused her of being a party to a conspiracy to defraud. This is the same bloke who tries to ring up police commissioners or Liberal police ministers to put in the fix to try to get them to take action to suit his political interests. This is the bloke who has no standards.
