        response to the Senate Community Affairs References Committee report:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Care and management of younger and older Australians living with dementia and behavioural and psychiatric symptoms of dementia (BPSD)
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Foreword
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In 2017, there are an estimated 365,100 people in Australia living with dementia. This is expected to increase to almost 900,000 by 2050.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Senate Community Affairs References Committee report Care and management of younger and older Australians living with dementia and behavioural and psychiatric symptoms of dementia (BPSD) provides 18 recommendations on a range of issues affecting people living with dementia in Australia. Since the report was tabled, the Australian Government has taken action through a wide range of initiatives and reforms targeting dementia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These actions are outlined in this response and underpinned by the National Framework for Action on Dementia 2015-2019 (NFAD). The NFAD was endorsed by the Council of Australian Governments Health Council on 7 August 2015. It outlines Australian, state and territory government priorities across primary, acute and aged care to reduce the risk of dementia and improve the quality of life for people living with dementia and their support networks.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 29 May 2017, Australia supported the adoption of the World Health Organisation Global Action Plan on the Public Health Response to Dementia 2017-2025 (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAP" rel="nofollow">
         GAP
        </a>
        ). The goal of the GAP is to improve the lives of people living with dementia, their carers and families, while decreasing the impact of dementia on them as well as on communities and countries. The GAP includes seven distinct action areas and outlines measurable targets for achievement.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHO" rel="nofollow">
         WHO
        </a>
        Global Dementia Observatory provides the monitoring mechanism to track implementation and progress of the GAP and will be a valuable resource for knowledge translation and exchange. Australia is proud to be among the first countries supporting and sharing our data and resources on this platform.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government is committed to the provision of quality services for people living with dementia, their families and carers, as well as research into the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and cure of dementia. In the 2014-15 Budget $200 million over five years was allocated to boost Australia' s dementia research capacity and deliver best practice support for people with dementia across the health system. Key priorities of projects funded under this commitment are improving care and interventions for the behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia and maximising the independence of people living with dementia. Research funding includes a strong knowledge translation component to translate research findings into practice within dementia policy and programs.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Phase one of the re-design of national dementia support programs and services was announced by the Government on 25 January 2016. The co-designed reforms are based on the advice of stakeholders and experts received through the Ministerial Dementia Forums of 2014 and 2015 and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPMG" rel="nofollow">
         KPMG
        </a>
        ' s nationwide consultation and analysis of dementia programs commissioned by the Government in 2015. Outcomes of the redesign address many of the report' s recommendations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Importantly, the redesign included the engagement of a single national provider to deliver nationally consistent accredited dementia training and education to the aged care workforce and health care professionals across Australia. Accredited training in best practice care of people with behavioural and psychiatric symptoms of dementia is available free to eligible health professionals and care workers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Other key elements of service redesign include the establishment of the Severe Behaviour Response Teams (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SBRT" rel="nofollow">
         SBRT
        </a>
        ) and engagement of a single national provider to deliver the Dementia Behaviour Management Advisory Service (DBMAS) across all states and territories. The national DBMAS supports staff and carers in community, residential, acute and primary care settings with information, advice, assessment and short term case management interventions. Family carers, health professionals and aged care providers have access to 24 hour advice and support to improve the quality of life of the person living with dementia. The SBRT supports Commonwealth funded approved residential aged care providers requiring assistance with addressing the needs of people with severe and very severe BPSD.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A mobile workforce of multidisciplinary clinicians also provides locally delivered person-centred interventions, capacity building and resources for carers and organisations to improve skills in the care of people living with dementia in the longer term.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Ministerial Dementia Forum held in December 2016 focused on redesigning dementia consumer supports to ensure national consistency and regional and remote coverage.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        is now working with stakeholders on phase two of the redesign of national dementia support programs to develop an improved suite of dementia consumer supports for people living with dementia and their carers across the life-cycle of the disease.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government has also supported additional research and service improvement projects at a cost of more than $30 million through three rounds of the Aged Care Service Improvement and Healthy Ageing Grant Fund between 2012 and 2017. Projects address a range of priorities identified through the NFAD including improving dementia diagnosis and care in hospitals and primary care settings, delivering sensory experience interventions, reducing the use of antipsychotic medications in aged care facilities and development of tools and resources to manage and reduce behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In June 2016, the Government committed to establishing Specialist Dementia Care Units (SDCUs) across Australia to support residents with very severe BPSD.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition, the Australian Government has provided funding over three years from June 2016 to Dementia Australia (formerly Alzheimer' s Australia) to establish the Dementia Friendly Communities initiative, which is designed to help ordinary Australians better understand dementia. This educative, community awareness raising program aims to give people a greater understanding of dementia and the small things that can be done to make a real difference to people living with the condition. A national dementia-friendly community resource hub will also be developed, to enable communities to network, learn from other initiatives and provide the latest evidence and information on best practice approaches to increasing community awareness and support for people living with dementia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Aged Care Reforms
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government is implementing significant reforms to the delivery of aged care services for older people and their carers to ensure that Australia has the best possible system, which is sustainable and affordable. The reforms are consistent with the long term policy direction recommended by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Productivity Commission
        </a>
        in its 2011 inquiry into Care for Older Australians.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A number of review processes have also recently been conducted that investigated how aged care services are delivered and the protections for vulnerable older Australians.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 1 May 2017, the Government announced an independent Review of National Aged Care Quality Regulatory Processes (the Review).
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Review" rel="nofollow">
         The Review
        </a>
        was led by Ms Kate Carnell (AO), in conjunction with Professor Ron Paterson (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ONZM" rel="nofollow">
         ONZM
        </a>
        ), and examined Commonwealth aged care accreditation, monitoring, review, investigation, complaints and compliance processes. On 25 October 2017, the Minister for Ageing, the Hon Ken Wyatt AM, MP released the Review report. The Government is considering the Review recommendations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 15 June 2017, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Law_Reform_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Law Reform Commission
        </a>
        released its report into elder abuse, recommending tighter regulation and safeguards in relation to the use of restrictive practices in residential aged care. The Review panel considered these recommendations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government recognises that care for older people living with dementia is an integral part of the aged care system.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government is committed to the provision of quality services for all older Australians, including for people living with dementia, their families and carers, as well as research into dementia prevention and cure.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         The Committee
        </a>
        recommends that the Commonwealth create a new Medicare item number that encourages
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Practitioners" rel="nofollow">
         General Practitioners
        </a>
        , registered psychologists or other relevant accredited professionals, to undertake longer consultations with a patient and at least one family member or carer where the patient has presented with indications of dementia (para 2.42).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Noted
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government notes this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The second priority area for action under the National Framework for Action on Dementia 2015-2019 (NFAD) is "The need for timely diagnosis". Under this priority, the Government has committed to the following outcome: Australians will have access to skilled and knowledgeable health professionals who can support and provide an accurate and timely diagnosis of dementia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government recognises the important role that can be played by primary care providers in the identification, assessment and management of dementia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government' s view is that rather than creating a new Medicare Benefits Schedule (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MBS" rel="nofollow">
         MBS
        </a>
        ) item, it would be more appropriate to consider whether current items are effective through the Medicare Benefits Schedule Review and Primary Health Care Advisory Group, and also to improve doctors' awareness of existing MBS items that allow for cognitive screening and care planning.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Whilst there are no specific items for dementia diagnosis and intervention under the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) arrangements, a wide range of existing items may be used for these purposes. These include:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        On 22 April 2015, the Government, announced an MBS Review Taskforce. The Taskforce is undertaking a program of work to review all MBS items to ensure they are contemporary, reflect current clinical practice and allow for the provision of health services that improve health outcomes. Further, it will identify services that are considered unsafe or ineffective.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is anticipated that the Mental Health Services Clinical Committee will be established to review psychiatry,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        mental health and psychology MBS items.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government also established the Primary Health Care Advisory Group, led by Dr Steve Hambleton, former Australian Medical Association President. The Advisory Group investigated options to provide: better care for people with complex and chronic illness; innovative care and funding models; better recognition and treatment of mental health conditions; and greater connection between primary health care and hospital care. Following an extensive national consultation process and review of the evidence, the Advisory Group provided a final report to Government in December 2015.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In response to that report, as announced on 31 March 2016, the Government is providing funding for stage one of the establishment of Health Care Homes in ten Primary Health Networks (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHN" rel="nofollow">
         PHN
        </a>
        s) regions across Australia from 2016-17 through 2019-20. Under this model, eligible patients with chronic and complex health conditions will voluntarily enrol with a participating medical practice known as their Health Care Home. This practice will provide a patient with a ' home base' for the ongoing coordination, management and support of their conditions. The model moves away from current fee-for-service payments for these eligible patients except for routine health issues not related to their chronic illness.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 2
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth consider increasing funding for the Younger Onset Dementia Key Worker Program in order to provide support to all people living with dementia. The increased funding should also ensure that accurate data is collected for evaluation purposes (para 3.39).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Not Supported
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government does not support this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Priority four of the NFAD is "Accessing ongoing care and support".
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Younger Onset Dementia Key Worker Program (YODKWP) is transitioning to the National Disability Insurance Scheme (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        ). Transitioning to the NDIS will provide the opportunity for Dementia Australia to receive significantly more funding whilst providing services to eligible people with younger onset dementia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government' s priority is to ensure that the NDIS is structured to provide support to those who need it. The NDIS is designed to provide people with disability, their families and carers greater choice and control over the course of their lives, including the flexibility to make decisions about which disability services and supports they use. Evidence suggests that when people with disability are given greater choice and control over their services they achieve better life outcomes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Access rates for the YODKWP have not been high and performance statistics do not support expansion of the program. An evaluation of this program is currently underway and although initial reports suggest that the program has resulted in some good outcomes so far, it would be inappropriate to expand the program based on preliminary findings without the analysis of longer term, more meaningful data.

         NHMRC
        </a>
        ) and industry groups recently conducted an evaluation of current models of key workers for people living with dementia in Australia, including a systematic review of the evidence in Australia and internationally. The key findings from the evaluation supported the role of dementia support workers and identified a need to further explore ways to increase access to the role within consumer directed care. Trialling and aligning the model with Primary Health Networks was also recommended. Key findings are relevant to future policy development.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 3
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee recommends that each State and Territory develop dementia training facilities similar to the Perc Walkley Dementia Learning Centre in Victoria (para 3.40).

        The Australian Government notes this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Priority four of the NFAD is "Accessing ongoing care and support". The related action to which the Government has committed is: Support system wide, organisational and workforce awareness of BPSD together with evidence-based prevention and management strategies, including the provision of dementia friendly environments.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government recognises the role that the physical environment and design of the care setting plays on providing high quality care to people living with dementia. Noting environmental design as an emerging priority, the Government is committed to providing flexible funding for a range of different approaches. The Government also notes that the aged care industry and the community share a role in ensuring environments are dementia friendly.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In 2013-14 the jointly funded Commonwealth-Victorian Home and Community Care program provided one-off funding to Dementia Australia Victoria towards establishment of the Perc Walkley Dementia Learning Centre in Victoria. The Perc Walkley Dementia Learning Centre is a dementia learning facility which showcases dementia friendly design. The goal of the Centre is to provide education on how workplaces, homes and public spaces can become dementia friendly.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Centre" rel="nofollow">
         The Centre
        </a>
        creates a multi-sensory simulation using light, sound, colour and visual content to create a virtual reality experience at the Centre, which enables aged care and health care workers to be taken into the world of people living with dementia.

        The Australian Government funds the Dementia Training Program (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTP" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        ) to provide dementia-specific training to aged care, health care and other community providers and their staff in order to improve the care and wellbeing of people living with dementia. The DTP offers an environmental design workshop and consultancy for aged and healthcare services. A consultancy and resources specifically for the design, construction and maintenance of aged care facilities for Aboriginal and

The program provides service managers and their design consultants with the knowledge, resources and tools required to understand the effects of the built environment on the person living with dementia and modify the environment to promote well-being while reducing confusion and depression. The information is provided through education and on-site consultation and is available in each state and territory.

        The Government acknowledges the ongoing work of non-government organisations in improving environmental design. For example, Dementia Australia Victoria and HammondCare have both been involved in development of virtual reality dementia training technology which enables anyone to experience planned physical spaces from the perspective of someone living with dementia. The technology assists care staff, designers and builders to understand sensory challenges for a person living with dementia and design environments that are much more welcoming and less confronting.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government-funded DBMAS provider notes that environmental factors contribute to over 70 per cent of referred cases. To inform practice, the DBMAS provider can use portable virtual reality technology to educate staff about how sensory challenges contribute to behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia.

        The Government currently funds Dementia Australia New South Wales for a trial of a dementia-specific experiential learning program in hospitals. The program uses a train-the-trainer model to engage hospital staff in simulation exercises to see how life might be experienced by their patients with dementia. The program is an opportunity for staff to reflect on the effect their work practices can have on the behaviour of those they are caring for.

        The NHMRC Cognitive Decline Partnership Centre (the Centre) has developed Clinical Practice Guidelines and Principles of Care for People with Dementia (the Guidelines) in consultation with an expert multi-disciplinary Guideline Adaptation Committee convened by the Centre. The Guidelines provide recommendations for the diagnosis and management of dementia and are intended for use by staff working with people living with dementia in the health and aged care sectors. The Guidelines also inform GPs about the key entry points for support services for the person with dementia, including Dementia Australia, My Aged Care, Carers Australia and the Aged Care Assessment Teams.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Centre has also published Diagnosis, treatment and care for people with dementia: A consumer companion guide to the Clinical Practice Guidelines and Principles of Care for People with Dementia. This consumer version of the Clinical Practice Guidelines includes accessible information about the latest evidence on dementia as well as information about the full range of dementia services and support. It is available from: www.sydney.edu.au/medicine/cdpc/resources/dementia-guidelines.php. The guidelines and the consumer companion have both been promoted to GPs via the Primary Health Networks.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        GPs also have access to the HealthPathways program which is a web-based information portal supporting primary care clinicians to plan patient care through the primary, community and acute health care systems.

        Other activities undertaken by the Department of Health may also assist dementia patients and their carers to be aware of the supports available to them. This includes the establishment of Primary Health Networks (PHNs) which aim to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of medical services for patients, particularly those at risk of poor health outcomes, and improve coordination of care to ensure patients receive the right care in the right place at the right time.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        PHNs have undertaken their baseline needs assessments and prepared their 2016-18 Activity Work Plans which have informed their commissioning decisions from 2016-17. While there are no activities specifically devoted to dementia in PHNs' first Activity Work Plans (submitted in May 2016), a number of them give consideration to dementia within broader activities that are focused on aged care including falls prevention, medication management, advanced care planning, palliative and end of life care, and promotion of healthy ageing.

        Another important initiative was the launch of My Aged Care in 2013 and its expansion in 2015 to become a true gateway for consumers to have their needs assessed and where appropriate, be referred to government funded aged care services. My Aged Care now includes a central client record to facilitate the collection and sharing of information, holistic needs assessment through a national standardised assessment form, online referral management and web based portals for clients, assessors and service providers.
       </p>

        Given its prevalence amongst older people, the Government considers the provision of appropriate care and support of people with dementia, their families and carers to be core business for all providers of aged care (including respite care). To support this, the Government provides a broad range of training and resources in dementia care for the aged care sector, as outlined in other recommendations in this document.

       <p class="italic">
        The Government acknowledges the unique respite needs of people living with dementia and their carers, as well as the additional challenges faced by those living in regional and remote areas. Consequently, the Government currently funds a range of programs and initiatives that provide respite support for carers of people living with dementia.

        The CHSP provides a range of planned respite services for older people including flexible respite such as in-home respite and host family respite; cottage respite; and centre-based respite. Respite services provided through the CHSP are complemented by other respite services including emergency respite, which can be accessed through the Commonwealth Respite and Carelink Centres (

        In response to the growing need for planned respite services for frail older clients, the 2016 CHSP Growth Funding Round targeted planned respite services as a priority area across a number of Aged Care Planning Regions for identified client groups. Through this funding round, an additional $115 million has been made available to deliver additional aged care services, including an increased number of planned respite services.

          In respect of the government's repsonse to the Community Affairs Reference Committee's report,
          <i>
           Care and management of younger and older Australians living with dementia and behaviour and psychiatric symptoms of dementia (BPSD)
          </i>
          . I note that the government has taken more than 3Â½ years to respond to the 18 recommendations, with the report from this inquiry being tabled back on 26 March 2014. It's refreshing to finally get a report that the government has responded to, given that there are now more than 10 aged-care reports, reviews and strategies on the minister's table at this very moment. But, when you look at the government's response, none of the 18 recommendations are fully supported by those oppositeâ€”11 recommendations are noted, one recommendation is not supported at all and six recommendations are supported but only in principle. This is an interesting government response to this report.
         </p>
         <p>
          In 2017 there were an estimated 365,100 people in Australia living with dementia. This is expected to increase to almost 900,000 by 2050. Labor, on the other hand, has been proactive on this important issue. On 21 November this year the Leader of the Opposition,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Shorten" rel="nofollow">
           Bill Shorten
          </a>

          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
           University of Sydney
          </a>
          about the challenge of dementia. Labor knows that this is an urgent issue. A recent NATSEM report estimated that dementia costs Australia over $14 billion a year. The same report found that even a five per cent reduction in the number of people with dementia over the age of 65 could lead to savings of $120.4 billion in less than 40 years. One in three Australians born today will eventually be diagnosed with dementia. This year, for the first time, dementia is now the leading cause of death for Australian women. Within the next five years it will be the leading cause of death for all Australians. With statistics like these, we urge the government to do more when it comes to Australians living with dementia.
         </p>
         <p>
          The government now has a responsibility to provide quality services for older Australians and this includes people living with dementia and their families and carers. This report is another example of the government abrogating its responsibility when it comes to the aged-care portfolio. Given this government cannot fully support one recommendation in this report, is it really an indication that those opposite again will not act when it comes to caring for those Australians living with dementia?

           I take note of the government's response to the
           <i>
            Care and management of younger and older Australians living with dementia and behavioural and psychiatric symptoms of dementia (BPSD)
           </i>
           report. Senator Polley has just articulated that this report was tabled on 26 March 2014. This was a very significant and very important report because we found that people were being poorly treated, that people with complex behavioural issues and psychiatric issues associated with dementia were living with restraints, both physical and chemical, that they were in poorly designed facilities that did not accommodate them and that there were poorly trained staff who did not meet their needs. It was a very distressing, unsatisfactory situation.
          </p>
          <p>
           I chaired this inquiry. For a while after we tabled this report some aged-care providers actually rang me and said: 'How can we fix this? What can we do? Where would you suggest we go to get some help?' There are places where people can get support for addressing issues around dementia, particularly for people who are living in residential care, but it requires training, for a start. We actually visited the excellent training facility in Melbourne of Dementia Australiaâ€”it's not Alzheimer's Australia anymore. They took the senators on that site visit through as near a lived experience as you could get. They use technology that gives you a feeling of a cognitive impairment so that a carer, a paid staff member or a loved one can gain a sense of what somebody with dementia is living with when they have a cognitive impairment. You can't pretend that it's anywhere near what somebody with dementia would feel, but it at least gives an understanding of certain behaviours. How, in 2017, could we have circumstances where people living with dementia are living in care and in a situation where somebody has not been through at least that training? That's what we still have in 2017, 3Â½ years later. It is simply not good enough. It is simply not good enough that we have not moved far enough along with training and support to address people's needs.
          </p>
          <p>
           Senator Polley, I'm wondering how long you think it's going to take before we get a response to the inquiry into the aged-care workforce. Senator Polley's just indicated that she thinks it's going to be a while. We have seen the government's announcement of the aged-care taskforce, which is a step. It doesn't have worker representation, but it's a step. An aged-care workforce that looks after and supports somebody with a cognitive impairment or somebody with dementia requires particular training. The inquiry into the aged-care workforce also highlighted the absolute flaws in the training, supports and preparation of the aged-care workforce. It shows just how understaffed our aged-care services and supports are going to be into the future. So I certainly hope that the government responds in a more fulsome way and in a much quicker way to a workforce inquiry to ensure that we have a workforce that is trained to support people living with dementia, that we have residences that meet the needs of people living with dementia and that we address issues around both chemical and physical restraints.
          </p>
          <p>
           During this inquiry, we also visited a number of excellent care facilities where they are providingâ€”at no extra cost, folks, because they have to live within the means of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACFI" rel="nofollow">
            ACFI
           </a>
           paymentsâ€”a caring environment where they have almost eliminated the use of chemical restraints and do not use physical restraints. People are cared for in a non-clinical environment where they have access to the outdoors, access to chickens and caring for animals, access to sensory gardens and access to a workshop. There's no nursing station. This is within an aged-care facilityâ€”there's no nursing station. The nurses don't wear uniforms.
          </p>
          <p>
           Some of the residents there are ex-nurses and they go around and make everybody's beds every day, because in the past, before they adopted the new techniques, they had had problems with people going into other people's rooms. Then they very intelligently worked out that the residents were ex-nurses and they wanted to tidy up people's rooms and make their beds. So that's what they do every day. Other residents with past experience arrange flowers.
          </p>
          <p>
           That was the only aged-care facility where, when we had our hearing, we didn't have the relatives of the people in care, who were their former carers, complaining. They were glowing in the experiences of their loved ones in aged care. So it is doable. There is no excuse for these facilities not providing the sort of care that we would expect to receive if we were in those facilities or that we would expect our loved ones would receive in those facilities.
          </p>
          <p>
           I'm extremely disappointed that it has taken so long to respond to this report. Many of the recommendations, as Senator Polley has just articulated, are supported in principle. The report said:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           The committee recommends that the use of antipsychotic medication should be reviewed by the prescribing doctor after the first three months to assess the ongoing need.
          </p>
          <p>
           That was supported in principle, but then the government go on to talk about what they've been doing et cetera and don't actually support this fully or make sure it's implemented. It's just one example of the fact that we aren't seeing a strong enough response from the government to address this very significant issue, which, as was highlighted just a moment earlier by Senator Polley, is only going to grow. If we don't nail this issue now and make sure that we have a workforce that is properly trained to understand the complex needs and the complex behaviours of people living with dementia, this situation is only going to get worse.
          </p>
          <p>
           We need to address the issues about restrictive practices, about the overuse of antipsychotic drugs and the overuse of restraintsâ€”the similar situation to what we've reported before on restrictive practices being applied to people living with disability. We have people with disabilityâ€”particularly those living in residential institutionsâ€”who have also been subject to both physical and chemical restraints. If we don't start taking this issue seriously, we are going to have a very serious problem into the future. It's hugely disappointing that this wasn't addressed much earlier and that our recommendations weren't supported. We will continue to review very closely what the government does do about these recommendations. I seek leave to continue my remarks.
