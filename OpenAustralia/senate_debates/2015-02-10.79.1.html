                 For Australia to be involved in a groundbreaking program like this, to see those extraordinary young men—and their families—who have an amazing capacity for precise attention to detail, who are able to systematically process information, who have long concentration spans that make them ideal for and make them love work in information technology is actually quite rewarding. It is quite heartening to see that a collaboration like that, working on something like critical

                </p>
                <p>
                 They have settled in incredibly well. I think that they expected to be welcomed by the Australian parliament when I made these observations this afternoon, not trashed by those opposite in the way Senator Cameron and Senator Collins did. They have settled in really well. They did their induction and training with Hewlett Packard and then they came to work with us. They are incredibly bright; they are incredibly talented. They have very impressive academic records, but, unfortunately, they found it hard to get jobs in the routine workplace. This partnership has been able to assist them and their families.

                        The trainees and their families—their mothers, fathers and siblings who were there last week—had incredibly positive initial feedback. One small business owner and his wife reported that their son, who had gone to work in the

                        , was now not in the truck with the father, which was fantastic for the son. He was able to come home and talk about the socialising that he had done at work and talk about going to work on the train with his colleagues. Of course, it meant that his mother was back in the truck now, so she was not necessarily thrilled by that arrangement, but in family terms it was overwhelmingly positive. To see the trainees talk amongst themselves, to see them engage in this discussion and to see the enormous potential that this has for other young Australians with autism spectrum disorder—no matter where they are on the spectrum, in very many cases—to work in this environment that supports and understands them is an incredibly important step. I am very proud that the Department of Human Services has been able to play a role in this.

Over four per cent self-identify as Indigenous; over 45 per cent—and I am not sure whether or not this number includes me—are mature age workers 45 years old or over; and 25 per cent self-identify as being from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds.
