        I have an answer to a question from Senator Lambie that I took on notice yesterday in question time, regarding the matter of Ordinary Seaman Edward 'Teddy' Sheean. As so poignantly outlined by Senator Lambie yesterday, Ordinary Seaman Sheean was killed in action on 1 December 1942 while performing actions that displayed conspicuous gallantry. Sheean was the subject of a contemporary nomination process which resulted in a posthumous mention in dispatches for his actions in 1942. This award was reviewed by the Defence Honours and Awards Appeals Tribunal in its 2011 to 2013 valour inquiry, which recommended that no action be taken to award Ordinary Seaman Sheean a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Cross" rel="nofollow">
         Victoria Cross
        </a>
        or other further form of recognition for his gallantry or valour. The government accepted the recommendations of the valour inquiry in 2013.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Victoria Cross for Australia is Australia's highest decoration for gallantry and is the only award in the Australian honours and awards system that is approved by the sovereign. Clear government policy, informed by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Majesty" rel="nofollow">
         Her Majesty
        </a>
        the Queen's expressed views, would only allow the award of the Victoria Cross in light of compelling new evidence or in the case of manifest injustice. In 2019, the tribunal conducted a review of the valour inquiry's recommendation in relation to the Sheean award and subsequently reported to government. Having received confirmation last night and following up from Senator Lambie's question, I am able to advise the Senate today that the government's view is that the 2019 review by the tribunal did not present any compelling new evidence that might support reconsideration of the valour inquiry's recommendation. That is also my view, and that is also the view of Defence. It is a very difficult decision but, I believe, in the circumstances the right decision.
       </p>
       <p>
        I must emphasise that the outcomes of the government decision in no way detract from the service, the bravery and the sacrifice of Ordinary Seaman
