         (b) Work Order 2011/01 (Project and Program Management Framework Development and Implementation), and Work Order 2011/02 (Gateway Review) permitted subcontracting to Projects Assured.

        <p class="italic">
         The Centrelink ICT Services Deed of Standing Offer was established in 2007 following an open market tender procurement coordinated by Centrelink. CrimTrac is an FMA Act Agency able to 'piggyback' the arrangement. CrimTrac does this by requesting quotes from participating suppliers on the panel arrangement and placing a Work Order.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Requests for quotes to members of the Centrelink ICT Services panel were not advertised on AusTender, as it is not a requirement to do so.
