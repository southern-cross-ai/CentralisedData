        by leave—I wanted to take the opportunity to report to the Senate on some developments in the Victorian bushfire tragedy and some of the Commonwealth responses to that. People are obviously following these events on the news and it is a developing situation, but I thought it important that we update the Senate on where we are at in terms of the Commonwealth response. The Prime Minister is doing a similar thing in the House of Representatives.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
         Can I
        </a>
        firstly thank the Senate for giving me leave and for its cooperation with the government over the last few days in allowing us to respond to the bushfires and apply all government resources to those. The agreement to cancel question time was a good decision and I appreciate the cooperation we have had in relation to that. Certainly the country’s attention is properly focused on the bushfires, as is the attention of all members of parliament. I think we are all a bit uneasy about parliament proceeding in the middle of all this. It is obviously important that we show appropriate leadership, but I think all our minds are more focused on those developments than perhaps the day-to-day activities of the parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        Each day, as we have seen in the news on the fires, the tragedy has got worse. It is fair to say that there may still be more bad news to come. There are certainly people still at risk and many people yet to be located. The response of the nation has been nothing short of fantastic. As we have seen on the news, ordinary Australians have been doing whatever they can to support the victims, be it by donating clothes, driving up with supplies or donating. It has been an amazing response. There has also been a very strong response by corporate and sporting organisations in terms of cash or other generous donations and activity. We should all applaud the response of the organisations and the community more generally.
       </p>
       <p>
        Might I also say that the leadership of parliamentarians from all sides has done them great credit. This is not something that will probably be said outside this chamber but I think it is appropriate to acknowledge that all the local members I have seen, across the parties, have been supporting and representing their constituents in a magnificent way. They have shown great energy and empathy and they have been a great assistance and support to their communities. I would like to acknowledge that. I think Senator Ronaldson made the very good point yesterday that those people know their communities, they know their needs, capacities and strengths. I think the response and leadership of the local members, from all sides of parliament, has shown that they are really in touch with their constituencies. As I say, they probably do not get many plaudits from others on such occasions but I do support and acknowledge them.
       </p>
       <p>
        The crisis has moved to a new stage. There are now two immediate challenges confronting us. First of all, we must continue to fight the fires in the face of a situation that has unfortunately deteriorated in the last 24 hours—and great risks remain. We also must continue the enormous and difficult work of the recovery. In addition to the twin immediate challenges, the Commonwealth and Victorian governments are moving ahead with the long-term reconstruction efforts.
       </p>
       <p>
        The fire threat in north-eastern Victoria has increased overnight because of strong southerly winds. This morning the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Fire_Authority" rel="nofollow">
         Country Fire Authority
        </a>
        issued urgent alerts for the communities of Acheron, Cathedral Lane, Rubicon, Thornton-Taggerty Road and Bulls Lane, with an increase in fire activity in the Murrindindi-Yea area. The fires burning to the west side of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Range" rel="nofollow">
         Black Range
        </a>
        have picked up in the southerly winds and early this morning they were estimated to cover an area of approximately 100,000 hectares.
       </p>
       <p>
        The most recent report on the Bunyip Ridge fire indicates some improvement in the outlook for the communities of Gembrook. Nevertheless, alert levels for these communities remain high. The fire is burning in an area of approximately 25,000 hectares in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunyip_State_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Bunyip State Park
        </a>
        and the Bunyip State Forest and it has the potential to directly impact communities in that region.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fire activity also remains high in the Maroondah-Yarra Complex, in particular south-east of Toolangi and east and north of Healesville. The Kinglake Complex continues to burn and is currently estimated to be in excess of 116,000 hectares. Fire crews and Army engineers are working to construct control lines around the fire perimeter on the northern and western flanks.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        fire crews are also assisting in this area and remaining firefighters are actively patrolling and blacking out the perimeter of the fire line. Fires are continuing to burn in many other areas of the state, including Churchill, Jeeralang and Walhalla.
       </p>
       <p>
        The latest information from the front lines confirms the catastrophic scale of these fires. There are currently 181 confirmed deaths from the fires, with 570 injuries and 78 admissions to hospital. Many are still unaccounted for. This morning the Victoria Premier, Mr Brumby, indicated that in Marysville, for instance, up to 100 of the town’s 500-strong population may have been killed. I know there is a great deal of concern amongst some people to get back into the communities, but people need to understand that there are still real risks and also that there are areas where they have not completed the search for bodies and where they expect to perhaps have more bad news. It is clearly not appropriate to be letting people back in. I know some people are finding it hard to understand that decision, but it has been made for very good operational reasons.
       </p>
       <p>
        Up to 20 patients have been admitted to the major burns unit at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Alfred Hospital
        </a>
        . At the last count, 1,033 houses were reported to have been lost and at least 5,000 people remain homeless, and of course many of them have been left with nothing at all. It is estimated that about 450,000 hectares have been burnt out.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commonwealth" rel="nofollow">
         The Commonwealth
        </a>
        has obviously got all of its agencies deployed to do what they can. The four main agencies working with the Victorian CGRC on the immediate challenges are the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
         AFP
        </a>
        , the ADF, Centrelink and FaHCSIA. Other departments, like my own, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Immigration_and_Citizenship" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Immigration and Citizenship
        </a>
        , are providing staff and other resources as required to support them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over 460 ADF personnel have now been deployed to assist with the range of firefighting efforts. The Minister for Defence, Mr Fitzgibbon, has been on the ground there for the last day or two. We thank all our professional and reservist personnel for their exceptional efforts. ADF teams are providing direct assistance to those who have lost everything in the fires. They are fighting fires and they are providing relief for firefighters and emergency service personnel, who are doing a fantastic job.
       </p>
       <p>
        In relation to the immediate search and recovery effort, I can inform the Senate that the ADF has deployed a search task group of approximately 160 ADF Reserve soldiers headquartered at Kilmore. This group comprises four search teams to assist emergency management agencies to search through rough terrain on foot near Traralgon,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Andrews" rel="nofollow">
         St Andrews
        </a>
        , Flowerdale and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarra_Glen" rel="nofollow">
         Yarra Glen
        </a>
        . I am advised that the search teams deployed to Flowerdale have completed their work and are now preparing to deploy to work in the Kinglake area.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of us all I would like to thank all of the permanent and volunteer firefighters and emergency personnel and the interstate firefighters who have been coming in. Yesterday I issued a regulation change to provide for overseas firefighters to enter the country to assist. We have had offers from around the world. The Indonesian government has offered—and I think it is in process—to provide some of their victim identification teams, who I think we helped train after the Bali tragedy. They are now going to be providing support to us. And
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        firefighters are I think coming in on Friday. We have had offers from around the world of such expertise.
       </p>
       <p>
        Centrelink is providing direct assistance on the ground in fire affected areas through the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment of $1,000 per adult and $400 per child for those affected by the fires. There was a story in the
        <i>
         Australian
        </i>
        newspaper today from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Hughes" rel="nofollow">
         Gary Hughes
        </a>
        , who is a victim of the fire, having lost his house and had a very traumatic experience. He described what clearly was most inappropriate treatment when he was asked to produce identification to receive his relief payment after he had registered with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Cross" rel="nofollow">
         Red Cross
        </a>
        at the relief centre at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_Creek" rel="nofollow">
         Diamond Creek
        </a>
        . All of his personal documents had obviously been destroyed in the house fire. What happened to Mr Hughes should not have happened. We apologise for the distress it caused him. The government accepts the criticism.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are doing everything that we can to remove the obstacles for people in claiming emergency relief. The Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_Macklin" rel="nofollow">
         Jenny Macklin
        </a>
        , has been on the ground there all week listening to people’s concerns, comforting people and trying to make sure that all the Commonwealth agencies are responding to their needs. She has done a fantastic job. I pass on our best wishes to her.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is also the case that the Minister for Human Services, Senator Joe Ludwig, went down yesterday and spent the day there working with those agencies to try and make sure that we get that right, that all resources are available and that staff understand the requirements of the government. They are all working very hard. There will be problems and hiccups, but there is a tremendous effort going on from all those public servants there.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government has made it clear that if anyone needs cash immediately or needs money to be put into their account that can be done on the spot. We know that many people have lost everything and have no resources to turn to. The Australian government will do whatever it can to assist them with emergency relief. I know that Senator Ludwig is very much focused on making sure that that happens.
       </p>
       <p>
        I can also advise that the Commonwealth, alongside the Victorian government, is undertaking work through the Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction and Recovery Authority. The authority will be coordinating the bushfire recovery activity across Victoria. The Commonwealth and state governments will share equally the cost of rebuilding communities affected by the fires. The authority will coordinate activities of all local, state and Commonwealth agencies and community organisations. Senators would be aware that the authority will be headed by the outgoing
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Commissioner" rel="nofollow">
         Chief Commissioner
        </a>
        of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Police" rel="nofollow">
         Victoria Police
        </a>
        , Ms Christine Nixon.
       </p>
       <p>
        The authority will determine what immediate action is required, such as the provision of temporary government offices so residents can continue to access vital assistance from Centrelink and the Department of Human Services, temporary doctors clinics and pharmacies to ensure that prescriptions are written and are able to be fulfilled, and all of the other essential services. It is a mammoth task, but all government resources will be deployed towards the end. Our priority is to make these towns become functioning centres of community life again. We will need to make sure that power and water are reconnected and running properly so that residents can return to their homes—those lucky ones that remain that were miraculously spared. Where homes have been destroyed, the authority can ensure a smooth path for individuals and insurance companies, helping to quickly process claims. Then we will have to move on to the permanent rebuilding.
       </p>
       <p>
        Cutting through the bureaucracy and getting the job done is the direct charter of the authority. They will have the capacity to erect buildings and use personnel to get those towns back on their feet. The Prime Minister has committed the Australian government to rebuild these communities brick by brick and school by school. The Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction and Recovery Authority will coordinate that rebuilding and ensure that we cut through any of the bureaucratic barriers to make sure that the reconstruction begins as soon as possible. All that must be done in a way that takes into account what we have learnt from this terrible tragedy and plans for a safer future.
       </p>
       <p>
        In terms of insurance, the Assistant Treasurer,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Bowen" rel="nofollow">
         Chris Bowen
        </a>
        , met this morning with senior insurance industry representatives from the Insurance Council of Australia in order to get a clear assessment of how we can expedite claims and provide assistance to victims of the fires as soon as possible. The Assistant Treasurer advises that he made it clear to the Insurance Council that the government expects insurers to act in a compassionate manner and process claims as quickly as possible.
       </p>
       <p>
        People who have suffered a loss of property due to the bushfires should contact their insurer directly. They do not need to worry if their insurance documents have been lost or destroyed. The insurer will have the details. Some insurers have put in place special arrangements to assist claims. Insurers are allowing the lodging of home and motor insurance claims over the phone and providing up to $5,000 in emergency funds where required for food and clothing. All insurers are putting claims staff and assessors on the ground as soon as possible as access to affected areas is granted. The Insurance Council and its members have activated an insurance task force to coordinate assistance to those who have concerns or questions about their claims. The Master Builders Association has also joined the task force and will be assisting with a supply of tradespeople and supplies for the rebuilding efforts. The government will keep the lines of communication open to insurers throughout this period.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the days and weeks ahead, the Commonwealth and Victorian governments will be working systematically through the long-term challenges raised by these tragic bushfires. The enormity of the impact of this event is only just beginning to be understood by the Australian community. I know that government ministers are seeing implications throughout their work. Even in my portfolio of Immigration and Citizenship, we are seeing lots of impacts. We are trying to help people, be it through replacing citizenship certificates or providing other assistance, such as providing visas for overseas firefighters. All of government is focused on responding. Other departments are much more involved than many, particularly that of Senator Ludwig, who is Minister for Human Services. It is putting strain on our activity, but it is very much our focus and it highlights what a broad impact this has had on people. There are thousands of issues that now confront people, as well as the sheer tragedy of their immediate experience for those who have survived.
       </p>
       <p>
        Obviously, the focus is on rebuilding homes and communities, the redevelopment of the infrastructure and re-engaging and rebuilding local communities, including agriculture and the local small businesses. It is a huge task. We very much acknowledge the way that Australians from all walks of life have come together to offer their assistance and do practical things to support those who have lost everything, particularly those who have suffered the loss of loved ones. The response has been fantastic.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to acknowledge the support of all parliamentarians and the way that they have conducted themselves. We will attempt to keep the parliament informed of developments, but the rebuilding and reconstruction effort will obviously go on for years. Those who experienced the Canberra bushfires realise the huge ramifications of an event like this. And this is on a scale that we have never ever seen before. Assisting those people to rebuild their lives will present enormous challenges.
       </p>
       <p>
        I do not want to talk about this as if it is somehow in retrospect—the danger remains. There are still real threats to property and life, and that is obviously a huge priority and challenge for us at the moment. It is also true that we continue to discover the full extent of the loss of life and damage done already, and it will be a while before we know the full extent of that. All the indications are that there is still more very distressing news to come as we work through the remains of this most horrific fire.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank the chamber for its indulgence and indicate that the government will attempt to keep the Senate, the parliament and the community informed as things develop further.

         by leave—I briefly want to thank Senator Evans very much on behalf of the opposition for keeping the Senate informed on the latest developments of the bushfire tragedy in Victoria. I indicate the opposition’s ongoing full support for all that the government is doing at the Commonwealth level to assist with the recovery. I indicate our strong support for what we know from our years in government is an extremely professional and confident
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Public_Service" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Public Service
         </a>
         . As Senator Evans has indicated, they are involved in assistance on very many levels across the breadth of the Public Service. I thank him for his explanation of the circumstances surrounding Centrelink and for dealing with that. I think we all have to understand that these are unprecedented circumstances and that there will be difficulties and mistakes made. We acknowledge that, and we thank the government for its explanation and rectification of that issue.
        </p>
        <p>
         We join with the government in congratulating all Australians on what has been a typical but nevertheless fantastic response to this tragedy. At the expense of sounding parochial, I was watching the Australia-
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">

         yesterday and saw the response of my fellow South Australians. I think some $6 million was raised at that cricket match alone as a contribution towards the victims of these fires. Obviously, we join in expressing our heartfelt thanks to all those volunteers still out there fighting these ongoing fires in Victoria. Finally, we extend our prayers and best wishes to the families of the victims and also of course to the many who are suffering very badly in hospital from horrendous injuries; there is nothing worse than burns injuries. Our heartfelt wishes and prayers go out to them.

          by leave—I will be very brief. I endorse the remarks of both Senator Evans and Senator Minchin. Obviously, the thoughts and prayers of this chamber are with those people who are trying in any way they can to alleviate the pain and suffering that people are going through in Victoria. I acknowledge the work of people in the hospitals, especially the burns units. I am sure that this parliament will make every effort to bring about a process that, although it cannot take people back to the time before the fires, can show them that we have every sympathy and will make every effort to provide some sort of relief for the future.

           by leave—This nation is rising magnificently to respond to its citizens who have been through such terror, destruction, loss and now grief. No doubt, with that will come some anger and great distress for quite some time to come. I thank the government for the statement and for keeping us informed. I agree with the

           that all parliamentarians have been doing what they can, both directly and through support of the government, to get help to the victims of this still unfolding and horrible tragedy. For many of us, that includes staying at a distance while the government goes in on the ground and does its work. I say, as a human being as much as a parliamentarian—and I am sure you will agree with me—that our spirit wants to take us to the people in this tragedy, fold them in our arms, share with them what we have, lift their spirits and tell them, as the Prime Minister did yesterday, ‘We’ll be with you, brick by brick, as you build your lives again.’ We hope that that comes swiftly.

            volunteers from Marysville that were assisting down there on Saturday. They had less than 20 minutes to evacuate Marysville from when they realised they were under immediate danger to when Marysville went up in a fireball. A man has shared with us today the enormous guilt he feels in relation to the deaths of so many of his friends. So far, he and his wife know, from seeing their pictures in the

            , of nine of their friends from Marysville who perished in the fires. They both escaped separately to Alexandra and spent hours apart not knowing if each other had survived. They escaped in just their SES overalls. On Saturday night, a nurse from the hospital gave them the name of someone who offered them a room to sleep in. They are currently staying in someone’s bungalow in Coldstream. Unfortunately, they were among the people who went to Centrelink and got a letter saying that they did not

            properly. I appreciate the comments that you have made today and the efforts to rectify that particular situation. As SES volunteers, they felt they should have been able to do more. They were in positions of authority and responsibility. They felt they had failed and were having difficulty living with their guilt and grief. I stand with them today—as, I am sure, the parliament does—to say that they are heroes and that we are grieving with them as well.

             by leave—I endorse and support the remarks of my colleagues in relation to this. I thank the government for keeping the Australian people informed on this tragedy. This really is a case where the worst of times have brought out the best in people. We have seen the generosity, the resilience and the courage of people at the bushfires and we have seen the generosity of Australians, as a nation, standing together as one with those affected by this tragedy.
