          You obviously were not invited, Fergie—or you didn’t pay! In light of that claim, can the minister confirm that Liberal Party donors who paid $8,000 to attend the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Council" rel="nofollow">
           Federal Council
          </a>
          meeting were then invited to Kirribilli for a private drinks function on 1 June 2007? Doesn’t that mean that people who donated funds to the Liberal Party received, in return, drinks with the Prime Minister at
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirribilli_House" rel="nofollow">
           Kirribilli House
          </a>
          ? Isn’t it therefore the case that Kirribilli was used as a venue for a Liberal Party fundraiser?

           I note with interest the Labor Party’s fascination with this matter.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Liberal_Party" rel="nofollow">

           , the Prime Minister and the government are happy with the arrangements that have been entered into. A function was held on 1 June 2007 at
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirribilli_House" rel="nofollow">
            Kirribilli House
           </a>
           , and delegates to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Council" rel="nofollow">
            Federal Council
           </a>
           of the Liberal Party and business observers were invited to attend that function. The decision to hold that function was made taking into account previous advice from the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_the_Prime_Minister_and_Cabinet" rel="nofollow">
            Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet
           </a>
           that it is appropriate to hold such functions on a full cost recovery basis as long as the function itself is not of itself a fundraising function. The function was attended by 225 guests. The total function cost was $5,186.69, covering food, beverages, casual staff and associated hire charges. This cost of that function has been fully reimbursed by the Liberal Party. The food and beverage served at the function was purchased separately for the function and existing stock was not used. Audiovisual costs for the function were billed directly to the Liberal Party. The cost of full-time staff was not charged to the Liberal Party, as that cost would have been incurred in the normal running of the house. The full costs of that function were just over $5,000, and the Liberal Party has paid that amount in full.

            , I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for that answer and I ask that he formally table that advice. Can the minister confirm that officials from the Prime Minister’s department greeted Liberal Party donors as they arrived at

             Kirribilli House

            for the function? Were attendees served by Kirribilli’s taxpayer funded staff? Can the minister explain how using public servants as ushers for Liberal Party donors at a Liberal Party fundraiser meets the Public Service Code of Conduct?

             As the senator well knows, it is not the practice of any government to table internal advice from the Public Service to ministers, so we will not be tabling that advice. Of course, I would not mislead this Senate in reporting that advice. I am not aware that officials from the

             were greeting delegates—I must confess I was not at the function, so I have no direct knowledge of this matter—however, I would be very surprised. Those who are employed full time at

             no doubt were welcoming guests, or greeting guests at the door and telling them where to go, but I am sure that officials from
