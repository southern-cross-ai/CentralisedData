         What my answer would be is: do not be fooled by the fear campaign from those opposite; do not be fooled by them saying they are worried about a carbon price, when their policy would impose a higher cost on your family. Do not be fooled by Senator Edwards saying he cares about jobs, when he is lining up to take $1.5 billion out of the car industry. Why don't you go out to the northern suburbs of Adelaide and sell that, Senator? Why don't you go out to the northern suburbs of Adelaide and explain to the vehicle manufacturers and the workers in that industry why you want to walk away from the automotive sector? What I would also say to those

          South Australia

            I would say to them; don't be fooled by the fear campaign from those opposite, who peddle mistruths and falsehoods. We can grow our economy, including
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
             South Australia
            </a>
            's, with a carbon price. We can grow jobs. We can grow our incomes. That is what the modelling shows. We know that a price on carbon is critical to ensuring that we get investment into the clean energy jobs which will sustain our economy in the decades ahead. We know that we do not want to be left behind as the world increasingly moves to put a premium on low-carbon goods and services, and we have designed a plan which will ensure that we make that transition efficiently.
           </p>
           <p>
            Those opposite have a plan which will impose greater costs on working Australian—not something they care about—and they will give money to large polluters in the hope that they might do something with it. The reality is that the priorities of the coalition are not about jobs; the priorities of the coalition are all about the coalition's fear campaign.

              The Treasury modelling projects the economy of South Australia to grow by 23 per cent to 2020 alone and by 108 per cent by 2050, with employment increasing by 2020 with a carbon price—something those opposite simply do not want to hear. With a carbon price we can still have more jobs, more income, and grow our economy. The senator would perhaps do well to look at his party's position when it comes to blocking tax cuts for small business, including

                    . I suspect it is a question that should be asked in the
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">

                    n parliament rather than to me, but I would make this point. We have released an unprecedented amount of data and an unprecedented amount of modelling. We have been up-front with the Australian people about our package, including our tax cuts which you also oppose. It is quite interesting that those opposite are opposing personal tax cuts as well as company tax cuts. I would say this: if the senator wants to talk about coming clean, why is it that those opposite cannot bring themselves to come clean with Australians about the cost of their carbon policy? They cannot bring themselves to come clean with Australians about the $1,300 extra in tax that they will impose on working Australians. They will not come clean about that, so do not come into this chamber and lecture us about transparency, Senator.
