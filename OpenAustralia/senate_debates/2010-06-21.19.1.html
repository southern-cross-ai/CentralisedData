          Thank you. In view of the condemnation by the Rudd government’s own hand-picked principal adviser, how can the minister deny that the Rudd government is more focused on spin than substance when it comes to mental health?

           I thank Senator Boyce for her question. I know she has an ongoing interest in this area, and it was disappointing to see the spin in the last part of the question. The government thanks Professor Mendoza for his services as chair of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Advisory_Council" rel="nofollow">
            National Advisory Council
           </a>
           on
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_Health" rel="nofollow">
            Mental Health
           </a>
           over the last few years. The government appreciates the advice he has provided us during his time and his strong commitment to improving mental health services in our community. We agree with Professor Mendoza that there is much more work to be done in improving mental health services in Australia. The Prime Minister, Minister Roxon and I have made that clear on a number of occasions.
          </p>
          <p>
           However, the minister and I do reject Professor Mendoza’s assertion that the government has no commitment to mental health. The structural reforms agreed to as part of the historic
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
            COAG
           </a>
           agreement in April this year, particularly in primary care, lay a strong foundation for further reform in mental health. The 2010 budget includes $175 million for mental health services, focusing on improving services for young people through new investments and programs such as headspace. This is entirely consistent with the national advisory council’s recommendations. Of course, we do wish Professor Mendoza well in his future endeavours, but the government is doing proactive work in mental health. The government is committed to ensuring Australia has a sustainable and effective mental health system. As I indicated, $175.8 million was announced in the budget to improve our mental health system—

            , I ask a supplementary question. Is the minister also aware of comments about the mental health system made by the Australian of the Year, Professor Patrick McGorry, who stated:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            The system is absolutely on its knees … We have a famine-like situation and the mental health system is getting the scraps from the table.
           </p>
           <p>
            If the minister can reject the comments of this outstanding mental health expert, what steps are the government taking to fix this appalling situation?

                This government—and I mentioned this in my answer to the first question—is committed to ensuring Australia has a sustainable and effective mental health system. Quite frankly, we call on the opposition to in fact look at our record and agree that we have made significant commitments in this area. The $175.8 million announced in the budget to improve our mental health system now includes $78.4 million over four years to deliver up to 30 new headspace sites around Australia. It provides—

                   We also expanded the telephone and web based support for services to young people. This will provide support for an additional 20,000 young Australians each year. It is an important initiative. It is disappointing that the opposition (a) do not want to hear it and—

                     Quite frankly, the opposition have not been listening to our excellent record on providing assistance to this area of need. The government are committed to providing health. We have $58.4 million over four years which we directed to deliver care packages to better support up to 25,000 people with severe mental illness. That is 25,000 more than the opposition contemplated. It will be delivered through access to allied psychological services arrangements. In addition, there is $25.4 million over four years to expand the early psychosis prevention and intervention centre model, building on its successful implementation in Victoria. It is a shame those opposite want to criticise rather than support the work that is being dealt with in this area. All they want to do is—
