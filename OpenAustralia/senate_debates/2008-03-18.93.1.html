        My question is addressed to Senator Evans representing the Prime Minister. It follows on from his discussion before about indefensible actions. I refer the minister to media reports today that the

         I thank the senator for his question, although obviously it is fairly loaded. As I indicated yesterday in the chamber, the attitude I take to this matter is that if there are issues of concern that the senator or others hold, they ought to report those to appropriate authorities. If there are issues about criminal activity, they ought to take those to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
          AFP
         </a>
         or other police authorities. If there are issues about concerns about electoral returns, clearly that is a matter for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEC" rel="nofollow">
          AEC
         </a>
         . And if, as you say—and I do not know whether or not this is right, but you claim it and I take it on face value—amended returns have been filed with the AEC, clearly the matter is before the AEC—because they now have an amended return with which they have to deal. If there is any other information you wish to raise, you ought to make it available to the AEC. Clearly, it is not for me in this parliament to arbitrate on these matters. There are appropriate authorities—be they the electoral commissions at state or federal levels, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Federal Police
         </a>
         or state police—that can investigate any concerns. If any of the senators are concerned, they ought to take those complaints to the appropriate authorities.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Given your attempts yesterday and again today to downplay the seriousness of these matters and in light of today’s revelations, why would the Australian community have any confidence that you are serious about your claims of openness and transparency?

           I thank the senator for his supplementary question. I would remind him of responses that ministers of the previous government used to give on some of these issues, which were to say that it would be inappropriate for us to intervene in a process where there are appropriate authorities. You would rightly criticise me if I were seen to be interfering in the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEC" rel="nofollow">
            AEC
           </a>
           ’s role in investigating these things. It is clearly a role for the AEC. If there are amended returns, they will be actively considering those issues. If there are issues of criminality, they ought to go to the appropriate authorities. There is no way I should be involved; there is no way I am involved; and if you have concerns, you ought to take them to the appropriate authorities.
