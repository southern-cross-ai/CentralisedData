       <p class="italic">
        (ii) recognised that under section 15 of the Constitution an appointment to a vacancy in the Senate may be delayed because the Houses of the Parliament of the relevant state are adjourned but have not been prorogued, which, on a strict construction of this section, prevents the Governor of the state making the appointment; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii) recommended that all state parliaments adopt procedures for casual vacancies to be filled expeditiously within 14 days after notification of the vacancy, including by recall if necessary;
