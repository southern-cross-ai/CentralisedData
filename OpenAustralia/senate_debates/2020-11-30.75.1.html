        plane to the tune of $4,300 an hour to interview for his next job. What does the minister say to the nearly 37,000 Australians stranded overseas who are watching a former minister of the Morrison government fly around at taxpayer expense while they remain stranded overseas and are likely to miss Christmas with their families?

         Let me firstly deal with returning Australians, and then I'll return to the issue of Mr Cormann and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
          OECD
         </a>
         . In relation to returning Australians, it is well known that the prime constraint in relation to getting more people into Australia is the quarantine facilities and their availability within Australia. Our government thanks the states and territories for working with us in relation to increasing the numbers of quarantine places. We are thankful for the fact that, working with the states and territories, we've been able to grow the number of returning Australians on a regular basis. And we welcome the fact that when Victoria is able to again welcome returning Australians and house them in hotel quarantine then we will be in a position to see a further growth, from 5,600 currently processed to around 5,700. This is about—

          Those opposite seem to think hotel quarantine is an easy, safe thing and we can just pile more and more and more and more people in and there is no consequence to it. Well, I think the people of Victoria have seen that there is a consequence to it and the people of

            We are absolutely working closely with the states and territories. We've put ADF troops on the line to work with them. We have grown the number of places.

             Senator Wong, on numerous occasions there I was calling senators to order. This will become a very miserable two weeks if people don't have some basic decency so that I may hear answers for inevitable points of order. You're quite right, Senator Wong; Senator Birmingham does have a very strong voice. I still had trouble hearing him. Senator Keneally, a supplementary question?

              Mr Morrison defended the $4,300 an hour spent on a private plane, saying:

             <p class="italic">
              If Mathias was flying around on commercial planes, he would have got COVID. The risk of that was extremely high.
             </p>
             <p>
              Can the minister explain to the nearly 37,000 stranded Australians why Mr Morrison believes it's acceptable for them to fly commercially, at hugely inflated prices, and face the extremely high risk of contracting COVID-19 but it's not okay for a former member of his government?

Having decided to field a candidate for this position, Australia intends to campaign to win. That's what's important—to actually make sure that, having put Australia out there to win, we get on and do so. We are supporting this candidacy. We are doing so because it will help Australia in the long term to influence the result—

                    We have absolute sympathy for the plight of many Australians overseas, and it is why we are working to increase those quarantine places, put in place more supported fights and provide targeted assistance in a range of different ways. In relation to support for candidacies, we think this is a thing Australian governments consistently should provide. Indeed, if we look back, I can see that

                       Senator Keneally, resume your seat! If you want to keep showing this amount of disrespect to the chair on the first day of the final fortnight, it's going to be a very slow question time as I constantly interrupt questions and answers. I do ask, while it is a very vibrant chamber, for people to at least heed me and pay a little bit of respect to the chair when I'm calling people to order.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       On the point of order, Senator Keneally, your question contained a number of pejorative phrases in terms of quoting people. When questions contain pejorative phrases, I'm listening carefully. In comparison, for example, the first question asked today was very specific and there was no latitude for the minister to stray. But, when questions contain politically loaded phrases, I don't think it's out of order for a minister to be able to respond in kind. That said, this was a quotation and not an assertion on your behalf. I accept that. I'm listening carefully to the minister's answer. He has 15 seconds remaining to address the question.
