           Labor would ask that the question be put separately on (a) and (b) and indicate that we will be supporting clause (a) of the motion but we oppose clause (b). That is largely due to issues of the imputations that it places on members of this place and of the other chamber. Really, it's just a stunt motion designed specifically to distract from the deaths of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
            Indigenous Australians
           </a>
           in custody and the overrepresentation of Indigenous Australians in our justice system. But certainly the (b) clause of the motion does pass judgement and negative imputations on members in this place and of the other and, as such, we think it's disorderly and probably out of order.

            I'll take that as a point of order as well. Senator Gallagher, I read (b). I don't, given the language that has been allowed, regularly in this chamber by the chair and by the mood of the Senate—I wouldn't consider any of the language in (b) to be contrary to the standing orders and, if it was, I think we would find I would be ruling a lot more comments across the chamber out of order. If the Senate would like to encourage me to do so, I am in their hands. The question now is that clause (a) of motion 600 be agreed to.
           </p>
           <p>
            Question agreed to.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now the question is that clause (b) of motion No. 600 be agreed to.
           </p>
           <p>
            Question agreed to.
