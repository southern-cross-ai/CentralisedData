        Wait for it, Senator Macdonald; here it comes. When will the minister comply with this Senate's previous order for production of documents and release the final text of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement so parliament and the Australian people can scrutinise this secret deregulation agenda prior to signing by cabinet?

          , on a point of order: I understand that this is a robust chamber, and interjections, although disorderly, are not unknown. But there is a difference between interjections and Labor frontbenchers, including the leader, yelling at members of the government while they are trying to answer questions, and I would ask you to enforce the standing orders.

            I do thank Senator Brandis for that intervention. But the day I need protection from Senator Carr will be the day I am scared by a limp lettuce leaf! As I was saying in relation to the developments in the United States, which Senator Whish-Wilson referred to in his question, these are always a matter of great cut and thrust in both domestic and international politics. The circumstances in the United States are no exception from that exercise, the highly political exercise, of cut and thrust that is associated with these matters.
           </p>
           <p>
            The trade and investment minister here in Australia, Mr Robb, has gone to great lengths to engage with members of the parliament, including extending an offer to Senator Whish-Wilson—an offer which was taken up by other senators and other members of the parliament in this chamber—to view the material that is available in relation to the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Others in the parliament have taken that up. I understand Senator Whish-Wilson chose not to. That is, of course, his choice and a matter for him and a matter for the Greens. It is not a matter for the government. The government made the offer. It was not taken up by Senator Whish-Wilson. There are other members who did avail themselves of the opportunity. We of course remain hopeful that the relevant legislation will ultimately pass, which will provide the momentum we need to conclude the negotiations. The trade minister has made that quite clear—and I reiterate his remarks.

We do not intend to sign up to any rules that are against the national interest and that are not fair and equitable to all Australians. ISDS itself is not new. We currently have ISDS arrangements with 29 economies. Four of those are

              s; 21 are investment treaties. We have always said that we will consider ISDS on a case-by-case basis, which we are now doing. As I understand it, in August 2014 the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee agreed with the case-by-case approach for the inclusion of ISDS in free trade agreements—a case-by-case approach.

               , I ask a further supplementary question. Debate in the United States is also currently focused on the trade adjustment assistance package to support workers who lose out from trade agreements. The model you released yesterday said your three partnership agreements will cause manufacturing output in Australia to decline by around $4 billion. This would include declines in Australian manufacturing of metal products, transport equipment, electronic equipment and machinery. When you pass ChA

                FTA
               </a>
               with the help of Labor, will you institute a structural adjustment package to support thousands of Labor's manufacturing workers who will lose their jobs as a result of this agreement?

                   Two comments: firstly, your question was borderline as to being a supplementary to the primary question. Secondly, the minister has only been on her feet for half the time; she has half the time left to answer the question.

                    In relation to jobs issues that the senator has referred to, I have a small amount of information here. But I think it is probably an idea for me to take the rest of that question on notice, and I will come back to the Senate.
