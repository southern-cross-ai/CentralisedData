       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In his July 2011 report of the independent review of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Capital_Authority" rel="nofollow">
         National Capital Authority
        </a>
        , Dr Allan Hawke commented that, ‘at a combined state and local government level, representation in the ACT is 1:14,285 compared to Tasmania at 1:1,110 and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        at 1:685.’ The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Government
        </a>
        agrees with the view of Dr Hawke and other constitutional experts that ACT citizens are significantly under represented today in comparison with the rest of Australia and that the year in which Canberra celebrates its Centenary is an appropriate time for this to be remedied.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To ensure that citizens of the ACT are not disadvantaged by their under representation and to ensure robust and accountable democratic processes in the ACT, including a high standard of parliamentary debate, a legislative program covering a range of complex issues and an active committee process, there is a compelling case for increasing the size of the Assembly as soon as practicable.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Assembly" rel="nofollow">
         The Assembly
        </a>
        is a mature parliament and it is the view of the Australian Government that it is appropriate that it takes on the responsibility for both determining the number of members needed to ensure its efficient functioning and the mechanism with which the size of the Assembly is altered.

        EXPORT FINANCE AND INSURANCE CORPORATION AMENDMENT (FINANCE) BILL

       <p class="italic">

       <p class="italic">
        Amendments to the
        <i>
         Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Act 1991
        </i>
        (EFIC Act) are required to implement a 2012-13 Budget decision.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The EFIC Act will be amended to:

       <p class="italic">
        The 2012-13 Budget included a revenue measure requiring EFIC to pay a $200 million special dividend from excess capital reserves to the Government in 2012-13.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill needs to be introduced and passed in the 2013 Autumn sitting period to enable the EFIC Board to make the special dividend payment by 30 June 2013. A revenue gain of $200 million will not be realised in 2012-13 if the bill is not dealt with in the 2013 Autumn sittings.

        EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS AMENDMENT BILL
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Purpose of the Bill
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This bill delivers on a 2012-13 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (MYEFO) decision to strengthen the focus of the Export Market Development Grants (EMDG) scheme to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asian" rel="nofollow">
         East Asian
        </a>
        , frontier and emerging markets. The bill will amend the EMDG Act to reduce the number of grants payable for marketing expenditure in the United States,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_and_the_European_Union" rel="nofollow">
         Canada and the European Union
        </a>
        to the applicant’s first five grants, and to extend the maximum number of grants payable to eight (up from seven) for all other markets.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This change brings the EMDG scheme more in line with Austrade’s broader trade priorities, including its new emphasis on frontier and emerging markets, and the Government’s
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Century" rel="nofollow">
         Asian Century
        </a>
        policy agenda.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill also seeks to change the way EMDG administrative expenditure is determined to bring this aspect of the program more in line with other grants based programs. The bill will transition from an administrative budget that is set in legislation as a proportion of overall EMDG program funding to one set through a Ministerial Determination.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Reasons for Urgency
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Delaying passage of this bill would cause unnecessary uncertainty for small businesses which need time to plan for the new eligibility arrangements which become operational on 1 July 2013. Gaining passage in the Autumn sittings would give small businesses time to plan their 2013-14 marketing strategies and for Austrade to promote the new rules.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The MYEFO decision and associated policy changes in this Bill will support $25 million in savings per annum across the forward estimates, including in 2012-13.

        The amendments are in direct response to recommendations made in the Post Implementation Review of the VET FEE-HELP Assistance Scheme Final Report September 2011 and extensive stakeholder consultations. The proposed amendments give effect to a number of measures to enhance and strengthen the quality and accountability frameworks underpinning FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP. Specifically, the enhancements strengthen suspension, revocation and compliance actions to improve protection of students and public monies. The proposed amendments also provide for more efficient administrative arrangements for approved providers.

The redesign measures incorporate Government commitments made under the 2012 National Partnership Agreement on Skills Reform and are consistent with the regulation impact statement (No. 13621). A delay in the amendments will impact on initiatives to improve provider and student participation in FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP.

        This Bill establishes the framework for the National Disability Insurance Scheme and the National Disability Insurance Scheme Launch Transition Agency (the Agency). This will enable the scheme to be launched, and the Agency to operate the launch, in five sites across Australia from July 2013.

       <p class="italic">
        Passage of this Bill in the 2013 Autumn sittings is necessary for the scheme to be launched from mid-2013, as announced and now widely anticipated. This primary legislation needs to be enacted before important operational matters can be put into place through subordinate legislation well ahead of the launch date. These formal processes are necessary for key launch activities such as employing and training staff of the Agency, and finalising communications to stakeholders and groups representing potential participants and their families and carers.
