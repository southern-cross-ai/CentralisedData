        My question is for the Minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme, Senator Reynolds. I refer to reports of the tragic death of 23-year-old Liam Danher, who died waiting for a seizure mat. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        repeatedly rejected Liam's request for a seizure mat over the course of an 18-month long
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAT" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        battle. His family say a $445 seizure mat would have saved his life. Why was Liam's seizure mat rejected? How many thousands of taxpayer dollars did the Morrison government spend on legal advice and lawyers to deny Liam his $445 seizure mat?

         I thank the senator for that question. That is a very tragic case, and I have been in contact with Liam's father, who I will be meeting at his convenience. I am still seeking further information on his case. It is complex. The trustee is also involved. So I'm in the process of getting further information. In the first instance I can discuss the matter with his father and then provide more information, as it is appropriate to do in individual cases.

           Could you answer the question about what you spent in legal costs? The seizure mat Liam Danher died waiting for was recommended by three different allied health professionals, a neurologist and an independent assessor, as I'm sure you're aware if you've spoken with Liam's father. Why then did the National Disability Insurance Agency still deny Liam the support he needed?

              As you say, Minister, the death of any child is tragic. This was an avoidable death if he had received the support. Why did the National Disability Insurance Agency contact the grieving Danher family requesting urgent quotes for the very seizure mat that would have saved their son Liam's life a week after his death? You've contacted the father, Mr Danher. Did you apologise when you contacted him? If yes, when did you do that—in that phone call? If not, why haven't you apologised?
