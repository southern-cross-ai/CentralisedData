        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Birmingham. Before the horror 2019-20 bushfire season, Mr Morrison ignored warnings from experts and from former fire chiefs that Australia was unprepared for the dangers. Overnight, the Intergovernmental Panel on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">

        has warned:

       <p class="italic">
        The intensity, frequency and duration of fire weather events are projected to increase throughout Australia …
       </p>

        I ask: will Mr Morrison ignore this warning too?

         The Prime Minister has already publicly responded to the release of the Intergovernmental Panel on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
          Climate Change
         </a>
         's sixth report. The Prime Minister has acknowledged the importance of the report in continuing to inform Australia's efforts in delivering emissions reductions—our successful efforts, as a nation, in delivering emissions reductions—and the importance of unified global action in dealing with emissions.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government looks forward to the opportunities that will be provided by the conference of the parties at Glasgow later this year to discuss the type of progress that is being made in Australia and around the world and the commitments for the future. We look forward to the fact that we can talk about Australia's emissions reductions, some 20 per cent emissions reductions since 2005.

          I hear the interjections from those opposite, saying, 'How embarrassing!' By comparison, our 20 per cent stands alongside a one per cent reduction in Canada, a 10 per cent reduction in Japan, a four per cent reduction in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
           New Zealand
          </a>
          or a 13 per cent reduction in the United States. I make those comparisons not to criticise any of those nations but to highlight for those opposite and those who, in the debate in Australia, seek to paint a proposition that Australia somehow does not achieve emissions reductions that in fact our countries has. Our country has done so, in part, due to the motivation of the Australian people as well. One in four Australian households have rooftop solar, the highest rate of uptake in the world. Last year, Australia saw some seven gigawatts of renewable energy capacity installed in our country, nearly eight times faster than the global average per person. It is this momentum that we intend to continue to pursue, and it is absolutely our commitment to make sure we continue to meet and beat those targets in the future.

             The answer to that is no. As I said in the primary answer, the Prime Minister has already responded to the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPCC" rel="nofollow">
              IPCC
             </a>
             report in a press conference earlier today, and, as I outlined, the government takes seriously the challenges of addressing global climate change. We take it seriously as a government, and it's why we're investing some $20 billion on low-emissions technologies over the next decades, with $1.6 billion committed just through this 2021-22 budget. It's why, during the Prime Minister's recent visit overseas, he signed partnership agreements that now see us in partnership arrangements with Singapore, Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom to deliver the low-emissions technologies that the globe needs to be able to deliver and achieve net zero emissions. The 2021-22 budget particularly dedicated $565 million to progress international research projects, knowing that those international projects of cooperation are the things that will actually deliver the technological changes to get the job done.

                 What the Prime Minister will do and what the government will do is to continue to get on with implementing our policies that are making a difference in terms of reducing Australia's emissions. What the Prime Minister and the government will do—which is what you asked me, Senator Wong—is make sure we continue to pursue the policies that are achieving the downwards trajectory in Australia's emissions and that we invest in the technologies that are necessary—our Technology Investment Roadmap with its stretch targets to make clean hydrogen affordable, not just for Australia but around the world—

                            Thank you, President, and, if you had anticipated that my point of order would be on relevance, you would be entirely accurate. This was an extremely narrowly scoped question, and it didn't go to the brave protesters raising really important climate issues at the front of

                             Order! Given the damage done to the building, Senator McKim, I'll assume you're talking about a protest, rather than an illegal act. Senator Hume was only speaking for seven seconds. I'm reluctant to call a minister before the first full stop in their answer, Senator McKim, but you've reminded the minister. I call Senator Hume to continue.

On 27 May 2021 the Federal Court delivered a document declining to grant an injunction preventing the Minister for the Environment from approving the Vickery extension project. On 8 July 2021 the Federal Court made final orders and provided further reasons in the matter. The court declared that the Minister for the Environment owed a duty of care—

                                            Just on the point of order: whilst interjections are of course always disorderly, sometimes they can help to clarify matters in the chamber. When Senator Hume started to reference the case and posed it in the question of 'I assume this case is what the question is referring to', I heard cries of 'yes' coming from the

                                             I'm sorry; I can't take points of order remotely under the provisions for remote participation, Senator Thorpe. My apologies. On the point of order: when Senator Hume did reference that case I definitely did see nods and hear acknowledgements of 'finally' from part of the chamber that happens to be down your end, Senator McKim. Given that this matter is in the public domain, I can't instruct a minister how to answer the question and I believe in this sense she is being directly relevant by turning to this particular issue. There's an opportunity to debate the answer after question time, but she is being directly relevant. Senator Hume.

                                              Senator McKim, the court declared that the Minister for the Environment had a duty to take reasonable care to avoid causing personal injury or death to young people in Australia arising from emissions of carbon dioxide to the earth's atmosphere in determining the Vickery extension project. But, on 16 July 2021, the Minister for the Environment filed a notice of appeal and is seeking an expedited hearing for that.

                                              The Minister for the Environment and the government take very seriously their responsibilities under the act to protect the environment and, in doing so, the interests of all Australians. But, as the matter is before the court, it would be inappropriate to comment on this case any further.

The notice of appeal simply raises a point of legal argument. Some of the factual findings that the judge made were not based on the evidence before him.
