        My question is to Senator Ronaldson, the Minister representing the Minister for Industry. On what date did the government receive the business case from Holden outlining the co-investment the company required to maintain its manufacturing operations in Australia? Did that business case confirm the company needed less than $150 million a year to guarantee continued manufacturing until the middle of next decade?

         I am not aware whether there was a business case delivered, and quite frankly I am not prepared to concede that Senator Carr is right or wrong. I have no further comment to make.

           I am unaware of whether the Prime Minister has met with them. That is a question that the Minister representing the Prime Minister might be able to answer. What I do know is that Minister Macfarlane met on a number of occasions with Holden. I understand, indeed, Minister Macfarlane will be meeting with Toyota.
          </p>
          <p>
           But I suppose the real question here is: did Senator Carr, when he was the industry minister, speak to Holden prior to the cabinet meeting on 16 July, when he imposed a $1.8 billion slug on the automotive industry with the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBT" rel="nofollow">
            FBT
           </a>
           ? Did he indeed go to the industry and say, 'I am reducing or slashing the green innovation fund'? Did he go back and discuss any of his $1.5 billion reductions with those companies?

I ask that you return the minister to the question.

                   Order! I have ruled on a previous point of order where I drew the minister's attention to the question—that the minister should address the question. The minister needs to address the question, with 19 seconds remaining.

                    . I am terribly sorry if it was not implicit in my initial answer that I did not accept the premise, and I suppose I should have said so. But what I do know is that under Minister Carr, on 16 July this year, he went to a cabinet meeting and let down the workers of this country.
