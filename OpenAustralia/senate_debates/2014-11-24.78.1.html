           and they build a number of diesel electric submarines, predominantly exported into our region, into India and Malaysia. French sonars are par excellence. Accordingly, it would be very surprising if my Prime Minister having Thales, one of our biggest defence exporters of sonar components, from Rydalmere in Sydney, if they did not discuss submarines and submarine construction. The point is, we have another of our companies here which have a connection with France—

             So it would be very logical and proper if the Prime Minister, in discussing maritime and French-Australian relations, was to discuss submarine sonars and the very fact that we had a submarine program to be unfolded in Australia in the next several years. I am sure he would also have said, 'We're cleaning up one hell of a mess left to us by the Labor Party.' They talk about the ABC cuts—4.5 per cent over five years. They took 10 per cent out of the defence budget in one year.

               It may be surprising to know that I was not there. So while I know that you would be fascinated to know what the discussion was between the President of the United States, the Prime Minister of Japan and the Prime Minister of Australia, it was a private discussion and I am sure to canvassed many important regional security issues. I cannot help you, Senator, because I was not there. Indeed, if you had read the article property and done any homework at all, you would have known I was not there and could not give you an appropriate answer.

Can the minister explain exactly who is running a Australia's biggest-ever defence procurement program—staff in the Prime Minister's office or the Minister for Defence? Is it not time the minister took control of his portfolio and announced a competitive tender so that all Australians can be confident we are getting the best submarine at the best price?

                 We are running this program, but if you are concerned it is taking some time, let me tell you in your shadow minister's own words why it is taking time. He told the submarine institute recently something I would like to highlight: '… significant work done on the project by Labor. We put $214 million on the table'. Of that $214 million put on the table in 2009, only $60 million as been spent. Oh dear! He then went on to say, 'We ruled out a
