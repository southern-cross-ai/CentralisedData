        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Earlier this week I met with representatives of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micah_Challenge" rel="nofollow">
         Micah Challenge
        </a>
        , which is a global alliance of church and faith based aid agencies. For decades it has been agreed within the international community that one of the key measures essential to eradicate extreme global poverty is for wealthy nations to provide just 0.7 per cent of gross national income to overseas aid. Currently Australia provides just 0.32 per cent with a commitment to 0.5 per cent by 2015. The importance of such an increase cannot be underestimated. For instance, a 2008 report
        <i>
         Make poverty history
        </i>
        estimates that if an additional $740 million was provided to health services in our region this could save 240,000 child lives, 260,000 maternal lives and 115,000 people, who would otherwise die from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS" rel="nofollow">
         AIDS
        </a>
        and other diseases. My question is: will the government commit to increasing our foreign aid to 0.7 per cent of gross national income as a matter of urgency?

         I thank Senator Xenophon for his question. I commence my answer to Senator Xenophon, through you
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
          Mr President
         </a>
         , by indicating that Australia strongly supports the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals" rel="nofollow">
          Millennium Development Goals
         </a>
         and is committed to helping developing countries attain them, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. In 2008-09 Australia will provide an estimated $3.7 billion in official development assistance. In practical terms this will mean greater investments in key
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDG" rel="nofollow">
          MDG
         </a>
         sectors such as health, education, water and sanitation needs and the environment. The government is working closely with other partners to raise awareness and achieve the Millennium Development Goals.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micah_Challenge" rel="nofollow">
          Micah Challenge
         </a>
         specifically is playing an important role in Australia and globally on raising awareness of poverty, and the actions of the governments, churches and citizens can help achieve the Millennium Development Goals.
        </p>
        <p>
         This week I had a delegation from Micah visit my office, and I am sure they visited the offices of many senators during their annual campaign to encourage a greater focus on overseas aid spending. At the high-level event on the Millennium Development Goals in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" rel="nofollow">
          New York
         </a>
         , Australia made a commitment to $250 million over four years to improve women’s and children’s health, with a focus on the Asia-Pacific. I can also say that the Australian government is a strong supporter of faith based groups through the Australian aid program. AusAID’s support of the Church Partnership Program in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG" rel="nofollow">
          PNG
         </a>
         has helped reduce the vulnerability of communities in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
          Papua New Guinea
         </a>
         . Faith based partnerships in Indonesia, in Afghanistan and in the Philippines are making an important contribution to Australia’s efforts to support poverty alleviation in those countries.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Xenophon asked me specifically whether Australia will meet the international aid volume target of 0.7 per cent. It is true that the government made an election commitment to increase official development assistance to 0.5 per cent of gross national income by the year 2015. This is a very substantial increase on the level of 0.3 per cent which was inherited from the previous government. I can only say to Senator Xenophon that, beyond that, I am not aware that any further commitment has been made by the government, but I think it is certainly fair to say to Senator Xenophon—through you, Mr President—that the international aid target of 0.7 per cent remains an aspiration.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Does the minister agree that a commitment to 0.7 per cent could be a win-win, because, with just one daub of red paint, these T-shirts are good to go ahead?
