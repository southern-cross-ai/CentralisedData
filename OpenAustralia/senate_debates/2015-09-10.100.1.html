        After 15 Dorothy Dixers from the government this week on the China free trade deal, I have some real questions for the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Investment, Senator Payne. Minister, the government has claimed this week that the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, if signed, will immediately create tens of thousands of jobs and add billions of dollars to the Australian economy. Given that trade is a major component used in the measurement of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
         GDP
        </a>
        , or economic growth, can the minister explain why the supposed 'rivers of gold' from ChAFTA are not factored into Treasury forecasts for economic growth?

         I thank Senator Whish-Wilson for the question. If forecasts for the free trade agreement had been factored into Treasury's forecasts on growth, I imagine you would have criticised us for doing that before the free trade agreement was ratified. I think it has been demonstrated repeatedly in the chamber this week—not just by me but by Senator Brandis, Senator Scullion Senator Birmingham and a number of ministers in the chamber—that the potential under the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement is absolutely enormous. Whether it be the Financial Services Council or the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Farmers'_Federation" rel="nofollow">
          National Farmers' Federation
         </a>
         , all peak bodies are looking with extreme interest at what they will be able to do in their sectors. More importantly, they are looking at what the damage to their sectors will be if the free trade agreement is not signed this year. We know that there will be—

If it is signed this year then there is a bonus at the end of this year for our exporters and a bonus at the beginning of next year for our exporters—for businesses I spoke about in the chamber this week such as Ensitech and

                  </a>
                  why the department does not share with Treasury its national interest analysis outlining the benefits of these trade deals for the Australian economy. The answer I got was that, from an economy-wide perspective, these deals would not be significant enough to alter Treasury forecasting of

                   I do not actually think that what Senator Whish-Wilson has indicated is inconsistent with anything that I or any other member of the government has said in relation to the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement in any of the discussions in the chamber this week.

                    , I ask a further supplementary question. The investor-state dispute settlement chapter in ChAFTA does not appear to have been finalised, which is unprecedented. Can the government guarantee that Australia will not be sued by Chinese companies for simply changing policy or laws in the public interest? Could, for example, the Shenhua Watermark coalmine use strategic

                     provisions in this agreement. The ISDS provisions in the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement provide a mechanism for Australian or Chinese investors to pursue international arbitration based on a claimed violation of the national treatment commitment in the investment chapter. ISDS does not protect an investor from any loss of profits from a change in government policy or regulation. ISDS also does not prevent a government from changing its policies or regulating in the public interest. Investors should understand the relevant regulatory environment before they commit to making their investments. What modern ISDS mechanisms—

                         . I think I was saying that modern ISDS mechanisms incorporate explicit safeguards to reaffirm the right of governments to take decisions in the public interest, including in the areas of health and the environment, and reduce the chance of foreign investors bringing frivolous claims.
