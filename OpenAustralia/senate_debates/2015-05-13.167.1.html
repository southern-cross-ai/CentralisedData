        My question is to the Minister for Indigenous Affairs, Senator Scullion, representing the Minister for Agriculture. Can the minister update the Senate on what additional support the government, and in particular the government in this budget, is providing for infrastructure to underpin the beef industry, particularly in northern Australia?

         The Prime Minister travelled to the Beef Australia exposition in Rockhampton last Friday and announced another commitment to the Australian beef industry, this time in the form of some $100 million to improve road infrastructure critical to the beef industry supply chains in northern Australia. This announcement goes to the heart of the government's commitment to realising the potential of this vital industry, helping it to grow into the future. Transporting cattle can often make up a significant percentage of the market price of livestock, so it is imperative that we improve the productivity and resilience of the industry supply chains.
        </p>
        <p>
         Additionally, we have announced some $70 million to enable primary producers to claim more favourable accelerated depreciation for water facilities, fodder assets and fencing. For farmers doing it tough, we have also provided the benefit of being able to access further concessional loans above the $270 million already lent out. An additional $250 million has already been made available for the next 12 months at 3.84 per cent and at 3.21 per cent.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have also committed $20 million for social support and mental health support—as Mr Joyce highlights, this is in recognition that the people on the land are our most important asset and we must always look after them. On top of this is the further recent announcement of the $35 million stimulus package for the communities at the epicentre of the current drought—a further 25 million on top of the 8.5 million already allocated for pest control for pests such as wild dogs and pigs. These measures are part of the $333 million drought package announced by the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, and the Minister for Agriculture at Longreach on the weekend.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Can the minister outline to the Senate how the government's policies are assisting to boost the profitability of the beef industry as a whole, and how they are assisting to deliver a better return at the farm gate for Australian producers?

           , I am pleased to inform the Senate that this government's policies are underpinning the capacity of the Australian beef industry to reach its full potential. This is an $8.5 billion industry, and the contribution it makes to the national economy is truly fundamental to the prosperity of our nation. Since coming to office, we have negotiated extremely favourable free trade agreements with Korea, Japan and China. We have opened six new markets for our live animal exports, and there will be more to come. This is good news for producers. Mr President, with confidence I can assure the Senate that this government will have a further substantial policy contribution, both to the beef industry and to agriculture more broadly, with the implementation and release of the agricultural competitiveness white paper.

             I know the honourable senator and I thank him for his question. I note his specific interest in this important event, given that his home base is, in fact, the beef capital of Rockhampton. Congratulations must go to the organisers of last week's Beef Australia 2015—to its Chairman, Blair Angus, and
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
              CEO
             </a>
             , Denis Cox, to their team and to the hundreds if not thousands of volunteers that made this event a true celebration of the quality and integrity of our nation's beef industry. The Minister for Agriculture has highlighted that the government has been extremely proud to fulfil its $2.75 million commitment to this celebration of steak. I am reliably informed that the steak was in fact something worth celebrating! Over 90,000 people attended this year's event, with 1,100 international delegates from over 50 countries in attendance and some 4,300 entries for stud and commercial cattle competitions. The success of this event is proof that the coalition government is committed to supporting initiatives that promote our nation's clean green product.
