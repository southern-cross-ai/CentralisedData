        Yesterday, I had the pleasure of meeting with Louise Bawden, who is one of our great beach volleyball athletes and an Olympic athlete, along with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volleyball_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Volleyball Australia
        </a>
        to celebrate the fact that my home state of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        has secured the 2025
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach_Volleyball_World_Championships" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , which is absolutely fantastic. This is only the third time that the beach volleyball championships have been held outside Europe and the first time in the Asia-Pacific region. It's fantastic for Australian volleyball. It's fantastic and a great opportunity for our volleyball players, for my home state and for the future of the game in Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        We know that hosting international sporting events not only provides the opportunity for our players to demonstrate their sporting prowess on the world stage and provides a critical pathway for elite athletes but inspires young people to participate, to get out there on the sand, get on the court or on the field and get active, which means that they are going to have a healthier lifestyle. This is the pipeline for our elite athletes, but most importantly, it encourages healthy and active communities here in Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm super excited about the opportunity this will provide to my state. There will be $10 million worth of economic activity, and 15,000 personnel will be working on these games to showcase our city and our state on the world stage and promote our wonderful city and state as a great tourism destination. We've got a strong record of backing in good sporting events in South Australia, and we're very proud to be able to host the beach volleyball championships.
       </p>
       <p>
        The South Australian government has put its money where its mouth is and is getting behind the championships and financially supporting them. I call on the Albanese government to back us in in South Australia on this important international event and make sure it supports us so that we can maximise the legacy opportunities for my state and this country through hosting another great international sporting event here in Australia.
