         Super Clinic was promised by the previous Labor government more than three years ago on 31 August 2009. It is still not open, and it is still yet to see a single patient. The first sod was turned on 25 October 2011, with a promise from the previous Labor government that it would be completed by 2013. It would be no surprise for people in this place to discover that, 2½ years later, it is still not finished.

           was constructed of 18,000 separate pieces of steel which weighed more than 7,300 tonnes. It has 2.5 million rivets holding it together, all inserted by hand. It is 324 metres high, has 81 storeys and is known the world over. I do not think anybody in this chamber could disagree that it is a significant construction project. It only took two years, two months and five days to construct—less time than the Cockburn

           So the history of ill-thought-through policy on the run from this government continues. The history of mismanagement continues. The previous Labor government were unable to deliver for the people in this nation. It is this coalition government that will deliver health services to people across the nation where they are needed.

             superclinics across the country but delivered only one. In 2007 they promised one for Wanneroo. In 2010, the previous Labor government promised it again. It is still not built. In 2010 they promised one for Rockingham. It is still not built. In 2010 they promised one for Northam. It is still not built. In 2010 they promised one for Karratha. It is still not built. This is a success rate by the previous Labor government of 17 per cent—a fail by anybody's account.

               superclinics around the country at a cost of more than $650 million. Unfortunately, there was nothing super about the former government's failure to deliver on its promise. You only have to look at the Redcliffe GP superclinic, which was originally a $5 million Commonwealth commitment from those on the other side when previously in government. It took six years and blew out to $13.2 million. This was from those opposite. Senators might like to take a guess at exactly how many clinics the previous Labor government delivered. It is not 50; it is not 40. The previous Labor government managed to deliver only 33 of the 64 clinics—a lot of them in
