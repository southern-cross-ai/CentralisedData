        Dr Clayton Golledge, microbiologist and infectious diseases expert, has been quoted as saying when describing the speed and ferocity of meningococcal disease cases, ‘I’ve seen cases where someone has been well at breakfast and dead by dinner.’ I would like to take this opportunity to inform the Senate of the devastating effect of meningococcal disease on many Australians and the work of the Violet Foundation, a community organisation working to raise awareness and support those Australians affected by meningococcal disease, a foundation for which I am proudly the patron.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meningococcal_disease" rel="nofollow">
         Meningococcal disease
        </a>
        is an acute bacterial infection that strikes with frightening speed and can cause death within hours if not recognised and treated in time. Fortunately, it is a rare disease affecting around 300 Australians a year. The most at risk are children under five years of age and young adults aged 15 to 24 years. While the majority of victims will fully recover, Australian meningococcal disease data indicates that 10 per cent of those infected will die and around 20 per cent will have permanent disabilities, ranging from sight and hearing problems, liver and kidney failure to the loss of fingers, toes and limbs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Meningococcal disease is caused by a number of different strains of the bacterium
        <i>
         Neisseria meningitidis
        </i>
        . The bacterium is commonly found in the upper respiratory tract and is spread through infected droplets in the air. Recognising the disease in its early stages is important but diagnosis can be very difficult as it can easily be mistaken for other common ailments such as tiredness, mild flu or the common cold. Meningococcal disease appears in two forms: meningitis or bacteria form, and septicaemia or blood poisoning, or a combination of both. Meningococcal meningitis causes inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms may include headache, fever, fatigue, stiffness and soreness of the neck, sensitivity to light, confusion and convulsions. Meningococcal meningitis can result in permanent disabilities such as deafness and brain injury and in some cases death.
       </p>
       <p>
        Meningococcal septicaemia is the more dangerous and deadly of the two diseases. Meningococcal septicaemia bacteria enter the bloodstream and multiply uncontrollably, damaging the walls of the blood vessels and causing bleeding into the skin which results in a distinctive purple rash many recognise as synonymous with the victims of meningococcal. The combination of cold hands or feet, mottled skin and muscle or joint pains should prompt seeking medical attention. Do not wait for the telltale rash.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most cases occur spontaneously. Outbreaks where more than one person is affected are rare. Meningococcal bacteria are difficult to spread, only passed from person to person by regular close, prolonged household and intimate contact with secretions from the back of the nose and throat. It is important for teenagers and young people to look after their mates and act quickly. Do not assume they have a hangover or flu-like illness. The sooner antibiotic and other treatments begin the less damage the disease will cause and most will make a complete recovery. However, it must be remembered this disease can progress very rapidly despite the best treatment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Vaccines are currently available for four out of the five strains of meningococcal disease, including the C strain, the second most common in Australia. This has had a big impact on reducing infection rates nationally. Information and education on vaccination will lead to more Australians being protected against this strain of the disease. Vaccination for the meningococcal B strain, the most common in Australia, is in advanced development and a vaccine becoming available in the near future does look like a promising reality.
       </p>
       <p>
        I acknowledge there are many organisations and charities in Australia tackling this terrible disease. I have had the great privilege of being the patron for one of those organisations, the Violet Foundation. The Violet Foundation was established in Sydney in April 2002 after a group of concerned citizens started fund raising for a friend suffering from meningococcal disease. It has since grown and now assists many sufferers and their families. I am not a medical expert, nor have I been personally touched by the devastating effects of this illness, but I do know the work of the Violet Foundation has been magnificent.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tonight I want to acknowledge the tremendous efforts of the foundation’s office bearers, including its founder and President, Mr Col Greenway; foundation Secretary, Leanne Cotter, whose daughter Danielle has suffered long-term effects from meningococcal disease since the age of 14 months; Treasurer, Mr Greg Peters, who had the disease in 1999 but is fully recovered from its effects; and Events Coordinator, Ruth Greenway; and those other members of the foundation’s committee, all of whom volunteer their time and expertise in this worthy cause.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to commend the foundation’s well-known supporters, particularly those from the sporting world:

        , who has worn the foundation’s supporter wristband around the world. Their contribution is exceptional.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Violet Foundation’s educational projects work toward community awareness of the symptoms of meningococcal disease, early diagnosis by medical professionals and rapid treatment—so crucial for a disease that can move so frighteningly quickly. The Violet Foundation’s vital financial and emotional support for those unfortunate enough to have had personal experience with meningococcal disease—to have been touched by the disease either as sufferers or as the family and friends of someone who has contracted the disease—is simply outstanding.
       </p>
       <p>
        As proud patron of the Violet Foundation, I do want to commend tonight the foundation’s tireless work in easing the suffering of so many who have had their lives affected by meningococcal disease.
