         Thank you for your question, Senator Brockman. Like you and many other senators across both sides of the chamber today, we wear the teal ribbon to show our support for ovarian cancer awareness. We wear the ribbon to show our support for the women and their families who live with this disease and to remember those who have died, including former Senator Ferris, the friend of many in this chamber and respected by all.
        </p>
        <p>
         It's timely to reflect on the devastating facts. In Australia, 1,600 women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer every single year. While survival rates for cancers have greatly improved in the past three decades, the survival rate for ovarian cancer is still tragically low at 44 per cent. In 2017, it is estimated that around 1,050 women died from this disease.
        </p>
        <p>
         This morning, our government announced it will provide almost $3 million to support groundbreaking cancer prevention project Traceback. Traceback will involve genetic testing of around 1,500 tissue specimens collected from Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer over the past 15 years. Women who have not previously been offered testing may be able to identify genetic variance, which will inform them or their relatives of the risk of getting these cancers. These women are then able to consider taking preventative action. It may inform information and decisions on whether or not to have pre-emptive surgery or how to monitor the potential condition.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is a new, groundbreaking approach to cancer control. According to estimates of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_Cancer" rel="nofollow">
          Ovarian Cancer
         </a>
         Australia, this could prevent 800 women from getting ovarian cancer and 2,000 from getting breast cancer over the next 10 years. The support for this project builds on the $33 million we've already provided for dedicated research related to ovarian cancer since 2013.

            The Australian government is committed to reducing the impact of cancer through a series of broad-ranging measures, including prevention, investment in cancer research, more effective screening and early detection, treatments such as radiotherapy and the listing of lifesaving drugs on our PBS.
           </p>
           <p>
            In relation to ovarian cancer, the government provides support through Medicare. In November 2017, we listed two new Medicare items for the testing of gene mutations that predispose women to ovarian and/or breast cancer. Women who have a family history, who are high risk or who already have breast or ovarian cancer can receive these tests funded by the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MBS" rel="nofollow">
             MBS
            </a>
            . This government also ensures that medicines to treat ovarian cancer are more affordable through the PBS, spending more than $17 million on PBS medicines in 2016-17 for the treatment of ovarian cancer.

               We should all be proud that the Australian government is committed to ensuring Australia is a health and medical research powerhouse by supporting our talented, world-class researchers and attracting the best and brightest minds to work right here in Australia. This commitment is demonstrated by more than $6 billion invested in health and medical research, and the announcement today of the Traceback program builds on the government's existing commitment to cancer research. Since 2013, we've provided $800 million to support cancer research and, specifically through the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHMRC" rel="nofollow">
                NHMRC
               </a>
               , more than $33 million for research related to ovarian cancer. In addition, Cancer Australia and its funding partners have supported 20 research projects focused on ovarian cancer research. The theme of Teal Ribbon Day this year is that it's a time for action. With Traceback and the government's investment in research, we're doing just that—taking decisive and immediate action to tackle ovarian cancer.
