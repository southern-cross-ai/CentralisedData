        My question is to Senator Ellison, the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. Does the minister recall that in 2005, following the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornelia_Rau" rel="nofollow">
         Cornelia Rau
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivian_Solon" rel="nofollow">
         Vivian Solon
        </a>
        cases, the Palmer report recommended that Immigration develop a single search facility for all of its databases so that such devastating bungles were not repeated? Can the minister confirm media reports that are saying that, two years after the Palmer report, only one in seven departmental officers can access the new search facility, known as the Systems for People program? Is it true that the new system, which cost hundreds of millions of dollars, is still not complete and has had almost as many
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT" rel="nofollow">
         IT
        </a>
        contractors working on it as there are departmental officers with access? Can the minister indicate how much has been spent on the new system, when its rollout will be completed and whether it will ever meet the standard required by the Palmer report?

         I understand that work is being conducted on the system that Senator Ludwig referred to. As to where that is up to at the moment, I will take that on notice. I can say this: across the government, there has been an enhancement of crosschecking of databases in relation not only to identity but also to entrance to and departure from Australia. In my department, that is being done as an additional action to what was canvassed in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornelia_Rau" rel="nofollow">
          Cornelia Rau
         </a>
         aspect. In fact, we announced in the budget this year that we would embark upon data matching with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Immigration_and_Citizenship" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Immigration and Citizenship
         </a>
         in relation to Centrelink payments so we can check whether someone is in receipt of concessions, benefits or both upon exit from and entry into Australia. As for the department of immigration’s work, I will check on that and advise the Senate. However, there has been a good deal of work across the whole of government in relation to document and identity verification. That has been not only at the level of the Commonwealth but also at the state and territory government level. My colleague Senator Johnston has been working on that with the states and territories. All of that goes to the sharing of data which can eliminate the sorts of mistakes that arise in a Cornelia Rau instance.
        </p>
        <p>
         I think it was yesterday that Senator Johnston mentioned the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA" rel="nofollow">
          DNA
         </a>
         database. Similar work is being done in relation to missing persons—so you could add that to the work being done. Missing persons has been a relevant issue—going to the question that Senator Ludwig has asked. We are looking at the situation where, if someone has been reported as missing, that information can be put on a national database.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrimTrac" rel="nofollow">
          CrimTrac
         </a>
         is overseeing it, as I recall—but Senator Johnston can correct me if I am wrong. That will provide a national approach to missing persons. So work is being done across the board that involves not only the Australian government but also state and territory governments across the country. But it is not something that is going to happen overnight. This is going to need the cooperation of all concerned, and we are making great progress.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Can the minister confirm that he and the government continue to have complete confidence in the Systems for People program? Given that the program is only accessible by one in seven immigration officials, what confidence can Australians have that the scandalous Rau and Solon cases will not be repeated? Two years on from the Palmer report, why has the government not taken action to ensure that this system is properly implemented as a matter of urgency?

           I have said that it is being implemented. In relation to the level of access by immigration agents, I will take that on notice and advise the Senate.
