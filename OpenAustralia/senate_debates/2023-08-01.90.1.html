        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Government Services, Senator Farrell. During the winter recess, Commissioner Holmes handed down the final report of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Commission
        </a>
        into the Robodebt Scheme, which highlighted that for 4½ years the former Liberal-National government pursued its unlawful robodebt scheme. It was a time when some of the most vulnerable Australians must have felt that their government, with the Liberals and the Nationals at the reins, had abandoned them. Can the minister update the Senate about what the report found on the design, implementation and operation of the former Liberal government's cruel scheme?

         I thank Senator Sheldon for his question and for his deep concern for the impact of robodebt on so many Australians. Yes, I can answer that question because Labor committed to establishing a royal commission into robodebt, and just over 12 months after the government being elected, on the morning of 7 July 2023, Commissioner Holmes delivered her final report for all to see. The report set out its findings on the Liberal and Nationals' cruel robodebt scheme. The report highlighted how the scheme unlawfully raised $1.8 billion of debt against approximately 435,000 vulnerable Australians. The report told the personal stories of tragedy and suffering this terrible scheme caused members of our community who, through no fault of their own, felt attacked with nowhere to turn.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the final report, Commissioner Holmes noted:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         … the Robodebt Scheme was put together on an ill-conceived, embryonic idea and rushed to Cabinet … It is clear enough why it was thought necessary and desirable: because of the dual advantages of supposed savings … and its neat alignment with the political rhetoric of the day about the social security system and the need for 'integrity' in welfare payments.
        </p>
        <p>
         Yet, despite the damning findings of the report, which found that the Liberals and Nationals had put political pointscoring over the welfare of vulnerable Australians, sadly many of the scheme's architects remain members of the coalition benches to this day.

           Is it correct that the royal commission's final report reiterated the unlawfulness of the scheme, including through evidence of how the former Liberal and National government was warned repeatedly about this and yet still hounded some of the most vulnerable in our community for unlawful debts? Has there been any evidence that those impacted by the royal commission have accepted any responsibility for their actions? What, if anything, has been the reaction to the findings of the report?

            I thank Senator Sheldon for his first supplementary question. Unfortunately, the answer to that question is no, because the royal commission's final report was clear: the former Liberal government ignored warnings of the scheme's unlawfulness. With everything that has been exposed, I would have expected that those responsible would have apologised to all of those Australians who paid the price of their actions. But yesterday former prime minister Mr Morrison and the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Dutton, doubled down. Mr Morrison stood in the other place and, instead of apologising, made out that he was somehow a victim of the robodebt scheme. What was more shocking was that Mr Dutton stood by Mr Morrison on last night's

            program. It really says something about the state of the modern Liberal Party.

               Yes, I can. The government established the robodebt royal commission to provide Australians with answers about how the scheme was established and operated. We are confident that Commissioner Holmes has provided these answers. In summing up the final report, Commissioner Holmes noted:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               I am confident that the commission has served the purpose of bringing into the open an extraordinary saga, illustrating a myriad of ways that things can go wrong through venality, incompetence and cowardice.
