Australia, as I have said repeatedly, is not immune to these global—

                     Yet again, those opposite have decided we can just fritter away the budget surplus—just give out another concession, just fritter it away as if it did not make any difference to the economic circumstances that families in this country face. What families in this country need is responsible economic management delivered by its central government. It does not need cheap political point-scoring from a Senate that seems to be committed to obstruction and blowing a $6 billion hole in the budget. To those who continue to argue that we can just lose that $6 billion—and apparently there is another chunk of money that should be just frittered away out of the surplus, evolving out of that question: just give it all away; it won’t matter—there is a reason—

                      , I raise a point of order. It is true that you cannot direct a minister how to answer a question. It is also true that there is a point in the standing orders about relevance. Mr President, I put it to you that in this answer the minister is not being relevant in any way to the question that was put to him.

                       Senator Ferguson, on the point of order: if I heard the minister’s answer correctly, and I believe I did, in just the last 30 seconds of his answer he did refer to the question that was put to him. But I draw the minister’s attention to the question and to being relevant to the question that was asked.

                        . As you correctly pointed out, I was very specifically discussing the consequences of doing what the question suggested. I was very specifically referring to the policy proposal that was being advanced by those opposite, because once again it shows that this opposition and some others in this chamber have lost touch with economic reality. What Australian families need is for pressure to bear down on inflation so that there is pressure to bear down on interest rates, so that their mortgages will be reduced after 10 consecutive interest rate rises, because those opposite chose to ignore

                         , I ask a supplementary question. In light of the minister’s answer, is Tasmanian Labor Premier David Bartlett’s call for the adoption of the coalition’s policy also economically irresponsible? And will you send a copy of today’s

                          For those who want to enter this debate, the message is the same: the federal government is committed to delivering its $22 billion surplus, because it is that surplus that is combined to add pressure in the fight against inflation—something that those on the other side ran up the white flag about. They gave up before the last election. They were engaged in nothing more than pork-barrelling at every opportunity. That is why they were the highest taxing, highest spending government in 30 years—with nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. They lost the economic plot. This government will continue to stand for sound and responsible financial economic management. We will not be diverted
