        My question is to Senator Minchin, representing the Prime Minister. Is the minister aware that the recent comments by the member for O’Connor that ‘the dogs have been barking’, about corruption in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWB" rel="nofollow">
         AWB
        </a>
        for years, mirror comments from the well known Victorian grain trader, Mr Ray Brooks? Isn’t the member for O’Connor right when he says that the government was guilty of trusting a mob of agri-politicians with close ties to the National Party? Didn’t
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Brooks" rel="nofollow">

        confront the then agriculture minister, Mr Warren Truss, in 2002 with concerns about AWB only to be told by the minister: ‘Don’t give me that bull’—and I will not repeat the last word? Aren’t both the member for O’Connor and Mr Brooks right when they say the National Party ministers were quick to dismiss concerns about the actions of their mates in AWB because they put personal interests ahead of their responsibility as ministers?

         No, they are absolutely wrong. As reported by the Cole commission of inquiry, they are completely wrong. The Cole commission of inquiry has found that there is nothing to indict the behaviour of the Prime Minister, the foreign minister, the Minister for Trade and the Deputy Prime Minister. It is the Labor Party that has got egg all over its face on the matter of the Cole commission of inquiry, running around the country and slandering ministers of this government without foundation at all, and has been found to be out of line by the Cole commission of inquiry.

         and Mr Tuckey go, they are also wrong to the extent they suggest there has been any improper behaviour on the part of National Party ministers. They are both wrong. I reject completely out of hand any insinuations made by the member for O’Connor against members of the National Party. They have acted honourably in every respect, as found by the Cole commission of inquiry. I stand by my National Party colleagues in the cabinet and the ministry.

               For the Labor Party to have the audacity to come in here and seek to play out differences that may appear in the coalition is incredible given that these people are all trying to knock off their own leader. They are undergoing the most extraordinary annual event: let’s play the game of undermining the leader. Here we have Mr Beazley deflating before us while Mr Rudd and his supporters continue to seek to destroy their own leader.

I know that the minister is seeking to not answer the question, but the question was about Senator Joyce and the member for O’Connor’s comments, and nothing to do with the Labor Party.

                   We are all much more interested in the machinations inside the Labor Party than anything else and, no doubt, you would be doing your best to cover them up. The government, of course, does not defend bribery in any respect. That is why we set up the Cole commission. We are the only government in the world to set up a fully-fledged, independent inquiry as a result of the Volcker report. There are 2,200 companies involved. We are the only country that set up a commission of inquiry to examine it.

                   have been found out by the commission and prosecutions will no doubt ensue. No-one defends bribery and no-one in this government defends bribery.
