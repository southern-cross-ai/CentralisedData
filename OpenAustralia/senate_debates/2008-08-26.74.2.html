        This is the Australian Government’s response to the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Inquiry into the Indigenous visual arts and craft sector, Indigenous Arts—Securing the Future, as tabled on 20 June 2007.
       </p>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        acknowledges the importance of the committee’s research into the Indigenous visual arts sector, and the value of its findings in contributing to the growth and stability of the sector into the future. The report highlights the economic, social and cultural benefits of the Indigenous visual arts sector to local communities and its wider impact on other sectors and the nation generally. As stated in the report, these benefits can be reinforced and developed through a coordinated whole of government response to the recommendations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government recognises the success of the Indigenous visual arts sector including the creation of an internationally acclaimed art movement, representing a dynamic living culture that helps define Australia’s identity. This sector affords economic opportunities for Indigenous artists and communities while playing a fundamental role in building a dialogue between Indigenous and other Australians in the reconciliation process. The Government also acknowledges that the Indigenous visual arts sector faces a number of challenges.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government considers it has an important ongoing role in the building of a strong and sustainable Indigenous visual arts sector which is reflected in this response to the committee’s recommendations.
