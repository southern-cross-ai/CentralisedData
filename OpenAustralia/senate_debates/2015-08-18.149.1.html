        , 13 August, representatives from 46 different Aboriginal groups and clans visited
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        to present a petition to members and senators. It was an honour to receive the petition. The presentation of the petition was celebrated with a traditional marriage dance, didgeridoo music and other culturally appropriate events.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 'Uluru bark petition', as it is named, urges the government to maintain the definition of marriage as a union between man and woman. The petition states: 'The sanctity of marriage between man and woman continues to be held in honour among all.' It also states that it is 'an affront to the Aboriginal people of Australia to suggest another definition of marriage' and cites 'the spiritual implication of this sacred union'. It states further: 'Our fathers and mothers are also honoured and form the foundation of our families, clans and systems and pass down our teachings, our culture, our traditions, from generation to generation.'
       </p>
       <p>
        This is the first petition to parliament that makes clear that the current definition of marriage is a matter of great importance to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginal" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Aboriginal
        </a>
        people. The definition of marriage is a matter not just of state or religious significance but of cultural significance. The Uluru bark petition provides a valuable insight for the Australian parliament. The meaning of marriage is not simply a matter of contemporary definition which depends on the present views of a number of vocal advocates for new and different definitions of marriage. It has an enduring meaning that is of great spiritual significance and value to Australia's Aboriginal peoples, who have lived in Australia for at least 80,000 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        There has been some criticism that the significance of this petition is reduced because many of its signatories are Christians. To disparage the views of Indigenous petitioners because they are Christians is both ignorant and patronising. Christianity has played a significant role in many Indigenous settlements and groupings from the early days of white settlement.
       </p>
       <p>
        I urge senators and members to read the petition and to consider the significance of the meaning of marriage to the 46 Aboriginal groups and clans represented by it. The petition reminds us of the universality of the truth of marriage between a man and a woman, as it has been for millennia across many diverse cultures.
