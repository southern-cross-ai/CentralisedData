           issued a broadcast alert for shipping in the area. The national plan for combating oil pollution was activated on Wednesday and its oil spill response resources were made available to the Queensland authorities. The plan is a cooperative arrangement between the states and the Commonwealth to work together to pool expertise and resources in times of oil pollution.

           then proceeded to anchorage off the port of Brisbane where an assessment of the ship was conducted by an AMSA surveyor. The ship’s crew advised that 20 to 30 tonnes of heavy fuel were lost. AMSA arranged for aerial surveillance of the area where the loss of containers and oil spill occurred. No containers were observed.

            , I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for that information, but in view of the huge delay that the Queensland government was engaged in in getting organised to address this spill, I ask the minister: when did the Queensland government actually contact the federal government seeking activation of the National Marine Oil Spill Contingency Plan? In view of that delay and in view of the minister’s answer to my first question, when was the actual offer made to Queensland for material to be available? When was the offer of support made? Mr President, as you would know as a Queenslander, it has taken so long for the Queensland government to get involved and I am interested in whether the minister can tell me some times—and I am pleased that the advisers have handed him some notes—that might be able to inform me when the Queensland government actually took the matter seriously.

             I utterly reject the suggestions in that diatribe from Senator Macdonald. I will continue to provide information, though, on the Commonwealth and Queensland government’s efforts in this area. As I was saying, no containers were observed. However, an oil slick three nautical miles long and 500 metres wide was sighted approximately four nautical miles north of
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moreton_Island" rel="nofollow">
              Moreton Island
             </a>
             . The weather conditions on Wednesday consisted of gale force winds and heavy seas as a result of a tropical cyclone. In such conditions, it was not feasible to use oil spill dispersants or oil recovery equipment to prevent the oil from coming onshore.

               <p>
                The difficulty in this—and please let me have my opportunity to address the point of order—is that the question first of all made an assertion, which may or may not have been part of the question because it depends on whether the senator provided an inflection at the end where he said ‘in view of the huge delay’. They were the words he started with—completely wrong but an assertion nonetheless, unless of course he was asking a question as part of that assertion. Senator Conroy was responding not only to the substance of the question, which was to address when, but also in part to a huge assertion made at the beginning of the question. It is appropriate for a minister to address an assertion as well as the primary question if a senator is going to include assertions in the primary question. We have dealt with this before in question time. An assertion is not part of the question and should not be part of the question. There is no point of order.

                   Mr Presi-dent, I ask a further supplementary question. It seems to me that Senator Conroy is either part of the stuff-up or part of the cover-up in this matter. Specifically, has the Maritime Emergency Response Commander or the maritime pollution controller exercised their powers of intervention in light of the slow response and underestimation of the size of the spill by the Queensland government?

                    Once again, I utterly reject the inane politicking being engaged in by Senator Macdonald in a pathetic attempt to try and win votes for his failing party in Queensland, and that is exactly how it should be seen.

                    can go to the substance of the question, oil dispersants can only be sprayed by small single-engine, low-flying aircraft similar to those used on farms, flying only metres above the affected ocean.

                     , on a point of order on relevance: the question was specifically whether the Maritime Emergency Response Commander has exercised his intervention powers because of the slow response and underestimation by Queensland. That is the question. Has the Maritime Emergency Response Commander exercised his powers? I am interested in what Senator Conroy says, but it was not the question he was asked.
