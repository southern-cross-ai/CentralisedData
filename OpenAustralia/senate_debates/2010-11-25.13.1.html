                     , I rise on a point of order. The motion that the minister is reading out is at variance with the motion that I have got in front of me. I am totally confused as to what the government is actually proposing to do this morning. Can he please be asked to provide some clarification?

                      It is correct within the standing orders for the motion to be read. If there is a difference between what has been circulated and what the minister is reading then I can only take it that what the minister is reading is the true and proper version. I think that is the correct way.

                       , I rise on a point of order. We just voted previously on two motions to immediately put a motion. The motion that was circulated to us as what would be put is not the one he was reading out, but the one that is on our desks. The previous two motions that have been voted upon related to the document that was on our tables when he moved that motion. So those two motions do not take account—

                        , let me finish. Let me develop my point of order. The two previous motions related to a document on our tables and so we voted accordingly. Perhaps if we had known it was different we might have voted a different way. And so, I think those previous two motions are invalid, and do not apply to the motion before the chair.

                              , on Senator Macdonald’s point of order: the motion for which the Senate just voted was a motion that the motion be put. Not that ‘a motion be put’ in relation to precedence but that ‘the motion be put’. The only motion before the Senate at the time that motion was put and determined was not the motion which Minister Ludwig is now reading. The motion that Minister Ludwig is now reading is not the motion that the Senate gave leave to put. He is out of order and you should sit him down.

                               Senator Brandis, that is a completely wrong construction on that. The motion was simply a motion seeking precedence; it did not stipulate the motion. It was a matter of precedence and that the motion be put that would allow precedence to take place. That is what the motion was and that was quite within order.

                                , I rise on a point of order. Can the clerk read the motion that was just put and deliberated upon by the Senate, because I think you will find it was a motion that the motion be put.
