        My question is to the Minister for Women, Senator Payne. I refer to the disturbing report aired by
        <i>

          Four Corners

        last night which reflected an ongoing culture within the Morrison government of inappropriate and sexist conduct and intimidation. What is the Minister for Women's response?

         At the outset, let me make it very clear that I condemn all inappropriate treatment of people in the workplace, women and men, including relationships that exploit an imbalance in power within a workplace. Every Australian has the right to feel safe in their place of work.

           A message sent by one member of an internal coalition women's WhatsApp group said:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           We, each of us inspire young women to aim for leadership, how do we continue to do this in the face of puerile back-stabbing from male party members whose sole aim is to count numbers and take our place?
          </p>
          <p>
           Was the minister aware of the existence of this WhatsApp group, and has she offered advice to members of this group?

            I'm not specifically aware of that WhatsApp group. There are many, as I'm sure those opposite also share. However, I would reiterate what I said in my response to Senator McAllister's first question and indicate that we know well from the Respect@Work inquiry carried out by the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_Discrimination_Commissioner" rel="nofollow">
             Sex Discrimination Commissioner
            </a>
            , Kate Jenkins, that there are many workplaces in Australia which don't meet the standards that we would hope and expect to see. That includes this parliament, and it doesn't just include the government sides of this parliament. We know that. So it is incumbent on all of us, women and men, to address and take responsibility for addressing these issues across the parliament in the ancillary parts of the parliament, whether that is for the press gallery, for other staff, for the entire building or for the entire community in which we work, including the political community. It's not acceptable. I condemn all inappropriate treatment of women.

               (—) (): I thank Senator McAllister for her question. In fact, in 2018, at the direct request of the Prime Minister, my political party undertook a comprehensive review of its processes for the handling of complaints and dispute resolution to ensure that our party had rigorous and confidential processes in place, as we should. The review resulted in the development of the Liberal Party's first National Code of Conduct and its Complaints and Dispute Resolution Policy, both of which were endorsed unanimously by the federal executive of the Liberal Party in 2019. These are matters which we took and which we take very seriously. Many other workplaces do not have similar codes or do not have similar dispute resolution policies. Many other workplaces, for example, and other political organisations have not instituted the restriction on sexual relations that former Prime Minister Turnbull instituted, which was maintained by Prime Minister Morrison. We take this very seriously and it's a matter of—
