         I cannot recall a time when the then Treasurer did not actually want to know how much revenue each tax collected! But is the minister not aware that the law does authorise the disclosure of taxpayers ' information to a minister for the purpose of enabling that minister to exercise a power or to perform any function under tax law?

              The PRESIDENT: Order, on both sides!
             </p>
             <p>
              This is the administration of Australia ' s tax laws, and they are independent of government. Having said that, the government is acutely aware of the importance of transparency in relation to our tax system. As I referenced yesterday, as a consequence of the government ' s awareness, Mr Bradbury, the Assistant Treasurer, is leading work to improve the transparency of Australia ' s business tax system so that this type of information can be released appropriately. Through this, the government wishes to broaden the transparency of the tax system, including in relation to
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRRT" rel="nofollow">
               MRRT
              </a>
              revenue. This approach that is being led by the Assistant Treasurer would remove any ambiguity from reporting requirements so that these issues can be addressed.
             </p>
             <p>
              Obviously, continuing to protect taxpayer confidentiality for individuals is essential. But there is a case in the government ' s view to examine whether larger multinational businesses should have the same level of confidentiality about the taxes they have paid. We will approach this issue in a measured, considered and principled way, rather than taking an ad hoc approach to particular taxpayers or particular taxes.

                I do want to be very clear with the chamber on this issue, as I was when I was acting Treasurer and some information was released publicly. This was not a discretionary decision made by government; this was a decision of the tax office and a matter on which Treasury provided advice and Treasury considered.

               <p>
                Whilst I know that for political reasons the opposition wish to make an issue of this, I think there is a separate issue here, which is the operation of Australia ' s tax laws. These are not discretionary decisions of ministers, and nor should they be. They are decisions which are properly made by the

                  , on the point of order: I clearly recall Senator Wong saying in response to the first question that she did not think that the Senate was the appropriate place to go into detailed legal debates on interpretation of different provisions in law. Beyond that issue, she has outlined quite a range of relevant information and described the process that Treasury and the tax office have been through. She is attempting, as far as is relevant, to address the question raised.

                 <p>
                  The PRESIDENT: I am very conscious of the standing orders in respect of the giving of legal opinion in this place. I am listening closely to the minister ' s answer. I believe the minister is answering the question. The minister does have 16 seconds remaining, though, to answer the question.

                   I was actually attempting to be helpful, but obviously I am not going to get into a legal argument. The point I was making is that the government has not made a decision on this. This decision has been made by those who administer the tax laws.

                    , I ask a further supplementary question. Given that the public interest threshold to which I referred has clearly been passed, why is the minister still refusing to release the revenue details for the

                     In relation to the latter, I think that has been answered publicly previously: Treasury is not in a position to advise ministers, given the provision of the tax act. As to the details of that revenue, given the confidentiality provisions—

                        However, the government, as I have said now on a number of occasions in this place, is aware of the desire and the appropriateness of proper transparency in relation to taxation matters. That is why we have seen the announcement from the Assistant Treasurer in relation to measures to increase transparency. But again, as I said, we will do this in a methodical and principled way, rather than the ad hoc way that appears to be what is proposed by the opposition.
