        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. The cost of living is the No. 1 issue that I hear about from constituents, and I know that it's the No. 1 priority for the Albanese Labor government. The 1st of July was a really important day, with a range of cost-of-living supports rolling out for Australians, including the tax cuts. But I have noticed that the opposition doesn't seem excited about Labor's tax cuts. I'm wondering if perhaps they don't actually understand how important this policy will be for their constituents. Can the minister help them out? Can the minister let us know how their constituents and all Australians will benefit from Labor's tax cuts?

         I will first also acknowledge the honourable speaker Seoule and welcome you to Australia. We're very pleased to have our friends from Vanuatu with us today. If we're a little feisty, you'll understand this is the robust Australian democracy, Mr Speaker!
        </p>
        <p>
         President, senators and Senator Grogan, I would say to you that what we see from 1 July are tax cuts. There's a tax cut for every taxpayer in Australia—13.6 million Australians, 2.9 million low-paid workers, many of whom are people who supported the coalition. They must be scratching their heads wondering why it is that the coalition are so opposed to so many of the cost-of-living measures that the government has put in place. Of course, there is the tax cut for every Australian taxpayer, not just some. On top of that there's the $300 energy bill relief for every Australian household and $325 for small businesses. Remember when they were the party of small business?
        </p>
        <p>
         There's a freeze on the cost of PBS medicines for every Australian and a third consecutive pay rise for 2.6 million workers—they're not excited about that because they believe in low wages as a deliberate design feature of the Australian economy. On top of that, there's more funding to build more homes and an increase to paid parental leave on top of cheaper child care, fee-free

          They're more interested in shouting at the Labor Party than actually looking at what the people who vote for them want, which is relief for the cost of living. You would think that Senator Birmingham might be excited about or interested in all the people in

            I thank the minister for that response. It's very helpful to have that laid out. I know that the Albanese Labor government is working to ensure Australians are paying a fair price for their groceries and to ease the cost-of-living pressures. Can the minister please tell the Senate what the government is doing and what the experts have said about why divestiture isn't the best way forward?

             Of course, this government is taking measures to strengthen the Food and Grocery Code of Conduct, cracking down on anticompetitive behaviour, increasing penalties and asking the consumer watchdog to investigate.

             What has been extraordinary this week has been to watch Senator Nick McKim write the coalition's supermarket policy. What I'm really interested in is: how is it that the party that used to be the party of tax cuts now has Senator McKim writing their competition policy? When did that happen?

             </a>
             used to be a party of people who prided themselves on being economic rationalists and who prided themselves on looking to the market. Now, Senator Nick McKim, I congratulate you. You're writing the alternative government's economic policy.

                   I read in the
                   <i>
                    Australian
                   </i>
                   this morning that Liberal MPs were ambushed over Mr Dutton's plan for new divestiture powers and are concerned that the policy will force up prices at the supermarket. Can the minister please tell the Senate: what are the best ways to ensure Australians pay a fair price at the checkout?

                     Obviously, we are very focused on working to deliver cost-of-living relief because we understand Australians are doing it hard.

                     is focused on adopting Senator Nick McKim's supermarket economic policy. But, of course, there are sensible people over there who understand what this really means. Earlier this year, Senator Dean Smith said that divestiture powers are 'ill conceived'. Senator Hume said that there was 'concern' about 'whether they will actually decrease prices'. I agree with you, Senator. Senator Kovacic said, 'They could end up harming the people we are attempting to protect.' Former Liberal Premier Jeff Kennett said, 'This is madness'. This is what happens when a party forget who they are and adopt the Greens' economic policy. Congratulations, Senator McKim. Welcome to the shadow cabinet.
