         NetAlert
        </a>
        . The Government considers that the activities of NetAlert address the Committee’s recommendation concerning the establishment of a multimedia public education campaign on the risks associated with the safe use of information technology by children, including parental supervision.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government established NetAlert under the Online Content Scheme in December 1999 as an independent body to promote Internet safety, particularly for children, and to provide the community with sensible, helpful and reliable advice about family-safe use of the Internet. In addition to undertaking community education, advice and research activities, NetAlert functions as the designated statutory body for the purposes of the Online Content Scheme, requiring it to be consulted during the development of Internet industry codes and standards prior to registration by the ABA.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In the last three years NetAlert has undertaken a national multimedia campaign on a range of Internet safety issues, involving the establishment of an advisory website for parents, teachers and industry bodies and an interactive children’s website. NetAlert has distributed a range of materials containing Internet safety advice and information, including posters and brochures and has promoted its services through the broadcast of national radio and television community service announcements. NetAlert has developed and implemented the first phase of its CyberSafe Schools Project, a three-year initiative to educate school students across Australia about the safe and responsible use of the Internet.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition to these initiatives, NetAlert continues to operate its toll free Internet safety helpline and email advisory service.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        NetAlert has established a number of strategic alliances or partnerships with key Internet industry bodies, including the Internet Industry Association,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Society" rel="nofollow">
         Internet Society
        </a>
        of Australia, the Australian Telecommunications Users Group and the Service Providers Action Network.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As part of the Government’s National Child Protection Initiative election commitment, NetAlert will receive funding of $2 million to run a National CyberSafe Program (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCP" rel="nofollow">
         NCP
        </a>
        ) which will deliver a two-year targeted training roadshow and information campaign aimed at educating parents, teachers and community groups about online safety.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The funding to be provided to NetAlert for the NCP complements other funding being provided under the initiative to the

        ). The AFP will receive funding of $1.7 million for the continuation of its important education and prevention programs aimed at parents, teachers and relevant community groups. On 1 January 2005 the AFP received a total of $28.4 million over three and a half years under the National Child Protection Initiative to set up a national centre for major international and national referrals of child sex abuse material and images with the power and resources to target, infiltrate and shut-down organised online paedophile networks.

        ) have implemented the model computer offences in the MCCOC Report. The Government has repeatedly emphasised to States and Territories at Standing Committee of Attorneys-General meetings the importance of fulfilling their commitment to a national model criminal code by promptly implementing the proposals in MCCOC reports.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Part 10.7 of the Criminal Code provides that those who engage in the unauthorised use of a computer with the intention of committing a serious offence such as fraud are subject to the maximum penalty which applies to the serious offence they intend to commit. Part 10.7 also includes an unauthorised impairment of electronic communications offence which targets disruptive tactics such as 'denial of service attacks' with a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. Similarly, an offence of unauthorised modification of data to cause impairment to that data or any other data attracts a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Part 10.7 of the Criminal Code also contains offences directed at those who possess or trade in programs and technology designed to damage data in other people’s computer systems. The offences of possessing or supplying data with intent to commit a computer offence are subject to a maximum penalty of three years imprisonment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Other offences include unauthorised access to or modification of restricted data and unauthorised impairment of data held on a computer disk or other device; both of these offences attract a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment.

       <p class="italic">
        The Cybercrime Act 2001 also updated federal investigation powers in the

        1914 and the Customs Act 1901 to ensure they cater for the new electronic environment. Law enforcement officers executing a search warrant are able to search not only material on computers located on the search premises but also material accessible from those computers but located elsewhere. Officers also have enhanced powers to copy data and to move computer equipment and disks off the search premises.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition, law enforcement officers can apply to a magistrate for an assistance order, requiring a person with knowledge of a particular computer system to provide the officer with the assistance necessary to enable the officer to access, copy or convert data on the computer system.

         Credit and debit card skimming and Internet banking fraud
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee’s report highlights the growing incidence of credit and debit card skimming and Internet banking fraud. The Government has also taken steps to develop a nationally consistent legislative response to these issues.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In March 2004, the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General released the Model Criminal Code Officers’ Committee Discussion Paper on Credit Card Skimming Offences. The discussion paper identified a gap in federal, State and Territory laws in their coverage of credit and debit card skimming and included a model offence to address this gap. The model offence criminalises dishonestly obtaining or dealing in personal financial information without the consent of the person to whom the information relates. The model offence is drafted in technologically neutral terms to ensure that it will not be overtaken by developments in the techniques or equipment used to capture credit or debit card data or other personal financial information (such as a person’s username and password for Internet banking).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government has quickly implemented the model offence, together with offences which target the possession and importation of devices used to ‘skim’ data from credit and debit cards. These offences are included in the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Telecommunications Offences and Other Measures) Act (No.2) 2004 which commenced on 28 September 2004.
       </p>

         Recommendation 4
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee recommends that as part of its legislative package to detect and prosecute those who use information technology for the trade of child pornography, the Government introduce a new offence relating to luring and grooming children for sexual purposes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Accept
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government takes its responsibilities to safeguard Australia’s children from sexual predators very seriously and has already criminalised the practice known as ‘online grooming’. On 14 March 2004, the then Minister for Communications, Information and the Arts, the Hon Daryl Williams AM
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QC" rel="nofollow">
         QC
        </a>
        MP, and the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator the Hon Chris Ellison, released an exposure draft of the legislative package mentioned in the Committee’s recommendation for public comment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Following public consultation, the Government enacted the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Telecommunications Offences and Other Measures) Act (No.2) 2004. This Act provides for an offence regime targeting adult offenders who exploit the anonymity of telecommunications services (for example, the Internet) to win the trust of a child as a first step towards the future sexual abuse of that child.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The ‘grooming’ offences prescribe maximum penalties of imprisonment for 12 years. The ‘procuring’ offences impose maximum penalties of imprisonment of 15 years. The offence regime operates nationwide in the same way that the other telecommunications offences targeting persons who access, transmit or make available child pornography or child abuse material.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The offences target both these steps. Relevant legislation in Queensland and the United Kingdom was considered in developing the offence regime. Where appropriate the proposed offences are consistent with the existing federal child sex tourism offences in Part IIIA of the Crimes Act 1914.

        has also implemented strategies that address this recommendation which included the part time secondment of an intelligence analyst to the AHTCC in February 2005 for a period of six months. Through the Australian Law Enforcement Intelligence Net (ALEIN) and the Australian Criminal Intelligence Database (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID" rel="nofollow">
         ACID
        </a>
        ) the ACC has in place a mechanism for the efficient and effective sharing of information/intelligence with the Australian law enforcement community. Of particular note is the ACC’s maintenance of a ‘National Fraud Desk’ which operates with funding arrangements under the Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA). One of the new joint-initiatives of the ACC and the AHTCC is the proposed development of a new information and intelligence desk for ALEIN on high tech crime. Subject to security and privacy requirements, and consistent with the dissemination powers of the ACC, information held in ALEIN desks is communicated to financial institutions through mechanisms such as the Fraud Desk ‘fortnightly digest’.

       <p class="italic">
        In addition to meeting its statutory responsibility through the provision of the services offered by ALEIN/ACID (see response to recommendation 5 above), the ACC has recently commenced an intelligence scoping project that examines a wide range of fraud issues affecting the financial sector, including consideration of the role of cybercrime. The Major Fraud probe is identifying a range of fraud related issues that have/are emerging in the high-tech area. This will culminate in the development of a Strategic Criminal Intelligence Assessment which identified key threats to Australian law enforcement. The ACC’s role in developing National Criminal Intelligence Priorities for consideration by the ACC Board provides opportunities to identify intelligence gaps and to seek to address them in collaboration with a range of partners through the ACC-managed ‘National Criminal Intelligence Collection Requirements’.

        The AHTCC is responsible for implementing the Australian E-Crime Strategy, which has as one of its core features joint training and interoperability of specialised high tech crime and computer forensic units. As part of its commitment to this objective, the AHTCC hosted the second annual AHTCC/AFP Forensic Computing and Computer Investigations Workshop in March 2005 to provide specialist training courses for high tech crime practitioners across all Australian state police forces, Commonwealth revenue, regulatory and enforcement agencies and selected private sector organisations with an interest in this type of matter. The workshop participants examined and discussed critical issues that arise in responding to incidents related to computer investigations and contemporary computer forensic practice, including innovative tools, latest software updates and gaps. The AHTCC is examining a range of training options to improve the skill of
