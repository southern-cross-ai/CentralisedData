        (B) when accounting for total remuneration, including overtime and bonuses, the real gap is wider, with men earning $25,679, or 20.8%, more than women each year on average,

       <p class="italic">

           The government has acted on this issue by providing an additional $8.6 million to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGEA" rel="nofollow">
            WGEA
           </a>
           to improve workplace gender reporting. This funding will allow organisations, including the public sector, to report to the WGEA. The Fair Work system, as introduced by the former Labor government, already incorporates the principle of equal remuneration in setting safety net terms and conditions and provides mechanisms to ensure the independent Fair Work Commission can adjust terms and conditions, including on work value grounds.

              Labor will vote for this motion on the basis that it reflects principles that are important to Australian women. Labor is acutely aware of the issues confronting Australian women at work and the continuing significance of the gender pay gap. Indeed, in the last two parliaments Labor has been instrumental in driving consideration of these issues in this place. While we support the motion, which in part (b) essentially reproduces the policy Labor took to the last election, we make the following obvious point. Labor revisits its policies at every election. Labor will release detailed costed policies prior to the next election, including policies in relation to women's economic security. Unlike the Greens, as a party of government, we take responsibility for ensuring that our announced policies are affordable and able to be implemented. The next election will be no different.
