        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Health, Senator Nash. I refer to the minister's answer yesterday that National Party policy goes on to form coalition policy. I also refer to the 2013 coalition health policy to fund 50 per cent growth funding of the efficient price of hospital services. Will the government honour this coalition commitment?

         The first commitment that the coalition is going to honour is fixing the economic mess that you left us after your period in government, and we are going to ensure that we do that. It is this side of the chamber that is going to honour their commitments when it comes to health. It is this side of the chamber that is going to honour their commitment to ensure a sustainable health system into the future.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Can the minister advise what percentage of growth funding of the efficient price the government will fund. And doesn't the failure to meet the pre-election commitment to fund 50 per cent represent a cut of more than $50 billion to public hospitals?

           The specific I will take on notice. What I can tell senators is the fact that, far from cutting funding to hospitals, we are actually increasing it. As I said yesterday—perhaps those opposite were not listening—we are actually going to increase hospital funding by nine per cent in 2014-15, by nine per cent the year after that, by nine per cent the year after that, by six per cent the year after that. There is $70 billion going into hospitals over the forward estimates, going from $14 billion to $18.9 billion. So, far from cutting funding to hospitals, we are increasing it.

            , I ask a further supplementary question. Following the government's decision to tear up the national partnership agreement on improving public hospital services, can the minister confirm that the government is walking away from the National Elective Surgery Target? Does the minister agree with the

             We are not walking away from our requirement to ensure that health improves through our hospitals and through the arrangements that we have with the states. We will ensure that. The

             that the senator refers to fell down in many areas, which is why it was not continued. It is this government that is going to have appropriate arrangements in place ensuring that we have responsible allocation for funding for better outcomes in our hospitals. It is this government that is going to commit to do that and not those opposite.
