        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Minister Payne. Minister, the

         US
        </a>
        government sought extradition of Australian citizen

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        for espionage. Espionage is a political offence for which extradition is expressly barred from the US-UK extradition treaty. Minister, given the political nature of the extradition, have you personally made representations to the incoming Biden administration to drop the US appeal against the UK court decision to not extradite Mr Assange? If not, will you?

         I thank Senator Rice for her question. Senator Rice, as I believe I have advised the chamber previously, I have raised the situation of Mr Assange with my previous United States counterpart, the former
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State" rel="nofollow">
          Secretary of State

         , Mr Pompeo. I have not yet met with the new Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, but I'm sure that in the course of such a meeting this matter would be raised.

There were reports that the Trump administration in the latter days of the Trump term was close to pardoning Assange and may have done so if they had received representations from the Australian government. Will you pick up the phone to the incoming Biden administration?

            As I again have previously advised the chamber, Mr Assange is subject to a legal process in another country. Australia does not interfere in the legal processes of other countries and has long held that position across multiple governments, as we would not expect other governments to interfere in legal processes in our country. Mr Assange is currently the subject of a
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
             US
            </a>
            appeal against the decision of the British courts that he is ineligible for extradition due to the court forming a view in relation to a risk of self-harm in the US prison. That appeal was lodged on 12 February. I don't intend to provide a running commentary on the details of the case, as it is before the courts. We continue to monitor Mr Assange's case closely, as we do for Australians in detention overseas.

               Julian Assange
              </a>
              has suffered so much, and the judge in the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
               UK
              </a>
              case has basically said that extradition to the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
               US
              </a>
              is effectively a death sentence. The
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
               UN
              </a>
              's special rapporteur on torture has said that the failure of the judgement to denounce and redress the persecution and torture of Mr Assange 'leaves fully intact the intended intimidating effect on journalists and whistleblowers'. So is it the Australian government's position that extraditing Julian Assange to the US is acceptable?

               met with Mr Assange's legal team in this sitting period to discuss a range of matters, including the matter of Mr Assange. This government has sought, through our consular officials and through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the high commission in Britain, to support Mr Assange in an appropriate consular fashion in any way we could. We have done that by seeking his consent to discuss any prison condition issues with prison officials, to offer him consular assistance; we have done that on 21 separate occasions. On 21 separate occasions, no response has been received to that correspondence from Mr Assange or from his representatives.
