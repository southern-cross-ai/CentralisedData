                     may, Senator Anning, I didn't interject on you on this serious issue. It does reflect the seriousness of that report that the two parties of government have co-sponsored a foreign policy motion. It would be a good statement about the bipartisan view as to the need to respond to the serious war crimes and serious violations of human rights which have been documented in the

                     Senator Anning, I appreciate you have different views about different areas where the Senate should deal with these issues. We have previously placed on record, consistent with the position that has been in place for some time, that foreign policy questions that are complex and contested—and many of the ones to which you refer have been contested—given the nature of this part of the program where one cannot amend and there is not substantive debate, are not an appropriate vehicle for formal business. If you wish to deny formality for the reasons you've outlined, I think, frankly, that reflects upon you, Senator Anning.

                        We join with the opposition in seeking to put on the record that this is a rare and important moment when the opposition and the government both agree on something as important as this particular foreign policy matter. The issues that have been raised in the report are very, very serious violations, and we believe that it is extremely important that the Australian government, along with the Australian opposition, make a united statement condemning the actions as reported by the

                         Just to facilitate discussion, I'm happy to move suspension. I ask Senator Anning: will he require such suspension given he's had the opportunity to put his view on the record, given that there are quite a number of other senators including on the crossbench who have motions before the chamber to be dealt with and that will obviously cut into the time for the Senate to deal with this prior to us rising for a few weeks, so I seek clarity from him as to how he wishes to proceed.
