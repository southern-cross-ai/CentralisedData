        <p>
         by leaveâ€”I want to speak briefly to the part of the motion asking that the bills be taken together, and I believe I can. I make the point that the Democrats had requested that these bills not be taken together, that they be dealt with separately. They both deal with substantial and significant taxation matters. Certainly we do not wish to delay passage of them, but, given that they deal with substantial and significant matters each in their own right, we believe they each merit individual examination through the second reading stage. I want to record that as our preference. I am not going to go on at length about it, but I think it is preferable that convention applies: that, if a senator does not want them to be taken together, it not happen unless there are compelling circumstances. I do not think any exist in this case. I simply want to put that on the record. Senator Murray will nonetheless speak to them both in as much detail as he can, but we would prefer it if they were separated.
