           for the work that he is doing to make sure that people on the cashless debit card move along the pathway to employment. This is really important, because in his own words, the government does not believe that the cashless debit card is a destination; it is a tool to help people take control of their own lives, become job ready and get into work. Having a meaningful job is what we believe can be a destination for all working-age Australians.

            CDC
           </a>
           . I'm pleased to update the Senate that the transition in Cape York has now been completed, with all 88 people using the BasicsCard now across onto the cashless debit card.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Families Responsibilities Commission does a fantastic job in Cape York to help their people stabilise their lives. I was fortunate enough to see some of the commission's hearings while I was there, where a lady in the community actually chose to go on to the cashless debit card, to have some of her social security payment quarantined so that she could pay for the maintenance of her home. In fact, she was one of 47 people in the cape who volunteered to go on the card. Those are people who are not required to be on it; they have done so voluntarily.
          </p>
          <p>
           In the Northern Territory to date we've seen 108 people make the switch from the BasicsCard to the cashless debit card. While I was in Darwin I was fortunate enough to sit with somebody who went through the process at the Casuarina Service Centre. He told me that he wanted to make the switch because the CDC is a debit

           card, which would allow him to pay his bills online and have more independence over the settings on his budget.
          </p>
          <p>
           We will continue to work to ensure that people in the Northern Territory are armed with factual information about the cashless debit card.

               The cashless debit card is a debit visa card, and it works just the same as any other key card in your purse or your wallet. The only distinction is that you cannot buy alcohol or most gambling products, or get cash. It can be used in over a million shops across Australia and can be used online, in comparison to the just 17,000 outlets which accept the BasicsCard. The cashless debit card, unlike the BasicsCard, can be used at pubs, clubs, restaurants and cafes to buy meals and non-alcoholic drinks. It can also be used to buy lotto tickets and scratchies. The government wants participants to have choice and freedom, and we have no issue at all with people who want to buy beer or have a punt from time to time. This program is about helping people to stabilise their lives, become job ready and, hopefully, get back into the workforce.

                  Overwhelmingly, we heard that people were really excited about the fact that they can use their cashless debit card when they travel, whether it be to Cairns, to Sydney, to Adelaide, to Perth or anywhere else. But the other issue they raised a number of times was the misinformation that is out there. The opposition are running an absolutely shameful scare campaign aimed at age pensioners. They are lying to them. Let me be absolutely crystal clear. The government has no plan to force age pensioners on to the cashless debit card, and we will never have such a plan.

                    The cashless debit card is for working-age payments to help people stabilise their lives, become job ready and get back into the workforce. Those opposite must cease telling Australians lies. They must tell the truth, which is something that they are not doing at the moment.
