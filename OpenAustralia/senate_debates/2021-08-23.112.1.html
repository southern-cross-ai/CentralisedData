             I thank the senator for her question and acknowledge her interest. The Tokyo Paralympics begin tomorrow with the holding of the opening ceremony and run through to 5 September. I don't know about other senators, but I am certainly looking forward to watching these

             , just as many Australians watched and enjoyed the Olympics that occurred just recently, and the pride of Australia from a Paralympics perspective will be on show for the world to see.
            </p>
            <p>
             These Paralympics offer another important opportunity for Australians to unite and celebrate the individual efforts of athletes who've overcome some extraordinary odds. Paralympians, in particular, have done that. Athletes will be representing 163 nations and competing across 22 sports. Just like their Olympic counterparts, this Paralympic team are a source of inspiration to absolutely every one of us. Australia's team in Tokyo will be the largest ever at an overseas Paralympics and the biggest since Sydney in 2000, with 179 athletes. They will compete in 18 sports, including the debut disciplines of para-taekwondo and para-badminton. The team includes soon-to-be seven-time Paralympians Danni Di Toro and

                   The Paralympics and our para-athletes, as I've said, are an inspiration to us all, as well as elite athletes in their respective sports. These athletes have some extraordinary tales of hardship that they've overcome to be competing in these games. They are an enormous demonstration of how sport and physical activity can play an important role in our lives and, in some circumstances, give an opportunity that would not exist otherwise. That's very much the case with the story of some of our para-athletes. They have opportunities that they would not have otherwise had. I say to all Australians: I hope you enjoy the 2020 Paralympics. I look forward to watching them and I look forward to cheering on our athletes to do their best, as I know that they're aspiring to do, over the next few weeks.
