        representing the Minister for

         Natural Disaster

        and Emergency Management. On the last sitting day of last year, I asked the then minister,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridget_McKenzie" rel="nofollow">
         Bridget McKenzie

        , if Australia had sufficient aerial firefighting capability. The answer was yes. As we all know, there was not enough capability, and the federal government and states had to substantially boost the aerial firefighting fleet and associated costs by leasing additional planes and sourcing crews from overseas. The delay most certainly hampered the firefighting capability. Minister, given that the economic cost of the bushfires is estimated by economists to exceed $100 billion and that due to climate change we are likely to have more horrific seasonal fires, isn't it now time for government to invest in a fleet of permanent large air tankers owned and operated by Australia?

         I thank Senator Griff for the question and also for his passion and commitment on this very important issue for our nation. The first point to make is that the Australian government doesn't specify the type or number of firefighting aircraft for professional fire and emergency services representatives in the states and territories. However, what we do is take advice, and we work extremely cooperatively with the states and territories, through the National Aerial Firefighting Centre, which advises the Commonwealth and state and territory governments every year about the assets that are required.
        </p>
        <p>
         Traditionally, firefighting assets—aircraft in this case—have been leased for a number of reasons. The first one is the very high cost of purchasing and maintaining these specialist aircraft. There's the fact that the Australian bushfire season, while growing longer, generally mirrors the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Hemisphere
         </a>
         's bushfire seasons. But also, and really importantly operationally, is that leasing them gives us much greater flexibility in terms of the aircraft that we need to lease every year to meet the particular demands of the bushfires then. It also allows us to make better use of technology, as it is emerging quite rapidly in this area.
        </p>
        <p>
         I reject the part of your question that says we didn't have enough this year. According to the experts, we did. We were asked for support for one additional large aerial tanker, and we provided funding straight away for four as soon as we were asked for that. Although some firefighting aircraft are shared with the Northern Hemisphere, as I have described, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAFC" rel="nofollow">
          NAFC
         </a>
         will contract 169 specialist aircraft across the country this year. But it's important to note that three-quarters of those already remain here in Australia and are largely contracted and owned by the state and territory governments.

           After the recent tragic crash of the Lockheed C-130 Hercules, Coulson Aviation grounded all their air tankers in Australia for a period as a safety precaution and a mark of respect. Whilst it was understandable that the company would do this, it demonstrated the risks in outsourcing Australia's ability to protect itself during extreme bushfires. Minister, do you seriously consider outsourcing aerial firefighting to be a wise decision for the country?

            I totally and utterly reject the premise of that question. There is absolutely no evidence that that tragic crash of the aircraft and the loss of three American firefighters—who were also, I note, veterans—had anything to do with the nature of the contracts themselves.

            An honourable senator: They're grounded.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'll take that interjection. Of course it's grounded. We always do that after any accident to take precautions. But the point is this—and I actually thank and acknowledge all of the air crews, because, as I said, this is a highly specialised skill that very few people globally have. It is dangerous work and the crews and the pilots are very skilled. They are brave and we should be acknowledging more their specialist skills. I entirely reject the premise of that question, Senator Griff.

               Senator Griff, in short, the answer is no, and there are very good reasons for that. Aerial firefighting is, as I've said, a very specialist core expertise which does not in any way reflect what, in this case, the ADF pilots of fixed-wing and rotary-wing air assets are for. Our air crews—Army,
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
                Air Force
               </a>
               and Navy—have done an extraordinary job supporting the bushfires and supporting the bushfire volunteers and
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SES" rel="nofollow">
                SES
               </a>
               by doing what they do best—doing logistics, doing transport—and they are not specialist bushfire pilots. That's why we contract and engage them, mostly here in Australia and some from overseas.

                 I thank Senator Fawcett for that question. Since September last year, the ADF has been making a significant contribution to the bushfire crisis response. The outstanding skills, the dedication and the compassion of our ADF members has shone through during this extraordinarily challenging time for our nation. Operation Bushfire Assist has been the largest mobilisation of the ADF in our nation's history for a domestic crisis. Over 6½ thousand ADF personnel during this time have been deployed. That includes 3,000 reservists. The statistics themselves are absolutely extraordinary: three naval ships; 24

                 helicopters; 900 Defence vehicles; 75 engineering vehicles; three water purification units; 7,900 personnel and over 2½ thousand tonnes of cargo were moved; 1,500 people, many with their beloved pets, were evacuated by ship and also by air; 500 people were accommodated on Defence bases and 380 have now been transferred back to Mallacoota; there was clearance of 3,000 kilometres of roads, 240 kilometres of fire breaks and also 430 kilometres of fences; delivery of 4.5 million litres of water, 70,000 litres of fuel and 730,000 kilograms of fodder; and 48,000 meals were served to evacuees and emergency services personnel in Defence messes and another 6,000 out in the field for emergency services. These statistics demonstrate the magnitude of the effort, but they do not describe the thousands of acts of compassion and care by our ADF members around the clock every day to communities across the nation.

                    REYNOLDS (—) (): Thank you again, Senator Fawcett. In November last year, as the Minister for Defence, I requested that the Governor-General authorise a limited call-out as a validation exercise in case the bushfire season required a much larger call-out. Sadly, that came to pass. On 4 January this year we announced a compulsory call-out of up to 3,000 Army reservists, which allowed
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDF" rel="nofollow">
                     CDF
                    </a>
                    to direct reservists to perform full-time service, which was also service that protected their employment.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    While reservists have always been part of the nation's response to disasters, their contributions have always been voluntary, at reserve conditions of service. While the call-out will now cease on 7 February, hundreds, if not thousands, of reservists will continue to serve on Operation Bushfire Assist on a voluntary basis. I thank all reservists, and particularly their families and their employers, for making this service possible.

                       The government has been overwhelmed with offers of support from all over the world. In fact, 70 nations of our allies and our partners have offered generous military support and assistance this bushfire season. Today, we still have over 300 international military representatives working side by side with our ADF to support our activities. We've got two Singaporean helicopters and 40 personnel, and three
