         I thank Senator Hanson-Young for her question. I can advise Senator Hanson-Young that Senator Wong has not commissioned such a risk assessment. I would refer the senator to the options that were submitted by Senator Wong’s department to the Senate inquiry into the Lower Lakes. The Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council has taken the first of those options as the best short-term measure—that is, pumping water from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Alexandrina" rel="nofollow">
          Lake Alexandrina
         </a>
         to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Albert" rel="nofollow">
          Lake Albert
         </a>
         to prevent the acidification of Lake Albert. I can say that I am advised that this is currently proving effective. On the best available advice, it is likely to be effective until at least February 2009, and its effectiveness beyond that depends on a number of factors, obviously including rainfall. Senator Wong has indicated that, consistent with the wishes of local communities, it is important to avoid any precipitous decision in respect of the lakes, so I would refer the senator, as well, to a statement by the Prime Minister that was made on 14 August in respect of this issue. The Prime Minister said:

        <p class="italic">
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cabinet" rel="nofollow">
          The Cabinet
         </a>
         confirmed that if the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
          South Australian
         </a>
         Government, based on the advice of experts, finds that it has become absolutely necessary to open the Lakes to sea water, the Commonwealth will consider any such proposals.
        </p>
        <p>
         The South Australian government has not come to that conclusion.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am sure that Senator Hanson-Young will be aware of the fact that, in the absence of very significant rain, there are no easy options in relation to this matter; there are just hard choices. Senator Hanson-Young, of course, will also be aware that there is very little water available to the system and many demands on that water for drinking, for other precious environmental sites and, of course, also for irrigation. I can say that, as the Senate inquiry has heard, even if there were water readily available upstream, a great deal of it would be lost in transmission through what is, of course, a very parched Murray-Darling Basin.
        </p>
        <p>
         I should also remind the Senate that, in addition to the pumping activities currently underway, the Commonwealth government has committed $200 million to the South Australian government for an enduring solution to the problems facing the Lower Lakes and Coorong, with $10 million immediately available to accelerate projects for the Lower Lakes and Coorong. And, of course, the government has committed an additional $120 million for piping works to connect towns, communities and irrigators currently relying on the Lower Lakes to a higher point on the Murray.

          , I thank the minister for his answer and ask a supplementary question. Given the current inquiry into the Coorong and Lower Lakes has heard that flooding the lakes with salt water may have devastating ecological effects, has the minister received advice on the long-term effects on the groundwater in the Fleurieu region? Where does the minister suggest that the extra 350 gigalitres of fresh water, which is required even if we are to open the floodgates to sea water to ensure that we dilute the sea water in those lakes in order to avoid a hyper-saline environment, come from? Will the minister consider this advice? Will the minister commission a risk assessment?

           I thank Senator Hanson-Young for her supplementary question. Senator, I will need to seek advice from the minister, Senator Wong, in relation to those technical elements of your supplementary question and I will certainly endeavour to do that as soon as I am able to.
