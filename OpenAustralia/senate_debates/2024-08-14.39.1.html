        We've all heard the name 'Landcare'. Over the last 35 years, Landcare groups have done an enormous job in protecting and enhancing our environment. As co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Landcare, I've had the pleasure of engaging with many volunteers across Australia and have seen the positive environmental and agricultural impacts these groups have. From collecting rubbish and planting trees to caring for rivers and supporting the habitat of threatened species, volunteers are actively caring for their local communities every single day.
       </p>
       <p>
        Landcare originated in Victoria in 1986, through the initiative of former Premier the late

        and the late
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heather_Mitchell" rel="nofollow">

        , the first female president of the Victorian Farmers Federation. Three years later, Landcare was established nationally by

        </a>
        , the former Prime Minister, and his government, who were staunch supporters of the movement. This friendship continues today in this building.
       </p>
       <p>
        Landcare supports over 6,000 groups and more than 140,000 volunteers, all playing their part in sustainable agricultural practices and conservation, with farmers and activists, environmentalists, all working together. In celebration of Landcare Week,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landcare_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Landcare Australia
        </a>
        unveiled a new $300,000 community grants initiative. This program is open to all Landcare and community groups across Australia, to deliver projects that will address priority issues such as restoring wildlife habitat and purchasing plants and equipment. I encourage all groups to apply before the 30 September deadline.
       </p>
       <p>
        Let's all celebrate the work Landcare does across Australia and let's thank every single volunteer that is involved. Regardless of where you live, find your local group and join the movement. Current and future generations will be better off, and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Nature" rel="nofollow">

        will certainly thank us in return.
