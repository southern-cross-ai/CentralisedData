        My question is the first in this chamber to the new Minister for the Arts and Sport, the affable and the highly competent Senator the Hon. George Brandis

         I thank Senator Lightfoot for the question and acknowledge his longstanding interest in sport as in so many other areas of Australian public policy. I am pleased to announce that last Thursday—

          Senators on my left, I think at least you should give a new minister the courtesy of hearing his answer.

           As I was saying, last Thursday, 1 February 2007, the UNE

           </a>
           O International Convention Against Doping in Sport came into force. This is a milestone which reflects well on Australia’s reputation as being at the forefront of the fight against doping in sport. Australia has been a strong supporter of the convention and played an active role in its development, with representation on the drafting group. The convention was adopted by member states during
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO" rel="nofollow">
            UNESCO
           </a>
           ’s general conference in Paris on 19 October 2005. Subsequently, on 17 January 2006, Australia became one of the first nations to accede to the convention. On 11 December 2006, Luxembourg became the 30th country to ratify the convention, reaching the threshold of 30 ratifications as required by UNESCO procedures. It follows that the convention entered into force on 1 February.
          </p>
          <p>
           The entry into force of this convention is an excellent outcome for athletes and sports fans worldwide. It sends a clear message that the international community will not tolerate cheating and that the nations will take all steps to ensure that cheats do not get onto the winners’ rostrum. Parties to the convention make a commitment to implementing the World Anti-Doping Code and taking specific action in a number of additional areas, including: restrictions on the availability of prohibited substances or methods to athletes; support for doping controls and national testing programs; the withholding of financial support from athletes and athlete support personnel who commit antidoping rule violations; encouragement for producers and distributors of nutritional supplements to establish best practice in the labelling, marketing and distribution of products which might contain prohibited substances; and the provision of antidoping education to athletes and the wider sporting community. The important role played by the Australian government in the entry into force of the UNESCO convention is yet another achievement by this government in the fight against doping in sport.
          </p>
          <p>
           On 14 March 2006, the Australian government launched the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASADA" rel="nofollow">
            ASADA
           </a>
           —a single, dedicated focal point for combating the use of drugs in sport. Its functions include providing education for athletes and support personnel in relation to antidoping matters, undertaking antidoping testing, investigating potential additional sports doping violations, presentation of cases against an athlete or support person alleged to have committed an antidoping violation, and various other matters.
          </p>
          <p>
           I was asked if I am aware of any alternative policies. I am but they are slight, because a search of the website of the shadow minister for sport and recreation, Senator Lundy, reveals the existence of three documents germane to the question of drugs in sport. The first is Labor’s sport policy for the campaign of 2004, which contains a number of platitudinal statements; the second is a media release by Senator Lundy on 23 July 2004; and the most recent is a media release by Senator Lundy on the issue on 29 June 2005. One year, seven months and seven days have gone by since the shadow minister last interested herself on behalf of the opposition in the question of drugs in sport.
