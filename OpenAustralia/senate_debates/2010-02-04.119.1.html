           This is a very serious accusation being made by Senator Minchin so I want to make it very, very clear: I utterly reject your allegation and for the following reasons. I know that Senator Minchin enjoyed the portfolio and that he had other things on his mind. On 9 April last year, we revealed the secret that the evaluation panel recommended no-one was value for money. It has taken nearly nine months for you to allege that what I said in February of last year was misleading the parliament. Now either it was a serious mislead nine months ago and you were not paying attention, or you are simply so empty—

            Order! Senator Conroy, address your comments to the chair and not across the chamber. Shouting across the chamber at any time in the Senate is completely disorderly.

             Let me be clear: I utterly reject this assertion. If you wanted to make this assertion, the time to do it was nine months ago. I appreciate that you were not paying any attention to the portfolio nine months ago. We revealed on April 9 that there was no value for money in any of the recommendations and that it was given to us on January 20. Either it was a serious mislead back then, Senator Minchin—

                  , I ask a supplementary question. Given the Auditor-General’s finding that non-Telstra proposals were likely to present significant risks, including the payment of billions in compensation to Telstra, why did the minister tell the Senate in February that he was still confident of signing a contract when Telstra had been excluded from the tender in the previous December?

                   The danger of reading the commentary here is that you do not bother to go and read the actual report. When you read the conclusions of the Auditor-General’s report, he gives a complete exoneration of the process.

                      Again, the conclusion does not support the question you have just put. It is very simple. Even more informative is that the Auditor-General did not recommend one single thing. He made a number of recommendations after you had completed the T3 float, Senator Minchin, and on a whole range of other government programs that had been completed, but he did not make one single recommendation. There is no basis for you to make the claims you have made in these questions. You continue to be out of your depth and it is a relief you have been moved.
