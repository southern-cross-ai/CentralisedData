        My question is to Senator Kemp, the Minister for the Arts and Sport. Is the minister aware that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">
         AFL
        </a>
        ’s antidoping policy gives players two chances to test positive to illegal drugs before they are sanctioned or their names are made public? Can the minister advise whether this policy complies with the World Anti-Doping Authority code? Can the minister also indicate whether the AFL have met the antidoping requirements of their own policy, the policies of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Sports_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Sports Commission
        </a>
        or the rules of the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority? Didn’t the minister himself also note last week that the AFL’s practice was out of step with community expectations? If the minister is concerned, can he advise the Senate of any action he has taken to ensure that the AFL comply with their own rules, the rules of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASC" rel="nofollow">
         ASC
        </a>
        and those of the Sports Anti-Doping Authority, and stop undermining the government’s zero tolerance approach to drugs in sport?

           Senator Ray thinks it is funny, but I tell you, Senator Ray, this is a serious topic. Senator Lundy, if you can just cast your mind back perhaps 1½ years or so, you will recall there was a significant debate regarding whether the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">
            AFL
           </a>
           and a number of other professional sporting codes would become
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WADA" rel="nofollow">
            WADA
           </a>
           compliant. After a bit of public debate, the AFL decided that they would become WADA compliant. So as far as I know, Senator Lundy, the AFL, along with every other major sporting organisation in Australia, is WADA compliant.
          </p>
          <p>
           What has happened is that the AFL—and they are to be congratulated for this—have an additional testing code. So, on top of their WADA compliance, they do tests for certain drugs out of competition. We welcome that; we think that is important. The debate, however, that is occurring is whether the sanctions under that additional testing arrangement are sufficient and whether the reporting requirements are sufficient. We welcome the lead the AFL has taken, but from my point of view—and, I suspect, from your point of view, Senator Lundy, judging from the tone of your question—the sanctions and the reporting arrangements are out of touch with community expectations. They are not seen to be rigorous enough. I think sporting clubs want to know the names of the players, and I have called on the AFL, as you would be aware, to have another look at their code—which, as I said, is in addition to the WADA code—and look more closely at how the sanctions are applied and how the reporting arrangements are applied.
          </p>
          <p>
           So I hope that the AFL will do that. I think there has been significant public debate on this issue. I think the AFL have got the chance to show some very real leadership in this area. I hope that they will grasp that chance, Senator Lundy, because with a major sporting code like the AFL it is important that they do set an example for the rest of the community. They are WADA compliant. They have put in place an additional regime. I think the fact of the matter is that there is a very good chance for them now to take some very strong action in this area and take a real lead in Australia.

            , I ask a supplementary question. How does the minister respond to the concerns of Australian International Olympic Committee member Mr Kevan Gosper that the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">
             AFL
            </a>
            ’s actions will damage Australia’s international reputation in the fight against drugs in sport? If the minister is concerned, can he explain what he has done to ensure that Australia’s reputation is not damaged by the failure of the AFL to meet the requirements of the World Anti-Doping Code or indeed community standards?

             One of the things I have done is make sure that when Labor senators make outlandish claims they are appropriately corrected in this chamber. I will not take you back over that particular history, Senator Lundy; that may be a debate for another day. I have made it very clear to the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">
              AFL
             </a>
             what my views are on this particular matter. The AFL are
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WADA" rel="nofollow">
              WADA
             </a>
             compliant. The AFL have signed up to the WADA code, and that is very important. But in my view, with the additional testing that they do, the AFL can now take a real lead, look more closely at their sanctions and have some tougher sanctions and a more open and transparent reporting process.
