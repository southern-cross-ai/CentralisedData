             ) Bill and then immediately moved to the next report. I know that Senator Macdonald has been waiting patiently to speak to the report—he has been here for over an hour. I am not blaming anyone, but I am a little puzzled. Senator McEwen went straight from one report to another while Senator Macdonald was seeking the call, but he did not obtain it. Can the Clerk provide some advice on that, because my understanding is that Senator Macdonald is entitled to speak to the report.

               I am told it is now tonight. Madam Acting Deputy President, if Senator Macdonald wants to talk to his whip, we can have a chat to our whip and we will see if we can progress something, but we do not normally grant leave for bills and we certainly do not grant leave on the same day we are bringing the bill on for debate. An agreement about a limited debate on the bill would seem to me to be seeking to undermine that debate. I am happy to suggest that Senator MacDonald talk to his whip who can then talk to our whip. We might come back if there is some sort of arrangement that they want to make.
