         by leave—The government would have been willing to support the motion of Senator Milne in relation to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministerial_Conference" rel="nofollow">
          Ministerial Conference
         </a>
         on Environment and Development, had it not been limited to delegates from Treasury and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_the_Environment" rel="nofollow">
          Department of the Environment
         </a>
         , Water, Heritage and the Arts. The government has a strong interest in promoting green growth in the Asia-Pacific region. An amendment was proposed that would have broadened the terms of the motion to take a whole-of-government approach. It would have given the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts a coordinating role while allowing the flexibility to involve a range of officials from relevant agencies. Senator Milne was not willing to allow such flexibility and was unwilling to amend her motion in this way. Instead, she preferred a more prescriptive approach, which the government considered impractical; hence our vote against such a motion.
