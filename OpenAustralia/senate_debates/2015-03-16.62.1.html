        My question without notice is to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Senator Ronaldson, representing the Minister for Industry and Science. Will the minister update the Senate on the government's industry programs, particularly the progress of the new Industry Growth Centres Initiative? Further, could he explain how this initiative will help business, including small business, to develop and create more jobs?

         I thank Senator Bernardi most sincerely for his question and acknowledge his longstanding interest in Adelaide industry. It is always nice to get a question in relation to industry because, funnily enough, there has not been a question this year from those opposite—in fact, not a question since 7 July last year. When you worry about and wonder about who is actually interested in industry, it is Senator Bernardi—versus Senator Carr, who has not bothered asking a question since 7 July last year.
        </p>
        <p>
         Indeed, I say to Senator Bernardi that, as he would be aware—and across his own state—there is an economic transition occurring. What the government want to do is to ensure that we provide industry with the opportunity to face its challenges, take the lead and create jobs in areas of Australia's economic strengths. We are transitioning from a nation that was built on farming, an economy based on farming, which then developed into manufacturing and commodities and is now turning to high-value-add sectors based on research and innovation. To keep creating jobs in the future, Australia must play to its global economic strengths.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Bernardi referred to the Industry Growth Centres Initiative. It is $188.5 million which will establish five growth centres in key industry sectors, Senator Bernardi: advanced manufacturing; food and agribusiness; medical technologies and pharmaceuticals; mining equipment, technology and services; and oil, gas and energy resources. A significant goal for these organisations will be to forge better links between industry and Australia's world-class researchers and maximise the return on this nation's $9.2 billion annual investment in science and—

          , I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister, and I ask if he would update the Senate on other programs available to help industry transition. How will the government's wider programs assist industry to become more competitive and to create jobs?

           I again thank Senator Bernardi for that very, very important question. There are a number of innovations of this government, including the Prime Minister's $400 million Industry Innovation and Competitiveness Agenda, which aims to build on our economic strengths by improving—

            these are notions, of course, Senator, which are foreign to those opposite—productivity, rewarding entrepreneurship and enabling business to create more jobs going forward.
           </p>
           <p>
            The $188.5 million Industry Growth Centres Initiative, which I mentioned earlier, sits within the industry and science portfolio and again is a very, very important part of this. In addition to the growth centres, other industry programs include the $484 million Entrepreneurs' Infrastructure Program, together with targeted programs such as the $155 million Growth Fund and the $50 million Manufacturing Transition Program. We are determined to ensure that Australian industry is best placed to create these jobs.

              can just refer back very briefly to my previous answer, I want to talk about a company such as Cochlear, who recently tripled their half-year profits and, in a letter to Minister Macfarlane in relation to the Industry Innovation and Competitiveness Agenda, said it 'demonstrates the importance of linking science with industry' and it is 'a win for jobs, exports and education, and a major step forward on the path to a smart Australia'.
             </p>
             <p>
              Obviously this agenda and this approach are completely at odds with those opposite in their six years, with a minister who was in and out on three occasions. There was absolutely no continuity of policy under the
