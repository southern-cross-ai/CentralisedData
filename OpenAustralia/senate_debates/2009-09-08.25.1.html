        My question is to the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator Carr. Can the minister advise the Senate on the recent performance of Australian industry, with particular reference to the steel industry? To what extent does the government’s stimulus strategy underpin that performance? Is the minister aware of any industry feedback on the strategy, and in particular—

                Manufacturing is growing again, and demand for steel has risen each month since May. These are things that have not happened by accident. They have happened as a result of the government’s stimulus strategy. It is a strategy that those opposite have opposed right down the line. They have happened because this government is prepared to fight for Australian industry and for Australian jobs. They have happened because we are ready to work with industry to generate new investment and employment opportunities. A major employer,
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OneSteel" rel="nofollow">
                 OneSteel
                </a>
                , has said:
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                We remain encouraged by … Government stimulus initiatives to invest in infrastructure and boost residential and non residential building activity … we are expecting to benefit from the Government’s Building Education Revolution stimulus from late 2009 and from larger infrastructure projects as they ramp up from around mid 2010.
               </p>
               <p>
                Industry clearly appreciates why the stimulus strategy is needed and the difference that it is making, even if those opposite have failed to do so. The government has invested some $77 billion in shielding Australia from the worst effects of the global recession, and 70 per cent of that money is going into infrastructure. It is being used to support jobs and business activity today which will create enduring assets that will go on delivering benefits for Australian industry, for Australian communities and for Australian workers for years to come. This is the investment in Australia’s future that we need and it is already paying dividends.

                 , I thank the minister for that very comprehensive answer and I ask a supplementary question. Can the minister inform the Senate how the government’s stimulus strategy and broader economic policies have shaped international perceptions of Australia as an investment destination? What significant new projects are in train and what opportunities do they create for Australian industry? What steps is the government taking to ensure that local firms have the chance to compete for major project work? What is the role of organisations like the Industry Capability Network and the government’s recently announced Australian industry participation package in maximising opportunities for domestic industry?

                  Senator Marshall, Australia’s strong leadership and sound economic management through this period of global economic crisis has been recognised internationally and is being rewarded with new investment.

                  liquefied natural gas project is just one example. The project will ultimately use some $33 billion worth of goods and services. Gorgon has already awarded more than $2 billion worth of contracts, the majority of which have gone to Australian companies. The Gorgon joint venture developed an Australian industry participation policy in the early stages of the project and is actively ensuring that local firms have every opportunity to get involved. It is working with the Industry Capability Network to identify Australian suppliers for this project. This is a great example of what the government is trying to achieve through its new $19.1 million Australian industry participation package.

Can the minister explain the background to the government’s decision to establish an industry innovation council and appoint a supplier advocate for the steel industry? How do these initiatives serve the government’s stated objective of giving Australian firms in steel and other industries the best possible chance to compete for work, both in Australia and overseas? To what extent will the innovation council and the supplier advocate be engaged in building industry capability?
