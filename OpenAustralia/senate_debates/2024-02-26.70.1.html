        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Resources, Minister Watt. Two weeks ago the Minister for Resources introduced a bill that would give the minister the power to bypass environment laws to fast-track climate-destroying gas projects and silence
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations
        </a>
        voices under the guise of worker safety. Why is this government's first legislative act since the Voice referendum to silence the voice of First Nations communities who oppose gas projects in their land and sea country?

           Thank you, President, for reminding me of standing orders. I do need to be reminded from time to time. Senator Cox, the government have been clear that our environment laws aren't working, either for the environment or for industry. That's why Minister Plibersek is reforming our national environmental laws and Minister Madeleine King is also leading a process to reform Australia's complex offshore resources environmental laws that was funded in the last budget and will be ongoing and extensive.
          </p>
          <p>
           In relation to this bill, a technical amendment introduced as part of the offshore safety legislation will allow the government to act in line with the recommendations of that review. The review is being undertaken to address widespread concerns regarding the consultation process for offshore projects.

               As I said, the bill that's before the parliament does not change the legal requirements for consultation for offshore projects in any way, shape or form. I understand that it's in the Greens party's political interests to misrepresent the intention of this legislation and to suggest that people are being excluded. But this bill that's before the parliament does not change the legal requirements for consultation in any way whatsoever.

                  Thank you, Senator Cox. The short answer is no. And of course that's a ridiculous proposition that is being put. As I said, the bill before the parliament does not change the legal requirements for consultation for offshore projects in any way, shape or form. There'll be no change to rigorous environmental assessments. No environmental standards will be watered down. There will be no fast track for offshore projects. And the government is consulting on ways to make these consultation processes clearer for offshore resources projects. Indeed, the consultation period has been extended to ensure that everyone can have their say. Environmental organisations,
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
                   First Nations
                  </a>
                  groups, industry and resources companies have all told us that our system of consultation about projects is not working. So we are happy to work with stakeholders on sensible amendments to the current bill to give everyone further confidence about the intent of the changes.

                    Why is this government so hell-bent on fast-tracking climate-destroying gas projects, that you snuck into a worker safety bill, while consultation is actually still ongoing? Is it to try and secure a deal with the coalition in meeting their conditions for passing the PRRT changes that are upcoming?

                     party may have a political agenda in characterising the government's position in a certain wayâ€”and where would they be without trying to characterise our position because they don't have any positions of their own? We have made clear that environmental organisations,

                      First Nations
                     </a>
                     groups, industry and resources companies have all told us that our system of consultation about projects is not working. We are happy to work with all stakeholders, whether it be First Nations groups, environmental organisations, industry or the general community. We're happy to work with everyone on sensible amendments to the current bill that give further confidence about the intent of our changes. This government supports the resources industry and the jobs that it creates and the export dollars it creates. We think we can do it in a way that respects First Nations interests and the environmental interests at stake here as well.
