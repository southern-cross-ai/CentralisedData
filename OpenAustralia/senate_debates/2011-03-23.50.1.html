        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for

        and

        </a>
        , Senator Wong. I refer the minister to her statement of 16 July 2007, which was made in conjunction with then Deputy Leader of the Opposition Julia Gillard and in which she said, ‘Labor will end the abuse of taxpayer funded government advertising.’ I also refer the minister to comments made yesterday by the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency that his department is ‘examining a number of options for public communications’. Has the government invited tenders or contracted an agency to undertake a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign in support of your carbon tax plans?

         </a>
         has made clear that the government has not made any decisions about an advertising campaign in this area. I would make the point to Senator Birmingham that when the coalition was in government there was a substantial amount of money spent on government advertising; from recollection, some $121 million was spent on advertising
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_Choices" rel="nofollow">
          Work Choices
         </a>
         . This government has reduced the advertising funding by a significant amount in a range of budget decisions over the last few years.
        </p>
        <p>
         I make the point that there is obviously a discussion that can occur about the extent to which we need to get the facts out in this debate as opposed to some of the fear mongering that we have seen in recent times. I am interested, for example, in some of the comments written on signs outside parliament today. One said, ‘Carbon dioxide is not pollution’; another said, ‘I love
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CO2" rel="nofollow">

          , I rise on a point of order on relevance. The question specifically asked whether tenders had been let or contractors engaged. That is the only thing that the question was addressed to. From 15 seconds into her answer to the question until now—in other words, most of the time that she has been on her feet—the minister has been criticising the opposition for things it was alleged to have done when it was in government. That can on no rational view be regarded as a direct answer to the question, ‘Have you let tenders?’ Mr President, I draw your attention to standing order 73(iii). The test is not whether a minister is responding to the question but whether the minister is answering the question. To respond to the question is a different thing than to answer the question. The minister’s obligation under the standing orders is to answer the question.

           , on the point of order: this is the most ridiculous point of order I think I have ever heard taken in this chamber. The complaint from Senator Brandis is that the minister answered the question in the first 15 seconds! His complaint is that the minister directly answered the question in the first 15 seconds. That is how far the opposition has got in terms of its credibility. The minister, having directly answered the question, went on to put it into context in terms of advertising campaigns—perfectly in order, Mr President. Quite frankly, as I said, this is the most stupid point of order I think I have every heard in my time in the Senate.

            , it really does stretch credulity to suggest that you can refer to slogans on placards outside of this place in response to a question as to whether or not tenders have been let for a certain situation. If we are going to have any semblance of relevance in question time then this has to be one of those cases where a ruling must be made.

                      . As I said, the government has made no decision about an advertising campaign. Obviously, any decisions regarding tenders or contracts are always subject to the usual disclosure requirements that apply to all government tenders, of which Senator Birmingham is well aware. But I would again make this point: there have been many times when governments have advertised. Perhaps some were more meritorious than others. When those opposite want to lecture this government about advertising, you might recall the excess of $120 million that you spent on your

                       , I ask a supplementary question. Given the minister’s tacit admission that the government will be running a campaign to ‘get the facts out’, I refer the minister to Labor’s 2007 election promise that:
                      </p>
                      <p class="italic">
                       … all government advertising and information campaigns in excess of $250,000 will need to be vetted by the Auditor-General or his designate.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Will the minister guarantee that any campaign will be subject to this process and that the minister will not follow the Treasurer’s example of declaring a national emergency to get around it?

                                      . I would make the point that this government has significantly reduced spending on advertising over the last few years. We have established more transparent and formal reporting arrangements. Advertising campaigns over $250,000 are independently reviewed, properly targeted and non-political. Campaign expenditures are also published and supplier lists are public. These are new procedures which enable the public to have access to information to see how their taxpayer dollars are spent. So, when those across from us in this chamber lecture people about advertising, let’s just remember the $120 million spent on telling working people why taking away their conditions was such a good thing.

                                       , I ask a further supplementary question. How can the minister claim that any advertising campaign regarding the carbon tax will in some way be an information campaign, when there is utterly no information to share—no price, no compensation, no inclusions, no exclusions, no detail and, frankly, no idea whatsoever?

                                           In two questions now I have answered that no decision has been made of the sort that Senator Birmingham has referred to, so I find it hard to understand how he now can try to beat his chest over an answer he did not get. Perhaps the real question is this: why is it that people on that side of the chamber are lining up behind a leader who goes and addresses rallies where there are signs such as, ‘Carbon dioxide is a harmless trace gas, you fraudulent criminals?’ Seriously, one wonders where the liberals are inside this opposition.

                                            Order! I have called for order so that Senator Bob Brown could ask his question in silence. He is entitled to be heard in silence.
