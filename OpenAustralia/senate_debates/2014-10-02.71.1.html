Can the minister inform the Senate of any opposition to a deal between the minor parties to establish a select committee into certain aspects of the Queensland government's administration in exchange for blocking the passage of the government's one-stop-shop environmental reforms?

           . I can understand the Labor Party's sensitivity. Yesterday, six of Australia's peak business organisations united in one voice, calling on the Senate to pass the government's one-stop-shop environmental reforms as soon as possible. They are the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Council_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">

            National Farmers' Federation
           </a>
           , the Property Council of Australia, and the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_Development_Institute_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            Urban Development Institute of Australia
           </a>
           . According to this very wide and diverse coalition:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           … one of the biggest drags on Australia's competitiveness is lengthy and costly delays in securing project approvals.
          </p>
          <p>
           Research tells us that implementing the one-stop shop for environmental approvals would provide economic benefits to Australian business in the order of $426 million each and every year. If the Senate blocks passage of this vital reform it is risking $160,000 million in cumulative real
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
            GDP
           </a>
           revenue, as well as up to 70,000 new Australian jobs. According to
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAE" rel="nofollow">
            BAE
           </a>
           conomics, in Senator MacDonald's home state and that of Senator Lazarus, 'a one year saving in the time frame for approvals would deliver over 13,000 additional jobs.' In my home state and that of Senator Lambie, it would deliver an extra 1,100 additional jobs. The
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
            Productivity Commission
           </a>
           has assured us that this is a crucial reform that will make approval processes more efficient without compromising the quality of environmental outcomes. I say especially to the Labor Party that sacrificing principle and precedent for perceived short-term expediency is not good policy.

             Yes I can. I can inform Senator Macdonald and fellow senators that the former Clerk of the Senate, the late
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Evans" rel="nofollow">
              Harry Evans
             </a>
             , cautioned against establishing a similar inquiry in 1996. Mr Evans highlighted the 'two-way-street' aspect of comity between parliaments when he said:
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             There is built into it an element of the Biblical golden rule of doing unto others as you would have them do unto you.
            </p>
            <p>
             Mr Evans warned of the possibility of retaliatory inquiries—if the Senate can conduct an inquiry into a state government, what will stop a state government from doing the same to the Commonwealth?
            </p>
            <p>
             Professor Anne Twomey, a constitutional law expert, has said:
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             There's this thing called the Melbourne Corporation doctrine, which basically says the commonwealth can't interfere in the capacity of the state to govern …
            </p>
            <p>
             If this committee proceeds, the Senate will have opened a Pandora's box and those opposite will bear the consequences.

               I can inform the Senate that there has been support for this particular deal. In today's media we see that the select committee has received the overwhelming support of senior Rebels bikie gang member 'Little Mick' Kosenko. According to the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
                Gold Coast
               </a>
               criminal lawyer Campbell MacCallum, who has acted for the Black Uhlan bikie Liborio Di Vita and Bandido Josh Downey, the inquiry is 'absolutely needed'. So the establishment of this select committee has the support of the Rebels, the Black Uhlans, the Bandidos, Senator Larissa Waters of the Greens and Senator Stephen Conroy of the

              <p>
               As a final thought, I would urge senators to reflect on the admission of the major proponent of this select committee:
