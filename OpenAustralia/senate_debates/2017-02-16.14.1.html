        </p>
        <p>
         This bill is a very complex bill. It will make significant changes to native title. I have had a number of consultations with a number of people, many of whom support the concept of the changes, many of whom do not support the concept of the changes. I and a number of people have expressed concern about the rushed nature of the debate on these native title changes. In fact, the proposals for change had been made for quite a number of years before the court case that has now triggered the government's sense of urgency, which we think is more around the Adani mine in Queensland than any sincere desire to help address some of the ongoing issues about ILUAs—land-use agreements. So we think that these changes need a considerable period of time to allow consultation.

         I, as I said, have been talking to a number of groups from around Australia and I clearly acknowledge there are groups that are in support of these changes and there are groups that are opposed to these changes and other people, who support the concept but who think that amendments need to be made. We need time to assess these changes. The government will probably stand up and say, 'You wanted to refer it to 27 March.' There was not agreement to that in the report; it went to 17 March. However, overnight and this morning, there has been increased concern raised with me. I think it needs much further consultation, to 8 May. That would allow everybody to have a look at these amendments, to actually understand the impacts of the amendments and whether in fact there needs to be amendments to the amendments or other things added to the bill.

         This is a serious issue. The fact is these issues have been raised over a number of years. There has been a lack of action, an unwillingness to address these issues until suddenly it starts threatening mining in the resource industry. That is what is driving the government's overwhelming desire to rush this through now rather than allow a significant period of time to actually assess the impacts of very serious amendments of an already very complex piece of legislation. This will allow us to assess those amendments. I urge the chamber to acknowledge this is complex and to support changing the date so that we can have a thorough review through the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee of the changes to the

          On the amendment, the opposition is sympathetic to the comments just made by Senator Siewert. We agreed last night that 17 March was an appropriate time for referral but we also acknowledge that these issues are complex and that there will be a lot of stakeholder interest. We would leave that in the hands of the committee as it progresses with the consideration of the

           Native Title Amendment Act
          </a>
          . I am not disputing that these issues are complex but we, at the moment, are happy with 17 March. We will await further advice from the committee once that inquiry is undertaken to see whether any further extensions are required.

           It is really important to acknowledge here that what we are talking about is a very complex piece of legislation, a fundamental piece of legislation that goes to the very heart of what it means to achieve recognition of country for Aboriginal people. The idea that a government dominated committee for reasons of its own is the arbiter of for an appropriate time line in this is laughable. This is a really complex issue. This is something that stems back decades. We know that there are many problems with the legislation as it stands. We have heard from people right across the community about how critical it is to get this right. Why would we simply rush this piece of legislation through this parliament when it has been so contentious for so long? Many Indigenous groups have stood up and said: 'We want this done and done properly.'
          </p>
          <p>
           Let's be frank about this; we know that this is a rushed timetable to try and facilitate the development of the Adani coalmine. We need to see some, I think, thorough reflection, some thorough inquiry to get this right; otherwise, we will be here again and again. That is why my colleague Senator Rachel Siewert has proposed that we extend that time line to May 8 and that we give this issue the attention that it deserves.

            The question is that the amendment moved by Senator Siewert to move the reporting date to 8 May be agreed to.
