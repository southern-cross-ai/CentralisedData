A Controlled Action decision was made on 24 August 2006, which was prior to the Dampier Archipelago (including Burrup Peninsula) being included on the National Heritage List. As national heritage values of the Dampier Archipelago (including Burrup Peninsula) were not listed as a matter of national environmental significance under the EPBC Act at the time of the referral decision, potential significant impacts on these values were not able to be considered as a controlling provision in the subsequent assessment of the project.
