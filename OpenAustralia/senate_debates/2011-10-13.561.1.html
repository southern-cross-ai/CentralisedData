       <p class="italic">
        (1) Have staffing numbers in agencies within the Ministers portfolio been reduced as a result of the efficiency dividend and/or other budget cuts; if so, in which areas and at what classification.

       <p class="italic">
        (2) Are there any plans for staff reduction in agencies within the Ministers portfolio; if so, can details be provided i.e. reduction target, how this will be achieved, services/programs to be cut etc.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) What changes are underway or planned for graduate recruitment, cadetships or similar programs, and if reductions are envisaged can details be provided, including reasons, target numbers etc.

        <p class="italic">
         (1) In the 2011-12 Budget and across the forward estimates there have been no specific reduction in staffing numbers as a result of the efficiency dividends and or other budget cuts.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) No target has been set for staff reductions to achieve savings. Staffing changes are a result of decisions made by the Government as part of the Budget process. Other than Budget decisions which are disclosed in the Portfolio Budget Statement there has been limited impact on specific functions within the

          IP Australia
         </a>
         is not subject to the efficiency dividend.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) None related to the efficiency dividend. IP Australia will reduce staff numbers over the next four years as workload levels return to steady-state. This should see a reduction of approximately 50 staff (5 per cent), via natural staff turnover.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) IP Australia does not run a formal graduate program, though the majority of examiner vacancies are filled by people with university qualifications. There is no intention to alter recruitment from existing steady-state workload projections which will see small offers to recruit for any natural attrition of staff beyond workload decrease projections.

        <p class="italic">
         (1) There has not been a reduction of staffing numbers as a result of the efficiency dividend and/or budget cuts. The effect of the efficiency dividend has been managed through changes to the staffing profile (i.e. both classification and categories).
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) Some vacant positions will now not be filled as a result of the budgetary position.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) The ARC does not have graduate recruitment, cadetships or other similar programs.

          The Institute
         </a>
         is currently reviewing its overall structure as a result of the efficiency dividend.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         It is noted that the Institute received one-off funding for the Digitisation project which ended at 30 June 2011.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         This funding employed 36 staff. Consequently, the Institute applied to the Minister for Finance for an operating loss of $3.2 million. This was approved and allows the Institute to continue to employ the affected staff for the 2011-12 year. However, without funding beyond the 2011-12 year, the Institute may potentially need to reduce staff members accordingly.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) This cannot be quantified until such time as the review is completed which is expected to be late October/November.
