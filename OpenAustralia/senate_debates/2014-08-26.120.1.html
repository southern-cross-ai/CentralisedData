       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        notes the recommendation
       </p>
       <p>
        The government recognises the importance of having representative peak industry bodies that provide effective industry leadership. The structure of peak industry bodies and their regional representation is a matter for industry.
       </p>
       <p>
       </p>
       <p>
        The Government does not agree to the recommendation
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         The Committee
        </a>
        has suggested a compulsory registration scheme and central database of citrus growers would serve a number of purposes. The government considers it would be appropriate for these to be addressed through other means.
       </p>
       <p>
        Industry planning and policy development are industry responsibilities, therefore, industry representative bodies (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRB" rel="nofollow">
         IRB
        </a>
        s) should be responsible for facilitating communication with citrus growers. It is appropriate that engagement in planning and policy development is voluntary. It is likely that IRBs already hold certain information about growers who are members of the bodies. IRBs undertaking planning and policy development activities can utilise other means, such as industry events or media, to encourage citrus growers to engage in these activities if they choose to do so.
       </p>
       <p>
        Levy funded research services are provided to the industry by Horticulture Australia Limited (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL" rel="nofollow">
         HAL
        </a>
        ). HAL is able to use research levy funds to facilitate the dissemination, adoption and commercialisation of research outcomes to levy payers. HAL prepares an annual report on its activities for the citrus industry and interested growers can also obtain reports about the outcomes from individual projects.
       </p>
       <p>
        Communication in biosecurity emergencies can be achieved through existing means such as grower organisations or the media.
       </p>
       <p>
        The existing citrus levy legislative framework cannot be used to collect or distribute the suggested data. In most instances, levy and other relevant information are collected from an intermediary, such as a market agent or exporter, and there is no direct contact with growers. Levy related information collected by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Agriculture" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Agriculture
        </a>
        (formerly
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAFF" rel="nofollow">
         DAFF
        </a>
        ) does not include information relating to individual growers. The establishment and maintenance of a compulsory grower database would require new legislation and new funding from appropriate sources. The custody of such a database and its maintenance should be the responsibility of industry. Compulsory registration would increase the regulatory burden on the citrus industry.
       </p>
       <p>
       </p>
       <p>
        The Government notes this recommendation
       </p>
       <p>
        The government notes the progress that Citrus Australia Limited (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAL" rel="nofollow">
         CAL
        </a>
        ) and Horticulture Australia Limited (HAL) have made on this issue including a revised
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAC" rel="nofollow">
         IAC
        </a>
        membership structure of nine members, six of whom are not
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIB" rel="nofollow">
         PIB
        </a>
        directors, executive officers or employees of CAL, and the appointment of an independent governance officer to the citrus IAC.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Deed of Agreement 2010–2014 (the Deed) between HAL and the Commonwealth requires an independent review of the performance of HAL. The Deed contains the standard terms of reference for the performance review and provides for additional matters to be included as required. Additional matters that were considered as part of the HAL performance review, which reported on 9 May 2014, include the HAL model of industry service delivery, and the constitution that underpins the model, against the benchmark of good governance under the Deed. The response to Recommendation 4 (see below) details the standard terms of reference and the additional matters that were addressed by the review.
       </p>
       <p>
       </p>
       <p>
        The Government agrees to the recommendation
       </p>
       <p>
        The independent performance review of HAL considered the structure of the horticulture levy system and the HAL model of industry service delivery. This included HAL's membership structure. The performance review report was released on 9 May 2014. The report contains nine recommendations, including that HAL transition from its current membership structure, in which horticulture peak industry bodies are the company's members, to a new membership structure, in which farmer levy payers are the company's members. The government has received the report the report and acknowledged that it meets the review's terms of reference. The government is considering the review findings and recommendations. The terms of reference for the performance review were:

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_Review" rel="nofollow">
         Performance Review
        </a>
        shall cover:
       </p>
       <p>
        1. The performance of HAL in meeting its obligations under the Deed as the Industry Services Body for the provision of marketing and research and development services to the industry
       </p>
       <p>
        2. HAL's implementation of strategic, annual operational, risk management, fraud control and intellectual property plans and its effectiveness in meeting the priorities, targets and budgets set out in those plans
       </p>
       <p>
        3. The efficiency with which HAL carried out those plans
       </p>
       <p>
        4. The delivery of the benefits to the industry and the community in general as foreshadowed by those plans
       </p>
       <p>
        Additional matters
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition, the Performance Review shall cover:
       </p>
       <p>
        5. The HAL model of industry service delivery and its underpinning in the Constitution against the benchmark of good governance practice under cl 4.1 of the Deed, including but not limited to:
       </p>
       <p>
        (a) HAL's membership whereby PIBs, rather than individual levy payers, are the members as is the case with other industry-owned
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDC" rel="nofollow">
         RDC
        </a>
        s.
       </p>
       <p>
        (b) The regulation of PIBs and other industry representative bodies under the HAL model; the nature and transparency of their direct and indirect funding arrangements with HAL; and their accountability to their own members and levy payers for their performance in consulting with levy payers and in spending industry and government funds, including the delivery of planned outcomes.
       </p>
       <p>
        (c) The operation of the IACs, including independence from the PIB/IRB and the extent and effectiveness of control by the HAL Board.
       </p>
       <p>
        (d) The influence of PIBs/IRBs on decision-making by HAL's Board, management and the IACs.
       </p>
       <p>
        (e) The capacity of the HAL model to deliver services in an efficient, effective and transparent manner to provide value for money to levy payers and corporate members.
       </p>
       <p>
        (f) Identifying alternative models to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of HAL's service delivery, transparency and accountability in HAL's funding arrangements.
       </p>
       <p>
        6. The efficiency of the levy structure for the horticulture sector (in which many individual commodities maintain separate independent levy rates and collection mechanisms) and the process by which levies are conceived, implemented, collected and expensed.
       </p>
       <p>
       </p>
       <p>
        The Government agrees to the recommendation
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Agriculture (formerly DAFF) has been actively pursuing improvements to the consultation arrangements with Australian horticultural industries, particularly in terms of the processes to identify priority projects for market access negotiation.
       </p>
       <p>
        There have been considerable achievements to date with the movement to more informed (evidence-based) analysis of market access applications and the strengthening of the engagement of industry in the strategies underpinning Australia's approaches, and the subsequent negotiations, to gain, improve or maintain access. The primary forum for advice to the department regarding the horticultural sector's priorities for market access is the Office of Horticultural Market Access, which is an industry project, funded by Horticulture Australia Limited from industry levies and matching Australian Government payments.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition, with the formulation of the Horticulture Export Industry Consultative Committee (HEICC), the citrus industry has the opportunity to assist with the establishment of process reforms and standards to further promote efficiencies in the export pathways.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under HEICC the department has established a program to assist industry evaluate its ambitions for the markets, including those technical and policy hurdles which it faces in both Australia and in their targeted markets. The department encourages the citrus industry through CAL to be an active participant in these processes with its peers.
       </p>
       <p>
        The previous recommendations that relate to the capacity of CAL to consolidate the views of the sector are also highly relevant to this recommendation. The citrus sector is extremely diverse with differing fruits, production systems, scale, pest health status, market sectors, etc. A well-structured representative system to bring together the competing interests of the sector would allow the industry to more effectively participate in the existing consultation processes on market access.
       </p>
       <p>
       </p>
       <p>
        The Government agrees in principle to the recommendation
       </p>
       <p>
        The government is committed to securing high-quality, comprehensive trade agreements that produce tangible benefits for agricultural producers and exporters, including the citrus industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government committed at the 2013 federal election to increase resources from within the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
        </a>
        to fast-track the conclusion of free trade agreements. Senior Australian government ministers and officials intensified discussions with their Chinese, Korean, Japanese and Trans-Pacific Partnership counterparts and achieved significant progress, including the conclusion of bilateral trade agreements with Korea and Japan.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Korea-Australia free trade agreement, once it comes into force, will deliver many benefits to Australian industries and exporters, including the citrus industry. It is a strong and liberalising agreement for agriculture that protects and promotes our competitive position in the Korean market. It will secure improved market access through elimination of very high tariffs on a wide range of exports, including oranges, lemons, limes, grapefruit and fruit juices. The agreement includes strong outcomes on citrus which will support Australia's competitive position in the Korean market, including for oranges, Australia's largest citrus export. Details of the agreement are available at http://www.dfat.gov.au/fta/kafta/.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement will provide a liberalising outcome for fruits and juices, including citrus, resulting in tariff elimination on the vast majority of Australian horticulture exports to Japan. The agreement is currently undergoing legal verification and will become public once this process has been completed.
       </p>
       <p>
       </p>
       <p>
        The Government notes the recommendation
       </p>
       <p>
        The Government will provide $15.0 million over four years to support small exporters in sectors where there are specific export certification registration charges.
       </p>
       <p>
        Funding will be provided in 2014-15 to provide eligible small exporters with a rebate of 50 per cent of their export certification registration costs, up to a maximum of $5,000. From 2015-16, funding will be provided for projects that directly benefit small exporters, particularly projects to improve market access. The Government will consult the small exporter sectors on the projects to be considered. This measure delivers on the Government's election commitment.
       </p>
       <p>
        In accordance with the Government's cost recovery policy, the Department of Agriculture is obliged to recover the costs of providing export certification and inspection services. The horticulture export program within the department provided services that support the A$197.2 million value of exports from the citrus sector in 2013.
       </p>
       <p>
        The charges currently paid by registered export establishment enables the department to undertake a number of vital services for citrus exporters including:
       </p>
       <p>
        management of export conditions, publishing and maintenance of export cases on the Manual of Importing Country Requirements (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIC" rel="nofollow">
         MIC
        </a>
        oR), development of operational workplans that outline the requirements to meet importing country protocols;
       </p>
       <p>
        export accreditation and audit of the export pathway from growers and packhouses through to treatment facilities and registered establishments to ensure compliance with importing country requirements;
       </p>
       <p>
        facilitate operational audits and inspectors from importing countries;
       </p>
       <p>
        liaison and communication with peak bodies to facilitate export compliance and process operational changes;
       </p>
       <p>
        liaison with importing countries to resolve phytosanitary and inspection/certification issues;
       </p>
       <p>
        contribution to market access negotiations on operational issues, including harmonisation of interstate trade;
       </p>
       <p>
        assist in the selection of market priorities, with a focus on market readiness;
       </p>
       <p>
        technical/operational advice to authorised officers; and
       </p>
       <p>
        secretariat for the HEICC, which has representatives from the major horticulture export industries.
       </p>
       <p>
       </p>
       <p>
        The Government notes the recommendation

       </p>
       <p>
        The Government agrees in principle to the recommendation
       </p>
       <p>
        The government has long supported the development and implementation of the National Fruit Fly Strategy (NFFS) and the NFFS Implementation Plan. The government provided both financial and in-kind contributions to develop the NFFS and the Implementation Plan. This includes direct funding towards the 15 key projects identified in the NFFS Implementation Plan that are designed to facilitate an enhanced and sustainable national approach to the management of economically important fruit flies.
       </p>
       <p>
        Successful implementation of the NFFS is contingent on a commitment from industries that produce fruit fly host goods to identify, fund, and undertake research that contributes to the understanding of fruit fly biology and management relevant to their sector. The government has committed to support these activities, both through matching industry funding for qualifying research and development activities undertaken through Horticulture Australia Limited, and through the provision of technical expertise and experience. The government has also committed funding to support the National Fruit Fly Strategy
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advisory_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Advisory Committee
        </a>
        , which will involve governments and industry, to oversee the implementation of the National Fruit Fly Strategy.
       </p>
       <p>
       </p>
       <p>
        The Government notes the recommendation
       </p>
       <p>
        The government agrees that all industries that are affected by, or that contribute to fruit fly pressures through the production of host material should contribute to the national efforts to develop and implement effective management practices.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many industries already have in place levy arrangements for responses under the Emergency Plant Pest Response Deed (EPPRD), as well as research and development levies. The Australian Government will consider any request by industries to investigate whether these levies could also be applied to broader biosecurity issues, including fruit fly, or whether a specific fruit fly levy is a more appropriate option.
       </p>
       <p>
        For this approach to be successful, fruit fly affected industries would need to agree to such a levy and set them at a level which ensures sustainable funding.
       </p>
       <p>
       </p>
       <p>
        The Government agrees to the recommendation
       </p>
       <p>
        As noted in submissions and in evidence provided to the committee by a number of parties, the management of fruit flies as a pest of horticulture has local, regional and national aspects. Factors including local and regional conditions and host crop varieties can influence the strategies required for successful management of fruit fly.
       </p>
       <p>
        Experience in managing fruit flies as well as research capacity for investigating and developing new management strategies is spread between industries, private enterprises and governments. The state and territory governments also have a key role in managing the regulatory systems that support Australia's favourable fruit fly status. It is because of this that the Australian Government has provided support to the National Fruit Fly Strategy Advisory Committee. The Advisory Committee will bring together industry representatives, researchers, and quarantine regulators to identify key management and research needs, and assist in communicating and implementing a co-ordinated approach with industry and other regional and state government organisations. Strong industry representation on the Advisory Committee will be critical for its success and to ensure that future management strategies for fruit fly include components relevant to all affected industries and regions.
       </p>
       <p>
       </p>
       <p>
        The Government notes the recommendation
       </p>
       <p>
        The development of contingency plans is a step within the broader industry biosecurity process that includes the development of crop specific Industry Biosecurity Plans, Pest Fact Sheets and Diagnostic Protocols. Recognising that biosecurity is a shared responsibility, these are developed as a primary function of Plant Health Australia, a non-profit company that is a tripartite partnership between the Government, state and territory governments, and potentially affected plant industries.
       </p>
       <p>
        Plant Health Australia has developed the Australian Emergency Plant Pest Response Plan, PLANTPLAN, which is the current preparedness and response guidelines for any incursion of an exotic pest or disease that would affect a plant industry. PLANTPLAN is constantly reviewed and regularly updated. PLANTPLAN can be applied to any plant pest incursion and is supported by nationally developed and agreed diagnostic protocols and response procedures.
       </p>
       <p>
        The development of pest-specific contingency plans provides additional information to supplement PLANTPLAN, but does not supersede it. In the case of the pest-specific contingency plan for Huanglongbing and its vectors, it was developed as a specified project using citrus industry levies and funded through Horticulture Australia Limited with matching funding from the Australian Government. Should the citrus industry consider that the current contingency plan requires updating or that any pertinent matters are not sufficiently addressed in the plan or through other resources, the industry should seek to address this through Plant Health Australia. The government would support any necessary efforts to update industry biosecurity plans and contingency plans, including support by matching funding through Horticulture Australia Limited projects and provision of technical expertise where required.

       </p>
       <p>
        The Government notes the recommendation
       </p>
       <p>
        The government considers it important that Australia's competition laws remain robust and effective into the future. To achieve this, the government has announced a 'root and branch' review of the competition framework.
       </p>
       <p>
        The review will be an independent examination of how the competition framework is working, whether it is keeping up with emerging trends, and looking beyond the competition framework to identify impediments to competition with the goal of improving the living standards of all Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        As part of this, the review will have capacity to consider how key markets, such as groceries, have evolved with a view to promoting efficient, competitive outcomes and fair business dealings.

        The Government notes the recommendation
       </p>
       <p>
        The government is aware that Australian consumers want clear and accurate labelling to help them identify and buy food grown and processed in Australia. The government is also aware that country of origin claims on food labels may be confusing to consumers. However, any changes to current laws would require agreement at the Commonwealth, state and territory levels. As a first step in developing clearer country of origin labelling for food, a government working group is considering activities to improve consumer and industry understanding of country of origin labelling and other actions to develop clearer labelling options.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Industry and the Treasury co-chair this inter-agency working group. It is tasked with implementing the Council of Australian Governments Legislative and Governance Forum on Food Regulation response to Recommendation 42 of the Review of Food Labelling Law and Policy (2011). That response effectively requested agencies to review and clarify guidance material on country of origin labelling and, if necessary, conduct an education campaign. Members of the working group include the

       </p>
       <p>
        To address possible consumer confusion, the ACCC has released a fact sheet titled 'Where does your food come from'. This factsheet explains to consumers how they can support Australian primary producers and Australian food manufacturing jobs. Revised industry guidelines, 'Country of origin claims and the Australian Consumer Law', were also released by the ACCC on 15 April 2014. These guidelines will help businesses to understand and comply with the Australian Consumer Law provisions relating to country of origin claims.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Agriculture and Industry is undertaking an inquiry into country of origin labelling for food. The Committee is looking into the current system to see if it can identify any gaps or compliance limitations, or any improvements that could be made.

        Food Standards Australia New Zealand assessed the safety of carbendazim residues in orange juice in 2012 and recommended amending the maximum residue limit from 10 mg/kg to 0.2 mg/kg. The Legislative and Governance Forum on Food Regulation subsequently approved the inclusion of this lower

        From 18 January 2014, importers are expected to source orange juice and orange juice concentrate that comply with the new requirements. The Department of Agriculture tests imported orange juice for compliance with the food standards code and publicly reports on the results of the testing program. State and territory jurisdictions have responsibility for ensuring that all food, including imported food, meets the requirements of the food standards code at the point of sale.

The Treasury's Submission to the Inquiry examined the problems for budgeting caused by targeting a specific ODA percentage of GNI. The Government is committed to deliver an aid program that is predictable, affordable and effective. Setting an ODA/GNI target to be achieved by a specific date is neither predictable nor necessarily affordable, given significant fluctuations in projected GNI.

           I seek leave to take note of the return to order regarding the

           boots order.

           Leave granted.

           On 18 July 2014 the Minister for Defence table a letter in response to an order for the production of documents from Senator Madigan on behalf of Senator Xenophon. Senator Xenophon had asked the government to explain why an Australian manufacturer had not been successful in tendering for a contract worth approximately $15 million to make 100,000 pairs of boots for the Army. That manufacture is
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rossi_Boots" rel="nofollow">
            Rossi Boots
           </a>
           . It is an iconic firm which has been making boots in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            South Australia
           </a>
           since the early 1900s. The minister's letter states that the successful tenderer was also an Australian firm, Amare Safety, which will deliver the boots via an Australian firm operating in Indonesia, and herein lies the problem. I am not critical of Amare Safety but I am critical of the government for failing to recognise the role that Australian government procurement decisions play in maintaining Australian industrial capability and Australian jobs. The minister's letter states that:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Under the Commonwealth's procurement rules Defence is not able to discriminate against a bid based on its country of origin.
          </p>
          <p>
           This statement is, at best, misleading. The minister must know that governments should always seek to obtain value for money in procurement decisions. That does not mean mandating government procurement for Australian firms but it does mean that governments should apply the right balance in applying rules. Most important of all, obtaining value for money does not simply mean buying at the lowest price. It means assessing the whole of life costs, whether the goods are fit for purpose and whether a potential supplier has the right experience and understanding of local conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
           That understanding of 'obtaining value for money' was reinforced by the recent report of the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee on Commonwealth procurement. So I ask the minister: what whole-of-life considerations were taken into account in awarding the contract to a firm that will make the boots in Indonesia? Will the department regularly send officers to Indonesia to inspect the process and the various facilities? How does the decision to award this contract offshore provide economic benefit to Australia? And did the department make any effort to reach an agreement with an Australian firm on price, delivery, compliance or quality?
          </p>
          <p>
           I ask a further question: was any attempt made to apply the same process that led to the purchase of the slouch hat from an Australian manufacturer under the same procurement guidelines, which this government now claims preclude the use of Australian firms in this manner?
          </p>
          <p>
           Let me assure the minister that I will be pursuing these matters further and we are looking forward to the next estimates committee hearings on these questions.

            I endorse the remarks of Senator Carr in relation to this matter concerning Australian manufacturing and what occurred in respect of

            was nothing short of a disgrace. Rossi is a very great Australian company, based in

             South Australia

            , and has been making boots for 100 years and for our troops since

            and for other conflicts since that time. It missed out on a contract with the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Defence Force
            </a>
            . Why? Because of this narrow procurement process, which has been the subject of a recent Senate inquiry report and which clearly needs to be fundamentally reformed. The process is too narrow.
           </p>
           <p>
            It does not take into account the whole-of-life costs. It does not take into account the multiplier effect of having something made locally, made by Australians being paid award or above- award wages, of the highest quality. Instead, Rossi missed out. Interestingly—and I want to make this point clear—I think the defence minister was genuinely concerned when he heard about this. He was not aware of it until it was raised publicly. I think his answer in the chamber expressed that surprise in respect of that. I do not want to single him out; I single out a flawed system that has been in place for many years.
           </p>
           <p>
            Interestingly, with respect to the documents we got from the defence minister, the offers for part B of the tender by the manufacturer, one offer was 10 to 20 per cent and others ranged from 20 per cent to 30 per cent more expensive than the winning bid. Let us put that figure in perspective.
           </p>
           <p>
            Studies have been done overseas and work has been done here about spending locally in respect of defence procurement. The Royal United Services Institute in the United Kingdom undertook a study and found a benefit of some 37 per cent in terms of taxes collected by the United Kingdom Exchequer—the Treasury—because that money is actually spent there.
           </p>
           <p>
            I expect that there would be a similar benefit here in Australia in terms of local taxes, state and federal, that would be collected by virtue of people working and paying their taxes, let alone the multiplier effect of someone being in the community working, earning a wage and spending that money locally. I do not get it. And when you consider the benefit of those jobs and the multiplier effect, then this is a gobsmackingly silly decision.
           </p>
           <p>
            I commend the work of Victorian

            </a>
            , who has been passionate about this issue. He was with me on 14 July when we had a press conference with Neville Hayward,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
             CEO
            </a>
            of Rossi Boots. These issues will not go away. It is not just about
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
             South Australian
            </a>
            companies; it is about every Australian company. It is emblematic of a malaise, I think, within the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Materiel_Organisation" rel="nofollow">
             Defence Materiel Organisation
            </a>
            in dealing with these issues. In my view, the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMO" rel="nofollow">
             DMO
            </a>
            does not get that whole-of-life cost or the benefit of having something built here. A Senate committee has been looking at the decision by the Australian government to exclude Australian companies in respect of the building of two naval supply ships, worth in the order of $1.5 billion. A restricted tender has been put in place restricting it to Spain and
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea" rel="nofollow">
             South Korea
            </a>
            . I find it extraordinary that Australian companies would be excluded, even from the tendering process.
           </p>
           <p>
            The lesson to be learnt from the Rossi boots saga is that the procurement process we have in place needs to be fundamentally reformed. It needs to take into account the benefit of local manufacturing. It needs to take into account the whole-of-life cost that Senator Carr was referring to and also the information that I have obtained, that the DMO, as I understand it, has not been to the Indonesian factory where the boots are to be made. They have not followed up the claims made about the manufacturing process and conditions there. These are matters that ought to be undertaken.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also wish to acknowledge that the CEO of Rossi Boots, Neville Hayward, is very grateful for the interest that Senator Kim Carr has shown in relation to this matter and his very hard work. He also acknowledges the work of a local member of parliament,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Williams" rel="nofollow">
             Matt Williams
            </a>
            , for the interest he has shown in this matter. Something has seriously gone wrong here, but it is emblematic of a bigger problem in Defence and a bigger problem with government procurement. There are not too many bootmakers left in this country and decisions like this will force more and more manufacturers to the wall.
           </p>
           <p>
            Fortunately, the postscript to this story is that, whilst Rossi Boots would have been much better off had they won this contract, this tender, there has been a lot of strong community support. I have bought two extra pairs of Rossi shoes and boots, in addition to my steel-capped Rossi boots that I have had for a few years. A lot of people are giving support. Local businesses and consumers are out there across the country and that indicates that a bit of people power has helped Rossi Boots and other Australian companies. But the Australian government, with its deep budget in procurement, needs to do much better.
