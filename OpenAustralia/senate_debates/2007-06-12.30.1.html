        My question is directed to Senator Minchin, the Minister representing the Prime Minister, and it follows on from Senator Forshaw’s earlier question in relation to the function that was held at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirribilli_House" rel="nofollow">
         Kirribilli House
        </a>
        on 1 June this year. Minister, will the Liberal Party be paying a hire charge for using Kirribilli House on that occasion, will the Liberal Party pay for all the salary and other on-costs of public servants who worked at Kirribilli House on the night and, given that Kirribilli House is not a business premises, is it lawful to charge people for attending functions at Kirribilli House?

         I am not sure that I can add much to the answer I gave to Senator Forshaw. I have indicated that, on advice from the department about the appropriateness of holding such functions—

           the appropriate function costs—that is, the additional marginal costs of holding the function at
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirribilli_House" rel="nofollow">
            Kirribilli House
           </a>
           —related to food, $2,128.50; beverages, $1,476.52; casual staff, $829.57; and additional hire charges of $752.19, which, I am told, were for heaters and a mobile fridge. That was a total of $5,186.69. There were audiovisual costs, which were billed directly to the Liberal Party—the Liberal Party paid directly for those. I have indicated that the cost of full-time staff was not charged to the party because the staff were there anyway and the cost would have been incurred in the normal running of the house. Any additional staff were casual staff, and the costs were billed to the Liberal Party.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is always the case that the Prime Minister of the day holds a variety of functions at the official residences—that has long been the practice. In this case, in relation to federal delegates of the Liberal Party and observers to that particular
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Council" rel="nofollow">
            Federal Council
           </a>
           meeting in Sydney, the Liberal Party was appropriately billed for all the additional costs that were incurred over and above the normal running costs for the ongoing maintenance and upkeep of Kirribilli House—which would have been incurred anyway—and that bill has been paid. It sounds like something of a furphy to suggest there was anything not within the law. I suggest that that is a very long bow for Senator Faulkner to draw in this place, but, to satisfy him, if there is any information on that matter, I will bring it back to him as soon as I can.

I further ask the minister whether the government is satisfied that those organising the Liberal Party function held on 1 June 2007 ensured that no breach of liquor-licensing laws occurred at Kirribilli House. I further ask whether advice has been sought—

               I would normally have considerable respect for Senator Faulkner, but really this is becoming very silly. The Prime Minister is entitled, like anybody else in Sydney, to host people at a private function at his official residence—of course he is. To suggest that you have to have a liquor licence or something—

                 of the Liberal Party. That is what the Labor Party do, and the Liberal Party does that. They attend the Federal Council meeting of the Liberal Party, which is held over a few days. They were not charged to attend that function. I would also note, in response to Senator Forshaw’s question, I am now advised that there were no departmental staff from
