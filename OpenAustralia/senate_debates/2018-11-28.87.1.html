This support involves improving smokers' access to quality vaping and smokeless tobacco products, and improving publicly available information on vaping. The cabinet paper emphasises access to vaping in particular for Maori smokers because a greater proportion of the Maori population smoke compared to the non-Maori population. Are there lessons for Australia in

         I thank Senator Leyonhjelm for his question and some notice of that question. The government currently takes an evidence based approach to the subject of e-cigarettes and vaping devices in efforts to reduce harm from tobacco. We acknowledge there are a range of studies internationally which appear to demonstrate the safety of vaporised nicotine products. But, equally, there's no conclusive evidence that can say with any certainty that these products are safe.
        </p>
        <p>
         Make no mistake: tobacco is the leading cause of preventable death, premature death and disability in Australia, and this government remains committed to doing everything we can to reducing smoking levels. Sadly, Indigenous smoking rates, unsurprisingly, are parallel with socioeconomic opportunity rates and they remain unacceptably high at around 45 per cent compared with only some 12 per cent in the general population. As the senator indicated, that is very similar to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
          New Zealand
         </a>
         example. Tobacco is the only risk factor shared by all main categories of non-communicable diseases: cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our government has committed to reducing the rates of smoking in Indigenous communities. In February this year, Minister Ken Wyatt announced $183.7 million to continue the Tackling Indigenous Smoking program. The Tackling Indigenous Smoking program is a key part of the implementation of the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Plan. I'm pleased to report that the reduction-of-smoking goals contained in this plan are all on track to be met.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Tackling Indigenous Smoking program complements work already being done by the national Don't Make Smokes Your Story campaign. But, importantly, with New Zealand now moving to regulate e-cigarettes, we will have a live example of how this works in a very similar population across the ditch, which we'll be watching with great interest. I'm very confident that the lessons from the New Zealand experience will be heeded here in Australia.

            I understand that there is a study currently being commissioned on e-cigarettes. I understand Minister Hunt has requested this study, and I'm sure he'll be very happy to work with the Senate and the Senate crossbench if you'd like to have some input into the terms of reference for the study. I've been informed of that, so we're obviously up to the stage where you'll still be able to have some input.
           </p>
           <p>
            There have been some questions about the speed with which we are doing this: are we delaying doing something when it comes to e-cigarette use? We're a responsible government and we need to properly assess all available evidence on anything we're considering introducing to the public. That's why we're taking a measured, precautionary, evidence based approach to vaping. We'll note the outcomes of the

            experience with interest. We'll take note of all evidence available to us as a government.

              <p>
               Nicotine for use in e-cigarettes can't currently lawfully be sold in Australia. The legal use of nicotine for use in e-cigarettes would require an amendment to the Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Medicines and Poisons—that's the Poisons Standard—which is a record of decisions regarding the classification of medicines and chemicals into schedules for inclusion in the relevant legislation of the states and territories. There's a clearly defined process for amending the Poisons Standard to be considered. It's important to note that this is independent from government.
              </p>
              <p>
               The effect of this decision is that the commercial supply of nicotine for use in e-cigarettes currently remains prohibited under state and territory poisons legislation. We are confident that the TGA's scheduling legislation and the underlying decision-making processes provide a robust mechanism for an assessment and determination of this issue to be made which appropriately balances potential risks and benefits, and this, again, will be informed by the relevant evidence.
