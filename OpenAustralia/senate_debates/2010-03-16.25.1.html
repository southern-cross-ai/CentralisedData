         I thank Senator McEwen for the question. Today we have seen further evidence of the need for a carbon price in Australia so that polluters are forced to pay for their carbon pollution—the carbon pollution that is causing climate change. A report that will be formally launched on Friday by ClimateWorks Australia makes it very clear that a carbon price as well as targeted practical measures are critical to achieving the reductions in carbon pollution in this country.
        </p>
        <p>
         We know that the only policy being put forward by a major party in this country that involves a price on carbon is the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_Pollution_Reduction_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
          Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme
         </a>
         . The report released today shows that a carbon price—that is, making polluters pay—is essential to driving an emissions reduction across the economy. I refer to what the ClimateWorks Executive Director, Anna Skarbek, told the ABC this morning when she spoke about a five per cent target. She said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Without a carbon price, our analysis shows by 2020 emissions would continue to rise under that scenario.
        </p>
        <p>
         That is precisely

          Tony Abbott
         </a>

           Any policy that claims you can even meet a five per cent target without a carbon price is simply a con and that is what the opposition’s policy is, nothing more than a climate change con job.

              We know there used to be bipartisan agreement on the need for a price on pollution—a price on carbon—to tackle climate change. Let us remind ourselves who was a part of that:

              agreed. But as Mr Abbott made clear to Mr Turnbull last year on this issue, he is ‘a weather vane’. That is a good position for somebody who is aspiring to be the Prime Minister of this nation, ‘Hello, I am a weather vane.’

                Mr Abbott now believes that climate change is ‘absolute crap’. He is advocating a position which will ensure that Australia’s emissions keep rising. What Mr Abbott is confirming is that you just cannot trust what he says.
