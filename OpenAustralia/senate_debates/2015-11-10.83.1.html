         I thank Senator Lindgren for the question. Those of us on this side of the chamber believe that the best form of welfare is a job. That is why everything that this government does is motivated by our commitment to see higher growth, because higher growth means more jobs. Indeed, since forming government there have been over 300,000 jobs created on our watch.

It was under you, Senator Carr, that, whilst there was growth in other industries, in the manufacturing industry, under you, jobs were lost—you personally. Your legacy to the Australian people is job losses. You can come into this chamber and you can scream—

               , but, when Senator Carr yells out interjections like that, I have to say that, when he was the minister in this place, under his watch employment in manufacturing in Australia fell by 127,600, or by 12.1 per cent. I believe that, as part of a government that is committed to growing jobs in this country, I have an obligation to correct the record. That is why we have invested, as a government, $6.8 billion in the jobactive program, which commenced on 1 July this year. We currently have 66 jobactive providers delivering services in over 2,000 locations and servicing a case load of approximately 758,000 people. This is a government that, unlike Senator Carr—

                 Yes, I am. Work for the Dole is of course the centrepiece of the new mutual obligation arrangements that form part of the government's jobactive program. My department has carried out an evaluation of Work for the Dole participants who are undertaking the pilot programs. Some of the results of this evaluation have been recently released, and they showed that 78 per cent of participants said they had had the opportunity to learn new skills; 79 per cent agreed that routine in getting up every day and going to work was actually good for them; 81 per cent of participants said that they were treated like a valuable member of staff. Participants also said that they had learnt and/or developed soft skills such as confidence, self-esteem, teamwork, communication and improved workplace behaviour.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Work for the Dole recognises the principle that unemployed people should be working, preferably for a wage but, if not, then for the dole. It is the people who have participated—
