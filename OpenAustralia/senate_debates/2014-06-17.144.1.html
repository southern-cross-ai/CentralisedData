        Tonight I want to remember the life and career of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Gilmour" rel="nofollow">
         Gary Gilmour
        </a>
        , a cricketer who played not for records or recognition but for the joy of the game—a cricketer for whom the record book just does not tell the full story and for whom statistics belie an extraordinary talent.
       </p>
       <p>
        Gary John Gilmour, known to so many as Gus, was born on 26 June 1951 in Newcastle,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        . Gilmour spent his early life in the working class suburb of Waratah, a place that sits in the lee of the city's steelworks. In Gary Gilmour's time the smoke, smell and noise from the steelworks kept house prices down and many of Waratah's residents in work. Today the steelworks is silent, yet the landmark still stands, a reminder of the city's industrial past.
       </p>
       <p>
        Gary Gilmour attended
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_Boys_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Newcastle Boys High School
        </a>
        where he excelled at rugby, baseball and cricket. He was a natural athlete, who, in the words of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Chappell" rel="nofollow">
         Ian Chappell
        </a>
        , 'was at the front of the queue when they handed out talent'. But cricket was his passion and, in a town more famous for its footballers than its first 11, Gilmour was peerless. Whilst still in his teens, Gary Gilmour was selected to play for Newcastle. By the time he was 20, he was playing for New South Wales. He scored a century on debut, a feat that brought the young all-rounder to the attention of Australian selectors. But it was not until December 1973 that he was finally selected to play for Australia. On debut he scored 52 and took four for 75 in Australia's victory over

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Gary Gilmour's appearances for the national side were sporadic. Another opportunity came during cricket's first World Cup in 1975. For most of the one-day tournament, Gary Gilmour was Australia's 12th man. But he was a surprise selection in the semifinal against England at Headingley. Asked to open the bowling, he took an astonishing six for 14, off 12 overs. Despite those efforts with the ball and chasing just 93 runs, Australia was in trouble at six for 39 until Gary Gilmour, combined with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Walters" rel="nofollow">
         Doug Walters
        </a>
        , steered Australia home. Doug Walters scored 20 not out. Gilmour remained unbeaten, on a run a ball 28. In 2002, his bowling feat in this match was rated by Wisden as the greatest performance in a one-day international. A successful home test series against the soon to be fabled
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        followed. In 1975-76, against the likes of Lloyd, Richards and Kallicharran, Gilmour lead the bowling attack for Australia, taking 20 wickets at a 20.3 average. At
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide_Oval" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        he scored a scintillating 95.
       </p>
       <p>
        There were also incredible bursts of brilliance, like his maiden century against Richard Hadlee's New Zealand. At Christchurch, again Australia in trouble, Gary Gilmour scored a brutal 101 with 86 of the runs coming from boundaries. His seventh-wicket partnership, again with Dougie Walters—it goes to show what two
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Welshmen" rel="nofollow">

        can do—of 217 remained an Australian record for three decades.
       </p>
       <p>
        But he was not to deliver fully on his tantalising promise. In the summer of 1976-77 he bowled with a piece of bone the size of a five-cent piece floating around in his heel. By the end of the summer he could hardly walk. Hampered by injury and poor form, his performance plateaued. Gary Gilmour was not chosen to tour England in 1977. He found out that he had not been selected while listening to the radio in his car while travelling across the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Harbour_Bridge" rel="nofollow">
         Sydney Harbour Bridge
        </a>
        . He headed home—in his own words—'peeved'. With that, Gary Gilmour's first-class career ended abruptly, prematurely, at the age of just 27. Gary Gilmour's services were not lost to Newcastle, which won the New South Wales Country Championship six years in a row with him in the side. Newcastle Cricket benefitted from his administration; its cricketers from his mentoring.
       </p>
       <p>
        Gary Gilmour's career is remarkable as much for the spirit he brought to the game as his achievements on the field. He played just 15 tests and five one-day internationals, but such was his flair that such numbers really only tell part of his story. Last week's obituary in
        <i>
         the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Morning_Herald" rel="nofollow">

        argued that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        ... he will be remembered as one of the cavaliers of a wild and woolly time in the game ... he sported a healthy paunch and gave an air of finding sporting life no more important than life off the field.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was struck by a tribute I read last week from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_McCosker" rel="nofollow">
         Rick McCosker
        </a>
        , a long-term friend and teammate of Gary Gilmour. He spoke about a Shield game between New South Wales and Victoria at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCG" rel="nofollow">
         SCG
        </a>
        in February 1976. Rick McCosker said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Gus felt sorry for the people there. When he and I came out after tea he said, 'It has been a boring day for the fans and I think we should do something about that'. I stood down the other end and proceeded to watch him score 100 in a session.
       </p>
       <p>
        One thousand, six hundred and ninety-seven people attended the SCG that day. The gate receipts were $742. I was one of those who paid up and saw Gary Gilmour score 100 in a session. I had never seen such a feat before—nor have I since.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some might argue that, with a less cavalier approach, Gus Gilmour's contribution to Australian cricket might have been even more significant and sustained. Rather than regret what could have been but never was, we should instead remember how he played the game and the joy that this gave to cricket lovers everywhere. Gary Gus Gilmour passed away on 10 June this year. He was 62.
