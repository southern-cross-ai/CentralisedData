        Let me begin by saying 'dajia hao'. Recent remarks about China by our friends on the cross benches and in the government compel me to reiterate to parliament that the strong and enduring relationship and friendship between the governments of China and Australia is something that, rightfully, we can be very proud of. As I have said publicly on several occasions, provocative and prejudicial slurs about the Chinese people are needless and offensive. I wrote in the
        <i>

        in January, on the eve of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year" rel="nofollow">
         Chinese New Year
        </a>
        , challenging the foreign minister for asserting that Australia should prioritise our relationships with the United States and Japan at the expense of our relationship with China, for publicly ranking our diplomatic partners and for placing a misguided sense of Australian identity over our future national interests. I joined members of the

        community in Sydney last month to remind the Prime Minister that his comments praising the sense of honour of Japanese soldiers in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        were needless and hurtful to many people. They were perhaps also prompted by that same misguided sense of Australian identity.
       </p>
       <p>
        I rise today to condemn publicly the comments made by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clive_Palmer" rel="nofollow">

        last week, for which he has rightly privately apologised. Hopefully, there will be an increasing and a more public apology from him in the coming days. I condemn also the comments made by a senator from the Palmer United Party, Jacqui Lambie. The comments of both demonstrate needless, provocative and unnecessary prejudice and have been prompted by misunderstanding of the deep and enduring China-Australia relationship.

        Friends, I do not need to remind any of you that serving in this place is a great privilege. Our words and actions resonate beyond this chamber into our vibrant multicultural communities and among our diplomatic friends and shape both the challenges and opportunities facing Australia on the world stage. Successive Australian political leaders have worked very hard to cultivate enduring relationships that are profitable—economically, culturally and politically—for both countries. Let me be clear, the rise of China as an economic, social, cultural and political power in our region presents Australia with a unique opportunity. Few countries are better placed than Australia, both geographically and politically, to capitalise on this rise to achieve our own economic and social objectives.
       </p>
       <p>
        While there are those who try to divide us by stoking the embers of fear and division, the relationship will endure, because the bond between the people of these two great nations is deep and will continue to grow stronger. The statistics speak for themselves, but the story is deeper than just a few statistics. China is now Australia's largest trading partner and is twice the size of our second-largest trading partner. There are now well over one million people in our country who identify as being Chinese-Australian, who have brought their culture, their identity and their sense of community to help grow this vibrant multicultural nation. But, again, the relationship is deeper than just statistics. We must recognise that the relationship will continue to be strong and continue to strengthen, provided we understand that we do not want a relationship with our largest trading partner that is based simply on transaction, on trade or on our being the cheapest place to purchase a particular commodity. We want an enduring relationship that is based on the principles of trust and respect. It is when those principles are being applied that the relationship is at its strongest.
       </p>
       <p>
        For over 40 years the relationship has gone from strength to strength, and all major political parties have played a role in this. As everyone in this chamber knows, it was

        played an important role in bringing the relationship forward in the modern era by bringing in institutions and playing a key role in the creation of institutions such as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APEC" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and by understanding the changes that China was undergoing at an economic level following the rise of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deng_Xiaoping" rel="nofollow">
         Deng Xiaoping
        </a>
        and the rise of the modern era of Chinese economic progression. While he is not someone I have often praised in this place, former
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
         Prime Minister John Howard
        </a>
        played a very important role in building our relationship with China. While his relationship began with a rocky start, there is no doubt that over time Prime Minister Howard understood and recognised the importance of the Australia-China relationship. In more recent years,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Gillard" rel="nofollow">
         Julia Gillard
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rudd" rel="nofollow">
         Kevin Rudd
        </a>
        both played a role in elevating the relationship and recognising that the increasing growth of China in this region is an economic, social and political opportunity. It is a relationship that has been reciprocated.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is worth noting the significance the Chinese government has placed on its relationship with Australia. That is best highlighted by the quality of the people and the delegates they have sent to represent them here. I want to note the outstanding work done by Ambassador Ma and the team at the Chinese embassy, who have played a very important role in maintaining and building our friendship and our relationship.
       </p>
       <p>
        In recent times, though, a serious of unhelpful comments and statements have been made that are hurting this relationship. As I have said in different places, I think the comment made by Foreign Minister Julie Bishop that she had a responsibility to be 'tougher' on the Chinese than the previous Labor administration was an unhelpful remark. I think it demonstrates a failure to understand what the relationship really needs to be about. She said that we need to be tougher, but I think the hurtful part was when she said that the Chinese government does not respect weakness. With all due respect, I think the Chinese have stared down far more formidable diplomatic opponents. But it is not about weakness. It should be about respect. I urge the Minister for Foreign Affairs to keep this in mind as she prepares for the visit of President Xi Jinping and for the G20.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian/Chinese diaspora are rightly proud of the achievements of their country. They are proud of the transformation they have achieved in the space of a few short generations. They are proud of the economic and social transformation of China. All Australians are proud of, and continue to benefit from, the important role that China and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Australians" rel="nofollow">
         Chinese Australians
        </a>
        play in the transformation of our own society. Friends, we have a responsibility in this chamber, as senators and as representatives, to ensure that our words and our language about not only our largest trading partner but a country that is playing such an important role in the future of this nation are respectful, considerate and show an understanding that this is a relationship that presents Australia with a very unique opportunity.
