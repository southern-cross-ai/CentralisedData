          I am surprised by the tasteless interjection from Senator Joyce. I think all senators would agree that the action of the

           United Nations
          </a>
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Council" rel="nofollow">
           Security Council
          </a>
          in adopting resolution 1973, authorising the use of force in Libya to protect civilians from attack by the regime of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel_Gaddafi" rel="nofollow">
           Colonel Gaddafi
          </a>
          , is an important one. The council adopted the resolution by 10 votes to zero, with five abstentions. The resolution authorises member states to take all necessary measures to protect civilians and civilian-populated areas under threat of attack while excluding an occupation force. In light of the fast-deteriorating situation, the Security Council established a no-fly zone, which bans all non-humanitarian flights in Libyan airspace. The no-fly zone was imposed following a request from the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_League" rel="nofollow">
           Arab League
          </a>
          . World leaders met in Paris on Saturday and agreed to enforce the resolution through military action. As senators would be aware, that commenced on Sunday, led by countries in the immediate region and select members of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO" rel="nofollow">

          .
         </p>
         <p>
          The decisive action is welcomed by the Australian government.
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Arab_League" rel="nofollow">
           The Arab League
          </a>
          , the Security Council, the nations represented at the Paris conference and the parties to military intervention have all acted in the interests of Libya’s civil population. The decision to use force to support peace is, of course, never easy, and it is not without risk. We know from bitter experience that the decision not to act also has consequences and can lead, like it did in Rwanda, to the unimaginable loss of civilian life. Through its brutal suppression of dissent, use of military force against civilians and threats of further bloodshed, the Gaddafi regime has failed its own people. The decision of the international community to take a stand and protect Libyan civilians from further attack has Australia’s full support.

            I thank Senator Forshaw for his question. Notwithstanding the recent international intervention, the situation for the people of Libya remains very grim. More than 300,000 people have fled Libya since mid-February, many of them across Libya’s borders with Tunisia and Egypt. The
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
             United Nations
            </a>
            World Food Programme has boosted its activities in the region and is providing more than 15,000 hot meals a day in a transit camp along Libya’s border with Tunisia. Australia strongly supports the request by the United Nations for humanitarian agencies to be allowed access to all parts of Libya in order to assist the civilian population and alleviate the suffering of those affected. In supporting the United Nations resolutions, which also strengthen arms embargoes against Libya, the Australian government is focused on providing the best possible protection to the citizens of Libya.

              Australia does of course join the international community in demanding that the brutal suppression of the civilian population by the Gaddafi regime ceases immediately. Australia has committed an additional $4 million for vulnerable groups in Libya and to help manage the influx of people into Tunisia and Egypt. The Australian government has pledged $2 million to the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
               United Nations
              </a>
              High Commissioner for Refugees and $2 million to the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organization" rel="nofollow">
               International Organization
              </a>
              for Migration. Australia’s total assistance to the people of Libya now exceeds $15 million, making us the third largest donor overall behind the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_and_the_European_Union" rel="nofollow">
               United States and the European Union
              </a>
              . So it is clear that Australia is playing its part in the intervention designed to protect the people of Libya. We will continue to support action that puts their interests first and attacks the Gaddafi regime’s very unacceptable treatment of its own people. (
