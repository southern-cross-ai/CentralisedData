         by leaveâ€”The government does not support this referral of legislation to a references committee. The bill has already been subject to a Senate legislation committee that has reported. Opposition senators have already said that they will oppose this legislation and have not explained why they wish to drag this out until March. The government is opposed to the concept of referring legislation to references committees as a matter of principle. We will not be supporting the motion.
