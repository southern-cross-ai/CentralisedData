        My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I draw the minister’s attention to the continued repression of political opponents to the Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe. I ask the minister whether she can outline to the Senate the government’s position on further targeted sanctions being applied to that country, including further economic sanctions from Australia, and also the suggestion by the former captain of the Zimbabwean cricket team
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Flower" rel="nofollow">
         Andy Flower
        </a>
        that some kind of sporting sanction could be applied. I do acknowledge that members of the government have made comments to this effect, and I ask the government to outline for us the government’s position on such sanctions.

        <p>
         Thank you to Senator Stott Despoja for a question about a matter that obviously is of great concern to the Australian government and, I am sure, to everybody in this chamber. Before addressing some of Senator Stott Despoja’s specific questions, I wish to place on record, on behalf of the minister, that the government is appalled at the barbaric actions of the Zimbabwean government in violently suppressing the activities of the political opposition on and after 11 March. I am sure the Senate would wish to know that Mr Downer made our views very clear to the Zimbabwean charge d’affaires on 15 March. Mr Downer’s department also called him in on 16 March.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are urging Zimbabwe’s neighbours—who would have the greatest leverage over Zimbabwe, as Senator Stott Despoja would appreciate—and key members of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Union" rel="nofollow">
          African Union
         </a>
         and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_African_Development_Community" rel="nofollow">
          Southern African Development Community
         </a>
         to use their influence to persuade the Zimbabwean government to respect the rule of law and the civil and political rights of its people. We are working with countries concerned about the political and economic catastrophe in Zimbabwe to place greater pressure on the leadership, including by allowing the situation to be considered by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Human_Rights_Council" rel="nofollow">
          United Nations Human Rights Council
         </a>
         . I think it has been said in the press, but it is worth repeating that the Australian ambassador and the consul in Harare are appalled at the injuries sustained by Mrs Sekai Holland, Mr Morgan Tzvangirai and other leaders. Inquiries have been made as to their current condition, their having been severely beaten in detention.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia has imposed progressively strengthened travel bans and financial sanctions against members of the Zimbabwean government since 2002, and we urge other countries to do likewise. The Zimbabwean government’s policies have crippled a once-thriving economy, leaving citizens to endure hyperinflation. Zimbabwe’s unemployed population is living very close to the poverty line. Perhaps the most appalling statistic is its lowest life expectancy of any country.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Stott Despoja asked about the implications for Australia’s
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International" rel="nofollow">
          One Day International
         </a>
         tour to Zimbabwe. Mr Downer has previously called on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council" rel="nofollow">
          International Cricket Council
         </a>
         to change its rules to allow teams to forfeit tours to countries where serious human rights abuses are occurring. It will be up to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Cricket Australia
         </a>
         to consider a range of issues on its mooted One Day International tour of Zimbabwe, including the security of the Australian team, and to consider with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC" rel="nofollow">
          ICC
         </a>
         just how the game of cricket could possibly be seen to be served by international tours to Zimbabwe.
        </p>
        <p>
         I also have some very recent information, which is that the Prime Minister has apparently said that he will speak to Mr Downer about this issue but that he has an inclination to maintain his previous position that the government would prefer that the tour did not go ahead but that the decision would be left to Cricket Australia, noting that it does have some attendant obligations to the ICC.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I asked the minister to outline the government’s opinion on further economic sanctions that have been called for, including from members in this place. I also ask whether the minister is aware of a recommendation by the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Crisis_Group" rel="nofollow">
           International Crisis Group
          </a>
          , which actually suggests that members of families who are the subjects of those targeted sanctions applied by the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU" rel="nofollow">
           EU
          </a>
          or the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
           US
          </a>
          have their visas or their residency permits cancelled. Is the government aware of any Zimbabweans currently in Australia who fall into that category—that is, the children or relatives of people who are subject to those particular sanctions? If that is the case, what will the government do about considering or revoking those visas or permits? Once again, I want to clarify: is the government saying that it will not consider a sporting sanction but it is clearly leaving it up to the cricket board, or will our government consider, as it has done previously in relation to
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa" rel="nofollow">
           South Africa

          and apartheid, supporting a sporting sanction?

            It was a long supplementary question, and I intend Senator Stott Despoja no disrespect by not being able to deal with all of it as comprehensively as I would choose to. Perhaps I will deal with the last question first. It is the case that the Prime Minister has asked Mr Downer to consider the position of the tour. The government’s present inclination is that we would prefer that the tour did not go ahead but that we would leave the decision to
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_Australia" rel="nofollow">
             Cricket Australia
            </a>
            , noting that Cricket Australia has some attendant or other obligations to the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC" rel="nofollow">
             ICC
            </a>
            . Whilst the government might have a clear preference, the position that Cricket Australia takes will be a matter for it—but the government’s view would be drawn to its attention.
           </p>
           <p>
            As to the issues to do with economic sanctions, I think those deserve a much longer answer than I am able to give right at this very moment. But I will check, for the purposes of providing a comprehensive answer, whether there are children or relatives in Australia of the category that Senator Stott Despoja talks about.
