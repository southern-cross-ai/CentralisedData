         I thank Senator Crossin for her question. The Fair Work Bill, which was introduced into the House of Representatives earlier this week, marks a new beginning for Australian workplace relations. It marks a decisive break from

           did not get everything it wanted, it has said that changes were warranted and of course can be welcomed. It also noted that the new legislation creates ‘opportunities for increased productivity through enterprise bargaining’. The
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Industry_Group" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Industry Group
           </a>
           has welcomed the emergence of ‘a workable compromise’ from what was otherwise called excessive and testing negotiations over many months. It says the legislation has addressed the Ai Group’s concern that ‘important protections for employers’ be put in place. The Fair Work Bill delivers on Labor’s promise to create a new workplace relations system, and it builds on earlier action to abolish individual Australian workplace agreements. It restores balance and fairness to the workplace relations system. It restores dignity and respect for Australian workers. Unlike those opposite, Australians believe in giving people a fair go.

             This bill provides certainty. I have said before that there is no more precious commodity in difficult times than certainty. The Fair Work Bill gives industry the certainty it needs to plan for the future. It gives employees the certainty they need to invest their time and their talents in their chosen work. It will foster mutual respect and cooperation. This is the key to harnessing creativity throughout the workplace—from the boardroom to the mailroom, from the executive suite to the factory floor. It gives the key to building partnerships and to reform and renewal in industry. The Fair Work Bill gives us more collaborative workplaces, more productive workplaces and workplaces where innovation can flourish. It will make Australia fairer now and stronger for the future. It is a marked departure from

               I certainly could offer some advice here. There are different views on workplace relations, and the opposition holds all of them. There are those who pine for a return to
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_Choices" rel="nofollow">
                Work Choices
               </a>
               and there are those, of course, who cannot repudiate the Howard legacy fast enough. There is, of course, Senator Abetz, who introduced the Work Choices legislation in this chamber, promising that it would give Australia ‘a brighter future’. Instead, it has left many Australians with no future at all.

                 Senator Abetz contributed significantly to the election of a Labor government. He now takes the view that we should not give any blank cheques. That did not stop him spending 120 million taxpayers’ dollars on
