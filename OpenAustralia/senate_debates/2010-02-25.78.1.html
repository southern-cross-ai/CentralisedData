        My question is to the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Government Service Delivery, Senator Arbib. Did any departmental officials ever advise or suggest to the minister or his staff that the starting date of the Home Insulation Program should be delayed?

         , Water, Heritage and the Arts. I met with departments relevant to all aspects of the stimulus: education, housing and defence housing. There were numerous discussions about the rollout of the stimulus. I state again that there is a total misunderstanding and misrepresentation of what my role was as the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Government Service Delivery. They have been trying all week to misrepresent me and my role, but it is pretty clear that the individual ministers in each portfolio were responsible for their—

          , a point of order: the minister has been going for more than a minute on what was a very simple and direct question. I draw your attention to the relevance of his answer. He is answering questions from earlier this week and failing to answer the very direct question: did any departmental officials ever advise or suggest to the minister or any of his staff that the starting date of the Home Insulation Program should be delayed? It should be a simple yes-or-no answer.

               . Again, there has been a complete misrepresentation by coalition senators on what my role was. As I have stated time and time again, I am advised that there was a whole suite of work that formed an overall risk assessment for this program. As I have said, this was not confined just to the Minter Ellison document that the coalition has gone on and on about. But, because you have gone on about the Minter Ellison report, I am happy to respond to some of those risk-assessment issues, such as that on page 5, where they identified the risk of house fire—

                    I cannot instruct the minister how to answer the question. I have said this repeatedly. I have drawn the minister’s attention to the question that was asked. I have asked the minister to address the question that was asked. You are right: there are five seconds remaining. The minister has five seconds to address the question that was raised by Senator Birmingham.

                      , I ask a supplementary question. I will not waste the time of the Senate by posing the initial question that the minister failed to answer again. Given the minister’s statements yesterday and on Tuesday that his role at these regular meetings with officials was ‘to ensure the rollout was proceeding smoothly and on time’, did the minister or his office ever suggest to departmental officials that the implementation of the insulation program be sped up, or stress that there could be no delays to the implementation of this program?

                        I cannot be expected to remember every conversation that happens. It was a long time ago. But, at the same time as that, I worked along with the Office of the Coordinator-General to ensure that the stimulus was rolled out as smoothly as possible. As I have said, we have, according to Treasury, supported 200,000 Australian jobs. Talk to the Master Builders—50,000 jobs supported in the construction sector. Those on the other side of the chamber, those Liberal Party and National Party senators, do not want to hear about it. They do not want to hear about it because they voted against the stimulus—

                            , I ask a further supplementary question. Given the minister will not deny that he told departmental officials to speed things up, why did the Rudd government ignore the recommendation in the Minter Ellison risk assessment that the implementation of the Home Insulation Program should be delayed by three months? Does the minister agree that accepting this advice could have helped to protect lives, homes, jobs and businesses?

Again, Mr Garrett has stated time and time again that he was in consultation and discussion with the insulation sector, with the industry, with the training bodies, to ensure that the compliance and auditing system was in place for the rollout of the system.
