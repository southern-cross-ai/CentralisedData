        My question is to the Minister representing the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development, Senator Canavan. Can the minister advise the Senate how the Liberal-National government's sound budget and economic management is guaranteeing funding for the infrastructure that Australian families and businesses rely on, including projects like the Inland Rail, in my home state of Queensland?

         Thank you, Senator Rennick, for that very important question. There's a lot going on in infrastructure in Queensland. It's all part of our more than $100 billion spend—a record spend—on infrastructure. This government is making a record spend on infrastructure. That's supporting more than 80,000 jobs in Australia at the moment, with projects under construction.
        </p>
        <p>
         You mentioned the Inland Rail, Senator Rennick. I know you're a big supporter of opening up agricultural opportunities in particular in this country, and the Inland Rail does just that. The Inland Rail is a nation-building project that will hook Melbourne up to Brisbane for the first time with a proper inland freight rail network. This will cut time, save money and support jobs.

              As I was saying, this will create a corridor of commerce in inland towns through our country. The

               CSIRO
              </a>
              has estimated that this project will cut $76 a tonne off freight costs between Melbourne and Brisbane; it will allow it to be transported in under 24 hours. For the first time we'll have rail journeys between Melbourne and Brisbane taking less than a full day.
             </p>
             <p>
              It is a shame that the speaker of Queensland is no longer with us, because I know he takes a keen interest in rail projects in his home state. Last week we signed a bilateral agreement with the Queensland government to finally get this project going in Queensland, and a big part of the spend—about $6 billion of the $9 billion project—will be spent in Queensland—in your home state, Senator Rennick, and my home state. This fantastic project is supporting more than 7,000 jobs in Queensland; around 15,000 jobs will be created through the life of this project. But it's not just about the jobs that are created during construction; it is about opening up our nation for commerce, it is about connecting up rural towns for better freight options, and it is supporting agriculture and the expansion of agricultural industries, because the closer they are to port then the closer they are to their customers in Asia, which will mean more production and more jobs here in Australia.

                 The only reason that this government has the capacity to make these nation-building investments—these game-changing investments for our country—is that we have managed our nation's budget. It's because we've managed other people's money better than others have done before us. We are producing the first surplus in this nation in a decade, and that allows us to have the capacity to invest in things that will make this country stronger. So, yes, this Inland Rail project is a large project, at over $9 billion, but by managing the budget properly we can have the funding to open up these opportunities for Australian farmers and for Australian regional communities.

                 There is more. We're investing $44 million in a facilitation program—in an infrastructure improvement program—alongside the Inland Rail, to help small projects—like to hook up with grain silos and sidings off this major trunk line. This will open up opportunities for small towns through rural
