       <p class="italic">

       <p class="italic">
        (ii) today there have been reports of a further violent death of a woman in Queensland – her death is under investigation and raises the toll to 26,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii) there is no national government reporting program to record the ongoing toll of women killed by violence in real time – this work is currently left to researchers at not-for-profit organisations like Destroy the Joint,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iv) on average, one woman a week is murdered by her current or former partner,

       </p>

        (x) there is growing evidence that women with disabilities are more likely to experience violence,

        (ii) adequately fund frontline domestic violence and crisis housing services to ensure that all women seeking safety can access these services when and where they need them,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii) legislate for 10 days paid domestic violence leave so that women don't have to choose between paying the bills and seeking safety,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iv) implement all 25 recommendations contained in the report of the Finance and Public Administration References Committee on domestic violence in Australia, tabled on 20 August 2015, and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (v) much like the national road toll, maintain and publish an official real-time national toll of women killed by violence in Australia.

           The Morrison government has taken action against the scourge of violence against Australian women. The government is making the single biggest ever investment of $328 million to the next national plan to reduce violence against women and children, which is focused on prevention, frontline services and emergency accommodation.
