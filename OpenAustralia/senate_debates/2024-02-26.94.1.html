        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Resources, Minister Watt. In the lead-up to the last election, the Prime Minister,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Albanese" rel="nofollow">
         Anthony Albanese
        </a>
        , made the strongest possible election commitment to stopping petroleum exploration project 11, known as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEP" rel="nofollow">
         PEP
        </a>
        -11, from proceeding off the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        coast. Earlier this month, the New South Wales government announced its plan to stop PEP-11 in its state waters. I understand that the PEP-11 proposal is now with a joint Commonwealth-state authority. Can you confirm today that Minister King has the final say on the future of PEP-11, and can you tell coastal communities across New South Wales, who want this project stopped, when this decision will be made?

         Thank you, Senator Whish-Wilson. I do recall the commitment that the Prime Minister made and Labor made, prior to the election, on an issue that I know is of great significance in that part of Australia. Since coming to office, the government has been left with no choice but to concede that Mr Morrison's actions on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEP" rel="nofollow">
          PEP
         </a>
         -11 could not be defended in court, so the government is taking a different approach by governing with competency and in the national interest.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am aware that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         government will introduce legislation to ban offshore resources development in New South Wales coastal waters and that the bill is intended to ban new offshore resources activity in New South Wales coastal waters. I understand that the New South Wales bill does not ban PEP-11, which is in Commonwealth waters rather than New South Wales coastal waters. So the New South Wales bill, as I say, relates only to offshore resources activity in New South Wales coastal waters. In terms of that bill, it's obviously a matter for the New South Wales government, and I refer you to them about this point. But we do understandâ€”

             government and the Australian government on 18 October 2023. Departments are now reviewing this advice, as is appropriate. Any future decision on PEP-11 would first need to be considered by the government of New South Wales as a member of the Commonwealth-New South Wales offshore petroleum joint authority. A future decision on PEP-11 will only be considered by the Australian government once the New South Wales government minister has considered NOPTA's advice and made a formal decision on PEP-11, but it's not the government's intention to provide an ongoing commentary on PEP-11.

The Prime Minister visited communities on the northern beaches of Sydney last week, meeting with constituents and discussing issues relating to coastal protection. Did the Prime Minister, during these community meetings, reiterate your government's pre-election commitment to end PEP-11 once and for allâ€”no ifs, no butts?

                Thanks, Senator Whish-Wilson. I obviously wasn't present with the Prime Minister when he made that visit. I was in a range of other places across Australia last week, but not there. But I'm confident that the Prime Minister will have reiterated the position that I've put, which is that we have received advice from NOPTA, the National Offshore Petroleum Titles Administrator. Departments, including those in this government, are now reviewing this advice and we'll make a decision on

                  : 'A Labor government I lead will rule out PEP-11,' and, 'We will consign it to the dustbin of history where it belongs.' Two years into this term of governmentâ€”after sitting on this advice for six months, I note from your previous answerâ€”will you provide certainty to New South Wales coastal communities on stopping PEP-11 that is causing anxiety, frustration and anger?

                   Thanks, Senator Whish-Wilson. The government very much understands the concerns of many in the local community about this particular project, and that's why we took the position that we did. But it's not my intention to jeopardise an administrative decision, which is yet to be made, by speculating about what may or may not happen and what decision may or may not be made.

                   and Australian governments. That advice is now being considered by the relevant departments. For me to speculate on what the outcome of that might be would be risky and would potentially create avenues for legal action, which we don't want to provide. We want to make this decision properly, in accordance with the law and in accordance with good process, and I have no doubt that a decision will be made as soon as possible.
