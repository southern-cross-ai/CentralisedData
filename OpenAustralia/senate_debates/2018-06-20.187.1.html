        In accordance with the order agreed to earlier, it being past 6.30 pm, the debate is interrupted for consideration of the Treasury Laws Amendment (Personal Income Tax Plan) Bill 2018. The time allotted for consideration of this bill has expired and the questions will now be put. I will first put the outstanding questions that were before the committee prior to senators' statements. I will put the question on the amendments that were before the chair earlier today. I will then work through the questions on the other amendments circulated in respect of the bill. If any senator wishes to withdraw amendments they have circulated, they may do so by leave. Senator Collins?

          I'm about to read out the ones that were before the chair earlier today. I will now go through the amendments by sheet and by number as I put them to the chamber, starting with the ones that were already moved before the chair in the committee stage. The question is that amendment Nos (3) to (8), (10) and (12) to (15) on sheet 8441, moved by Senator Storer, be agreed to. Senator Collins?

           Just so that we can be clear—and I understand there's no debate, discussion or the like on the actual amendments—I think it's important for senators, particularly in circumstances where we don't have a committee consideration, to understand what the question actually is before us. The point you made earlier was that you were proceeding with those questions that had already been moved in the limited debate that we had—

             So, looking at the running sheet and comparing that with the revised running sheet—and thank you to the clerks for providing it—Senator Storer's amendments, the ones that have already been moved, are (3) to (8), (10) and (12) to (15). Senator Storer's amendment (1) is not being moved at this stage; is that correct?

                I have just taken some advice from the Clerk, which confirms my past experience that, where amendments have been circulated in the chamber—and these were before the chair and well circulated—there is not a need to read them out. There is no doubt about what the matter we are dealing with is.

                 The difficulty I have with the difference here is that the Clerk's advised you on how matters would be dealt with under normal circumstances, which is not what we're dealing with here. We're dealing with an artificial distinction between amendments that have been previously moved and the ones that haven't yet been dealt with. In the case of Senator Storer, for instance, he has only now started to understand that, in terms of the batching of his issues—

                  Senator Collins, I was referring to my own experience of when the Senate has adopted this procedure that I am now bound by, which is to put these votes without debate or discussion. I've made a ruling in respect of there being no need to read the amendments out. I have allowed you to put your point. I've made my ruling. I'm now going to put the question, because that is what the Senate has directed me to do—to put these motions without debate or discussion. So the question is—and I'll read it again—that amendment Nos (3) to (8), (10) and (12) to (15) on sheet 8441, moved by Senator Storer, be agreed to.

                    We will go through the other amendments in an order that I have been provided with. They will all be voted on by the Senate. Even if they were not before the chair, all the amendments will be voted on by the Senate in an order starting now.

                      I will restate it and I'll make it very clear. The first set of amendments are the ones that were moved by Senator Storer earlier today and were before the chair at the time. Then we will proceed through other matters. But I'm going to put that question now. I'm not going to read them out four times every time. I'll do it again now. The question is that amendment numbers (3) to (8), (10) and (12) to (15) on sheet 8441, moved by Senator Storer, be agreed to.

                         Could I just briefly make two points. I appreciate that you're giving me some leeway to do so, so I will be brief. The first is that these include the amendments which proposed Labor's bigger, better and fairer tax plan, so I just draw that to the attention of the chamber given that Senator Cormann made some inaccurate statements earlier today.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         In light of that, what I'd also say to you,
                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
                          Mr President
                         </a>
                         , is that there is a distinct possibility there may be senators who wish to vote differently on items (1) to (3), (5), (7), (9) and (10) on sheet 8450. These are items that fill a gap in the tax law as a result of the Senate's earlier decision to omit step 3 of the government's plan from the bill. They implement the step 2 tax rates for 2024-25 and later income years rather than leaving no rates in place, and they make associated consequential amendments. So I would invite you to consider putting those items that I've identified in that contribution separately.

                              Senator Collins, I have offered senators the opportunity. Senator Whish-Wilson has indicated he would like some matters dealt with separately because he would like to vote differently on that to the others. No-one else has taken advantage of that opportunity, so I'm going to put it as I read it out just then. The question now is that amendments (1), (3), (4), (6) and (8) to (11) on sheet 8449, amendments (2), (13), (15), (17) and (19) on sheet 8449 and amendments (1) to (3), (5), (7), (9) and (10) on sheet 8450, circulated by the opposition, be agreed to.

But I would like to get on record that had we split those bills we would have said yes to 8449—amendments (1) to (10).

                                                            I don't have a request for that from Senator Whish-Wilson. He has asked to put the matter on the record. He's been granted the courtesy to do that. The question now is that the remaining stages of this bill be agreed to and the bill be now passed with amendments.
