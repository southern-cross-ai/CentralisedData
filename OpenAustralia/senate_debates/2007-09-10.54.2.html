         Purpose of the Bill
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill makes amendments to consolidate the alcohol measures in the
        <i>
         Northern Territory National Emergency Response Act 2007
        </i>
        .  For example, the 1,350 ml trigger for seeking and recording identification details in relation to takeaway alcohol sales will be clarified, certain exceptions made to the alcohol offences in relation to visitors to parks, and provision made for the alcohol measures to be determined not to apply in a particular area if warranted, for example, by strong local alcohol management measures.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Reasons for Urgency
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The existing alcohol measures take effect on Saturday, 15 September 2007.  If these amendments do not pass and take effect before that date, stakeholders potentially face dealing with two differing regimes in a short period of time.  This would create confusion, particularly at the point of sale, and potentially undermine public support for the new measures.

         This is the second time that I have introduced such legislation.
