         I thank Senator Ruston for her question. Senators will be aware that the drug ice is destroying families and hurting communities. It poses the highest risk of illicit drugs to our community, with ice use rates almost doubling in the last 12 months. It is a growing problem around Australia, but particularly in our rural and regional communities.
        </p>
        <p>
         Tackling ice is a priority for the Abbott government. We are aware that those who seek to profit from the importation of ice and other illicit drugs continue to pose a problem for our front-line border personnel. The government understands that securing our borders means not just ending the profitability of people smuggling but also ensuring that criminal enterprises will not profit from the scourge of ice.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government has been on the front foot in providing border agencies with the necessary powers to address drug imports into Australia. On 8 April this year, the Prime Minister announced the establishment of the National Ice Taskforce, led by Mr Ken Lay, to develop a strategy for combating the ice epidemic. Customs has a representative on this task force. Additionally, Customs has a strong and successful strategic partnership with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Federal Police
         </a>
         , using shared models for narcotics and precursor detections. Potentially indictable offences are subject to joint consideration for treatment options, which may include joint investigations leading to prosecution of those responsible for narcotics and precursor strategies and trafficking. In 2013-14 there were 1,379 detections of ice at the border, weighing approximately 1,435 kilos.
        </p>
        <p>
         This government has brought the focus on border protection back to where it should be and that is, of course, at the centre of government priorities. Our Ice Taskforce is proof of that.

           Intelligence-led, risk-based targeting is the key to seizing ice and other drugs either at or, ideally, before the border. For instance, on 5 June this year a Chinese national faced court after allegedly importing four kilograms of ice into Australia via the international mail. This resulted from a joint operation between Customs and the Federal Police, which began in July last year, when Customs officers examined cardboard parcels which arrived at
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Airport" rel="nofollow">
            Sydney Airport
           </a>
           declared to be auto rims. Examination of the cardboard cartons and their contents led to the discovery of parcels containing a white, crystalline substance concealed in the lining of the cartons, which tested positive for ice.
          </p>
          <p>
           Additionally, on 30 May this year, Customs officers at
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Airport" rel="nofollow">
            Melbourne Airport
           </a>
           seized almost 2Â½ litres of liquid methamphetamine hidden inside one shampoo bottle and two cognac bottles. The operational diligence of Customs and their partner agencies is yielding successes and sending a clear message.

             The coalition, as we all know, was elected with a clear mandate from the Australian people to secure our borders. But we understand that securing our borders does not just mean stopping the boats; it also means the government is committed to providing our front-line personnel with the resources that they need to get on with the job of tackling the scourge of ice. Last year, the government announced a $630 million funding boost to our security agencies. As part of that package, $150 million was set aside to strengthen Australia's borders. The government has also made a commitment of $700 million invested over the next six years for the Australian Border Force.

             Australians want to know that everybody in our communities, but especially young people, are not having their lives destroyed comprehensively because of exposure to the insidious methamphetamine drug that we know as ice. This is a government that is tackling ice head on in our community and at the border.
