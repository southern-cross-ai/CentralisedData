        My question is of the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Senator Arbib. Under the government’s award modernisation, what unique features of the restaurant and catering sector merit concessions separate from the hospitality sector?

         Thank you, Senator Fisher. It is a pleasure to be able to get up and talk about industrial relations, and certainly about the transition to a fair and less complex industrial relations system.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
          Can I
         </a>
         say to Senator Fisher that we are extremely proud of the work we are doing in award modernisation. It is an area that had been left on the backburner by the previous government for far too long and it is real reform. It is reform that business has actually been asking about—streamlining awards and ensuring less complex features.
        </p>
        <p>
         The transition will take place over five years, and there has been a great deal of discussion and consultation with the catering and restaurant industry; there is no doubt there has been a great deal of discussion and consultation with them. They have raised a number of issues in their operations concerning overtime and night shifts, and the Deputy Prime Minister has taken that on board and has asked the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Relations_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          Industrial Relations Commission
         </a>
         to have a look at those issues, which they are doing. There are certainly other issues in the areas you raise, and I am sure the follow-on question will be about other areas that the government will also be looking at—horticulture, retail and pharmacy. These areas are under examination by the government because we are about providing flexible, streamlined awards that actually provide fairness to workers but at the same time provide certainty to employers.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Those other sectors such as horticulture, cleaning services, retail, pharmacy and fast food consider they have the same challenges as the restaurant and catering sector. They want the same, Minister; you know they deserve the same. Will the government give them the same?

          <p>
           The decision by the Deputy Prime Minister to issue the variation to the award modernisation request was one that was not taken lightly. It is not the usual practice of the Deputy Prime Minister to intervene in the award modernisation process. However, in some cases there will need to be intervention.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
            Can I
           </a>
           say, Senator Fisher, that in the areas you raise—horticulture, pharmacy and retail—there is examination going on right now by the department and also by the Deputy Prime Minister. I do not think that is any surprise because there is extensive consultation with the sector going on right now; Senator Marshall just raised that. This was raised with Senator Fisher in estimates. Again, this is about streamlining these awards—reform that should have taken place in the past but was too hard for those on the other side of the chamber.

                As I said previously, those on the opposite side of the chamber actually voted for this legislation. They voted for this legislation—a fairer industrial relations system. But again we see the true colours of the Liberal Party—reverting to

                , the architect of Work Choices, may be on his way out, but those on the opposite side of the chamber still want it back. The government’s plan is to stimulate the economy with the largest infrastructure program the country has ever seen. We talk about the
