                      has made a text based referral of powers to the Commonwealth. Three other states have indicated that they will make referrals to the Commonwealth to empower the National VET Regulator and two states have indicated that they will pass mirroring legislation. Timely passage of the bill is therefore necessary to provide clarity to those states referring powers to the Commonwealth and certainty to those states that are mirroring the legislation as to what they need to legislate.
