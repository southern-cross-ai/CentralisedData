       <p>
        I recently highlighted the work of two outgoing Tasmanian mayors, Annie Revie and Julie Arnold, in this chamber. Today I would like to acknowledge the remaining eight mayors who are retiring at the local upcoming elections in Tasmania.
       </p>
       <p>
        It has been interesting to watch the evolution of local government over the years—no longer solely about rates, roads and rubbish, local councils offer a broad range of services and can, in some instances, lobby on behalf of the community to ensure state and federal governments deliver on promises and projects for their city, town or region.
       </p>
       <p>
        A notable example of such lobbying was the coalition government's policy of City Deals. Both Launceston and Hobart received City Deals under the previous government, and multiple projects are coming to fruition from these 10-year commitments. Tasmania is on the cusp of change at a grassroots level as my state approaches the local government elections in October. It is fitting that the elections will be held in Spring, traditionally a time of renewal, as 10 Tasmanian mayors are retiring from public life, many after significant years as an elected official.
       </p>
       <p>
        Local government is a level of government that cannot be understated. While we here in this chamber discuss matters of state or national importance, local government is the closest level to the public. Someone who understands that vital connection of government with public is outgoing
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Launceston" rel="nofollow">
         City of Launceston
        </a>
        mayor Albert van Zetten. Albert has spent the past 17 years in local government and is Launceston's longest serving mayor. After five successive terms as mayor, Albert is stepping down from this position in just a few weeks, when Tasmanians will cast their vote for who they wish to serve them at a local level.
       </p>
       <p>
        As an aside, these local government elections will be the first held under Tasmania's new compulsory voting legislation.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_City" rel="nofollow">
         The City
        </a>
        of Launceston town hall is just a block from my electoral office, but my dealings with Albert span well beyond my time in the Senate and his time as mayor. Albert spent more than 30 years as a chartered accountant and served as Launceston City Mission's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        for 30 years. Albert and his wife, Lyndle, have been involved with and supported many community organisations throughout northern Tasmania during this time.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was celebrating from the sidelines when Albert was first elected to the City of Launceston Council in 2005 and thrilled when he was elected mayor in 2007. Over almost two decades in local government, Albert has strived to make Launceston one of the world's greatest and most liveable regional cities. He believes in community collaboration and the idea that teamwork can make the impossible possible.
       </p>
       <p>
        With these big picture aims in mind, I want to share some of Albert's key achievements as Launceston's mayor. A significant project and one that has transformed the fabric of the city and surrounding suburbs is the Launceston City Deal. As with other City Deals this project is a joint initiative between all three levels of government and was delivered in 2017 by the City of Launceston, Tasmanian Liberal state government and the coalition federal government.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Launceston City Deal allowed Albert to work on something close to his heart: revitalising Launceston's northern suburbs by building stronger communities. This has been achieved by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Place" rel="nofollow">
         My Place
        </a>
        , My Future project in the northern suburbs, comprising Mowbray, Newnham, Mayfield, Rocherlea, Waverley, Ravenswood and Invermay. The suburbs account for around a third of Launceston's population.
       </p>
       <p>
        My place, My Future initiatives include Barbers for Life, with barbers trained to support the community and raise awareness around suicide prevention as well as create sharp styles. There is also Say G'Day on Bin Day, which helps to build relationships between neighbours that build to safer and stronger communities. And the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABCDE" rel="nofollow">
         ABCDE
        </a>
        Learning Sites program fosters connections between suburbs. I know My Place, My Future was driven by Albert's passion for this part of Launceston, and the northern suburbs are stronger for his efforts.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another venture realised under our City Deal was the ambitious $240 million Northern Transformation Project, where the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Tasmania" rel="nofollow">
         University of Tasmania
        </a>
        relocated to a new campus at Inveresk, within easy reach of the Launceston CBD. The first of three buildings have already opened at the Inveresk campus. University students, staff and the public enjoy the stunning new library and associated public spaces, including a community garden and Esk Activities Space, complete with sports courts. Construction has started on the second and third buildings—
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River's_Edge" rel="nofollow">
         River's Edge
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willis_Street" rel="nofollow">
         Willis Street
        </a>
        —with the entire campus to be complete by 2024.
       </p>
       <p>
        Launceston City Deal also includes $140 million funding for river health improvement programs within the Tamar Estuary. This initiative progresses TasWater infrastructure upgrades and ties in with Tasmanian government and Launceston and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Tamar" rel="nofollow">
         West Tamar
        </a>
        local government visions for this important riverway.
       </p>
       <p>
        Complementing the completed flood levies around Launceston, the iconic all-abilities recreation facility Riverbend Park is another project completed under Albert's watch. Built on a former industrial site at the edge of the Tamar, and connected to the popular Seaport precinct, Riverbend Park contains four zones of play equipment along with barbecue facilities and sports courts. Riverbend is home to the skywalk and the confluence net, two of the largest pieces of play equipment in Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Launceston's City Heart Project aims to make the city's CBD the premier lifestyle hub for Northern Tasmanians and cement its reputation as the country's most liveable regional city. Launceston City Heart includes redeveloping the city's public spaces, namely Quadrant Mall, Brisbane Street Mall and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_Square" rel="nofollow">
         Civic Square
        </a>
        . This project is the largest ever undertaken by the council, and its first stage was initiated and completed during Albert's tenure as mayor.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mayors and counsellors who have the foresight to look at the big picture for their communities can deliver meaningful reforms and community assets that pay dividends in the years to come. Another of those big-picture thinkers is outgoing Devonport mayor Annette Rockliff. She has been steadfast at the helm of Devonport's greatest urban renewal project—
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_City" rel="nofollow">
         Living City
        </a>
        .
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Living_City" rel="nofollow">
         The Living City
        </a>
        project has developed civic buildings like the $48 million paranaple centre, which recently hosted our state conference. It was also the venue for the Sustainable Economic Growth for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Regional Australia
        </a>
        conference, marking the first time Tasmania hosted this national event. However, Living City is not only about civic buildings; this initiative will soon deliver a public playground and open space attached to a new Novotel hotel on the waterfront overlooking the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersey_River" rel="nofollow">
         Mersey River
        </a>
        . Separate to Living City, Devonport's port is undergoing a $240 million upgrade to deliver modern infrastructure for the port and to support the continued growth of the Spirit of Tasmania's ferry and freight services.
       </p>
       <p>
        Annette has been Devonport mayor since 2018, taking on the role after the resignation of former senator
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Martin" rel="nofollow">
         Steve Martin
        </a>
        . She has served 15 years on the council and became deputy mayor in 2014. As such, she has been integral to the conversations on these developments and has overseen various stages of Living City, activating Devonport's city centre and transforming it for future generations.
       </p>
       <p>
        For many years, Tasmanian communities have been held in good stead by a vast array of strong rural women like Annette who enthusiastically create change in their communities. Another of those is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        mayor Jan Bonde. She has been heading up that council for 12 years and been an elected member for 17 years—an incredible achievement. Jan has also been at the forefront of renewal in Ulverstone and the Central Coast area, overseeing community asset redevelopments like the showground precinct, Ulverstone Wharf, Anzac Park and the new hive museum and art gallery. They are a boon for that region. Under Jan's leadership, Central Coast has become an active and thriving community. Jan counts this community reducing its waste by 45 per cent among one of her finest achievements as mayor.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, the reality of public life is that it's not suited to everyone—something that became apparent for many of the mayors who are retiring at this election. Kentish mayor
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Wilson" rel="nofollow">
         Tim Wilson
        </a>
        is not recontesting his position after one term in office. Tim took over the role from predecessor Don Thwaites and was elected unopposed in 2018. His decision to resign from his role is financial, outlining his return to full-time employment as he does not feel he can adequately support himself and his family on a rural mayoral salary.
       </p>
       <p>
        Family is a common theme for Tasmanian mayors who have reconsidered their roles. Waratah-Wynyard mayor Robbie Walsh,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_Head" rel="nofollow">
         Circular Head
        </a>
        mayor Daryl Quilliam, Clarence Council mayor Doug Chipman and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huon_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Huon Valley
        </a>
        mayor Bec Enders—who left her position earlier this year—all cited a desire to have more time with their families as part of their decision to resign. While there is excitement in renewal, we must take pause to consider the realities of a commitment to public life and how we can create new opportunities for the next crop of political leaders.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to take this opportunity to say thank you to all the outgoing mayors of Tasmania for their service and contribution to our community. I look forward to working together with the successful candidates for council positions at the October elections.
