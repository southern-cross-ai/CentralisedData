        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction, Senator Birmingham. The minister yesterday refused to confirm whether the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction would submit to an interview by the special strike force, Strike Force Garrad, established by the

            I have reflected on the question that was asked by the opposition yesterday. The opposition have asked for this inquiry and this investigation. The opposition have sought it, allegedly seeking an independent inquiry and investigation into this matter. Out of respect for an independent inquiry and investigation into this matter, I don't intend to come into this chamber and seek to provide a running commentary in relation to this investigation. The government has been clear there will be full cooperation with this inquiry and investigation. If there are questions in relation to the conduct of that inquiry and investigation, those questions ought to be directed to the

As much as the Labor Party might think it's a matter for Labor not only to write letters and initiate investigations but also to conduct these investigations, the minister is not in a position to provide a running commentary in relation to the conduct of an independent law enforcement investigation. The point of order that Senator Wong raised should be dismissed.

                    It is not for the chair to rule on the content of answers as long as they are directly relevant. It is not for me to instruct the minister how to answer a question. There is an opportunity after question time for debating answers. The minister is being directly relevant, even if it is not the preferred mode of answer of those asking it. Senator Birmingham to continue.

                     The government could not have been clearer about the full cooperation that will be provided to this investigation. But those opposite, who asked for this investigation, now seem to be doing everything possible to try to undermine or corrupt the investigation, rather than letting it run as an independent investigation. You don't like it, do you, Senator Wong?
