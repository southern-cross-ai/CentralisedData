        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. Minister, over the past week the government has repeatedly criticised the opposition for wanting to talk about matters other than the Voice. So I'd like to ask the government some specific questions about how the Voice will work. How will the different Indigenous groups represented by the Voice resolve internal differences? Will they vote like a parliament? Will they give multiple dissenting opinions like a court? Or will they be required to reach consensus like a treaty negotiation?

            As I said, the senator well knows that, were the referendum to be passed, those in this chamber would get the opportunity, as members of parliament and the Senate, to resolve the sorts of matters that she is describing.

                   . Well, you know what's pathetic? That's pathetic: to say, 'We can’t win the election unless we defeat the Voice solidly.' You know what that shows? You learnt nothing from the last election about what Australians want. You continue the Morrison-Dutton legacy of always looking to your own interest and never to the national interest.

                                  Senator Ayres, I am trying to get the chamber to order, and that interjection across the chamber was very unhelpful.
