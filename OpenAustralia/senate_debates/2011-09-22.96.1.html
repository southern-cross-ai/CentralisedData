         I thank Senator Bilyk for the question and her interest in this issue. I am proud as a member of the Labor government to inform the Senate that this week the government delivered the fourth increase to pensions since we have been in government.
        </p>
        <p>
         Following the government's historic pension reforms age pensioners, disability pensioners, carers and veterans income support recipients have received increases to better reflect the actual costs for pensioner households. From this week single pensioners are receiving almost $20 extra a fortnight. Pensioner couples on the maximum rate, combined, will receive almost $30 a fortnight to help them meet increased household costs. Since coming to office this government has delivered pension increases of about $148 per fortnight to the maximum pension for singles and $146 per fortnight for couples, combined. It is something the Labor government is extremely proud of. All up, 3.4 million pensioners across Australia will receive an increase in their payments.
        </p>
        <p>
         This government recognises the enormous contribution pensioners have made and continue to make to our nation. That is why it took a Labor government to act and a Labor government to ensure these increases went through. The government's reforms have delivered not only pension increases but also a new pension supplement, a pension work bonus and a new indexation system. These reforms to the pension have been absolutely critical for Australian pensioners, who for years were neglected by those opposite, who ignored the fact that pension increases were not keeping pace with the cost of living. We as a Labor government understand that. We understood it at the time, and when we came to office we acted. Since Labor came to office pensioners are now $148 per fortnight better off—

           We understand the importance of employment and the dignity of work. Many senior Australians want to work and continue in the workforce and play an active part. The pension increases delivered by the Labor government recognise that. But at the same time we introduced the seniors work bonus to make sure that pensioners benefit and are not penalised for contributing more to the Australian economy and to the workforce. This means that pensioners can keep more of their pension when they take on some part-time work. For example, if they decide to work during the Christmas sales season or to help out during the census, one of which recently took place, eligible age pensioners can now earn up to $250 per fortnight without it being taken into account as income. Over a year this could be worth up to $6,500. Almost 80,000 age pensioners with employment income stand to benefit from the work bonus. So again Labor is acting for pensioners, making sure that they can financially meet their obligations. The coalition is opposing—

            , I ask a further supplementary question. Given that addressing cost-of-living pressures is critical to the health and life quality of millions of Australian pensioners, are there any future challenges or risks that may arise and what can be done to avoid these risks?

             We know the risk; it is the $70 billion black hole that those on the other side of the chamber have in place through the faulty economic management of the Liberal Party in the other place. There is a $70 billion black hole. It has already been put in place and it has already been agreed by Mr Robb, who has already shown that it is there.
            </p>
            <p>
             Let's talk about the attitude of those on the other side in the Liberal Party. Senators and members in the previous cabinet refused an increase for pensioners. They let the pension slip further and further behind without acting for an increase. We know this is the case, because the then minister, Mr Brough, said that he had taken it to the cabinet and asked them to increase the pension. But, no, it was opposed. In relation to the $70 billion worth of cuts, on
