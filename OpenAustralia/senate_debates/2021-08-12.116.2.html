        . I think we can all agree in this place that Australia has done all Australians very proud. I, like many Australians, have been an armchair expert over the last three weeks, watching much of the coverage of these games. I'm sure you would agree, Madam Acting Deputy President Askew, that it has been so inspiring to see so many Tasmanian athletes on the world stage representing our state. We have been blessed to see 12 Tasmanians compete in a total of nine sports, including swimming; hockey; soccer; track and road cycling; triathlon; basketball; rowing; athletics; and canoeing.

They have represented their nation at the highest level in sport, something that no-one will ever be able to take away from them.

        for his time at the games officiating at the athletics. Tokyo 2020 has been providing hope and aspiration to all of us during a very trying time globally and at home in own state of Tasmania. So congratulations to all of them. But, in particular, Ariarne Titmus is now a household name, and I'm sure all Tasmanians and Australians are looking forward to welcoming her home along with her medals.

        The footage over the past couple of weeks has displayed raw emotion and the power of sport to bring communities together. It is extremely gratifying to watch athletes in peak condition compete, endure and be successful, to prepare themselves mentally andâ€”
