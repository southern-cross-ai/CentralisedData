         for the question and for her career-long effort in supporting the rights of working women right around this country. Equality for women is at the heart of what we do as a Labor government. There's no other government in recent memory that has done as much for Australian women as we have tried to do in our first year in government. For too long Australians were treated as second-class citizens, and, after nine years of blokey budgets, this is finally a budget that delivers for women. It delivers for all women now and into the future but gives the most economically vulnerable immediate relief with—

               Thank you. We are supporting women's economic equality and helping to close the gender pay gap with investments to support highly feminised workforces, including fully funding a wage increase for aged-care workers; investing in the Australian Skills Guarantee, which includes national targets for women in apprenticeships; and investing in building and retaining the early childhood education workforce. An additional half a billion in further investment in the National Plan to End Violence against

               will bring the total funding for investment in that national plan to a record of $2.3 billion. And there are a number of measures which address women's health priorities, including $26.4 million to support health and medical research focusing on women's health.

                  . I hope you can hear this answer to your question. In our first budget, less than six months after the election, we initiated structural changes that will continue on, hopefully, for generations to improve the lives of all Australian women. Our approach is not a sugar hit for women. It is going to change the landscape for women in this country. It builds on the investments we made in October, which will shift the dial on gender equality. This means investing in women's experiences across the board—for example, our investments in cheaper child care and paid parental leave.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  We've invested in making the workplace relations system work better for women, including by putting gender equality at the heart of the Fair Work Commission's decision-making and by implementing the

                  recommendations so that women are safer at work. We are investing in women's safety, including by introducing paid domestic and family violence leave and through consent and respectful relationships education.

                    Can the minister outline how this budget demonstrates the government's commitment to ensuring that the experiences of women are at the heart of the budget process?

                     , for the question. Before I start my answer, I welcome the Borroloola women who are in the back row up in the public gallery, who have come from seeing

                     . I say a big hello from us. It is so great to have you in the Senate, particularly when we are talking about our investments in women across the country.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Our achievements, investment and actions have been made deliberately and specifically to benefit women and contribute to gender equality because women are not an afterthought or something you add on at the end of the budget process. These are efforts that are being led by the Prime Minister down and across the cabinet and reflect the values of not only the government, which is a majority-female government, but the Australian people. These priorities will be carried forward in the budget process through our gender responsive budgeting, our Women's Budget Statement and the measures which support those.
