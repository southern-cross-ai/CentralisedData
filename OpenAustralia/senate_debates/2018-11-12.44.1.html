        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Cormann. Prime Minister Morrison was sacked as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Tourism Australia

        and Tourism Fran Bailey has confirmed:

       <p class="italic">
        … it was a unanimous decision to get rid of Mr Morrison by the board and the minister.
       </p>
       <p>
        I ask the minister: why was Prime Minister Morrison sacked as Tourism Australia's managing director?

         Firstly, what I would say in relation to the

            The minister has been speaking for 17 seconds. You have reminded him of the specific nature of your question. There are times when ministers can bring back information, but I will give him an opportunity to continue his answer because he has only been speaking for 17 seconds.

             Let me just tell you something: Mr Morrison did a great job as a great advocate for the Australian tourism industry. He did a great job as immigration minister, when he fixed up the chaos at our borders which you created. He did a great job as social services minister, when he initiated and implemented welfare reform. He did a great job as Treasurer.

                    Clearly the Labor Party doesn't want to listen to the strong support of the Australian tourism sector for the Prime Minister's performance when it comes to promoting policies that actually advance and support jobs and opportunity in the tourism sector.

                       On the point of order, Senator Cormann: Senator Wong has reminded you of the terms of the question. You need to be directly relevant to the preface to the question or the specific part of the question that Senator Wong has quoted. I note, however, that was the end of the question and the minister is entitled to be directly relevant to any part of the question. I have called him to the question.

                                      . Of course, the question asked goes to the performance of the Prime Minister. Let me say again, the Prime Minister has been an outstanding performer when it comes to fixing up Labor's mess at our borders, has been an outstanding performer when it comes to initiating and implementing social welfare reform and has been an outstanding performer as Treasurer. The Australian people know that he is one of the strongest advocates there is for a stronger tourism sector across Australia.

                                        Reports indicate that Prime Minister Morrison received a payout of more than $300,000 when he was sacked after only a year and a half as managing director of

                                         Again, the senator is asking questions about events, allegedly, that took place more than a decade and a half ago. I'm not personally aware of the employment circumstances at the time. What I do know is that Mr Morrison is highly regarded in the tourism sector as a very effective advocate and contributor to the tourism industry, just as he is highly regarded for his very effective contribution to delivering a stronger economy, more jobs and better opportunities for families around Australia to get ahead.

                                         Labor clearly has made a decision to come into this chamber today with the outcomes of the latest dirt unit work in the last sitting fortnight. Labor clearly has run out of ideas. They're running their dirt units through ancient history because they haven't got any policy to talk about and because they're so embarrassed by the negative impact on the economy of their high-taxing, reckless agenda.
