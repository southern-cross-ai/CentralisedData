        My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig. Can the minister explain to the Senate the Gillard government’s vision for putting Australia’s food system at the centre of government policy making?

         I thank Senator Sterle for his question. The Gillard government has developed the first ever National Food Plan. This is the first time the Australian government has ever taken a comprehensive view of the food system right through from the paddock to the plate. With growing export markets and a rising middle class in Asia, there are new opportunities for Australia on our doorstep, but these opportunities will not simply happen; we need a dedicated road map for government, industry, producers and our exporters. The National Food Plan is that road map. It brings together a range of strategies to assist in that endeavour.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have set a goal to increase the value of Australian agriculture and food related exports by 45 per cent in real terms by 2025. Any road map requires goals. We have also set the goal to increase Australia's agricultural productivity by 30 per cent by 2025. We will do this by helping farmers grow more food using fewer inputs. And we have set the goal for Australia to be amongst the top five most efficiently regulated countries in the world. The National Food Plan also sets out how the Gillard government will work to achieve those goals.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have established a $29 million Asian Food Markets Research Fund to provide support and research for the expansion of the Australian food industry into Asia. The

         </a>
         will also undertake a review of food regulation so we can cut red tape in the food-processing area. We will also publish two new reports to identify what Asia wants and the infrastructure we need to get it there. To overseas markets, we are working to create the first ever food—

           I thank Senator Sterle for his supplementary question. The growth of the middle class in Asia presents unparalleled opportunities for the Australian food industry. Take, for example, beef. Top restaurants in Shanghai advertise Australian beef as a premium product. Australian beef products into China, to give you one example, are forecast to rise to 60,000 tonnes in 2012-13. Eight years ago, that was only 5,000 tonnes. We want Australian food on more plates both here at home and around the world. To do that, we are investing in food businesses in Australia, strengthening our global brand and extending our reach into international markets. We are providing a $22-million grants program for food producers at home to improve new markets, technologies and biosecurity systems.

             I thank Senator Sterle for his supplementary question. The Gillard government has released the first ever National Food Plan. Unfortunately, the opposition do not have one and do not even talk about one. That is how much they care about food producers in Australia. But the actions of the state Liberal and Nationals governments will give you a clear indication of what those opposite are on about. In Queensland, Premier Campbell Newman sacked rural financial counsellors, closed biosecurity centres and cut funding from research and development. In Victoria, $40 million was slashed from agriculture, and there have been $300 million of

              TAFE
             </a>
             cuts that have seen campuses closed in rural Victoria and courses scrapped. Mr Abbott and the opposition need to commit to a national food plan. The opposition spokesperson, Mr Cobb, put out a press release, which was about the summary of his entire plan. All it did—
