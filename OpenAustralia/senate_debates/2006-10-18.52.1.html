        My question is to Senator Abetz representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Does the minister recall asserting on Monday:

        has not been adopted by Australia; it is subject to a review ... this government will not agree to anything that sacrifices the safety of passengers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Will the minister now correct the record and confirm that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CASA" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        knew in February that Boeing’s training arm, Alteon, would start Australia’s first MPL course in Brisbane next month and produce its first batch of so-called qualified pilots by January 2008? Was not the syllabus of this course in fact given to so-called ‘industry partners’, which, according to Alteon, include CASA, as early as April this year? How can CASA maintain an appropriate arms-length relationship with the industry at the same time as being considered an industry partner? Can the minister guarantee that no multi-crew pilot licence training will be conducted in Australia until the promised consultative process is completed?

         I am pleased to report to the Senate and to Senator O’Brien that I did not mislead the Senate the other day. In relation to the specific matter that Senator O’Brien now raises, I can advise that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CASA" rel="nofollow">
          CASA
         </a>
         is still reviewing Alteon’s training package documentation and has yet to approve the commencement of the trial. The trial is an opportunity for industry and CASA to further develop the competencies that underpin improved licensing arrangements. I understand the minister supports the aviation industry’s efforts to ensure that focused and targeted training is in place before any regulations are implemented. I also understand that no changes to current licensing arrangements will take place during the trial period and the 12-month consultation period will ensure that CASA is well placed to take into account any suggested improvements. Therefore, I can confirm that we as a government are not prepared to risk the safety of air travel in this country and I stand by the answer that I provided on behalf of my colleague the Minister for Transport and Regional Services earlier this week.

          understand the minister to be saying that there will be no course conducted in Brisbane commencing in November this year which is part of the multi-crew pilot licence training program? Is the minister saying that those courses have been cancelled, notwithstanding the fact that

           For the benefit of the honourable senator—and clearly he is trying to verbal me to get any hairy-scary type of headline—the simple fact is that what I indicated to the honourable senator was that
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CASA" rel="nofollow">
            CASA
           </a>
           is still reviewing the training package documentation. I indicated that there is a trial and an opportunity for industry and CASA to further develop the competencies that underpin improved licensing arrangements, and the minister for transport supports the aviation industry’s efforts to ensure that focused and targeted training is in place before any regulations are implemented. There is no contradiction to that which I said previously. I would suggest to the honourable senator that he watch this space carefully and develop policies of his own rather than simply relying on the old lazy habit of opportunity—that is, trying to be an opponent for opposition’s sake.
