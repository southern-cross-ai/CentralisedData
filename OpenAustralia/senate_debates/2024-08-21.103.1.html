        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Minister Wong. How has the government addressed the cost-of-living challenges while building a better and fairer education system, from early-childhood education all the way through to fee-free

        debt relief? Can the minister also detail particularly how the Albanese government is helping early-childhood educators get a pay rise while also keeping fees down for many working families?

         Thank you to Senator Ciccone for that excellent question. What I would say is we understand that Australians are struggling with cost-of-living challenges. We know that, which is why this government is working so hard to deliver assistance and support to Australians who are struggling with the cost of living and looking at all the ways we can help—tax cuts for all Australian taxpayers, energy bill relief for every household, cheaper medicines and more bulk-billing,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HECS" rel="nofollow">
          HECS
         </a>
         relief for everyone with a student debt—and, of course, fee-free
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
          TAFE
         </a>
         —support for people from the outer suburbs and regions to go to university and getting wages moving. We also provisioning for higher wages for aged-care and childcare workers.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, what have the opposition, who came in here talking about cost of living, actually done? Well, what they have really done is oppose cost-of-living relief at every chance they get. Not only that, but the ideas they put forward would cost more. Mr Dutton's plans would mean higher power prices, higher grocery prices and higher taxes, but there is one thing that would be lower under Mr Dutton. There would be one thing that would be lower—

           You got it, Sterlie—wages! Wages will definitely be lower under the Liberals and Nationals. You see, Labor wants Australians to earn more and keep more of what they earn, including early childhood educators and care workers. We are making sure that they are fairly paid by funding a 15 per cent wage increase, and we are always working to make sure the cost is not passed onto families. The wage increase is tied to a commitment from centres to limit fee increases, so better for parents, better for educators, better for children. This is on top of our cheaper childcare reforms that have cut the cost of child care for 1.2 million families.
          </p>
          <p>
           You don't like the truth do you, Senator Henderson? According to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
            ACCC
           </a>
           , childcare costs were cut by 11 per cent following our reforms—11 per cent!

             , I have met so many hardworking early childhood educators and parents who speak of what an important role they play. What will the government's decision to lift the wages of early childhood education and care workers mean for the workers and the industry more broadly?

              Thank you, Senator Ciccone, for the supplementary. Like all of us on this side of the chamber, he knows early childhood educators deserve a pay rise. The
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
               Productivity Commission
              </a>
              has made it clear: if we don't increase wages in the sector we won't have a workforce. Under the Albanese government's plan, an average worker receiving the award rate will get an extra $103 per week in pay by the end of the year, increasing to $155 extra by December 2025, a wage increase that will apply to workers in OSHC—outside of school hours care services—benefiting parents of school-aged children too.
             </p>
             <p>
              Of course, we take a different view to the opposition. We don't believe we should keep wages low by design. Of course, we have Senator Rennick, who is on the record on these issues. When Labor announced these changes, he said 'paying early educators more was going to destroy the family unit'. Is this the coalition's policy?
