           This is a government that does believe that you make decisions based on good evidence and good science. The reality is that climate scientists are telling governments all around the world that carbon pollution is contributing to climate change. Senators might like to know that 2010 was the warmest year on record and equal warmest were 2005 and 1998.

              I am unsurprised by the interjections, because those on the other side are led by someone who does not believe climate change is real. In this chamber the opposition is dominated by individuals who do not believe climate change is real. We have on one side the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
               CSIRO
              </a>
              , the

               Bureau of Meteorology
              </a>
              and the world’s respected climate scientists—but no, on the other side, the opposition know different. We know that Mr Abbott’s approach is somewhat confusing. It seems to change depending on who he is speaking to. On 14 March Mr Abbott said:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              ... whether carbon dioxide is quite the environmental villain that some people make it out to be is not yet proven.
             </p>
             <p>
              He also said:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              I don’t think we can say that the science is settled here.
             </p>
             <p>
              Then two days later Mr Abbott said:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              ... climate change is real. Mankind does contribute to it.
             </p>
             <p>
              And today Mr Abbott goes and addresses a rally which has signs such as ‘Carbon dioxide is not pollution. I love
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CO2" rel="nofollow">
               CO2
              </a>
              ’ and ‘CO2 is a harmless trace gas, you fraudulent criminals’. People are entitled to express those views—we disagree with them—but these are the sorts of views that the opposition is now lining up behind.

                  Senator Cash’s interjection just demonstrates the sort of ideas, or lack of ideas, on that side of the chamber. They are led by a man who changes his mind depending on the audience. I think we saw that today when a man who wants to be the Prime Minister of this country is out in front of a rally that has signs such as the ones I read out, signs referring to genocide and signs such as ‘Pauline knew 10 years ago’. Those on the other side ought to be ashamed of themselves that they are allowing their leader to go out there and play to that audience. You should hang your heads in shame. And some of you are.

                             I think I had completed my question. I was asking: why is scientific evidence so important to the government in determining the appropriate policy for tackling climate change. And I would like to be able to hear the answer.

                              The science is important and, notwithstanding the efforts of those on the other side to try and drown out the scientific evidence, the reality is the scientific evidence is overwhelming. The question really should be: what is the proper policy response to deal with the risk, not just for this generation but for subsequent generations, and how to make that transition in the most economically efficient way. One of the sad things about the Leader of the Opposition is that if you read his comments—

                                I know you are very sensitive about this, Senator Abetz. If you read his comments it is quite clear that he comes to this issue not on the basis of conviction but only on the basis of opportunism. Mr Abbott said in April 2010:
