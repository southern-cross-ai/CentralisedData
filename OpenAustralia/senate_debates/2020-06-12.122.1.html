        My question is for the Minister for Aged Care and Senior Australians, Senator Colbeck. Why is the government making older Australians wait twice as long for their bills, for cards from their grandchildren and for letters from their doctors at a time when COVID makes the post an even more essential service and lifeline for older Australians?

             To one of the consistent interjectors in the place: older Australians are Australians last time I looked. When we're assisting Australians, we're also assisting senior Australians by helping Australia Post to provide Australians with the important services they need during COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified a number of existing trends, with letter volumes declining and parcel volumes jumping. Parcel volumes were up by 64 per cent in April year on year, and letter volumes were down by 36 per cent year on year; 200,000 new households are shopping online. In response to Australia Post's request, the government has temporarily adjusted the elements of the

                 These changes are temporary and are effective until 30 June 2021 and will be reviewed before the end of the year. This flexibility to retrain and deploy its workforce to support parcel delivery means that around 600 new roles have been created to assist

                       Senator Wong raises a legitimate point about direct relevance in this case. However, I will be slightly broader in my interpretation of it, because that was the second part of the question. The first part did refer to consultation more generally. It is my view that a minister could be directly relevant while talking about consultation about this change, not just that part of the question. But the definition of direct relevance is tighter than the old definition of broad relevance. I'll call Senator Colbeck to continue with that in mind.

                        , and can I just reject the core basis of the allegation that the opposition's making—that we're trying to make people wait longer for the services they're receiving. We've done no such thing at any point. In fact this government, all through the period of the COVID-19 outbreak, has done everything it can to accommodate changes that have occurred, to accommodate the changes that have had to be made because of the incidence of COVID-19.

I reject any assertions from the opposition that they might make that we've been doing anything other than trying to assist Australians manage their way through the COVID-19 outbreak.
