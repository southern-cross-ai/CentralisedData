        My question is to the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
         Climate Change
        </a>
        and Water, Senator Wong. Can the minister advise the Senate on the progress of the Rudd government’s Water for the Future plan, given that the circumstances in the Murray-Darling Basin are very challenging, and in the context of the government’s $12.9 billion plan to secure our water supplies, to take action on climate change, to use water wisely and to support healthy rivers? Can the minister describe the challenges in getting the Murray-Darling Basin back on a sustainable footing?

            system annually for each of the last three years has been just one-fifth of the long-term average. We cannot ignore, although Senator Bernardi would like to, the findings of the South Eastern Australian Climate Initiative, which showed there is a clear link between rainfall reduction over south-eastern Australia and observed global warming. Australia’s own scientists are telling us this fact.
           </p>
           <p>
            These challenges have been compounded further by decades of mismanagement of the system. Whilst no government can make it rain, the Rudd government are delivering our plan to meet these challenges. We have taken over basin-wide planning, and for the first time Australia will have a scientifically based limit on water use in the basin. That is the only takeover that counts. All the bluff and bluster on the other side would mean nothing more than further delay on real action, just as we saw exemplified during their more than decade in government on this issue. We are investing in irrigation to help our farmers in regional communities and to protect water security, and we are purchasing water to return to our rivers. Those opposite—

If the Rudd government’s approach to the situation in the Murray-Darling Basin is based on taking action to prepare the basin for a future with less water, what are these alternative policies based on?

              Thank you very much for the question, Senator McEwen. The utterances from those opposite would suggest that they think that they have a magic wand to create more water. All we have seen from the other side is opportunism and division. It is interesting to note the example we have had of this in the last 24 hours with Senator Bernardi issuing a press release saying that the Rudd government is not spending enough on purchasing water. It is interesting. I wonder where he was when they were in government and did not buy a single drop of water. But he is saying, ‘Not enough, we should be purchasing more water.’ I wonder whether Senator Bernardi has spoken to his shadow minister, because Mr Hunt has previously said, in reference to buybacks, it will not help the Murray. So Senator Bernardi wants us to buy more water and Mr Hunt says it will not help the Murray.

               , I ask a further supplementary question. Can the minister also outline for the Senate the importance of the states working with the federal government to get the Murray-Darling Basin back on a sustainable footing? What role are the states playing in helping the Rudd government deliver its plan to prepare the basin for a future with less water?

                The first issue that has obviously been important is that the states have agreed to a Commonwealth takeover of basin planning. That is the first and most important historic agreement achieved. But obviously there are many areas where we need state governments to continue the reform process and one of them is removing the barriers to trade in the water market. We on this side are clear: water should go where it is most highly valued. I welcome the legislative change in Victoria to remove the 10 per cent limit on the amount of water in a district that can be held by non-landowners. This delivers on the agreement between Prime Minister Rudd and Premier Brumby. This delivers on our continued series of reforms in the Murray-Darling. Again, this is an area where we see the opportunism of those opposite. We have a press release from Dr Stone calling moves to scrap the four per cent cap—another trade restriction—a ‘cruel attack’.
