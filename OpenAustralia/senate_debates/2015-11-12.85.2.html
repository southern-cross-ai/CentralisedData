        My question is to the Minister for Communications, Senator Fifield.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        would cost $29.5 billion and said his plan was 'very conservative'. In December 2013, the now Prime Minister said his second-rate NBN would cost $41 billion and the assumptions were 'conservative and achievable'. In August this year, the now Prime Minister admitted his second-rate NBN would cost up to $56 million and said:

       <p class="italic">
        … all of us can have real confidence in the numbers …
       </p>
       <p>
        Minister, how can anyone have any confidence in this government's numbers when the Prime Minister has gotten every single one of his NBN costs so hopelessly wrong?

          McAllister
         </a>
         for her question. Senator McAllister is quite right that the 2016 corporate plan presents a peak funding range of between $46 billion and $56 billion, with a base case of $49 billion, and she is right that the strategic review estimated peak funding of $41 billion. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
          NBN
         </a>
         , as it is rolling out, is learning from experience, as it has also learnt from the many reviews that it has commissioned and it is getting a much better and much more precise fix on the cost of the NBN. That is an important point, because our predecessors had no fix, they had no handle, on the costs of the scheme. This government has had to put in train with the board and management of nbn co processes to determine, to get a realistic handle on, what the true expenses of the NBN are because the NBN was left in such bad order by those opposite. As I have indicated before, in stark contrast to the work and the preparation done for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
          NDIS
         </a>
         , where we had things such as a 2,000-page

          Productivity Commission

I return to something that I posed the other day to this chamber: in what plan would you have more confidence? Would it be one developed by Senator Conroy or one developed by Mr Turnbull?

           Mr President

          , I ask a supplementary question. In October, this minister said the government's three-year construction plan was ambitious, and nbn co chairman, Dr Switkowski, said the

           NBN

          's rollout plan to 2020 was 'heroic'. Will the minister guarantee that this rollout plan will be achieved? Or is it as 'conservative and achievable' as every other forecast released by this government on the NBN?

              But I do not deny for a second that this is not an ambitious project. It is a very ambitious project with a very good board and very good management who have oversight. It is an ambitious project but it is a realistic project. What we know for sure is that the multi-technology mix approach being pursued by nbn co will see the

                  So say us! The 2016 corporate plan represents the most robust corporate plan developed by nbn, and it provides an accurate reflection of the business. We are confident that the network can be completed by 2020. In fact, for the past two years, the company has successfully met its rollout targets. That is the first time that has happened. We have confidence in the board of nbn. We have confidence in the management of the nbn. We want to see them get on with the job of delivering fast broadband sooner and at less cost.
