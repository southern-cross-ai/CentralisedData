        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Wong. Earlier today, some of Australia's allies publicly called out the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Chinese Communist Party
        </a>
        for malicious cyberactivity attributed to groups sponsored by the Chinese government targeting democratic institutions. In response, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        sanctioned a front company and two individuals who are complicit in this behaviour.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_United_States" rel="nofollow">
         The United States
        </a>
        government also revealed that thousands of American citizens have been targeted in a prolific hacking operation for which seven Chinese individuals face charges. What action has the Australian government taken in support of our allies who have been subject to these cyberattacks?

         I'm a little confused—I shouldn't say that, because then somebody over there will say something rude. I am bemused by your question because it suggests that we haven't done anything. I would have thought, given how much of an avid follower of these matters you are, you would have seen that we did take the unusual step of issuing a public statement. As, from me—

            Order across the chamber. Senator Fawcett has asked a serious question, which Senator Wong was answering. Interjections across the chamber or indeed to Senator Wong when she's answering the question are disorderly. I would ask all senators to allow Senator Wong to focus on the question that was asked and to listen in silence. Minister Wong.

             Thank you, President. It is a serious issue, and Senator Fawcett would know that there have not been many occasions on which the foreign minister of Australia and the home affairs minister have issued an attribution in relation to cyber that names the particular entities or country concerned. And we did so. We did so, obviously in consultation with our friends in the United Kingdom and other members of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes" rel="nofollow">
              Five Eyes
             </a>
             . We did so because it is important, when it comes particularly to China state backed actors targeting democratic institutions and parliamentarians, that we do make clear that this is a line for all of us, that our resilience and our sovereignty do require respect for our democratic institutions. So you would have seen, I hope, what we said, which was:

               Minister, I do welcome the government's willingness to join in that attribution, which is important in preserving democracies. But my supplementary question is: will the minister now commit to using the powers under Australia's Magnitsky-style thematic sanctions regime to stand with our allies in sanctioning those individuals responsible for this behaviour?

                I would make the point that sanctions—firstly, we don't discuss or telegraph any consideration of sanctions in any circumstances. The second point I would make—and I appreciate that, in opposition, you are free to take a different view—is that I think governments have to always think very carefully about what is the appropriate measure to take in relation to situations of international concern. There are occasions where sanctions are imposed. They are rarely our first choice. They should be used judiciously, and they are usually used in conjunction with other response measures. What I would say to you, Senator, is that all of us here are united in our belief that any government of Australia and parliament of Australia should always ensure we protect our democratic institutions.
