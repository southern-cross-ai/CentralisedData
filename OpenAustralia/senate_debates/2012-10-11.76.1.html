         I thank Senator Sarah Hanson-Young for her question. I am aware that Minister Ferguson has met representatives of the particular group in question. As I understand it, it is an area that Minister Ferguson has lead responsibility for. But I am happy to take it on notice and correct that if necessary. In terms of the Mr Combet's portfolio, the Australian government are firmly committed to a clean energy future for Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have increased the renewable energy target to 20 per cent by 2020 and have committed $17 billion in funding support for clean energy initiatives. This includes the new $10 billion for the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the $3.2 billion for the Australian Renewable Energy Agency,

         . Most importantly, the Australian government have introduced a carbon price in the economy to achieve our long-term goal of reducing emissions by 80 per cent by 2050. Combined, these initiatives will provide unparalleled support. The Australian government continue in the direction of meeting the renewable energy target. It is important to recognise that this is why the government initiated the Solar Flagships program in 2009 and created the—

                 , I rise on a point of order. I appreciate that Minister Ludwig is trying to answer my question but I cannot hear the answer.

                  Order! On both sides, as I pointed out, there needs to be quiet.

                   What I indicated was that I would take that on notice. As I understand it there is a range of programs that may be available out of either Minister Combet's or Minister Ferguson's portfolio. I think it fair, given the available time, to provide an answer on notice to Senator Sarah Hanson-Young because the community has asked, through Senator Hanson-Young, to gain that additional information. I will also seek an answer from Minister Combet as to whether or not he has engaged with the community.
