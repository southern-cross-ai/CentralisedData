          My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Senator Colbeck. I refer to disturbing reports today that two elderly Queensland aged-care residents, aged 94 and 88, have been given four times the recommended dose of the COVID-19 vaccine by a doctor contracted through the federal government, with one of those residents being hospitalised as a result. How has this mistake been allowed to occur?

           The circumstance that occurred in Queensland yesterday should not have happened. It should not have happened. The government is just as concerned as anybody else in this chamber with respect to the circumstance that occurred in Queensland yesterday. What occurred, on my advice, is there was a clinical incident at a scheduled vaccination clinic, at the Holy Spirit Home at Carseldine in Queensland, where the vaccination provider dispensed more than the prescribed dose of the Pfizer vaccine to two residents. My understanding is that they are both currently in hospital, but, fortunately, they are both well at this stage. They are both okay, which is quite important for us all to understand.
          </p>
          <p>
           Both families have been advised of the incident, and the Deputy

             On 16 February 2021, in a joint press release with the minister for health, Minister Colbeck is quoted as saying:

              The senator is correct in the fact that we have contracted as a federal government two companies to undertake the vaccination rollout in aged-care facilities across the country, and this is a very important rollout process, as I have indicated on a number of occasions over the last two weeks. The fact that we have now commenced the vaccination rollout in aged-care facilities to protect senior Australians is one of the most important things that we will do as a part of the COVID-19 recovery process.

                 My view—and I will take advice from the Clerk on this—is if the minister is keeping his comments to a narrow construction of the question and the question referred to the Commonwealth responsibility or the Australian responsibility for the rollout of the aged-care program, I cannot go to the content of his answer. He is not free to talk about anything else, but I think that is directly relevant. As I said earlier, I will take some advice from the Clerk about this, but I believe I am being asked to direct him on content.

                  to inform people of the circumstances. We have been working with the Queensland Chief Health Officer in relation to it and we are doing everything we possibly can to ensure the integrity of the rollout program, because we do take responsibility for it across the nation to ensure senior Australians are protected from COVID-19.
