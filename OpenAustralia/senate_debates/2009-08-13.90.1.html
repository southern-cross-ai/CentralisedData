        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Evans. Will the minister explain how it is that the Rudd Labor government has lost the confidence of Indigenous leaders like Mr Galarrwuy Yunupingu, as reported in the
        <i>
         Australian

        newspaper this week, after the Howard government was able to successfully engage such important stakeholders in the

         I thank the senator for her question. I am not sure that we have lost the confidence of the gentlemen you refer to. But, quite frankly, what we know is that there are a range of diverse opinions about all issues in political debate in Australia and particularly in the Indigenous area. We have had a number of Indigenous people argue a range of positions about the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         intervention and what the best way forward is in terms of providing housing and employment opportunities. Mr

         has made a number of contributions to the debate, some of which I agree with and some of which I do not, but I engaged with him when I was Indigenous affairs spokesman and he makes a really useful contribution to the debate. So I do not think one can try and say, in terms of assessing complex policy: ‘Well, one person disagrees with you on an issue, therefore you ought to reconsider your position, or therefore you ought to go home and pack up and give it away.’ The reality is the debate about the way forward in Indigenous Affairs is contentious.

           Failed to deliver, Senator? We have been in government 18 months. I point you to the 11 years of the Howard government when you made no dent in the key indicators of Aboriginal health, employment or other outcomes. So don’t come in here and say to me: ‘Oh, well, you’ve failed.’ Don’t come in here and tell me we have failed, Senator. What we know is that after 11 years of the Howard government—

                I see the tactics committee is struggling without Gordon’s contribution! As I said to the earlier question from Senator Scullion, we have invested in the

                 Strategic Indigenous Housing and Infrastructure Program
                </a>
                in a large way. The program will deliver 750 new houses, 230 rebuilds and 2,500 refurbishments of houses in remote

                 Northern Territory

                communities. That is a massive commitment to try and address the huge shortage of decent housing in the Northern Territory. We are making a genuine attempt, backed by a large financial commitment. I suggest the opposition, just as I did when we were in opposition, try and support the government’s initiatives to try and tackle these problems rather than try these cheap political attacks. Quite frankly, none of us have got it right so far, and unless we get some sort of common commitment we are not going to get it right this time.

We are hard at that and I would encourage you to support us.
