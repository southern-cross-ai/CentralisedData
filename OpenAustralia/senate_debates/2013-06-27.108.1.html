         strategy and has proved most successful. It is critical in preventing multi-drug-resistant TB developing and spreading.
        </p>
        <p>
         But there has, I am sad to report to the Senate, been a smear campaign targeting Australia's impressive efforts to address this issue in a country that, on average, has 14,000 new TB cases diagnosed per year. It is an issue that has been politicised, I am sad to relate, by the member for Leichhardt. He said Australia's life-saving assistance, this fine work helping PNG and Western Province, has been 'grossly mismanaged by bureaucrats'. His claims have been criticised as derogatory and negative by, among others, Dr Smith Pinai of Daru General Hospital in a letter to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_High_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          Australian High Commission
         </a>
         in June last year. The opinion of the member for Leichhardt flies in the face of professional medical assessments made by the World Health Organisation, which in November 2012 in its major document on TB monitoring found there had been 'clear progress in TB prevention and control in South Fly' since its last review.

          Papua New Guinea

In a statement from Queensland's Premier, Mr Campbell Newman, and its health minister, Mr Lawrence Springborg, in a press release on 15 May, they stated that by providing the best treatment—

            Premier of Queensland

             Indeed I can, and I am happy for the opportunity. However, to complete the answer on

             help: since May 2012, the sea ambulance we provided the province has made 27 trips along the South Fly coast to deliver TB and other medical services to remote villages. That is all in the context of the great work we are doing in partnership with
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG" rel="nofollow">
              PNG
             </a>
             to improve health services. In 2012 alone we helped to vaccinate more than half a million children against measles and polio and more than 1.2 million women against tetanus. We trained 187 health workers, including doctors, nurses and pharmacists, in PNG and supported 20,000 supervised births. Our assistance this year will reach $105 million. That is our assistance to the health sector of PNG. There will be medical supplies to 2,700 health facilities across the country among other things.
