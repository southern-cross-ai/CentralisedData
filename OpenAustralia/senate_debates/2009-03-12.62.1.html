        My question is to the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator Carr. Minister, in your role as minister for industry, can you explain why the government has agreed to contribute $40 million to United States companies so that they can develop their unproven

         I thank the senator for his question. I recently visited the site in Bendigo, and I would agree with you the Bushmaster is a very fine vehicle. It is made by a group of people who are highly skilled. It is a highly innovative vehicle and it has saved many Australian lives. It is also being used in a number of military forces around the world—

           It is a program that we do support. Recently we announced support with regard to innovation policies and, through the defence science department and the procurement office, support for additional measures to encourage the development of facilities and to improve still further its capacity to be used. We are also seeking to ensure that the procurement policies of other governments acknowledge the value of the Bushmaster. We are doing what can be done to ensure that additional contracts are secured internationally.

            , I ask a supplementary question. What representations has the minister, as the minister for Australian industry, made to the Minister for Defence in support of the Australian made vehicle as opposed to an unproven foreign alternative that is not even off the drawing board?

             The senator asks the question: what have I done about making representations on behalf of the company and on behalf of the project? I can also indicate in my answer what the member for Bendigo has done, which is a substantial amount. Both of us have taken up representations on behalf of the company, on behalf of the workers, on behalf of the project. The member for Bendigo has been a persistent and very thorough advocate on behalf of this project. He has led delegations to Canberra, and just recently there was a number of ministers gathered in Bendigo to discuss this specific project.

              , I ask a further supplementary question. It is obvious to all of us that the government is setting new records in paying money to people living overseas, but in this case why wouldn’t the government back an Australian made product that exports quality and proven vehicles all over the world? Will the minister personally intervene to have this decision overturned and ensure that the Australian government supports an Australia company and Australian jobs? Will you intervene?

               The Australian defence industry, as the senator would be only too well aware, is a very important part of our industrial capacity in this country. This government does support the Australian defence industries and has actively engaged those industries to ensure that they are able to secure much greater numbers of international contracts. As to the specifics with regard to this particular project, as the senator only too well knows, that is not a matter that is directly in my area of responsibility.

                Well, the light tactical vehicle is a project that the Minister for Defence has been engaged with. The decision has been made to ensure that the government has a full range of options before it. We are in the process of assessing the bids. We are in the process of ensuring value for money. And I can assure the senator that I personally am in the business of ensuring defence of Australian jobs.
