        Pursuant to standing order 74, I ask the Minister for Superannuation and Corporate Law, Senator Sherry, about question Nos 747, 915, 917, 938, 940, 953, 961, 963, 1022, 1024 and 1027.

         In relation to Senator Sherry’s portfolio areas, a response to question No. 915 was tabled today. A response to question No. 938 is not far away—it is moving through the system. A response to question No. 961 is near clearance. Regarding question No. 1022, the relevant department,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAFF" rel="nofollow">
          DAFF
         </a>
         , is waiting on figures, as I understand it. There is clearly work underway that shows a readiness to provide responses to these questions. A response to question No. 1145 is being prepared.
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to questions asked of Senator Sherry in his role as the Minister for Superannuation and Corporate Law, responses are not too far away, as I understand it. Question No. 1150 is a question in relation to which Senator Evans would respond on behalf of all ministers. Because some of these questions are across portfolios, the government will try to ensure that we provide a coordinated response so that we answer your questions as accurately and fully as possible. Question No. 747 was about a matter that was transferred, as indicated on the
         <i>

         </i>
         on 10 March.
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to questions asked of Minister Sherry as the Minister representing the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, No. 953 is near clearance. Question No. 1137 is about a matter that Senator Evans, in his capacity as Minister representing the Prime Minister in the Senate, will respond to on behalf of all ministers. Clearly, this government has taken the matter of providing responses seriously. Raising it at this juncture is a little early, but that is a matter for Senator Ronaldson.
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to questions asked of the Minister representing the Minister for Resources, Energy and Tourism, Senator Sherry, there was a response lodged to question No. 917 on 13 March. For question No. 940, there was a response lodged on 13 March. Question Nos 963 and 1024 are also near completion. For question No. 1147, it was advised that Senator Evans, in his capacity as Minister representing the Prime Minister in the Senate, would respond on his behalf.
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to questions asked of Senator Carr and Senator Conroy, these matters are similarly being taken very seriously. This government does take answers to questions of this nature very seriously. As Senator Ronaldson may know, many of the questions were across all portfolios. Some were to individual ministers. Some were sent to the wrong minister, either by error or misadventure. What we will do is ensure that we provide a coordinated and fulsome response to those matters. I understand that that is currently now in train and that many of them have already been answered or will be tabled shortly. I will leave the comparison to the end of taking note of answers to questions, and I look forward to that debate.
