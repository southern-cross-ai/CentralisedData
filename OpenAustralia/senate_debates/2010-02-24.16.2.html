        This amendment will introduce a new section into the Customs Tariff Act to ensure that the reductions made to the excise rates on fuels due to the introduction of the scheme also apply to the relevant imported products.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Where a relevant excise rate, as defined in the Excise Tariff Amendment (Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme) Bill 2010, is reduced, this amendment will substitute the same rate to the excise equivalent customs duty rates. The substitution will apply to the subheadings in schedules 3, 5, 6, 7 and 8 and item 50(1A) in schedule 4 to the Customs Tariff Act.

        contains consequential and transitional provisions relating to the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill seeks to amend 12 Acts and one set of regulations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The most significant amendments relate to the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Act provides the existing national framework for the reporting of information on greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption and energy production. To maintain the Government’s commitment to the streamlining of reporting of greenhouse and energy data, the Act will be the starting framework for monitoring, reporting and assurance under the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A number of changes are proposed to strengthen the Act and align it with the requirements of the Scheme, as outlined in the Government’s White Paper titled Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme: Australia’s Low Pollution Future, which was released on 15 December 2008. Under the amendments, one report will satisfy an entity’s reporting requirements for the Scheme and current reporting requirements under the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Coverage of synthetic greenhouse gases
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme covers synthetic greenhouse gases. As some of these gases are already regulated under the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 1989, amendments will be made to that Act to align it with the Scheme.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Establishment of the Australian Climate Change Regulatory Authority
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill contains a number of consequential amendments relating to the establishment of the Australian Climate Change Regulatory Authority.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As well as administering the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, the new Authority will take over administration of both greenhouse and energy reporting and the renewable energy target. This necessitates a number of legislative amendments to replace two existing statutory bodies—the Office of the Renewable Energy Regulator and the Greenhouse and Energy Data Officer—and transfer their functions to the Authority.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The creation of the Australian Climate Change Regulatory Authority also gives rise to a number of other consequential amendments—for example, to apply financial management and accountability requirements to the Authority.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

         Measures to prevent market manipulation and misconduct
        </b>

        Australian emissions units and eligible international emissions units are to be financial products for the purposes of the Chapter 7 of the

         Corporations Act
        </a>
        2001 and Division 2, Part 2 of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001. The bill amends these Acts accordingly.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These amendments will provide a strong regulatory regime to reduce the risk of market manipulation and misconduct relating to emissions units. Appropriate adjustments to the regime to fit the characteristics of units and avoid unnecessary compliance costs will be made through regulations.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        has consulted on those regulations, which will be made shortly after passage and apply from commencement of this legislation.

         Taxation treatment of emissions units
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Schedule 2 of the bill amends various taxation laws to clarify the income tax and goods and services tax treatment of emissions units.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The main consideration in designing the tax treatment of units is that the tax treatment should not compromise the main objectives of the Scheme. This means that tax should not influence decisions between purchasing, trading and surrendering units or alternatively reducing emissions. The preferred tax treatment will help implement the Scheme and reduce compliance and administration costs for taxpayers and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Government
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For income tax, the amendments establish a rolling balance treatment of registered emissions units which is similar to that for trading stock. The result of the treatment is that the cost of a unit is deductible, with the effect of the deduction generally being deferred through the rolling balance until the sale or surrender of the unit.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The proceeds of selling a unit are assessable income with any difference in the value of units held at the beginning of an income year and at the end of that year being reflected in taxable income. Any increase in value is included in assessable income and any decrease in value allowed as a deduction.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill also amends the goods and services tax law. It characterises a supply of an eligible emissions unit or a Kyoto unit as a supply of a personal property right and not a supply of or directly connected with real property. The amendments will promote certainty about the application of the normal
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">

         Conclusion
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The consequential amendments contained in this bill are important for the efficient and effective operation of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. The amendments seek, where possible, to streamline institutional and regulatory arrangements and minimise administrative costs with the Scheme.

        would establish the Australian Climate Change Regulatory Authority—a new statutory authority that would be responsible for administering the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is one of a package of bills to establish the Scheme.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Authority" rel="nofollow">
         The Authority
        </a>
        will be responsible for auctioning and allocating emissions units, maintaining a national registry of emissions units and ensuring that firms comply with their obligations under the Scheme.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government’s intention is to establish an effective, efficient and independent regulator.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Authority will be a body corporate headed by a Chair and between two and four other members. Through the Chair, it will employ
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Public_Service" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Public Service
        </a>
        employees on behalf of the Commonwealth.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It will have a modern set of information-gathering, inspection and enforcement powers, conferred on it by the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2010.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Authority will be at arm’s length from Government. As with other independent regulators, the Minister will only be able to provide directions on general matters and there are limited grounds on which a member of the Authority may be removed from office.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Authority will also be accountable. It will be required to produce three yearly corporate plans and annual reports, and comply with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Management" rel="nofollow">

         Accountability Act
        </a>
        1997.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Authority will take over the functions of the existing Office of the Renewable Energy Regulator and the Greenhouse and Energy Data Officer, so that a single regulatory body will have overall responsibility for administration of climate change laws. This transfer of functions is to be affected through the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2010.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        While it will have strong powers to ensure that Scheme obligations are complied with, the Authority will also have an important role in advising and assisting persons in relation to their obligations under the Scheme—something that is formally reflected in the Authority’s functions.

        The CPRS fuel credit program will give transitional assistance to the agriculture, forestry and fishing industries for the period 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2014.

As these incidental activities will therefore receive a partial benefit from the reduction in fuel tax until 30 June 2012, they will be entitled to a partial CPRS fuel credit until that date. This CPRS fuel credit will be 50 per cent of the full CPRS fuel credit while the reduced fuel tax credit rate applies, and the full CPRS fuel credit thereafter until 30 June 2014.

         Excise Tariff Amendment (Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme) Bill 2010
        </a>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This
        <a href="http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:legislation/billhome/R4289" rel="nofollow">
         bill
        </a>
        seeks to amend the Excise Tariff Act 1921 to confirm in legislation the Government’s commitment in the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme: Australia’s Low Pollution Future White Paper. The Government will cut fuel taxes on a cent-for-cent basis to offset the initial price impact on fuel of introducing the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government recognises that people have limited flexibility to respond quickly to changes in fuel prices but that, over time, transport choices can respond to price changes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To give households and businesses time to adjust to the Scheme, this legislation introduces a mechanism to automatically adjust the rate of fuel tax on all fuels that are currently subject to the 38.143 cents per litre rate of excise.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Fuel tax consists of excise duty on domestically manufactured fuels and excise-equivalent customs duty on imported fuels. Fuel tax is predominantly applied at a rate of 38.143 cents per litre across the range of fuels including petrol, diesel, kerosene, fuel oil, heating oil, biodiesel and fuel ethanol.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Different fuels emit different amounts of carbon when they burn and their prices will increase according to the volume of their emissions. To minimise compliance costs, the fuel tax cut will be made ‘across the board’ to currently taxed fuels. The fuel excise adjustment will be based on the expected rise in the price of diesel resulting from the introduction of the Scheme. This will ensure there is cent-for-cent assistance for diesel users.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Diesel emits more carbon than petrol on a per litre basis so the fuel tax cut will provide more than cent-for-cent assistance for petrol users, which make up the majority of motorists. However, diesel use is becoming more common as fuel and vehicle standards improve. Basing the fuel tax cut on diesel will therefore ensure that the Government’s cent-for-cent commitment is delivered for the most common fuels used by households.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Any reductions will take place on 1 January and 1 July of each year, to harmonise with the Business Activity Statement reporting period.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The first fuel tax reduction will occur on 1 July 2011 with the commencement of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. On 1 July 2011, based on current taxation arrangements and that the emissions unit charge will be fixed at $10 per tonne, the fuel tax will be reduced by 2.455 cents per litre to 35.688 cents per litre.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        After the fixed emission unit price of $10 per tonne lapses on 30 June 2012, the need for further reductions, and the amount, will be assessed based on the average Australian emissions unit auction charge over the preceding six-month period. If the average unit charge at the time of the assessment is greater than the average unit charge that formed the basis of the previous reduction, then the fuel tax rate will be further reduced. This approach will apply to adjustments that occur from 1 July 2012.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If the current average unit charge amount is less than the previous average unit charge amount then the rate of fuel tax will remain the same — the fuel tax rate will not be increased if the emissions charge has fallen.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Information on the six-month average Australian emissions unit auction charge will be published by the Australian Climate Change Regulatory Authority in accordance with section 271 of the CPRS Bill.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The final reduction will be made, if necessary, on 1 July 2014. The fuel tax rate at that date will be the ongoing rate, that is, the fuel tax rate will not revert to the 38.143 cents per litre rate. At this time the Government will review the mechanism introduced by these amendments.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The amendments to the Excise Tariff Act will commence on 1 July 2011 assuming that the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme commences on that date.

        I am introducing today a Bill to amend the Customs Tariff Act 1995 to confirm in legislation the Government’s commitment in the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme: Australia’s Low Pollution Future White Paper. The commitment is to cut fuel taxes on a ‘cent for cent’ basis to offset the initial price impact on fuel of introducing the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme.

        </a>
        delivers on the Government’s commitment to assist low and middle-income households with the expected increases in the cost of living arising from the introduction of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Climate change threatens Australia’s way of life and our future prosperity.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australians want action on climate change.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That’s why the Government has moved to introduce the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It will allow economic growth without growth in emissions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        However, the introduction of the Scheme will have a modest impact on the cost of living for households.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That is why the Government is providing low and middle-income households with upfront assistance to adjust to the impacts of the scheme.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Through a package of cash assistance, tax offsets and other measures, the Government will help these households maintain their standard of living while moving to a low pollution future.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This bill delivers on the Government’s commitments given in the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme White Paper that:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         pensioners, seniors, carers, veterans, people with disability, the unemployed, students and other allowees will receive additional support, above indexation, to fully meet the expected overall increase in the cost of living flowing from the scheme;
        </li>
        <li>
         low-income households will receive additional support, above indexation, to fully meet the expected overall increase in the cost of living flowing from the scheme; and
        </li>
        <li>
         middle-income households will receive additional support, above indexation, to help meet the expected overall increase in the cost of living flowing from the scheme.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        The assistance in this bill delivers on these commitments.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The average overall cost of living for households is expected to be $624 higher once the scheme is fully up and running (by the middle of 2013), or about $12 per week. However, the average amount of assistance that the Government will provide to help with this will be $660.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        8.1 million households, out of a total 8.8 million households will receive direct cash assistance. All pensioners, people with a disability, carers and low income households will be fully compensated for cost increases they face.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This bill takes account of changes to the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme announced on 4 May 2009 that introduces an initial $10 per tonne fixed carbon price in 2011-12 and a flexible carbon price in 2012-13. The composition of the Household Assistance package reflects this staged approach.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill is also fully consistent with the amendments to the CPRS package agreed with the former Opposition leader, Mr Turnbull, and introduced and debated in the Parliament in November and December of 2009.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill also takes account of other policy changes in the Budget, principally the Government’s Secure and Sustainable Pension Reform, which will affect how assistance is paid.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme will see a modest increase in the overall cost of living as we start to recognise the costs of carbon pollution in our everyday lives.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is anticipated that the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme will result in increases in the cost of living of 0.4 per cent in 2011-12 and 0.7 per cent in 2012-13, resulting from an initial $10 per tonne fixed carbon price in 2011-12 and a flexible carbon price in 2012-13.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For many households government payments only represent a share of their income. Therefore increasing payments in line with headline

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To adequately compensate these households, compensation needs to go beyond the average household Consumer Price Index impact.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To ensure fairness, household composition has also been taken into account in designing the assistance.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This household assistance will be funded from the sale of carbon pollution permits. The Government has committed to use every cent raised from the introduction of the scheme and the sale of carbon pollution permits to help households and businesses adjust and move Australia to the low pollution economy of the future.

        The measures contained in this bill will increase the amount of certain social security and Veterans’ Affairs pension and allowance payments by 2.5 per cent over two years. This includes a 1 per cent increase from 1 July 2011 and a further 1.5 per cent increase on 1 July 2012, including upfront indexation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These payment increases include bringing forward the expected Consumer Price Index related indexation increases that will automatically flow from the Scheme’s introduction. These indexation increases are expected to be 0.4 per cent in 2011-12 and 0.7 per cent in 2012-13. The 0.4 per cent expected indexation increase for 2011-12 will be brought forward and paid from 1 July 2011. The 0.7 per cent increase in the expected indexation increase will be brought forward and paid from 1 July 2012.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Because assistance for the cost of living increase provided through certain payments will be brought forward, subsequent indexation arrangements will be adjusted to avoid duplicate assistance.

        These increases will apply to a range of income support payments including the age pension, carer payment, veteran service pensions, disability support pension, Newstart allowance,
