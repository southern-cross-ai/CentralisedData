        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISAF" rel="nofollow">

        helicopter carrying 15 ISAF members, 10 of them Australian, went down in northern Kandahar earlier today. Three Australian commandos from the Special Operations Task Group were killed and seven were wounded—two of them very seriously. One other ISAF soldier has been killed and another is in a very serious condition. Two other ISAF helicopters also carrying members of the Special Operations Task Group were in close proximity to the helicopter at the time it went down. These two helicopters were able to land immediately, secure the area, evaluate the wounded and evacuate them to an ISAF medical facility for treatment. I am advised that the incident was not the result of enemy action. Investigations into the crash are ongoing and I will inform the parliament of the outcomes when I am able to do so.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a tragic day for Australia and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        and an absolutely devastating day for the families and friends of these brave young men. The 15 on board the helicopter, including 10 Australians, were en route to an operation, going out as they do day after day, putting their lives on the line for their country. This most dangerous theatre of operations has claimed five Australian lives in the past two weeks. It is with very great sadness that I inform the Senate this evening of these latest casualties.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the Australian government—but I know I speak for everyone in this chamber—I express our deepest condolences to the families who have lost their loved ones today. At this moment of grief and gratitude for the sacrifice made by these brave young men, our thoughts and our profound sympathies are with their families, their friends and their comrades. This is a time of absolutely unthinkable loss for them. These fine young Australian soldiers were also sons, brothers, fathers and friends. Our thoughts are also with the wounded soldiers and their families at this time of great anxiety and great apprehension for them. As Minister for Defence, I want those families to know that their loved ones are receiving the best possible medical care.
       </p>
       <p>
        I take this opportunity to ask all Australians today to take some time to think of these soldiers and their families and all the members of our defence forces who are serving their nation overseas. Three brave young men died today serving our nation. Sixteen Australian soldiers have now been killed in Afghanistan fighting alongside our coalition partners to improve conditions in that country. While our mission to Afghanistan is difficult, it is vital for international stability and the security of Australia. Our men and women in uniform continue to do absolutely outstanding work in this difficult and dangerous environment. They deserve our highest praise and all our gratitude.
       </p>
       <p>
        I should say that the families involved need time to come to terms with their loss. Operations also remain ongoing in Afghanistan. I will, of course, share more information with the Senate when I can. I wanted to conclude my remarks by assuring the Senate and the Australian people, particularly the families of these three soldiers, that the commitment, dedication and sacrifice of these soldiers will not be forgotten.

         by leave—The coalition joins with the government in extending its sympathies to the families, friends and colleagues who have lost loved ones, friends and mates today in Kandahar province in what appears to be the result of an accident rather than enemy action. Our condolences go especially to the Australians but also the families, friends and colleagues of our coalition partners who have also lost a loved one. This tragic incident regrettably comes close on the deaths of Sappers Darren Smith and Jacob Moerland, whom we have only just recently laid to rest. We as a nation are greatly indebted to the willingness of our servicemen and servicewomen to serve in the cause of freedom. In serving they know the risks and they self-sacrificially are prepared to take the risks for our wellbeing as a nation and those of us who support freedom more generally in other parts of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
         On behalf of the coalition, can I say that we join with the government in expressing our condolences to the families, friends and mates who have lost loved ones.

         also on behalf of the coalition indicate our very best wishes for the medical teams that have to deal with this tragedy, and especially express our best wishes to those who are injured, both Australian and non-Australian personnel. Our thoughts and prayers are especially with those two who are very seriously injured.
        </p>
        <p>
         We as a nation can be very thankful that there are young men and women willing to sacrifice their lives in the cause of freedom, and especially for our freedom. Often it comes with a price and today we are reminded of that price, and that is a price that we as a nation ought to bear together, along with the families in particular and the friends who have lost loved ones. I join with the government in its comments on this matter.

           , I would like to add my comments to those of Minister Faulkner and others who have spoken briefly. As this comes so soon after the tragedies of last week, the Australian Greens would just like to place on the record that we are indeed in the debt of these men who have died in Afghanistan. I would like to put the support of the Australian Greens on the record.
