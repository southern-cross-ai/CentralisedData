        The 10th of March this year marked the beginning of World Glaucoma Week. World Glaucoma Week is a joint initiative of the World Glaucoma Association and World Glaucoma Patient Association. Its aim is to promote glaucoma patient support and to bring the message of early detection and lifelong treatment of this disease to the community. Tonight, I want also to promote this message and bring attention to the ongoing work of Glaucoma Australia. The word 'glaucoma' comes from the ancient Greek word 'glaukoma' for clouded or opaque. Hippocrates first used the term 'glaucoma' to describe the onset of blindness in patients of advanced years. Today, glaucoma is the name given to a group of degenerative eye diseases caused by the gradual destruction of the optic nerve, the cable that transmits visual messages from the eye to the brain. In most instances, damage is caused by an abnormal build-up of pressure within the eye.
       </p>
       <p>
        Glaucoma is known as the sneak thief of sight. It is an elusive and irreversible killer of sight. Initially, a sufferer's sight recedes from the margins of their field of vision, but in these early stages one eye often compensates for the other. Thus, the full impact of the condition remains hidden until a majority of nerve fibres have been damaged and a large part of vision has been destroyed. Unfortunately, for those afflicted with glaucoma, this means that the loss of sight is permanent, and from this point on all that can be done is to manage the vision that remains, and to try and ensure no more vision is lost. It is estimated that as many as half of those with glaucoma may not be aware that they actually have the condition.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organisation" rel="nofollow">
         World Health Organisation
        </a>
        , glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide. It is estimated that 11.1 million people will be blind due to glaucoma by 2020, accounting for an estimated 12 per cent of all world blindness. In Australia, glaucoma is one of the leading causes of preventable blindness. Over 300,000 Australians have glaucoma. While it is more common as people age, it can occur at any age. A joint study prepared by the Centre for Eye Research Australia and Access Economics estimated that the total annual cost of glaucoma in 2005 was $1.9 billion. With an ageing population, this figure is expected to increase to $4.3 billion by 2025.
       </p>
       <p>
        The damage caused by glaucoma is irreversible, so its detection and its lifelong treatment is a vitally important public health issue. As I mentioned earlier, the leading cause of blindness both in Australia and worldwide is not glaucoma but is cataracts. But, while the sophistication and effectiveness of cataract surgery have increased, there remain no measures able to restore the sight of those afflicted with glaucoma. This means that, although less prevalent than cataracts, the impact of glaucoma is arguably more severe. In the absence of preventive and corrective measures, the key is early detection and management, and this is why initiatives aimed at raising awareness such as World Glaucoma Week are so critical. This week Glaucoma Australia—this country's peak glaucoma support and awareness group—is promoting World Glaucoma Week. During this week Glaucoma Australia is asking all Australians to remind their friends and family to have regular and comprehensive eye checks. The focus of this year's campaign is on early detection and lifelong treatment of glaucoma.
       </p>
       <p>
        Glaucoma is a disease where up to half of its sufferers remain unaware of their affliction until it is too late, and that is why initiatives such as World Glaucoma Week and the ongoing work of Glaucoma Australia are so vital to ensuring that we lessen the terrible impact of the sneak thief of sight.
