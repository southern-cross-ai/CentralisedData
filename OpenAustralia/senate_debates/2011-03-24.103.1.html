        <p>
         I wish to speak on this. There is an important question here for the minister to answer before we get into whether or not the bills should be considered as a whole or how we consider these two bills. That question is whether we have all of the amendments, all of the information and all of the detail before us here and now so that we can go through this. The challenge to you is for you to stand up and say that there will no more government amendments tabled during the course of this debate and no more amendments to government amendments from the government during the course of this debate. The challenge is for you to say that you have settled with this thing, these bills that you have been going on with since November last year when you first introduced them into the other place. That was on 25 November last year. You have had all of the time since then to get these bills right—all of those months.
        </p>
        <p>
         This week, the bills were listed for debate on Monday—the beginning of the week. We came in here and started that debate. Then, presumably with your instruction, Minister Arbib adjourned that debate. We have not come back to it until this point in time. So the rest of Monday went by, Tuesday went by and Wednesday went by. Late on Wednesday, we were provided with the reams of amendments that your government is proposing to make. There are 28 pages of amendments across the two bills—hundreds of them in total—for us to consider. You have insisted that the Senate consider these bills today and, if need be, tomorrow, the day after and so forth. We want to be certain that these bills and amendments will be the bills and amendments that we will be considering. We want to be certain that there is no way that you are going to come in here and present further amendments. If you are going to do that, we might as well go through and consider each bill clause by clause.
        </p>
        <p>
         More significantly, as I advocated during the discussion of hours, we would be wiser to simply refer these bills, and these amendments in particular, back to the legislation committee to let the stakeholders have their say to ensure that you have it right, because—quite clearly—to date you have not got it right. If you had got it right in the first place, you would not have had to amend one of these bills and reintroduce it subsequent to the first introduction in 2010. If you had got it right in the first place, you certainly would not have had to introduce 28 pages of amendments in the last couple of days.
        </p>
        <p>
         These are the questions for you, Minister: have you settled the whole thing? Is this it? Will there be no further changes? Should we say, ‘Let us not debate it now; let’s wait until you get your house in order’? I want to know, and I think that every senator deserves to know, whether the government has its house in order on this issue now. This is important.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is a $50 billion package. I know that you love to take people to task on that, Minister, but we all know that, when you consider government’s direct equity into the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
          NBN
         </a>
         Co. and the debt-raising activities that the NBN Co. will have to undertake and the payments that the NBN Co. and the government will ultimately make to Telstra, we are talking about a sum that reaches beyond $50 billion. This is a vast project. These bills have vast implications, implications for how the NBN Co. will work, how it will be scrutinised in future, whether it will be subject to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOI" rel="nofollow">
          FOI
         </a>
         Act—and we know that you are seeking to provide sweeping exemptions there—and whether it will be subject to the full scrutiny of this parliament. We already know that you are seeking to exempt it from the scrutiny of the Public Works Committee.
        </p>
        <p>
         These bills have vast implications for the operations of the telecommunications market and the NBN Co. in particular. Will it be the wholesale only provider that you claim it will be? Will that be the case? If not, we need to get to the bottom of why not, of who they will be able to provide services directly to and why you think that breaching the wholesale only provider promise is justified. We will need to get to the bottom of why you think that you can go back on your word in that regard and set the NBN Co. up as a potential retail provider as well. We need to go back and find out what implications that will have for the operation of the telecommunications market in this country and whether or not you will be starting the NBN Co. off on the path of potentially being another vertically integrated telecommunications company, but one with a government legislated and mandated monopoly in the fibre space. We need to know whether you will be taking us back many years in this space because of your failure to get this right. These are vital issues and questions.
        </p>
        <p>
         We need to understand whether these amendments will, as is being alleged, wind back the capacity of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
          ACCC
         </a>
         to have decent oversight of critical things such as how the NBN Co. discriminates on price to its retail customers, how the NBN Co. bundles services or discriminates on the bundling of services to its customers and how the NBN Co. decides on points of interconnection. Will the ACCC have full and strong oversight in this regard or have you taken a step back to weaken it? These are questions that arise out of the amendments that you have tabled. They are questions that arise from the bills that are under debate. But, from what we understand, you are still trying to make your mind up as to whether this is the final equation—whether you have it all bedded down now or whether we are going to see further iterations as this debate goes on.
        </p>
        <p>
         If we are going to see further iterations, it is just not good enough for this debate to go on. Every senator who has an interest in this deserves to be able to start this debate knowing exactly what the government is proposing and having a clear idea of what it is that you intend for this parliament, this Senate, to decide upon with these bills. You are the government. You are meant to be in charge of this agenda. So far, you have failed miserably in that regard. You came in here during the debate on the hours and proclaimed, as did Senator Ludwig, the vital importance of getting these bills through to allow the deal—the already delayed deal—with Telstra to proceed.
        </p>
        <p>
         That deal has already been delayed. It may be at risk of further delay—I do not know—as a result of this legislation. But, if it is, there is nobody to blame but yourself and your government. You are masters of your own destiny in this regard. And, as I emphasised at the outset, these bills were first introduced way back in November last year. You have had not just days to get your house in order on this, not just weeks to get your house in order; you have had months to get your house in order on this. Now you come in here, on the last day of the last week of this session, and try to extend the hours—as you have successfully done—and expect us to roll through all of these amendments, of particular substance, to your legislation and expect, in some way, for the Senate to be happy. Well, we are clearly not happy about it. What we will be even less happy about is if we get halfway through this debate and discover that—wait, there are more amendments from the government; wait, there are more things that you need to fix up with your own legislation. Or, potentially, most amazingly, will be the likelihood that you will come in here with amendments to some of the amendments in your 28 pages of amendments. That is quite likely because, given the way you have got it wrong so far with the drafting of these bills, given the fact that you have seen it necessary to move these 28 pages of amendments, there is every likelihood that you are going to find, as this debate goes on—as no doubt will be pointed out in your consultations and discussions with industry stakeholders outside this building who are worried about these changes and who are concerned, like senators, that they have not had a chance to adequately consider these changes—that there are flaws and there are problems. That will push you into potentially having further amendments.
        </p>
        <p>
         We think that it is not unreasonable for the Senate to expect to see the government’s final position at the start of the committee debate, that it is not unreasonable for us to know that you have actually got your house in order, made your mind up, locked it all in and settled where you are going at the start of the committee debate. So before we move on to this procedural motion about whether the bill be taken as a whole, I have one simple question, Minister: will there be any more amendments? Can you rule out bringing any further amendments to these bills into this chamber during the committee debate?

          What staggering hypocrisy—I mean, seriously. I have one simple question for you: is your policy position still to abolish the

           NBN

          ? Is that still your position? It is your leader’s stated position. Is it still your position? It is staggering hypocrisy to actually suggest that, if an amendment came forward that would improve the legislation or correct a typo, it should not be brought forward. What staggering hypocrisy from those opposite.

              Senator Cormann, unfortunately you have not, and are not likely to for some considerable period, especially once Malcolm takes over. But for you, Senator Birmingham, to actually come into this chamber and say no-one should be allowed to move an amendment that could improve legislation or correct an error is quite disingenuous. You have promised this chamber—I have had discussions—that we are going to be here until Saturday afternoon. That is just a game of the opposition seeking to delay and demolish the

                 I withdraw that. But there has been a ruling that calling someone impertinent is unparliamentary. Is Senator Conroy calling us, collectively, ‘frauds’ parliamentary?

                  I withdraw. As I was saying, for those opposite to even remotely suggest they are interested in one single amendment, one single clause in this bill—you are voting against it! Do not come in here and pretend that you are the slightest bit interested in the amendment process. If there is an amendment that can come from the floor that improves this legislation, or corrects an error, then of course this chamber should consider it.

                     You said ‘improve’ as well. Answer this question, then: is your department working on potentially more amendments? Are there more amendments still to come? Do you know that there are actually more amendments to come that you will proclaim will improve this bill? Are there further changes? Tell us whether, to the best of your knowledge, at this point in time, this is the final version of the bill; whether to the best of your knowledge, at this point in time, we have all of the amendments before us; and whether, to the best of your knowledge at this point in time, each one of these amendments is settled, unless something unforeseen comes up, unless there is an amendment that fixes a typo. Tell us whether there is work going on to produce further amendments or not. If you do not deny the fact that there is work going on, work happening to produce further amendments, then it will be quite clear that you are asking the Senate to start this process with one hand tied behind its back—not knowing exactly where you are going, not knowing exactly what it is that you are planning to undertake during this debate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     You are right—the opposition has fundamental problems with your
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network" rel="nofollow">
                      National Broadband Network
                     </a>
                     . We have made absolutely no secret of that, none at all. We have real concerns, and we have highlighted those again and again. Our concerns are valid and understandable. This is a vast, vast expenditure of taxpayer money. This is a vast interference in the way the telecommunications market operates in this country. This will have implications for many, many years to come. As I have said many times before, the debate is not about whether Australians should have access to fast, affordable, reliable broadband. That is something that we want, it is something that you proclaim to want and it is something that I think every senator in this chamber proclaims that they want to see happen. The debate is about how you give Australians access to fast, affordable broadband—how you make sure that that broadband is delivered in the most cost-efficient way for taxpayers, in the most effective way for the operation of the telecommunications market and in the best way to give consumers, in future, the best chance of accessing what is necessary for the technologies of today and of years ahead and accessing it at the lowest possible price.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     We believe that your National Broadband Network is the wrong way to go about doing that. We believe that because it involves such vast sums of public money being spent to create a new, vast government-owned monopoly that will involve overbuilding and overlaying infrastructure in many areas that already have good broadband services. It will involve taking services out of the hands of, in many areas, a market that is actually working to provide good broadband services and duplicating or taking over those services in all of those areas, rather than focusing, as government should, on the areas of market failure—on the people who are actually missing out on broadband services. These are the areas we think government should get in and focus on. These are the areas in which you should be delivering your services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The backhaul rollouts that have been undertaken focus on areas of geographic disadvantage. These are not unreasonable areas for government focus. But you are building a giant new government monopoly and building it in a way that takes away any competitive sense in large tracts of the Australian community and takes away from what is, in many parts of Australia, an already functioning broadband market. In many parts of Australia, people already have good, reliable broadband services—fast services—that are priced competitively. That seems to us to be the wrong direction for government to go.
                    </p>

                     That is why I do not shy away from the fact that, yes, we oppose the

All up, some $50 billion will be churned around in this.

                       Minister, would you prefer it if I yelled at you the whole time? That is fine! I can give you a bit of passion if you want and plenty of substance to this argument as well. I can give you plenty of substance for the Australians who are going to be paying off the debt on this for many years to come. I can give you plenty of substance for the Australians who are going to be wondering why they have been burdened with this pipedream of yours and why they have been burdened with this white elephant from the government. I can give you plenty of substance to allow Australians to ask why the government is insisting on rolling this out up and down every street of Australia in the manner it is proposing, rather than focusing on delivering services where they are genuinely most needed. There is plenty of substance there.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       As I said, I do not shy away from our opposition to this—not at all. Yes, we will be opposing these bills, but we have also approached these bills constructively. We have highlighted problems in these bills. Opposition senators who participated in the Senate inquiry into these bills highlighted concerns, some of which your amendments have at least attempted, in some ways, to actually address. While your government senators were happy to brush it under the carpet and propose that the bills be passed as they were, you clearly were not satisfied with that, because you have come out with 28 pages of amendments since then. The opposition has at least subjected these bills to far greater scrutiny than your own senators have. The opposition in the other place proposed and raised issues of concern and moved some amendments there as well. The opposition is proposing a raft of amendments here, because although we think this is a bad proposal—a flawed proposal—we are willing to put in the hard yards to try to make sure that it does as little harm as possible. That is what we are hoping to at least achieve from this process.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       We want to hold you to your word. You say that this will be a wholesale only provider, and that is what we want to hold you to. We want to make sure that that is what it is. When you say that this will be subject to stringent competition rules, we want to hold you to that. When your government says that it wants to be open, accountable and transparent in its operations, that is what we want to hold you to. That is why we have proposed the amendments that we have proposed in this space. The folly of it all, of course, is that you have now proposed your own raft of amendments, most of which fail to deal with the concerns that we have highlighted, yet you come in here and want to have a debate about proposals that are substantially different from what they were this time yesterday. You want to have a debate about those all of a sudden, and you want it to be a debate of substance. What is not unreasonable is the fact that we asked the question whether, to the best of your knowledge, this is it—what we have before us. That is the question for you, Minister, as I put it at the outset: will you tell us whether your department is working on any further amendments or any further changes to the amendments before us—whether you know that there are other changes to come. Do not give us the glib answer, ‘We might correct a typo here,’ or that you ‘might’ do something else. Tell us the truth—is the work happening behind the scenes? Are senators going to be ambushed with yet more amendments and do you know that they are already on the way?

                         I am talking about their being in the chamber, where you can speak to these amendments. I cannot see any of the crossbenchers or the Greens. That suggests to me that perhaps amendments are being discussed.

We want to get this bill dealt with. We want to have our amendments dealt with. We are asking the minister a question and the minister chooses to speak on the telephone and not listen to any of the questions being asked of him.

                               I am asking you a question, Minister. I am expecting that you might do the Senate the courtesy of actually listening to questions so that you might answer them. This just shows contempt. There he is. He has hung up the phone, so he is listening.

                               Senator Conroy, can you please tell us if the department is currently working on additional amendments? If so, why are we bothering with this farce of a debate? Why don’t we just refer the amendments to a committee to be looked at? Let TransACT work out whether the amendments actually deal with the very genuine concerns they raised in the committee. Let Telstra and Optus work out whether the amendments genuinely deal with the concerns they raised. If other amendments are currently being drawn, please tell us so that we all know where we are going. It is pointless debating these amendments that you have put on the table if they are not the final amendments.

                                I rise on a point of order, Mr Temporary Chairman. It is not within standing orders for Senator Macdonald to mislead the chamber. Senator Ludlum has not left the chamber at any stage. The fact that Senator Macdonald could not notice him in the chamber does not mean that he is entitled to mislead the chamber or anyone listening to this debate into believing that he had left the chamber.

My only concern is whether they are around in the department drafting the next set of amendments. Clearly they are not. Perhaps their advisers are. That is all we want to know. Minister, if you could tell us that, you could curtail this debate quite considerably. Please confirm, as Senator Birmingham has asked you, whether or not additional amendments are currently being drafted. If they are, why are we proceeding with this farce of a debate? If they are not, let us get on with it and debate the amendments before us.

                                   There are days when I wish I could suffer from the same affliction as those opposite: the inability to remember what happened the day or the week before. I have watched the opposition—the then government—move amendments on the floor many times. I have seen amendments brought in. If they improve the bill, they are welcome—unlike the efforts by those opposite, which are simply to demolish, delay and destroy the

                                       Yes, I can see why you would be smiling, Senator Cormann. I am pleased that Mr Turnbull has taken some time off from his full-time job of destabilising Mr Abbott to actually do a little bit of policy work. I am sure that even Senator Birmingham, who is very diligent in the pursuit of his portfolio areas and very diligent in representing Mr Turnbull in this area, gets tired of carrying Mr Turnbull. I know you got tired of carrying him, Senator Cormann. We are always open to consultation and amendments that will improve it.

                                          I just want to be upfront. I think the government and the opposition know that my negotiating style is to tell everybody—both sides at the same time—what I am doing. I think that is the best way to deal with things in this place. I just had a quiet private conversation with Senator Macdonald, and I am happy to repeat what I said to him to the chamber—that is, the government introduced some further amendments yesterday. They were not insubstantial amendments. There were two amendments that I have some concerns about in relation to the points-of-interconnection authorisation and also in relation to the bundling of services and how those services can be offered. Senator Birmingham would be familiar with those amendments, as would other colleagues and of course the government. I do have some concerns, principally in relation to those two amendments. I would like to discuss that further with my colleagues. In fact, I had a brief conversation with Senator Birmingham about those concerns. I want to reserve my position to, if necessary, move amendments.

                                            I think the government’s position is clear, but I have the right, as Senator Cormann has the right, if need be to move amendments in relation to issues of concern as a result of the recent amendments. I am being completely upfront with all my colleagues in relation to this, and I think I have been consistent with respect to this. I want to reserve my position in relation to those issues. I do not think we will be getting to them for some hours, and I expect not by tonight—

But the questions that the opposition have been asking the minister have not pertained to whether he is assisting crossbenchers or whether he is looking at crossbench amendments; they have pertained to whether the government are drafting further amendments of their own, whether the government are actually developing amendments of their own.
                                               </p>

                                                And it is quite clear from his obfuscation, from his failure to tell us whether what we have before us is, from the government’s perspective at this point in time, the complete set of amendments without further ones that he knows are already being prepared, already being drafted. It is quite clear that the government is trying to work on further ways to fix up its flawed legislation, to fix up the mistakes it made when it first drafted this legislation and brought it into the House in November last year, to fix up the mistakes it made when it brought back the legislation into the House this year and passed it through the House, to fix up the mistakes it made after it began the debate in this chamber on Monday and then realised that it could not go ahead with what it had before it—and to fix up the mistakes that it has no doubt made in the two bundles of amendments totalling 28 pages that we have already.
                                               </p>
                                               <p>
                                                No doubt there are many mistakes that still need to be fixed up, and that is why the opposition has serious concerns about what you are doing here. That is why we want to make sure that you are held to some account on this and that there is thorough scrutiny. Thorough scrutiny, frankly, is not provided by us spending endless hour upon hour upon hour in here debating this. It is not what I would want to be doing. I am sure it is not what the minister wants to be doing or what anybody else wants to be doing. Thorough scrutiny can be had by giving a little breathing space, by ensuring that we step back from this debate to some extent and that we have a couple of days and an opportunity for everyone who has an interest in this to give decent analysis to the hundreds of amendments the government has proposed—ensuring that we have that breathing space so that everyone can consider it.
                                               </p>
                                               <p>
                                                In an ideal world, the minister would have had these amendments ready to roll on Monday, in which case we would have had easily a couple of days to give them the consideration they deserve. We could have had the time in that window to talk to stakeholders, to make sure that everyone was comfortable that the amendments you are proposing are going to do the job that you say they will do. But, no, you were not ready on Monday—and that is not Senator Xenophon’s fault; it is not Senator Ludlam’s fault; it is not the opposition’s fault. The only blame for the fact that this debate has not progressed further this week is on your shoulders, Minister, and the shoulders of the government for not being ready to debate it when you said you were going to.
                                               </p>
                                               <p>
                                                You had it listed first up on Monday morning. We all came in ready and rearing to go. We were there, happy to debate straight on from there. I was expecting to be clearing the diary for Monday and clearing the diary for Tuesday as we progressively went through it. Had you proposed amendments of such substance as these, perhaps we would have sought an adjournment of the debate for a day or two so that everyone could go away and consider them. But, no, you were not ready. You did not do any of those things. Instead, of course, it was last night that these amendments were dropped on the table. It was late yesterday that these amendments were dropped on the table.

                                                        The reality is that you have had the opportunity during this week to get out there and do the job properly and you failed to do it, failed to actually ensure that these amendments can be properly considered. As I said before, the opposition thinks there should be some breathing space. There should be an opportunity for these amendments to be properly considered. If you have further amendments, if you have other amendments that you are working on as a government, then there should be an opportunity for them to be properly considered for a couple of days. If you have other amendments that are necessary for the government to secure the support of the crossbenchers to get this through, there should be an opportunity for them to be considered for a couple of days. There should be a transparent opportunity for anyone who has a stake in this to have a say, to look at it and to consider all of the amendments on the table for a couple of days at least.
                                                       </p>
                                                       <p>
                                                        In reality it would be far better if we had a bit longer than that, but I understand that the government is time pressured on this. I understand the government is desperate to ensure that this legislation passes quickly so that you can get on with your negotiations with Telstra, delayed and fraught though they may already be. So I understand the government has a sense of urgency in wanting to deal with this. But a couple of days is not too much to have asked for to ensure that these amendments of substance are thoroughly considered by all of the parties and stakeholders involved in this debate. A couple of days is not unreasonable in that regard. It is especially not unreasonable when the government is conceding that there will be further amendments to come, that we have not seen the last of the amendments, that there will be more—so we will have to continue to update our understanding and knowledge of what it is you are proposing without the opportunity to thoroughly go out and consult stakeholders.
                                                       </p>

                                                        The reality is that these bills are not going to become law this week. The House of Representatives, the members of the other place, are probably starting to file out now, or pretty close to it, I suspect. They are heading off home, heading off to whatever they are doing back in their electorates for the weekend. They will be coming back next week. It is not unreasonable to suggest that perhaps they should come back late next week rather than early next week, to provide for the opportunity to have those couple of days’ breathing space. It is not unreasonable to suggest that the Senate should do likewise—rather than debating this now, coming back in the middle of next week after having had a couple of days to give thorough and decent analysis to these bills and to the amendments you are proposing.

It would give you another day or so to get your house in order, to make sure that you finalise the amendments that you want to move in relation to this legislation, to make sure that you actually had the final bill and the final package of amendments before us so that everyone can have an informed debate; so that we can all be informed by the various stakeholders in relation to this matter; so that we can know for sure, for certain, that your intentions are as you proclaim them to be in relation to this legislation—that you will be creating a wholesale only network in the guise of a national broadband network company and that the

It would give us all that couple of days’ breathing space to make sure it lives up to what you say it does.

You shake your head, Minister, but of course this was a story, this was news that came out—

That is your simple approach and in this case you choose to do it against a newspaper. The questions have been asked. You shake your head, but it is not unreasonable for the questions to be asked, because these amendments were provided yesterday. The explanatory memorandum that is quoted in that newspaper story was released just yesterday. It is not unreasonable for people to be trying to digest what that means. If we had a couple of days’ breathing space to work it out and to ensure that we had confidence in knowing what it means, the Senate could come back and debate it with full confidence, confidence that your shake of the head, your assurances that people in the seven per cent will not be worse off, are actually to be taken—

Indeed, you can provide further amendments if need be into that process so that the whole package is thoroughly considered. Then we can come back here next Wednesday, have the proper debate and get it done. Our colleagues from the other place can come back on Thursday or Friday, have their debate and get it done, and you will have your legislation by the end of next week, I am sure, if you do the job properly. That is all—one week. It could take one week in total to actually give these amendments proper airing, proper consideration, thorough examination and a full opportunity for stakeholders to actually have their say. That is all it would take, a full one-week period in which the committee could have a few days, the Senate gets a couple of days and the House gets a day or two. Everyone gets the opportunity to give that consideration and make sure the job is done properly rather than rush in the manner that you are proposing.
                                                               </p>

                                                                So I indicate that it is my intention to move that the committee report progress so that the Senate can then debate a motion to allow these bills, and more particularly these amendments, to be referred to the committee for consideration. That will give the committee those couple of days in which it can air those amendments and get feedback from the carriers, consumer groups, academics, the department and the government—get all of the relevant information—and do the homework that you seem to be so unwilling to do. The committee will do the homework you are unwilling to do and make sure that all of your amendments live up to your commitments and promises—that they all make sense and will actually do the job of providing the

I have told you: bring the Senate back next week and we will deal with it next week, but give these substantive amendments—these hundreds of amendments—a day or two of airing. Actually give them the consideration they deserve. Give them that consideration. I assure you, Senator Conroy, that if you do this then by this time next week you will have it all done and dusted, I am sure. By this time next week it will have been sorted, but the bills will have had the proper consideration given to them. With that, I move:

Firstly, the minister has again referred to members of the opposition collectively as ‘a bunch of frauds’ and he should withdraw that, as you have previously asked him to withdraw. Secondly, he is misleading the Senate. Senator Birmingham made a very constructive suggestion, given that the minister is not ready to proceed with the debate because he does not have all his ducks in a row in relation to his amendments. There is no suggestion at all of blocking anything; the suggestion is that the Senate debates it so we can deal with this.

Senator Conroy has said time and time again that it is to be a wholesale only network—that NBN Co. is to operate on a wholesale only basis. In fact, let us look through some of Senator Conroy’s quotes, even some of his recent quotes. In March 2010 Senator Conroy, talking on

Notwithstanding the opposition’s concerns about the entire concept of the NBN, if you are to go down this path, we want to make sure and guarantee that NBN Co. cannot in future abuse its position. We do not want to find ourselves in the future in a situation where we have gotten rid of one vertically integrated monopoly to create another unregulated or poorly regulated monopoly.

A great competition is held back in telecommunications in many markets around the world by a monopoly wholesaler offering better wholesale services to its own retail arm than to the retail businesses of competitors.
                                                                      </p>

So it is of great concern to the opposition and industry that we have come along here to debate this bill, the National Broadband Network Companies Bill 2010, to discover that the government has not put an appropriate fence around what the NBN Co. can do in future.

                                                                      </p>

The opposition is proposing to amend clause 9 in the means and ways listed on sheet 7049 revised. This amendment will provide a far clearer definition as to where and to whom services may be supplied. It will provide a far clearer definition to ensure that services are supplied on a wholesale basis and that services are supplied in a manner where, to paraphrase Senator Conroy, ultimately down the track NBN is not able to abuse its position.

We think that is only fair and reasonable. We think it is important to hold the government to its word in this regard and that we ensure that NBN Co. are not able to step out of being a wholesale only provider and in doing so risk having that situation where down the track they are able to abuse their position so that we will have potentially gotten rid of one vertically integrated monopoly and instead created a poorly regulated monopoly that is able to step, in some way, into a field of vertical integration.
                                                                      </p>
                                                                      <p>
                                                                       We heard during the Senate committee inquiry genuine concern from carriers that there were real prospects of NBN Co. supplying directly to end users of services and that there were real prospects that there were carriage service providers, companies and organisations, who already met the definition of being a carriage service provider who would be eligible under the government’s act, if it is passed, to be able to get services directly from NBN Co. We heard everything in that regard from library groups, local government groups, supermarket groups to potentially big banks. You can only imagine what would happen if NBN Co. were able to snatch all of those big customers—the supermarket groups, the big banks, the big companies, large local government entities and big library services—and provide services directly to any of these bodies. It would rip the more profitable aspects out of the retail market. It would leave the retail service providers providing smaller services to large numbers of people. It would take out some of the biggest customers and in the process NBN Co. would have stretched ‘way beyond’—your words—your promise throughout the entirety of this debate that NBN Co. would be a wholesale only provider. What would have happened is that they would be quite clearly providing retail services. They would be providing retail services because they would be providing to customers at the end point of that service. There is no denying that is what it would become in those circumstances. Indeed, in evidence to the Senate committee, it was clear that NBN Co. was quite happy with that situation, that they saw nothing wrong with the situation of them being able to provide services directly to end users. Under questioning from Senator Ludlam, the revelation became quite clear that NBN Co. saw nothing wrong in providing services directly to end users.
                                                                      </p>
                                                                      <p>
                                                                       So, Minister, the question for you to answer here relates to this very narrow definition you have provided, where many entities, who will have absolutely no intention whatsoever of on-selling communications services but who are defined as carriage service providers, would actually be able to buy services direct from NBN Co. without on-selling them. Why should those companies be able to meet it? We have the example that was given of Woolworths, who meet the definition of a carriage service provider because of some of the mobile services that they sell—that is all. That is how they meet that definition. But if Woolworths were to find it cost effective to buy their services direct from NBN Co. there would be nothing in your legislation at present that would prevent them from doing so. They would be, therefore, a retail customer if that is all they were doing. If they were buying the service, if they were using it themselves, if they were not on-selling it, they would be a retail customer—a total retail customer.

That is the crux of the amendment we are attempting to get agreement to in this regard. The opposition wants to hold you and your government to account in this, to account against your promises. It is a long, long time since you made your first grand promises on this—since we had fibre to the node, since we had all of that policy development from the government, a modest $4.7 billion project if my memory stands correctly. But ever since you moved to the fibre-to-the-home proposal you have been emphatic about it being a wholesale only network. We just want to make sure it is a wholesale only network. Through this amendment we are attempting to ensure that is the case, attempting to do nothing more than to hold you to your word and ensure that is what is delivered.

The mechanism it uses is a restriction on selling to any party other than a carrier or carriage service provider or specified utility—that is, it cannot sell to end users. The proposed amendment puts a further restriction—this is what is critically important—on the parties that NBN Co. can supply. It leaves the requirement that NBN Co. supply only carriers or carriage service providers, but only those carriers or carriage service providers or a member of their immediate circle that supply a service to the public.
                                                                                  </p>

First, NBN Co. will only supply a service that by its nature is a wholesale service—for example, a layer 2 service on the fibre network. This is not a service that can be used by an end user as considerable resources and capability are required in order to turn a layer 2 service into an end-user or retail service. You cannot use the service that the NBN is providing without changing it and adding to it. But most importantly—and the hypocrisy of Senator Birmingham and those opposite—the restriction proposed by the opposition would prevent an arrangement that has been permitted by the Howard government’s own legislation since 1997—that a person can become a carrier even if that person wishes to supply services primarily to his or her own operations.

                                                                                   You are actually seeking to amend your own legislation to restrict people in a completely anticompetitive way. You are actually seriously proposing to this chamber to restrict your own previous legislation to be more anticompetitive. That is what you are proposing. It is quite an astonishing and astounding thing for the Liberal party, the supposed party of competition—although in the telco sector we know there have been a few black marks over the last 15 years. But seriously, this is your chance to shake off the chains and to shake off the anticompetitive position that you and your party have endorsed for 15 years. There is an opportunity to actually get on board for a pro-competition piece of legislation.
                                                                                  </p>

It prevents carriers or service providers from using NBN Co. services for their own internal communications. For these reasons, the government does not support this anticompetitive and restrictive amendment.

But in terms of the ability of wholesale operators, I would be concerned and have some sympathy for Senator Birmingham’s amendment if this bill were to come out of this place with provisions to allow for price discrimination. If you remove the provisions on price discrimination then I think that takes away the reason or the rationale for, or the benefits of, this particular amendment. I think the appropriate way to deal with this bill is to ensure that the

It will then not make any difference; there will be a level playing field. I think it would enhance competition.
                                                                                     </p>

I think that would provide a very strong safeguard for competition and ensure that there is a level and fair playing field.

Perhaps Senator Birmingham, if you had been here when that occurred, you would have crossed the floor and saved the day; we will never know. But your side left us with the market structure that we have today. It is extraordinary to then come in and get a lecture on setting up a wholesale-only, open-access network that we are hoping will be as free from contamination by retail activities as possible. And to hear that from the side that sold this vertically integrated thing down into the market, where it then did everything it could, what it was legally obliged to do—that is, maximise shareholder returns. The public interest went out the window, not because Telstra’s management were bad people but because they were legally obliged to do what they spent the last couple of years doing.

We agree with the principle, as it was outlined years ago, that this is to be a wholesale-only, open-access network. I believe the amendments that the coalition have put up are poorly drafted. I am not going to suggest, or anything of the sort, that there is malicious intent. Let us be very careful here about whether the amendments the coalition are going to bring forward into this debate are genuinely designed to improve this bill. I ask Senator Birmingham to answer the question—I know he does not have to—that if the amendments the coalition put forward were to get up, would he vote for this bill? Or is the coalition intending to trash this thing no matter what happens over the next couple of days? I would be genuinely interested to know that.
                                                                                       </p>

I think the questions that Senator Xenophon raised are entirely appropriate and I foreshadow that the Australian Greens will be moving amendments at the appropriate time to make sure that when we are debating a real

I am interested to know, as I suspect everybody in this chamber is, about the degree to which this supposed scope creep actually occurs.

I will have this argument in the case of utilities, carriage service providers and so on—people using these services for their own use—but the service that NBN Co. is selling to the market will be a wholesale service to everyone. I think that is a very important distinction to make. I may rise again if Senator Birmingham cares to address any of the issues that I have raised, but otherwise I will just state that the Australian Greens will not be voting for these amendments.

In the earlier debate we had, where I pleaded for the government to provide some extra time for consideration of its detailed amendments to ensure that we got all of them right, I think I made it quite clear that the position of the opposition coming into this debate is that we are trying to put forward amendments in good faith, but that does not vary our position of opposition to the

I made it clear earlier and I make it clear again that our opposition is based on some of the fundamental concerns we have with the NBN. But along the way we are attempting to do our best to hold the government to account and ensure that—on the presumption that this will eventually pass and become law—it reflects what the government has said is its intention and that it does what is best for the consumer and the telco sector by providing the necessary outcomes.

He heard the various terms on which parties raised concerns about this. Let me quote a couple of those areas of concern from the committee report.

                                                                                            </p>

                                                                                             It is very easy for a customer to ‘convert’ from a retail customer to a carrier, because a carrier licence can be readily obtained with minimal investment requirements, and there is no requirement that a person who holds a carrier licence actually use a network unit to supply services to the public. Once an entity becomes a carrier, NBN Co can supply that person, and the services supplied can be self consumed (by the entity or within its corporate group). This is a simple loophole enabling a corporate customer to buy communications services directly from NBN Co without being a retailer.

This bill is meant to be about ring-fencing NBN Co. and putting a barrier around it to ensure that it is a genuine wholesale only provider. We think that that is a wise intention: if you are going to construct this thing it should be a wholesale only provider. That is not an unreasonable intention—in fact, that is exactly what the intention should be and you should be held to account on that.
                                                                                              </p>

From the evidence provided, it appears that it is wide open to potential abuse. We would rather knock that abuse out from day one than risk the type of mission creep that is of concern and risk getting to a position where NBN Co. is able to abuse its position and pick-off profitable customers from the retail service providers.
                                                                                              </p>
                                                                                              <p>
                                                                                               If you want to set up NBN Co. as a genuine wholesale only business we invite you to narrow your definition to ensure that it is only a wholesale only provider. The minister seems to be putting his entire faith—not in his clause related to whether or not it is a wholesale only provider—in technical definitions of the type of service NBN Co. will provide but not who it will provide to. We do not think that that is good enough because there is still some debate to be had about whether those technical definitions are satisfactory.
                                                                                              </p>

What if that happens? Why not make the ring fence tighter from day one? Why not ensure from the outset that you protect the market, NBN Co. and the consumer from having NBN Co. stray into this retail space? Just as Telstra highlighted in their evidence questions about the terms ‘carrier’ and ‘carriage service provider’, they equally highlighted questions in relation to the definition of service providers. In their submission Telstra argued:

Such an entity would operate under the CSP class licence, and – under the proposed NBN Companies Bill – could acquire all of its fixed services from NBN Co directly, even though they may be entirely unrelated to functions as a mobile reseller.
                                                                                              </p>

I again emphasise that just relying on the technological definitions, just relying on where NBN Co. may or may not be able to draw the line on exactly what technical services it provides, is not good enough, because the technology and the ability to use that and adapt to that and the cost of doing so will inevitably and invariably change in years to come.
                                                                                              </p>

A wholesale only network, by anyone’s definition, by the definition of any layman or anyone walking down the street, should surely be a network that provides services only to retailers who on sell them. It should be that simple. That is all the opposition in this amendment is trying to achieve—to distil it down to those basic few words.
                                                                                              </p>

                                                                                               If Senator Ludlam or Senator Xenophon have concerns with aspects of our amendment, let us look at them and let us fix the problems, or let us look at an alternative. What we should be expecting here is a very clear ring-fencing, as I have put it, of NBN Co. that ensures it is a wholesale-only network, as the government has promised. That is what we urge the chamber to support. The current definitions in the bill are not satisfactory in that regard; they do not provide that protection. I would urge the minister to outline exactly why he thinks this very open definition in clause 9 that he has is somehow going to prevent that.
                                                                                              </p>

                                                                                               It seems the minister has indicated he actually does not think it is going to prevent that and he does not think there is anything wrong with it. Well, if you do not think there is anything wrong with it, then please explain to us why you think, having proclaimed the virtues of NBN Co. being a wholesale-only network, it is appropriate for them to be able to sell services directly to end users. Tell us why you think that. Why have you changed your mind? Why do you want to provide capacity for NBN Co. to step into providing services direct to end users and therefore be a retail provider. Why do you think that that is a reasonable thing? Tell the Senate that; be honest about your intentions in this regard. If you let the bill go through in its current form without changes to this clause, without accepting the opposition’s amendment or proposing some other substantive alternative, your words that this is to be a wholesale-only network will ring hollow to anyone in the sector who cares to look at this bill. It will be clear to all that your intention is to allow NBN Co. to engage in this mission creep.
                                                                                              </p>
                                                                                              <p>
                                                                                               Why will that be your intention? I have no doubt that will be your intention because you need to get some return; you desperately need to somehow provide the capacity for NBN Co. to provide some return on the billions of dollars of taxpayers’ money that is being pumped into it. Quite possibly the only way you are going to be able to get that return is to allow them to engage in this sort of mission creep, to allow them to stretch their mandate beyond being a wholesale-only provider into providing these sorts of retail services. Is that the reason? Is that why you are happy to provide this unsatisfactory definition of wholesale-only services? Are you happy to leave it this open? Your hope, really, is that the only chance for NBN Co. to provide the returns to government that the government claims to be seeking is for it to actually stretch its mandate, is for it to cherry pick profitable retail customers off those retail service providers and make sure that it provides a service directly to them.
                                                                                              </p>

Is that why you are rejecting any means of tightening the definition of this? If it is, it shows just how unsatisfactory your approach to this whole issue is, just how hollow your words are, just how shameless the approach is when you say one thing about it being a wholesale only network but then when it comes to the legislation, when it comes to the nitty-gritty on how NBN Co. is going to work, you do something quite different by simply defining that it can provide services to a carrier or a service provider, knowing full well that the definition of those words will allow service provision to a whole range of other businesses and entities, will allow NBN Co. to get into providing direct services to retail customers.

We do not draft these amendments for fun, you know, Minister. We do not do it for fun at all. We have done it to ensure that there is something here to debate, to say, ‘Let’s make sure that we keep you to your word.’ If you want this to be a wholesale only network, the challenge is here. Support this amendment or come up with something else, but tell the chamber before we vote on this what the alternative is, to keep you to your word.

I confess I was unfair to Senator Birmingham when I said he was quoting himself because, to my shock and horror, I discover in actual fact he was quoting Telstra. He was basically parroting Telstra’s line and they are saying that the bill should include a requirement that the

So people should know exactly where the Liberal Party stand when it comes to competition in the telecommunications sector yet again: just do Telstra’s bidding. Senator Ludlam, we had hopes. There was a chance for the opposition to finally break free of their mindless anticompetitive pro-Telstra position, but again we have been disappointed.

You should hang your head in shame that you are in here wanting to tell corporations who pay for a legal service what they can do with it. At the end of the day that is what this is about. You want to tell them how they can use a service they buy. They can only buy a wholesale service. A company then has to decide what it wants to do with it. But, no, you on behalf of Telstra want to tell them what they can do with it. You are in here saying that they can only use it for one purpose and they cannot use it for another. Talk about anticompetitive. You have just been exposed again. I quote you again from

It would not be possible. I say that in the kindest possible way. As Senator Fisher knows, I said that with a smile on my face.

Could you be more Stalinistic in intervention? Could you be more anticompetitive if you tried? You are actually going to amend your own legislation to be anticompetitive. It is quite extraordinary behaviour by a party that claims it is pro-competition, that it is pro-small business, that it is pro-innovation but the same simple pro-Telstra, anticompetition lines are coming from those opposite.

I appreciate and anticipate Senator Conroy’s objections that it is not $50 billion but, once you add up what they are going to pay to Telstra, in a global sense this is going to be a $50 billion investment by the taxpayer in this national broadband network.

We had issued contracts for a mix of fibre, wireless and satellite that would have provided a very fast broadband service to everyone in Australia at a cost of about $5 billion. It was gazumped by the Labor Party prior to the 2007 election by promising that they could provide a national broadband network for $4.7 billion—a little bit cheaper.

It was your great policy, which was written for you by your then friends, Telstra, and you fell for it hook, line and sinker. You are moving your head; it should be up and down rather than side to side. You know what I am saying is exactly what happened. We know what it is like in opposition: you do not have many resources, so you grab your advice where you can get it. Telstra were only too pleased to give you a few clues and tell you they could do it in a proper way for about $4.7 billion, which in a way was similar to the OPEL contract, which had been at that time let by the previous government. If your government had not breached its contractual duties, a fast broadband service would have been up and operating in Australia about a year ago. Yet under your scheme we are going to have to wait for about eight years until we get anything closely resembling it.
                                                                                                            </p>

                                                                                                             You spent $20 million on one proposal and then scrapped it. Then you spent another $20 million on something else. You were throwing the money around. It is easy to do when it is not your money, of course, but that is typical of the Labor Party. Then when nothing fell into place we had Senator Conroy come up with the $50 billion proposal at taxpayers’ expense. That is one thing, but at the same time to say, ‘This will be a commercial operation and we’ll get a return on the taxpayers’ investment and there will be co-investment,’ is something else. We do not hear too much about these things at the moment. Go out to the market and see who wants to invest as a partner in this sort of project. Yet, Senator Conroy, that was your original proposal.

Once anyone saw the figures you did not have to be a mathematician to work out that it would never make a profit, particularly if you do what you have been doing in Tasmania and give away the NBN services absolutely free. It will not cost them a cent in Tasmania until 1 July this year. No wonder it is a cheap service to users in Tasmania; they are not paying for it. They are being given it for free. How are you ever going to get a return on your investment if you are not charging anything for the $50 billion investment you are putting into it? Nobody believes it, not even you.
                                                                                                            </p>

He never wants the entity to be privatised as he knows no private entity would ever invest in this because it will be a financial dud. It may work in the end. It may provide very fast broadband. But it will not provide it at a price that Australian consumers or Australian taxpayers will be able to afford. That is clearly why the government and NBN want to leave this little option open to be able to retail their services to certain defined, I concede, consumers.
                                                                                                            </p>

I do not know and I hope I am not giving away any secrets here, but I do not think Defence buy their services. I think they have their own network. That is stuff that is probably not relevant here. I think most other government departments, most big entities, most utilities currently get their services from someone else. That is a question; I am not asserting that. I am asking the minister as it is appropriate to do in this committee stage of the debate where senators, on behalf of the Australian taxpayers, are able to raise these questions. That is a question for you, Senator Conroy. Are there any government agencies not now buying their services through one of the retail service providers?
                                                                                                            </p>

                                                                                                            </p>
                                                                                                            <p>

Perhaps, Senator Conroy, you could answer those two questions for me to make sure that I understand this appropriately. When you have answered them, I will then move on to say—I will not argue this now; I will come back to this once I have your answers—wouldn’t it be better if some amendments were adopted? I suggest the amendment we have moved, but, if not, then perhaps we and the Greens could get together and prepare an alternative amendment that might ensure that NBN is a wholesale-only company. Otherwise we could get to the situation that I think Senator Birmingham enunciated, and that is that you have a vertically integrated telco, as we have had in the past and which many people have said is inappropriate. Perhaps we could start with those two questions, and then I will refer to our amendment.

Senator Conroy, you will no doubt—as you have in the past—get up and have a tirade against your old mates Telstra, who weren’t your old mates for a while, then they were back as your new mates and then they weren’t.

Your fibre-to-the home proposal gave you a lot of excitement: it gave you tingles up the spine. But as Mr Turnbull mentioned at the first meeting of the new joint committee this morning, he has just been to Korea and Singapore. They do not have fibre to the home there. They have fibre to the node. Even in these brand new, high-rise buildings there is fibre to the node and they send it out from there. You can dismiss that. It is only Singapore; it is only

They are already doing that. Hopefully, you will be able to have a look at Mr Turnbull’s video. He has offered to make it available to the committee. I am sure he would make it available to your department, because I think you might find it a bit instructive. This is what happens when you make these policies on the run. They sound good and, for a little while, you can talk a language that nobody else can talk and you can get away anything.

Senator Conroy keeps attracting my response to his disorderly interjections. He has again diverted me from the question I was asking. So I might leave it there and get Senator Conroy to answer the questions that I asked earlier. I think Senator Fisher might have some questions as well.

I would not necessarily have defined your OPEL lament as a question—perhaps a stream of consciousness. But when it comes to OPEL, I know that the next speaker is the master. This amendment prevents a carrier acquiring services for self-supply. This is a right they have today. You actually want to tell people, tell companies, how they can use a service. That is what you are proposing. I invite you, Senator Macdonald, to reflect on what you are actually proposing. You are saying that it is okay for a company to buy a wholesale service from

That was not your position a while ago—not yours personally. At least you have come round to not wanting to be too embarrassingly anticompetitive. But once they have purchased it, you are deciding for them what they can do with it. That is actually what you are doing. That is something that they have the choice to do now. You are seeking to restrict your own former legislation to tell a company that buys a wholesale service what it can do. I do not think you could be more interventionist.

Senator Macdonald and Senator Fisher want to tell them what they can do with it.

Did Mr Turnbull not meet anyone involved in that rather large—I think to quote from the Economist Intelligence Unit—$24 billion project. This involves converting from the basement or node, if you want to use that word, to people’s flats—actually into their homes. Did he not meet anyone involved in that $24 billion project that is underway in South Korea? I am quoting those figures; I could be wrong. I am quoting that from the Economist Intelligence Unit so it is entirely possible that it is wrong, given the way that they incorrectly described our build. But perhaps Mr Turnbull did not meet any of those companies involved in that somewhat significant project in South Korea on his tour of telecommunications facilities.

Far from the opposition doing the bidding of Telstra with this particular amendment, your government is doing the bidding of NBN Co. and its boss, Mike Quigley.

The fact that more than one person or body has a good idea does not discredit the goodness of that idea. There is no mortgage on a good idea. Great minds often think alike. Maybe in this particular respect, Minister, you could consider the fact that Telstra’s great mind just happens to think alike to the opposition’s great mind in this respect.

Maybe that is why the government is choosing in this respect to do the bidding of NBN Co. and its boss, Mike Quigley—that is, the sad fact that fools seldom differ. You have also tried to suggest that this opposition amendment ‘tells them what to do with it’—I am not quite sure who ‘them’ is—and is therefore anticompetitive. You are deliberately missing the point. The effect of this opposition amendment is not to tell them, or indeed anyone, what to do with it. The intent of this opposition amendment is to tell them—to the extent that there is a ‘them’ defined by you—what they cannot do with it. It is hardly anticompetitive to say what they cannot do with—

How obfuscatory it is. You try to say that our amendment effectively tells ‘them’ what to do with it when in fact our amendment simply says one thing that they cannot do with it. That one thing is not to on-supply to the public. We do not dare to prescribe what and how about on-supply to the public. We are hardly telling them what to do with it. All that we are doing is saying what they cannot do with it—we get the amendment, Minister—and we are making it very clear that retail service providers continue to have a role in this market.

Your government is very clearly telling the retail service providers they can stick it up their jumper. They can stick what has been their business right up their jumper because the government owned enterprise,

You seem to be conveniently forgetting that your NBN proposition is to move from the market and scenario of today to a world of tomorrow—a totally different world of tomorrow. But it now may be even more different than we thought it was going to be because with this raft of amendments that you have tabled overnight. It really is quite an indecent proposal for this Senate to consider your 20-or-so pages of amendments, delivered overnight at this short notice. It is an indecent proposal because, Minister, deep in your heart of hearts you know that these amendments so turn on its head the underlying spirit of what was the companies bill that really you should have tabled a new bill. You should not be trying to amend the bill that is currently before the Senate. You should have gone back to the drawing board and started again.
                                                                                                                                                 </p>

                                                                                                                                                  In your heart of hearts you know you should have done that. But you know that were you to do that you would also have to start the process all over again and that might put a spanner in the spokes as to your need to reach an agreement with Telstra and the need for your government owned enterprise to get access to certain things that Telstra has. You also know you are not going to get a deal with Telstra until you have got legislation in some form or other through this chamber—and that needs to be quick smart. So, Minister, do not talk to us about telling them what to do with it when your bill very clearly tells the retail service providers what to do with it and what to do with their business and that is to stick it up their jumper—and that is putting it politely. Minister, my question is: what in the bill or the bill as proposed to be amended by the government stops NBN Co. from stepping into the shoes of would-be retail service providers in any circumstance? What provisions in the bill or in the amendments tabled by the government stop NBN Co. from being a retailer?

To follow on from the astute line of questioning of my colleague Senator Fisher, Minister, I would appreciate it if you could cite other examples where a wholesale service is defined on the product rather than on the nature of the fact that a wholesaler is usually a wholesaler who sells to a retailer. As I said in comments earlier, the general understanding that I think any layman or laywoman would have about the definition of wholesale is that wholesale, and wholesaling, is seen to be an instance of onselling a product to a retailer. You seem to be wanting to define wholesaling activity not as the onselling of a product but by the product that is being sold. These are markedly different definitional approaches. They are vastly different definitional approaches. What the coalition’s amendments are seeking to do is to take a very routine, standard, traditional approach to a wholesale-only service and define it by virtue of the fact that it be onsold. There is nothing terribly radical or new in that. It would be quite commonsensical and logical, I think, to anyone who cared to listen and consider the debate. What is perplexing in the debate is why you are attempting to define a wholesale service not by the sales actions of the company but by the product that is being offered. Why do you want to create a totally different understanding of wholesale services for

You are seeking to close it down and dictate to companies who buy a legal wholesale service—it is legal because they have got themselves the licence—and tell them what to do. You are seeking to change the definitions in the existing bill. You are actually closing down a market. That is what you are doing.

When someone plugs it in and turns it on in their house, a little sign will come up that says, ‘You need to go and get a RSP service.’ I will accept that a layer 3 style component at the absolute minimum is necessary to tell a consumer to go and contact an RSP. If you want to talk about technology and layer 2 or layer 3, I would accept that as a legitimate criticism, although I think most people are comfortable with that.

A company that could do something today will not be able to do it tomorrow because you have decided it. It could not be more anticompetitive. It is straight out of Telstra’s songbook, as I read out before. If you listened to someone other than Telstra—and I quoted the Australian Telecommunications Users Group—then perhaps you would have a slightly different perspective. I appreciate that you have been a wholly owned subsidiary of Telstra for so long that you cannot look in the mirror without seeing a big orange T on your forehead. But I want you to know that I still have hope for you, Senator Birmingham, because I know deep down under that tie there is a Liberal heart beating and a Liberal heart would actually support competition.

You want to define wholesale services in a wholly different way to what anybody else accepts as a normal or reasonable approach in this regard. You base it all on the concept that the technology being provided is not suitable for retail application. That is your sole line of defence, it seems, as to why you think that it is reasonable at present to accept your bill in its current terms.

That is usually what happens in this place when a bill is before us. That is usually what happens when an amendment is being debated; we are changing something. This is not some new revolution to anybody else. I am not sure why you are amazed that an amendment may seek to change something. That is the very nature of amending something. Yes, we are seeking to change something. We are seeking to change it because we want it to apply in a way that conforms with what you have been saying—that this is to be a wholesale only service. I will say it again: technology will change and adapt and there is a potential that in the future many more businesses may find it viable to take a layer 2 bitstream service and to apply it to their own needs.

Until you say that, if you are going to continue with the charade of pretending that you want this to be a wholesale only service on the one hand yet leaving a gaping gap wide open for NBN Co. to engage in retail service provision direct to customers on the other hand, then that is fine; be frank and honest about it. As long as you continue the charade of saying one thing but promulgating this bill that does something totally different, we will continue the debate arguing that you have got it wrong and that you should front up to that fact. Minister, please, I urge you to recognise that your definition of wholesale does not match anybody else’s.

Surely it is a combination of the two and surely, if there were to be more than a 50 per cent balance in one or the other, it would be in the nature of and activities of the entity, organisation or party which supplies those goods or services. To have a relationship you need at least two parties. You are essentially envisaging a scenario where you have only two parties—an NBN Co. and then a consumer who you are attempting to say obviates any place for a retailer in the relationship.
                                                                                                                                                                                  </p>
                                                                                                                                                                                  <p>
                                                                                                                                                                                   But let us compare this scenario with, for example, spare parts for a motor car. We could have a manufacturer of those spare parts who then supplies those spare parts to the next party. According to your definition, the manufacturer would be a wholesaler simply by virtue of passing on spare parts. However, if you have a manufacturer who supplies those spare parts to a second party, who then supplies those same spare parts with nothing done to them to a third party who then supplies those same spare parts to a fourth party who consumes those spare parts by putting them in a motor vehicle and driving away, that surely has to be this sort of scenario where at the very beginning you have a wholesaler and at the very end you have a consumer. Maybe the second step, but certainly the third and fourth steps, have to be retailers of a sort because they have passed on that good to another party who ultimately consumed that good. Surely that is more the test of wholesale versus retail in the relationship of the parties in the supply chain to one another in the context of what then happened to the good or service itself. I put to you, Minister, that it is simplistic for you to attempt to constrain a wholesale-retail relationship simply by saying, ‘The legislation defines it as such; therefore it is,’ particularly if what it is in the legislation turns on its head a common understanding in the everyday marketplace and also probably what has been the subject of case law over many years.

Give us an analogy in the commercial world where your definition of wholesaler and retailer works.

Clause 9 of the companies bill provides the general rule that an NBN corporation must not supply an eligible service to another person unless the other person is a carrier or a carrier service provider. Clauses 10 to 16 of the bill set out exemptions to the general rule with each of those exemptions relating to the provision of eligible services to the specified utilities. Amendments (2) to (4), (6), (8), (10), (12), (14) and (16) make it clear that the exemption does not apply unless the services are supplied on the basis that the utility must not resupply the service. Amendments (5), (7), (9), (11), (13) and (15) are minor consequential technical amendments. Concerns have been expressed that utilities could use wholesale services sourced from NBN Co. to offer retail services to the public. While this is clearly not the case, given the concerns that have been expressed and to put the matter beyond any doubt, these amendments make it clear that the services cannot be resupplied and are solely for internal use.

In this instance, the government seems to think that where it has provided exemption to the NBN on providing services to other entities it is reasonable to put a condition on those exemptions that would prohibit the on-supply or resupply of the service by those entities.

It is a very peculiar inconsistency in the government’s approach, but we are quite used to such inconsistencies from the government. The opposition are not convinced these amendments go far enough. We have amendments of our own which will be debated following this; however, we will support these amendments as a second-best solution to the government’s flawed approach.

Does coalition support for these amendments indicate that you will be changing your position or withdrawing some of your amendments down the track? I am not sure if I heard your statements correctly.

I know the whole chamber is looking forward to hearing from other senators on this. Senator Birmingham, I am shocked but pleased by the sensible approach that you are taking on this. I am interested in why you do not think these amendments are enough. I think they are pretty direct and straightforward, and they confirm what we stated upfront was always the intention. I am interested if you would like to tell me—and I am quite serious when I say this—why they are deficient. Do you intend to assist in that for a moment?

It is important that we clear this up. The government’s stated intent was always to ensure that utilities could not resupply the broader community in a retail sense. We believe that to be fair. It is what we set out to achieve, and we believe the original legislation did that. But the point has been made by a range of senators that the industry did have concerns that this was not clarified enough and we welcome the support of the chamber in clarifying this to ensure that people do not feel that the legislation is deficient. We welcome the opportunity to ensure that the government’s aims are absolutely clear in this bill.

If you are going to agree to our next amendment then you are probably going to heed our call about the deficiencies. We look forward to you acquiescing to our next amendment, which Senator Birmingham will move.

Further, the government will clarify in its amendment relating to access to utilities that it may only be used for internal uses and not for the resupply of the carriage service.

But, under the legislation, utilities will not be accessing NBN Co. for everyday telecommunications services but only for necessary and desirable uses that will enhance its ability to improve monitoring systems and innovate smart technology, which in turn will benefit the consumer of those utilities. Utilities are not end users and the government’s amendment makes it explicit that they may not resupply the carriage service. For those reasons, I cannot support the opposition’s position in relation to this.

But it does come back for the opposition to a point of principle. The point of principle is the very basic one that we have spent a very long time already debating in this place, and that is whether the

What the government has written in here is a raft of exemptions—exemptions for transport authorities, electricity supply authorities, gas supply bodies, water supply bodies, sewerage services bodies, stormwater drainage services bodies and state or territory road authorities. There is a raft of exemptions in each of those categories. We would start from the principle and the premise that it would be better for the government, who proclaim that these exemptions might be necessary—they do not say that these exemptions are necessary—to curtail the NBN as much as possible from day one to ensure that its mandate is restricted as much as possible from day one. That will ensure that it is ring fenced—and I have used that phrase before—from broadening its scope or range of activities outside of being a wholesale only provider.

We do not see that it is necessary to start out on this process of developing the NBN and of setting its operational framework in place by weakening it by providing exemptions from day one, from the get go. It would make far more sense for the government to not have these exemptions and for the government to be open to hearing sound and rational arguments that can be put to the public on a case-by-case basis as to why perhaps there should be some exemptions some time in the future. But as to giving blanket exemptions now, although the government’s amendments that were just moved tighten it a little and at least stop these entities from onselling, we see no reason why, at the outset, these entities should have immediate and ready access. That is why the opposition maintains its opposition to these exemptions within the bill.

But NBN Co. can also supply to specified utilities for limited purposes. There are three reasons for permitting supply to utilities. First, under existing legislation, utilities can do things that otherwise make them carriers or carriage service providers without being classified as carriers and carriage service providers under the

The bill simply seeks to allow NBN Co. to treat them as carriers and carriage service providers when it comes to the supply of services. Second, these arrangements will support the growth of smart infrastructure management in Australia, including smart management of energy supply. I would have thought, Senator Birmingham, that you would have been very supportive of that. Third, it puts pressure on telcos to provide utilities with the services that they need.

They must use them for the sole purpose of carrying communications necessary to monitor and administer their own networks. Utilities cannot use these services to provide retail services to end users. To clarify this matter, the government has proposed its own amendment, which makes it clear that a utility cannot resupply a service that it has bought from NBN Co. Utilities and transport authorities will still need to purchase normal communications services, like telephony or broadband internet, from retail providers. Services that NBN Co. makes available to utilities should also be available to other carriers and carriage service providers and they could offer these to utilities if they wished.

That is why the government does not support it. Let me now go to the Senate committee report.

This is an attempt by the opposition to ensure that we do not have NBN Co. supplying non-eligible services, non-approved services, to other persons or other bodies in this case. Minister, I hope that you and the crossbenches see that this is a sensible, rational amendment and one that should not cause particular duress if the NBN Co. is to operate in the manner in which you proclaim that it will. I hope that you will support this amendment.

It is appropriate that NBN corporations be permitted to provide certain other communication services, such as services that are ancillary or incidental to the supply of eligible services. These provisions of the bill place limits on the scope of the services NBN corporations may provide while still ensuring they can operate effectively to supply all necessary services to wholesale customers. For this reason the government opposes this amendment. Clauses 17 to 19 in the bill limit NBN Co’s activities to communication services and goods.

On either of those fronts I wonder how they fit within your current definition of a non-communications service. That would seem to me to suggest that you are providing communication services, not billing services, to customers. So if you are going to cite that as an example, it does not seem to be an example that is congruent with the bill as it currently stands.

So in fact non-communications service does not necessarily mean that NBN Co. cannot provide a service that seems unrelated to communications. It just means that the way a non-communications service has been defined in the act provides a fairly broad reach of opportunity to say that pretty much anything that is ancillary or incidental to the supply of an eligible service is therefore an appropriate service for NBN Co. to be supplying.

Examples of this are facilities access services (such as leasing of duct or conduit space) or access to an NBN corporation’s operational and business support 73 systems (to facilitate service ordering, provisioning and billing). The reference to ancillary or incidental services is also intended to permit NBN corporations to engage in the provision of minor services necessary in the conduct of a business, such as subleasing of surplus office space.

Quite obviously, we can see where the numbers are on this. It is going to go through and I suppose the sooner issues are brought to a head, the better. It seems inevitable. But there are a couple of things that I think should be put on the record to do with service provision and a whole range of issues. There are a whole range of queries and now is as good a time as any to ask them.

We are always rather amazed at the extent of inflation. The question I want the minister to answer, just so we can finally clarify this, is: how much is this actually going to cost to build? How much is the entity actually borrowing to do this? If the commercial plan, unbeknownst to you or to anybody else, does not stand up, is the taxpayer underwriting this and having to pick up the bill and pay it all back? Why are you building a service of fibre to the home when you could provide it to the node and provide a wireless service from there and really trim your costs? And why are you providing a service in cities? Why did you not start at the outside—in the country, where the service is not—and put the optic fibre around the optic fibre trunk lines around the country and then concentrate on the cities at a later stage? You might have even been able to get the market to look after if for you and avoid the costs.

That has nothing to do with relitigation. It is something you should know; you are the minister. If it falls over, does the taxpayer have to pick up the tab? Why are you building a fibre service to the home when you could have built it to the node? And why are you providing it in cities where there is already a market to provide it? Perhaps you could just tell us how much it is borrowing, what happens if it falls over, who picks up the tab and is the taxpayer underwriting it, just so we can get it on the record. Have you ever stood up for anything? Have you ever crossed the floor on anything, Minister, in your life?

It has been litigated—through you, Madam Temporary Chairman—many times in this chamber, in both question time and Senate estimates and in the debate on the substance of the bill in December. None of your questions are relevant to the bill, Senator Joyce. If you would like some further information on the bill, I am happy to assist you.

We can go back into our rooms and watch this on television, and I am quite happy to do that. All he has to do is tell us how much the entity is borrowing. It goes to the point of the capacity to finance it and it goes to the service delivery. It is all interconnected; he knows that. It is a very simple question: does the taxpayer pick up the tab if the whole thing falls over? Watching tonight, that is what they want to know.

I do not actually think that that is afoot. What we do plan on introducing to these bills later in the debate is some kind of transparent review so that we actually know whether this is going on. The problem we have at the moment is that the government has proposed a hypothetical national broadband network, the opposition has attacked a hypothetical broadband network, the industry is circling around trying to work out how their business models are impacted by this hypothetical network, and nobody actually knows how this is going to play out in reality.

Is there scope creep occurring? Are electricity utilities becoming covert retail service providers? Heaven forbid. Are the legitimate interests of the telco providers, who by and large still support the passage of this legislation, being trespassed upon? I do not think anybody in this chamber can say for certain how these issues will be resolved until we start to see the market perform. Predictions of how competition policy is going to impact on any given sector are notoriously unreliable. We believe the redrafting, as far as this clause is concerned anyway, that the government has proposed is about right in terms of the way the utilities will interact with the broadband network. I will state now for the record that the Greens will not be supporting this opposition amendment and we hope that we can get back vaguely on topic.

There are a number of live issues here. We believe the government, in consultation with industry and other parties, corporate and otherwise, over the last couple of years have put in quite a bit of work to try to work out how this market structure is actually going to function. This has never been done before in Australia. We have had a vertically integrated government owned incumbent and we have never had a wholesale only provider before. We have never tried to do this. I think it is somewhat unlike what has been tried elsewhere in the world; every experience is different.

We have a hypothetical national broadband network. The government says it is going to work one way and every stakeholder who has expressed a view thus far believes it is going to work in one way or another—but nobody actually knows. In this instance I can absolutely commit to Senator Xenophon and the rest of the chamber that if it is going sideways we will absolutely revisit it—

I think that is a difficult question to answer because the time lines will be different for different aspects of the bill.

So I can commit that we are not proposing simply to set and forget. As part of his agreement with the government late last year, Senator Xenophon proposed the establishment of a joint standing committee that would oversee the rollout of this project—that would be its whole job; that is all it would do—and I feel that would be a very important vehicle in determining whether the reality was matching what was in the business plan, what was in the minister’s speech and what we were told this entity would do. I am not planning on going anywhere in the next little while. I hope these issues do not need to be revisited but if they do we will certainly be there to perform that function.

The entity is borrowing $27 billion and will need to borrow a further $10 billion to roll out the network. That will be picked up by the taxpayer if it falls over. It will have disastrous effects on the Australian economy if that happens. You are building it as fibre to the home because you got sucked in. You are rolling it out in the cities and not in the country because you live in the seven per cent of the country and you have lost interest in the rest—it is purely hypothetical until we have to pick up the tab. The tab is coming; it is going to be massive and it is going to be a complete and utter disaster.

Amendment (17) inserts the words ‘and the finance minister’ after ‘communications minister’ in subclause 21(4) of the companies bill. The purpose of this amendment is simply to require both shareholder ministers to jointly make such a determination. This is consistent with clause 25 of the bill, which requires both ministers to make a functional separation requirements determination that reflects the joint shareholder responsibility of the ministers for NBN Co. Amendment (18) is a minor technical consequential change.

But I inquire of the minister: why is it appropriate that two ministers certify in relation to functional separation, as I read the clause? Why isn’t there some other perhaps more independent assessment—with respect to whoever may be the communications minister and finance minister of the time? It could be someone who, with respect, might have a little bit more of an understanding of whether the functional separation is appropriate or otherwise.

I was just saying that Senator Birmingham has indicated the opposition have no objection to adding the finance minister to the joint decision making on functional separation. But I just wonder why there is not some outside authority who determines functional separation rather than leaving it, with respect, to whoever might be the communication minister or finance minister at the time. It could be someone who might have a bit better of an idea of what it is all about.

It inserts after clause 41 in the bill a new clause, 41A, that outlines these restrictions. I would hope this is an amendment that the minister would welcome, because we have learnt from the debates we have had tonight and earlier this afternoon on the provision of wholesale only services that the minister seems to place almost the entire emphasis on the type of service that is being sold as being the preventative mechanism to stop NBN Co. from moving up the value chain and from engaging in some type of scope creep, or mission creep as it has been termed by many.

That type of service that he says is being provided is a layer 2 bitstream service. However, the bill does not provide for absolute clarity around that type of service. The bill does not provide a guarantee that NBN Co. will not engage in mission creep in who it sells to. It also has the potential to engage in mission creep in what it is selling. If we cannot close at least one of those doors, we have a real problem.

But, just as the minister made it clear in previous comments that he was not going to attempt to define for the chamber the technical specifications and differences between a layer 2 bitstream service and higher value services, I am not about to attempt to do that. Importantly, the amendment does not attempt to do that. The amendment makes it clear that in fact what it does is empower the minister through the capacity of regulatory power to put a restraint on NBN Co. from moving up the value chain in this regard. This is about empowering the minister to be able to do what he says this legislation is about and to be able to ensure that NBN Co. is providing what he has defined to be the wholesale only service, even though he wants to define ‘wholesale’ in terms of the product that is provided. That is fine; here is his opportunity to define wholesale in terms of the product that is provided. This amendment seeks to do that. In seeking to do that, it therefore again is an attempt by the opposition to keep the government to its word to the public, the industry, consumers and the parliament about what its mission for the NBN Co. is.

It is important because we want the minister to foster maximum competition at the retail end. We want to make sure that NBN Co. is not shutting out the potential for innovation and product development by retail service providers. We want to make sure that it is offering a flat, uniform service that is available to retail service providers for them to be able to innovate, value add and provide competitive outcomes.

I know that these are technical areas and issues, but equally I know that Senator Ludlam and others have looked at these issues. I hope they recognise that there is some value in providing the minister with this power and, in doing so, providing the minister with the capacity and opportunity to ensure that he and future ministers can keep NBN Co. to the mandate that you have told all of us today and many times prior you believe the government is giving them and wants them to operate within.

I do not think it actually needs a legislative fix, which is why the government is not support this amendment.

I appreciate the point you made that you have not sought to be too inflexible. A simple black-and-white layer 2 rule is inflexible and could be counterproductive in terms of the services provided to customers. This was even recognised by Telstra in its submission to the Senate committee that examined the bills.

With suitable carve-outs, a restriction of the type contemplated by this amendment would most appropriately be dealt with by a carrier licence condition if the need arose. During the next four months the government will consider placing a condition on NBN Co.’s carrier licence to restrict it to layer 2. The coalition’s revisions to the amendment it moved in the house do not address these fundamental issues. The revisions to the amendment would allow the minister to exempt a specified eligible service by legislative instrument subject to public consultation. This function is already met by clause 41 of the bill. So I think it is a very constructive amendment, Senator Birmingham, and I do actually think this is an important issue for us to follow closely. As I have said, I have indicated the government will consider placing a condition on NBN Co.’s carriers licence.

I went back and had a quick look at the submission that Telstra put to the committee—the one that the minister referred to briefly in his contribution. Telstra wrote an amendment. I do not know whether it is exactly word for word what Senator Birmingham is proposing tonight; I would not suspect that other people are doing the coalition’s homework under any circumstances at all. But in the submission they put that accompanied their proposed amendment they did state:

They went on to sketch one carve-out. So if it is a satellite service, for example, perhaps Telstra proposed a specific amendment to catch that. My point of view is that this is perhaps one of the very rare instances in this NBN debate where the coalition and the government are not actually all that far apart and the intentions are more or less the same, and I will associate the Australian Greens with that. It does undermine the entire principle of NBN Co. if it is working its way up the stack or up the value chain. I do not think anybody is seriously contemplating that it should be able to do that, but for purely technical reasons it is not possible to legislate a black-and-white boundary between the two kinds of service that NBN Co. might choose to offer.

There again there is another carve-out. There are ways dealing with exemptions. But to me it sounds like a recipe for terrible micromanagement by the minister if he has to sign off on every one of these variations to the instrument. To me it feels as though there is potentially unnecessary intervention there by the minister. So we will not be supporting this amendment, although we do support the intention and we believe that the bill as drafted probably does take care of that potential for scope creep vertically, if you will. Again, this is another issue—and I am probably going to reference this a few times during the evening and tomorrow—where we want that reported. We want some transparency around what kind of entities and how often NBN Co. has gone and done that. We think this is probably not particularly a deal breaker for the coalition, but we will be voting with the government on this occasion.

We are just saying that it should be the parliament that determines this, and that is why this amendment here puts it in. Senator Conroy is saying that the parliament does not need to do it because we can, if we want to, make it a carrier licence condition. That is right: you might do that, but then you might not decide to do that.

So it gives the parliament and the people of Australia the ability to oversight this, rather than leaving it to the minister, as I understand his objection, saying, ‘You do not need to do that because we will include it, or we may include it, as a condition of the carrier licence being issued.’ But I repeat: they may not include it as a condition. I am surprised that the Greens and the Independents cannot allow the parliament to have oversight of this rather than just leaving it to the government to make a decision. The end result, as Senator Conroy rightly said, is the same if the government does impose that condition. But if they do not impose that condition then the restrictions on better than layer 2 are perhaps a bit looser. I would have hoped that the Greens and the Independents would have supported the parliament having that role. Being a legislative instrument—and being disallowable—does allow the parliament to have that oversight rather than leaving it to the possibility of the minister including it as a condition of the carrier licence.

I particularly thank the minister for his comments on clause 41, the carrier licence conditions, and the expectations of the government in regard to developing and imposing some conditions in this space. The coalition welcomes that commitment, we note it, we bank it and we look forward to seeing it honoured. It is important in these debates for commitments like that to be noted and to be recorded so that all understand where they are going in this space.

I also appreciate his comment that he is hoping in the future to see some provisions that surround the disclosure of some of these arrangements and matters. If there are further amendments to come we certainly look forward to seeing them, getting to them and seeing just what shape and form they take. We hope that the Greens and the other crossbenchers, if they are working with the government on such disclosure amendments, ensure that they are rigorous, comprehensive and cover many of the concerns that we have discussed.

We believe that to be the case largely because we are approaching this, as we have with numerous other amendments, from a position of caution going into this debate. We think it is better, wiser and more sensible to ensure that risks are minimised, that doors are closed rather than left ajar and that we actually have a very tight framework in place for the operation of

If the government then needs to open the door a little to create some exemptions and to find the space to have a bit of extra flexibility, we can do that. But, to start with, the parliament should be ensuring that this entity is living by the principles that the government has set out and works within the mandate that the government has stated time and time again. We believe that when we look at this there is a real concern that NBN Co. could move up the value chain and could start to operate outside of that mandate. We trust the government will act to ensure that does not occur, in the way that Senator Conroy has outlined, but we would rather not have to finish this debate operating on trust. We would rather conclude this debate operating on certainty. We think the industry, the sector and consumers all deserve to be able to conclude this debate operating on a level of certainty as well, rather than on just a level of trust.

They also ensure that NBN Co. will not move up the value chain and engage in mission creep of any sort whilst providing the flexibility that may be necessary for the minister, the government and NBN Co. to operate in a sensible way into the future. This is probably going to be a point of principle on which we differ, but it is fundamental to the approach the opposition has taken. It is consistent through most of the amendments that we have moved to date and it is consistent in the fact that we are arguing, in so many of these instances, for an approach where we expect NBN Co. to be operating very firmly within its mandate. This legislation is the means to define that mandate and to curtail that mandate. We should not be leaving wriggle room, we should not be leaving room for expansion and we should not be leaving room for doubt in the future. We should be creating certainty tonight and tomorrow and however long it takes to pass these bills. We should be ensuring they leave a certain framework and environment, and not a framework that allows NBN Co. to expand its scope or mission into the future.

As the minister has indicated, and I welcome his indication, they are offered in a constructive way. We have taken on board concerns from the debate in the House of Representatives and made sure that more flexible amendments are put forward in this place. We think that it is a stronger, better and more secure way for the parliament to ensure it gets what the minister says he is going to give us. This is so we do not wake up in two, three, four, five or 10 years time to find that we have a new government owned monopoly that is starting to sell, or has been selling, in markets that none of us thought or wanted to see happen, and as a result we have a whole new problem in the telco sector.

While I must confess I had colleagues chatting around me at the time and did not hear all of the minister’s brief explanation, I am curious as to whether the minister could inform the house as to what has precipitated this 18-month extension?

The build has expanded, because we undertook, when we went from 90 per cent to 93 per cent, to incorporate an extra three per cent of homes. We also took on board greenfields, which meant that we were picking up a million-odd extra homes as part of those two decisions. We have well over a million homes extra in the 93 per cent and the greenfields, and that is what is behind this change. This was announced in December last year.

It still seems odd, Minister, that this was not perhaps fixed up through an amendment in the other place before it came here, but I shall take your word for it that this has been known for some period of time and is of little consequence when compared to the more substantive amendments related to Commonwealth ownership provisions that the opposition will be moving in a moment.

I got that wrong. You are extending an eight-year plan. I sorted that out without even hearing you, Minister, through the hubbub around you. Okay, so you are extending an eight-year plan to a 9½-year plan. That is an extra year and a half out of eight years, and 1.5 over eight does not make an extra three per cent. You are saying that you need an extra year and a half to cope with an additional three per cent—to go from 90 per cent to 93 per cent. That does not really add up for me, even taking into account the greenfield sites. If that is the rationale—

Thank you. Minister, if you are seriously arguing that, together with the greenfields sites, it is the government’s extended promise in increasing coverage from 90 per cent of homes to 93 per cent of homes—an additional three per cent—that might be consistent with an additional three per cent in terms of the time frame. By my probably other than perfect and crude computations, one and a half years out of eight years is something closer to 20 per cent than three per cent. Can you explain how in fact there is almost a seven-fold increase rather than a pure or crude, if I can use the word, three per cent increase?

What this amendment does is talk about when the minister may declare that the network is built and fully operational. Whether is it is 2018 or 2020 I guess matters little. What it does highlight to the people of Australia is that the minister will have 9½ years to declare that the whole thing is fully operational. The minister may well get up and say, ‘That is the outside date; we could declare this in two year’s time’—well, you could, but if you had any thought that that might be the case, why are you extending this period by another 18 months with this amendment?

This just demonstrates to me that not even the minister—who I have to say has been consistently optimistic; nobody else knows why—believes that the whole network will eventually be declared to be built and fully operational. But even the minister is not prepared to put two bob on the fact that it will be built and fully operational before 2020 if you go by this amendment. It is has been like this from day one. The minister first said, ‘Look we can build this for $4.7 billion’—$4.7 billion! It is now—

To the people of Australia who might be listening to this: you have to pay that! Someone has to pay this $55 billion. The minister originally said it would be built quickly. Even when this bill was put down he said, ‘At the very latest it will be 30 June 2018, and everyone will have it.’ Now, with this amendment that the government is putting forward, we are extending it by another 18 months, to 31 December 2020. So not even the minister is confident that this is going to be built and fully operational any time before 31 December 2020.

I said to those involved in the OPEL contract, ‘Why didn’t you take them on?’ They said, ‘You know, you can’t fight with the government’—particularly one as focused as this one; I was going to say narrow minded, but I won’t—so they just rolled over. But had that gone through, everyone in Australia would have had that fast broadband network by today. By this amendment we are pushing back by another 18 months, to 31 December 2020, the time up until which the minister has the opportunity of declaring it built and fully operational.

But I suspect it is probably not a contribution that the minister could properly respond to. It is the fact of the matter; it is their legislation. They said it will not be finished until June 2018, but we are not even confident about that now, so we are going to blow it out to 31 December 2020. I think that is a very telling amendment by the government which just demonstrates clearly what this whole fiasco is about.

Could the minister please detail the numbers that he has used to justify the greenfields sites, adding to the three per cent to come up with an additional year and a half, so that I can help my homespun maths?

I see Senator Ludlum already with a wry smile on his face and a little shake of the head in my direction.

That is fine. I respect anybody who comes into this place who has a view and puts that view with passion based on their principles and philosophical belief, no matter how greatly I may differ from them in regard to that.

But unfortunately for Australians and for the operation of the telco industry in Australia and for Australian taxpayers in particular, these amendments that Senator Ludlum has so carefully helped to craft pretty much seem to make it almost impossible for the Commonwealth to ever sell the NBN. I know that that is something that Senator Ludlum will welcome and be grateful for, if that is the case, but the opposition does not welcome it. We do not think that through this bill we should be seeking to tie the hands of future governments. We do not think that it is reasonable to present a situation where, essentially, the NBN cannot be sold. In particular we have, as my colleagues highlighted in the debate on the previous amendment, this question around whether or not the NBN can be sold until it is complete. The question that remains over whether and what it is to say that the NBN is complete. We have a series of definitions that are attempted to be given here, but many people are not unreasonably sceptical of whether this project will ever reach a point at which it can be declared to be complete. It is a project that will take many, many years and there will be several different elections in that time—we hope, on our side of the fence, just one change of government in that time—and we will see many changes to government policy and many different approaches in years to come, yet we have this very prescriptive process put in place here. We do not think it is appropriate to tie the hands of future governments in this way. We think there is a chance that the future capital investment that NBN Co. will need may ultimately not be forthcoming and that the direction of this project, as is so often the case with this government, or with future governments, could change. So we seek to delete these provisions that tie the Commonwealth’s hands. We seek to eliminate the opportunity for the government hand-in-hand with the Greens and at the instigation of the Greens to try to make this very much a permanent government monopoly. We do not think that is the right thing for Australia, especially not for Australia’s taxpayers.

Of course, one of our qualms about this is that we have been calling for a Productivity Commission inquiry into the building of the NBN and calling for it consistently for a long, long period of time.

There are amendments that I will come to later to once again try to encourage that. But we do note the strange hypocrisy whereby the government and the Greens think it is reasonable to come into this process of debating these bills and say that in relation to terminating the NBN as a Commonwealth entity, in relation to privatising it, there is a good case at that point to have a Productivity Commission inquiry. Yet the government—and the Greens, whenever they have been given the opportunity to vote on this matter—have consistently argued that there not be a Productivity Commission inquiry into actually spending billions upon billions of taxpayer dollars building this thing. That is the question. It is very strange that the government would want to have a Productivity Commission inquiry at one end of this process but not have one at the other end.

That is not an unreasonable thing. That is what we would expect to ultimately happen in the many, many years ahead, potentially, if indeed we were to wait until this thing were complete. But there is no reason to leave these provisions, proscriptive as they are, in place—no reason at all, aside from the government’s desire to have a deal that stands in place with the Greens. This is a government desperately conceding a few points that will hamper future governments so that it can get its way today with the Greens. It is not acceptable, and that is why we seek to remove these various provisions and provide the amendments I have moved.

For the record’s sake, I will say that we will be opposing these coalition amendments. I think they are half-baked, counterproductive and remarkably cynical and are probably just to express a deeply felt intention not to learn anything at all from the privatisation of Telstra. Anyway, I quite look forward to resuming my remarks when the building is a bit more awake in the morning.
