        , and place on record its appreciation of his service to his country, and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.

       <p>
        Ted Kenna was a man who epitomised the values that Australians hold important. He was courageous yet modest, determined yet selfless; he was a mate and a team player. Those who knew him have spoken of how those qualities stayed with Ted Kenna throughout his life. The incident for which he won the Victoria Cross was only the most famous example.
       </p>
       <p>
        In May 1945, the Australian 6th Division was engaged in clearing the Japanese from their defensive position south of Wewak air base on the northern coast of Papua
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
         New Guinea
        </a>
        . The 2nd/4th Battalion, which included Ted Kenna, was ordered to clear the Japanese defenders away from the Wirui mission. The mission stood on a steep, 300-foot high grass-covered spur. By nightfall on 14 May the spur had been cleared but for machine gun bunkers on the north-west slopes. On the next morning the 2nd/4th moved against them. The Japanese resistance was fierce. Little progress had been made and several Australians had been hit. Private Kenna stood up and, at a range of only 50 yards, engaged one of the bunkers with a Bren light machine gun. Failing to subdue that bunker before emptying the magazine, he borrowed the rifle from a mate beside him, Private Rau, and silenced the enemy machine gun with four aimed shots. All the while, the Japanese machine-gunned him from very close range. Private Kenna then turned his reloaded Bren gun on to another bunker, about 70 yards further on, and silenced it. His courage and selfless actions enabled the position to be captured without further delay. Three weeks later, unfortunately, he was badly wounded in the face. Fortunately, in the hospital he was nursed by Marjorie Rushbury, who was to become his wife of more than 60 years. After the war he returned home to Hamilton, Victoria, where he was born and where he lived with Marjorie until they moved into a nursing home in Geelong. He worked at the local council and played for the local footy team. He was active in Army reunions and has led Melbourne’s annual Anzac Day march.
       </p>
       <p>
        With the passing of Ted Kenna VC we have lost one of the links to a part of our history, to a time when many, many Australian men, some very young, some not so young, set down the tools of their trade—in Ted Kenna’s case, it was a plumber’s wrench—and picked up rifles, becoming soldiers at the time of their country’s greatest need. They faced terrible dangers, appalling conditions and at times absolutely overwhelming odds. And they achieved remarkable things. At the end of it, those fortunate enough to survive came back to the towns and cities, the suburbs and farms of Australia and did their best to pick up the pieces of the lives they had set aside.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ted Kenna was one of the most recognised and famous of those men. But he told those who interviewed him over the years that he wore his VC not for himself but, in the words of his daughter Marlene Day, for every soldier—because, he said, everyone contributes to those sorts of things. That says a great deal about the kind of man Ted Kenna was. Recognised for his individual bravery for acting to defend his mates, he wore his medal on behalf of those mates. Journalists who interviewed him quickly learnt that Ted Kenna’s own choice for the action highlight of his life was, apparently, kicking the winning point for Hamilton in the last seconds of their 1947 footy grand final. We may beg to differ on that, and we probably do. Today, as we offer our deep sympathy to his family and our gratitude for his contribution, let us also remember that Ted Kenna VC was—as well as for a few short years an extraordinary soldier—for many years a husband, a father and a mate.

         I am pleased on behalf of the opposition to support the motion moved by Senator Faulkner and express our sincere condolences on the passing of Private

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">

         . We pay tribute to his service to our nation in the armed forces and his long and successful life. The fact is that he died just two days after his 90th birthday. As a senator whose father is a

         veteran who has just celebrated his 90th birthday, I am particularly pleased to be able to support this motion. I hope that my father lasts for a lot longer yet.
        </p>
        <p>
         As we know, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Cross" rel="nofollow">
          Victoria Cross
         </a>
         is awarded for extraordinary acts of valour and bravery. Ted was awarded the Victoria Cross for his gallant action in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
          New Guinea
         </a>
         in 1945 when he exposed himself to heavy fire, killing a Japanese machine-gun crew and facilitating the success of his company’s attack and capture of an enemy bunker. The citation for his VC is interesting. It states:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The result of Private Kenna’s magnificent bravery in the face of concentrated fire, was that the bunker was captured without further loss, and the company attack proceeded to a successful conclusion, many enemy being killed and numerous automatic weapons captured.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         There is no doubt that the success of the company attack would have been seriously endangered and many casualties sustained but for Private Kenna’s magnificent courage and complete disregard for his own safety. His action was an outstanding example of the highest degree of bravery.
        </p>
        <p>
         He was a very deserved recipient of the VC.
        </p>
        <p>
         He had, as Senator Faulkner noted, enlisted with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIF" rel="nofollow">

         in 1940. He was discharged in 1946 after his period in hospital where, as it was noted, he met his wife, Marjorie, whom he married in 1947. He was always described as very modest about his VC. His daughter Marlene said that he was proud to wear it but, ‘He wears it for every solider, because he says everyone contributes to these sorts of things.’

         Indeed, one of the remarkable characteristics of Australia’s World War II veterans—who regrettably now are much diminished in number—is their innate humility about the remarkable service that they gave our country.
        </p>
        <p>
         Being awarded a VC is an extraordinary honour. It is very sad to lose the last, but it is great to have this opportunity to pay great tribute to Ted Kenna for his contribution to our nation. We offer our sincere condolences to his wife of 62 years, Marjorie, and their children and their families upon his passing.

          I concur with the remarks of Senator Faulkner and Senator Minchin. There is nothing more that can be added to what was said by those two gentlemen. I hope that the family of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Kenna" rel="nofollow">
           Ted Kenna
          </a>
          gets some comfort from those words. The attributes that some people show on the battlefield are remarkable. But sometimes what is even more remarkable is that they come home to live an ordinary life and to love life as an ordinary person. ‘For Valour’ is the inscription that is on the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Cross" rel="nofollow">
           Victoria Cross
          </a>
          . Obviously, Ted proved that without any question. The engagement in Papua
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
           New Guinea
          </a>
          saved Australians from having their homes and hearths occupied by the enemy forces. Those who fought there were a remarkable group of people. As Ted said, he wore his

           VC
          </a>
          for all those who were part of the action that saved our nation from succumbing to the enemy. We recognise that at this time of his passing. We will never forget the sacrifice that was offered by Ted and which was paid by so many others. Because of their sacrifices we have the benefit of sitting in this chamber today.

            back in 1945 did not go unnoticed. We are all the richer for that not going unnoticed. He was a Victorian resident. Our sympathies are with his wife. Three weeks after his act of bravery, he was injured. It is interesting to note that Private Ted Kenna met his wife in hospital, where she nursed him. They were married for more than 60 years. He was born in Hamilton, Victoria, and made his family home there. Recently, he was at a nursing home in Geelong, Victoria, with his wife.
