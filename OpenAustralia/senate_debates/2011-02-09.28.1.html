            I will ignore the interjections from the opposition. What action has the government taken to stop the depredations of the thugs representing the Egyptian government, who are currently torturing people who protested peacefully for democracy and who have illegally arrested members of the Western media, including Australian journalists?

             I thank Senator Brown for his question. The government is continuing to monitor the situation closely. The situation is calmer but remains uncertain. Our priority remains the wellbeing of Australians. We remain deeply concerned by intimidation of journalists and opposition activists. We deplore the loss of life. We welcome efforts of the army to protect peaceful protestors from violent attacks and intimidation. Mr Rudd has spoken to the Egyptian foreign minister about the need for political reform and for the process to begin, and he has informed him that the attacks on protestors and journalists were unacceptable. Egypt has been the focus of Mr Rudd’s discussions with world leaders, including Mr Netanyahu and Mr Blair. We are concerned about the stability of Egypt, as it is vital to the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
              Middle East
             </a>
             region.
            </p>
            <p>
             Who leads Egypt must be for the Egyptian people to decide. The Australian government urges a quick and orderly transition involving broad representation of opposition groups to address the demands of Egyptians for political, social and economic reform. Australia has long supported democratic transformation in the Middle East and other parts of the world.
            </p>
            <p>
             In terms of your question on some of the allegations about some activities of the services in Egypt, we are aware of some allegations. It is not appropriate for us to speculate on the operations of another country’s intelligence service in this setting. We note that Vice-President Suleiman is well known in the region and to foreign leaders for his role in the Middle East peace process. Ultimately, as I have said already, who leads Egypt must be for the Egyptian people to decide.

              , I ask a supplementary question. Has the government gone beyond being ‘deeply concerned’? Has it considered calling in the ambassador for Egypt over the illegal and unwarranted arrest of Australian citizens, including journalists, in Cairo? Secondly, on that reference to Vice-President Suleiman: is the government aware of his reputation as a torturer and a murderer?

               As I mentioned, Mr Rudd has spoken directly to the Egyptian foreign minister—on 28 January, on 3 February and on 8 February. So he has actually spoken directly to the foreign minister on the matters that you have raised to express our deep concern about the intimidation of journalists and opposition activists.

                    I am just trying to copy you, Senator Brandis! On 13 February 2005 the Australian government asked the Egyptian government to investigate

                    ’s claims of mistreatment while in detention in Egypt. Egyptian authorities advise that no evidence was found about Mr Habib’s alleged detention and torture in Egypt.

                     , I ask a further supplementary question. It is known by the government that Mr Habib was detained in Egypt. Has any member of the government or its intelligence services met Mr Suleiman? Were they involved in the detention and torture of Mr Habib in Egypt?

                      As I mentioned, the government did request the Egyptian government to investigate claims of mistreatment. And, as I said, Egyptian authorities advised that no evidence was found about Mr Habib’s alleged detention and torture in Egypt. On the specific matters you have just raised, I will seek some further information from the foreign minister. If there is any further information that can assist with the answer, we will provide it.
