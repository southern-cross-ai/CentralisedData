        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. Earlier today, you voted to agree that the slogan 'From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free' opposes Israel's right to exist, is a call for the abolition of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Israel" rel="nofollow">
         State of Israel
        </a>
        and is frequently used by those who seek to intimidate
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Australians" rel="nofollow">
         Jewish Australians
        </a>
        via acts of antisemitism.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tragically, this phrase is increasingly being used in Australia and elsewhere as part of an unprecedented wave of antisemitism. The Prime Minster has agreed that this is a very violent statement and that it doesn't have a place in our political debate. However, yesterday, Senator Payman, a Labor senator, proudly repeated this very phrase in front of assembled media. Has the Prime Minister now spoken with Senator Payman about her use of the phrase and asked, or demanded, that she retract it? What apology and other action has he demanded of her?

         I acknowledge the question from Senator Cash. She would have heard me, in my contribution on that motion, provide an answer to the topics that she is raising. The point I have made is that this is a government that does represent the community more completely than any government in Australia's history. It is a government that does have members and senators from a wide range of faiths, perspectives and cultural heritages.

               Order! Minister Wong, please resume your seat. Just as I asked for silence when Senator Birmingham moved the motion earlier in the day, I'm going to ask for silence once again. Senator Cash, you've asked your question. The minister is on her feet. There needs to be silence.

                I said earlier today, and I stand by it, all of us need to be peacemakers. We understand what has occurred and what is occurring from the abhorrent attack by Hamas—a terrorist organisation—to the humanitarian catastrophe that is incurring in Gaza and the loss of life. We mourn all lives, all innocent lives. I laid out in detail, in our response, our policy position, including in relation to that phrase, and I would refer the senator to it. She knows it.

               <p>
                I ask the Senate to consider whether using this, and these issues, for political division is the responsible thing to do. What you saw you saw today in response, by the collective that is the Labor Party, was a position that sought to be clear about our policy position but also to lead by example—

                                I will go back to the beginning. It does say something about the motivation of those opposite that, after the government senators have voted for a motion which makes clear our position on that phrase, they seek to make political division about it. It says something about their motivation.

                                  I raise a point of order. The Prime Minister, in the other place, has twice today been asked whether he has intervened in this matter. The Minister representing the Prime Minister in this place has now thrice been asked whether he has acted on this matter. I ask that the minister respond directly to the specific question asked by Senator Cash, which could not have been worded more precisely, about whether or not the Prime Minister has spoken with Senator Payman.

What I have just seen is intimidation, bullying and harassment of a high order. If you're going to come into this place and do it, you should be called out and thrown out.
