        Tonight I rise to speak about how the Tasmanian government has navigated the coronavirus pandemic firmly and compassionately over the past six months. This steady leadership has ensured my home state and its residents have remained safe. Tasmania is an island state, which has afforded us a level of protection not enjoyed by our mainland cousins. However, this protection has not been taken for granted. Premier
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Gutwein" rel="nofollow">
         Peter Gutwein
        </a>
        has put the health of the state's residents first throughout this pandemic, while also being mindful of the huge impact the pandemic has had at an economic and social level.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tasmania was the first to ban cruise ships and enforce strict borders controls to protect the state. At the time, Premier Gutwein said if we went hard and went early we stood a better chance of getting on top of coronavirus and returning to our way of life sooner. During the COVID-19 outbreak in the state's north-west, which has been traced back to the

        cruise ship, Tasmania was quick to ask for federal assistance. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        team arrived swiftly and, within a short time, the outbreak was under control. Since that point, our COVID-19 cases have been low and we have no active cases at the moment.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to the extensive supports provided by the Australian government during this pandemic, the Tasmanian government has also committed significantly, with a package worth more than $1 billion. Tasmanians have been buoyed by this. At more than three per cent of our gross state product, it is the largest state or territory support or stimulus package in the country in proportion to the size of our economy. These measures have included: freezing, waiving or capping fees and charges for businesses, like water and electricity bills; payroll tax waivers for the hospitality and tourism industries; $80 million in business grants; and targeted loans. Key sectors like construction and tourism have been and will continue to be stimulated, because these industries hold the key to the state's economic recovery.
       </p>
       <p>
        Then there was the state's vital support for temporary visa holders and those who are homeless, plus extra funding for community organisations helping vulnerable Tasmanians. This funding has helped those organisations to address important social issues like child safety and wellbeing and addressing family violence. Millions of dollars have been allocated to mental health support services and continuing the state's health preparedness and response. The local government sector has also been supported, with up to $200 million in interest-free loans so that our councils, in turn, can help their communities rebuild and recover. And it's working.
       </p>
       <p>
        While the state has been hit significantly in economic terms, the impact has not been as severe as first forecast. The most recent CommSec report found Tasmania had the strongest economy in the country and the census report showed our businesses are still the most confident in the nation. ABS labour force data shows job growth has returned, with more than 7,000 Tasmanians returning to work in July. And, at six per cent, the state's unemployment rate is much lower than anticipated at the beginning of this crisis.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tasmanians have a very strong community spirit. We are unashamedly Tasmanian first. We have pride in our state, and that attitude has stood us in good stead as we navigate this pandemic. When Tasmania was locked down, we shared resources with our neighbours and reaffirmed our commitment to community. We did all we could to support locals. Instead of going out to our favourite restaurants, we started buying takeaway meals from those restaurants instead. Our grocers and butchers saw an uptick in trade as local produce became even more important. Once we could travel outside our immediate regions, we started moving around the state, supporting local traders, tourism operators and accommodation providers along the way, and we will continue to do this.
       </p>
       <p>
        The combination of coordinated health and economic stimulus has supported Tasmania to stay safe in its bid to suppress COVID-19 and weather this storm so far. However, there are still more hurdles to jump. The threat of community transmission of this deadly virus is never far away. We are now approaching spring and summer, which are traditionally busy times in Tasmania, especially for our agriculture, tourism and hospitality industries. These industries are learning to operate in a new normal, as are their customers. This is when we will rally to stay safe.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are, by no means, at the end of this chapter in our state's history, but we are working hard to make the best of what is an extremely difficult situation. Strong leadership by our state government, in support of our Health and Treasury departments, has put us in a good position to continue through this pandemic. I would particularly like to acknowledge Tasmanian Premier Peter Gutwein and the health, small business and hospitality minister, the Hon. Sarah Courtney, and thank them for their outstanding leadership.
