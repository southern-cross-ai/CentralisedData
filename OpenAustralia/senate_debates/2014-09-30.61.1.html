         I will take the detail of that question on notice—what the position is—keeping in mind that Australia is not in full control of the G20. The G20 is a group of countries that have come together to pursue certain economic and other issues and therefore if Australia were to unilaterally determine one way or the other who or who may not be welcome I could imagine that there could be potential consequences for the general viability of the G20. Having said that, I will take the detail of the question on notice to ascertain whether there is more material that I might be able to advance for the benefit of the senator.

           President Putin
          </a>

           One would have thought that somebody who, one would imagine, is experienced in matters governmental and in foreign affairs would realise that, from time to time—and I do not know whether this report is correct or not—you might entertain certain hopes but still know that the answer is not necessarily completely up to you. You do need to talk and liaise with the other members of the G20 to determine what an appropriate course of action is. As I said in answer to the previous question, if there is any further detail that the Prime Minister would seek to add to that which I have offered, I will present that to the chamber.
