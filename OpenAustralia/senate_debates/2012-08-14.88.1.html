         Mr President
        </a>
        , I seek leave to make a short statement.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        Senator Carr's disclosure to the Register of Senators' Interests shows that he has retained his shareholding in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RJ" rel="nofollow">
         RJ
        </a>
        Carr Pty Ltd, the private company he used as a lobbying company. Prime Minister Gillard's standards of ministerial ethics say that ministers must divest themselves of an interest in any private company or business. Whether or not this is an appropriate standard is not a matter for consideration; it is a test set for the Prime Minister. When challenged by Senator Abetz and me at Senate estimates in May, Senator Carr insisted that the issue of his retention of the shareholding was absurd and simply a bit of paperwork. I lodged a motion with the Senate and was in discussion with a member of the Greens regarding that motion when—coincidentally, the same day—Senator Carr came into the Senate and asserted that he had been advised that there was no conflict of interest in the retention of his share.
       </p>
       <p>
        This motion simply calls for the tabling of the advice that Minister Carr has relied upon; it does not go to the substance of it. I put to those opposite, and particularly to Senator Rhiannon, who has expressed concern about the revolving door between business and lobbyists, that this Senate has a right to such advice.
