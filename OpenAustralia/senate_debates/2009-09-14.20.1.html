        My question is to the Minister for Employment Participation representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Senator Arbib. Can the minister inform the Senate of the impact that Australian workplace agreements have had on Australian workers? In particular, could the minister detail how
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWA" rel="nofollow">

          I thank Senator Lundy for the question and her longstanding interest in protecting jobs and employment conditions. We have seen over the last couple of months the work that is going on between the government and employers to protect workers in the workforce. The move to part-time labour is made possible by a workplace relations system that the government has introduced, striking the right balance between fairness and flexibility. But over the weekend the veil has slipped from the Liberal Party and at last their true intentions have once again emerged. Mr Turnbull told the Australian people that
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_Choices" rel="nofollow">

                        , I ask a final supplementary question. Can the minister further elaborate on the sources of support for such fundamental changes that threaten jobs and entitlements? Can the minister inform the Senate of why such radical changes are being proposed at the height of the global recession?

                         I can tell you why Mr Turnbull is trying to introduce them now—because he is out of touch. He is completely out of touch with working Australians.

                            Just to show how out of touch the Liberal Party is I will read what Mr Keenan, the shadow minister, said this morning when he was on Sky News. Kieran Gilbert said to him:
                           </p>
                           <p class="italic">
                            I suppose people would want to know though in this time of economic uncertainty would the coalition’s safety net include, for example, a guarantee on redundancy pay. Would you provide a guarantee for that?
                           </p>
                           <p>

                            Look, I think people absolutely have a right to know the sorts of things that we will be proposing, but we will release our policy in the leadup to the next election.
                           </p>

                           <p class="italic">
                            So you can’t guarantee something like redundancy …
