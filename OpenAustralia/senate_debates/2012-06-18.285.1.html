         The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1)   ASNO has provided advice to the Prime Minister and the then Minister for Foreign Affairs in relation to requirements to be included in a possible bilateral nuclear cooperation agreement with India. Following the

        <p class="italic">
         Before proceeding with any negotiations of a bilateral nuclear cooperation agreement for the supply of Australian uranium there needs to be a clear signal from the Government of the proposed recipient country or the Australian uranium industry.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (12)   Discussions on a possible agreement to amend (or supplement) Annex D of the Australia/China nuclear transfers agreement commenced in 2009 to provide that uranium extracted from copper concentrates supplied by Australia to China would be subject to the relevant provisions of the Australia/China nuclear transfers agreement. These discussions were held in Beijing in January 2009. No further discussions have been held since.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Accounting arrangements would need to be developed under the amended Australia/China agreement to provide assurances that any uranium extracted would become subject to the Agreement in the same way as uranium directly exported to China.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         All of Australia's bilateral nuclear safeguards agreements require Australian uranium be protected to international standards of nuclear security, and this would likewise apply to any uranium extracted from copper concentrates.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Any amendment of the Australia/China agreement to cover extraction of uranium from ores and concentrates would be subject to review by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties.
