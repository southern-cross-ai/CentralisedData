         Minister, before we were rudely interrupted by the adjournment debate last night, I was trying to ask you a question about decision reasoning and the publishing of decisions. You'll, of course, be aware that often decisions are published in respect of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAT" rel="nofollow">
          AAT
         </a>
         and the courts so that people in the community can understand what the rules are, how the law works and the operation of the bill in this instance. If there are never any reasons made available for people to look at to understand why something was rejected, how is it that the government will inform the public and entities that are subject to this bill of, basically, the mood of the government and how to avoid getting into a situation where an agreement is entered into that ultimately gets overturned or where they start to walk down a path for an agreement which then later has the minister intervening?

          Senator Patrick, I think we were discussing this yesterday. Obviously, in relation to the processes which will exist under the bill, the engagement of the task force with entities, state and territory governments, local governments and universities will be very much part of that process. As I alluded to yesterday—and I haven't quite put my hand on the note that I was using yesterday—it's similar to the provisions under the FIRB, which are also sensitive decisions and are provisions which have a similar application as these. We will be engaging comprehensively with those stakeholders, with those entities, on these matters. I think once the stocktake process is underway, and we have the chance to go through the arrangements and work with entities about the nature of those arrangements, I do think this will fall into a sort of rhythm, if you like, in terms of awareness and understanding of what the implications are in relation to foreign policy and foreign relations.
         </p>
         <p>
          One thing I would like to absolutely assure the chamber of is that this is in no way intended to be a confrontational engagement or a confrontational relationship between the Commonwealth government and state and territory and local governments and universities under this bill. This is meant to be and will be, I'm absolutely confident, a constructive set of relationships that will assist us all in coming to a collaborative approach on foreign policy and reflecting the Commonwealth's particular role in that regard.

          <p>
           I want to follow up in respect of the discussion we were having yesterday about the sensitivity of these reasons, and I do understand the minister's concerns. In relation to a decision that related to a state government—and I asked this question in ignorance of how Commonwealth-state relations work at a ministerial level—does the dialogue between states and the Commonwealth permit the disclosure of those perhaps sensitive reasons to the states so that they are assisted as they may seek to establish future agreements with overseas entities?

            As part of the dialogue, that's an important part of the approach. The decisions themselves will obviously be contained in the public register as part of this process. That's formalised. That will provide a picture of arrangements that are inconsistent with foreign policy and foreign relations, and there will be a significant amount of consultation during the process between the entities and the Commonwealth government in the form of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" rel="nofollow">
             Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
            </a>
            task force.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are also the matters in section 51, which I alluded to yesterday, which are the matters that the minister is required to take into account. It gives some quite explicit guidance to the states and territories in relation to these matters and to the Commonwealth, frankly, in terms of what has to be taken into account by the minister.
           </p>
           <p>
            On sensitivity, obviously decisions will be based on a range of inputs—the foreign minister's input—as is explicitly referred to in the bill, but also on classified issues, cabinet-in-confidence issues and a range of others. I do think, for the reasons that I set out yesterday and for the reasons that apply in the context of the FIRB similarly, that the way the bill has cast this, in terms of not providing reasons, is one that the government believes is appropriate.

             I have a question in relation to delegations of decisions under the bill. Can you clarify whether the decisions are made exclusively by the minister or whether they are delegated, and, if they are to be delegated, to what level, perhaps matching those with the nature of the decisions that might be made?

                Section 56 of the bill goes to the question of delegation. The delegations are limited to the secretary of the department or a person who holds or performs the duties of an

                in the department, but the minister is not able to delegate any of the minister's powers or functions under the parts of the bill which deal with negotiating and entering core foreign relations; or, in relation to part 4, a core foreign arrangement; or section 54, which is part of the legislation which deals with making the rules. A delegate, in exercising any powers or performing any functions under the delegations, must comply with any directions of the minister. That's section 56 of the legislation, which is very clear about the delegations.

                 I rise to put on the public record my concerns about not only the substance of this but this minister's failure to engage with us constructively. We are of the view that it's a pretty reasonable proposition when a minister is exercising this level of power—and it is a substantial power. Let's recall that this could enable whoever is there, perhaps this minister or possibly
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Dutton" rel="nofollow">
                  Peter Dutton
                 </a>
                 —goodness me, imagine the power in his hands!—to just choose to exercise the power to stop Premier McGowan's agreements with some international entity. Obviously the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRI" rel="nofollow">
                  BRI
                 </a>
                 is in their sights—the Victorian one. There are some agreements

                 has with sister city arrangements. Whoever is in that seat, whether it's
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marise_Payne" rel="nofollow">
                  Marise Payne
                 </a>
                 or Peter Dutton, could do so without giving the government notice and could make a decision without even writing down the reason for it. That's the kind of authoritarian power she's defending.
                </p>
                <p>
                 And I know Senator Payne doesn't like to pick up the phone, but there's an incredible amount of passivity associated with dealing with this legislation. Every day of consultation by this minister, which had been non-existent, was after the bill had been announced. I mean, really: that's not consultation. I think there's some suggestion that it's a privileged position to actually talk to people, but I just think it's good legislating. If you're going to introduce a power that gives you the discretion to veto agreements across subnational entities and universities, what's the problem with actually talking to people in order to work through how that might best work? That's called good government. But no, she didn't pick up the phone and didn't meet with them. We saw that on Qatar, too. Even with the engagement on foreign policy and the exchange with Senator Rice, I think it was, about why foreign policy isn't defined—and I actually understand the argument there—the minister's department has admitted that engagement with the affected entities on government foreign policy is ad hoc.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I indicated broad support for this legislation on the day it was announced, subject to constitutional remit and subject to looking at the detail. We hear from the minister's office and we want to be bipartisan. We send them our amendments—radio silence; not even the courtesy of a call. On this legislation, at this time, I would have thought they'd want some bipartisanship. During this time that we're going through—we saw what happened yesterday and the day before; we understand what Australia is dealing with—why not try to land an agreement? But no: just silence, and she just comes down here and airily dismisses it. Frankly, I think it's pretty poor form, and I'm putting that on the public record. It's deeply disappointing.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Nothing the minister has said on these issues around the accountability of the executive for this decision makes sense. Her arguments to Senator Patrick yesterday and today really don't hold up. I again put on record our willingness to consider an alternative proposition to deal with some of the issues the minister has raised, even though I believe that those issues are dealt with in the amendments we've proposed. But, again: radio silence. I can't work out whether it's just passivity or, frankly, arrogance—because I do think it's a pretty arrogant position to say the federal government is not accountable for the decisions it makes. So, I hope the Western Australians will have a think—whichever minister is there, whether it be Peter Dutton or someone like that—about which of Mark McGowan's propositions might be vetoed without reasonable notice.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I was hopeful we could actually have a sensible bipartisan discussion on this bill, but it appears this minister is unwilling or uninterested in doing so, and I express my disappointment, particularly at this time. I was going to move to other topics, but perhaps the Greens or Senator Patrick have further issues before I do so.

                 <p>
                  I want to conclude some of this discussion about the concerns we have about the lack of a collaborative approach and the lack of accountability. Minister, you've talked about how this isn't meant to be adversarial, that it's collaborative—that it's about people working together. But that hasn't been the experience so far in terms of consultation and working with a whole range of stakeholders before this legislation was introduced. I want to put on the record that Australia's interests are, obviously, incredibly important and the issue of foreign interference is incredibly important. I think everybody around this chamber recognises the measures to ensure that there isn't foreign interference—that is, that we are not entering into relationships that are not in our interests or not in the interests of human rights or not in the interests of good order in the world. It's important that we do have legislation that enables us to deal with those.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I also agree with the premise of the legislation. I think that it's important that there is a collaborative and cooperative approach between the states and the Commonwealth in terms of our international relations. A situation like the Victorian government deciding that it was going to go and enter into the Belt and Road Initiative with China without engaging the Commonwealth is not a situation that is in the good interests of Australia. That's playing off different parts of the Commonwealth and different states against each other. That collaborative approach is clearly essential, but we can see that that collaborative approach, and that reporting back and accountability, which goes hand in hand with that collaborative approach—is not baked into this bill. Minister, you talk about the fact that they can happen but that doesn't mean that they will happen. Unless you actually have them there in the legislation to ensure they will happen, it is very possible that—maybe not under you as minister, Minister Payne, but under future ministers—these things won't happen. The powers that are vested in the foreign minister to take a complete over-the-top, non-collaborative approach are there in the bill. They are there. They are enabled.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Going to the collaborative approach, we know there was no consultation with the states and territories before this legislation was introduced. What discussions have been had with all of the states and territories since the introduction of the bill? We know that not all of the states and territories took the opportunity to put in submissions to the inquiry and those that did were largely not supportive of the bill. Minister, could you please go through the negotiations and the discussions that you have had with all of the states and territories since the legislation was introduced?

                  <p>
                   Senator Rice, thank you for those observations. Let me say that in this place there are a range of ways in which legislation is brought to the parliament in either chamber—a range of ways. Government selects, according to the nature of the legislation and the approach government wants to take, how they do that. In some cases there will be large public exposure draft processes and in some cases there will not, but that is a matter which is for government. The approach that the government has taken in this context is obviously the one that is before us.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Following the introduction of the bill, as I indicated in the chamber yesterday, there were, I think, 60 consultations through the

                    Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
                   </a>
                   . Prior to the committee hearings, I understand that the office of the

                   </a>
                   was briefed on the bill as part of that process. I would have to say to the chamber that I think this government is actually very constructive with briefing engagement with the opposition in a way, in fact, that I did not experience in my time as a shadow minister in this place—not even close. I do think we try to be constructive and, indeed, very forthcoming with briefings as they are requested by senators, including yourself.

                   On 28 September we met with the University Foreign Interference Taskforce steering group, the UFIT steering group. That meeting included the UFIT,

That meeting included the executive of UA and also the University of Queensland. On 1 October we met with the Innovative Research Universities group again. The group on that occasion—I'm just trying to see if there is a difference between the universities that were included on that occasion and the 17 September group, but I don't think that there is—was the same group that met on 17 September.

They have included: the draft rules, which, as you know, have been loaded onto DFAT's website; the information that is to be included in notices; the nature and form of the public register and what that will include; and exemption arrangements as part of those discussions.

                      I will be very brief. I just want to make the observation that we have been debating this bill since Monday night. We are still in the committee stage, but we are yet to consider a single amendment. There have been a number of questions asked by senators on the same topic over and over again. It appears, to me, that it might be that the chamber is trying to delay the passage of this bill, which I think would be very unfortunate given the bipartisan support for this bill and particularly considering the events of this week. I hope the Senate can quickly move on to the substantive matters and the amendments that senators wish to move.

                       Senator Paterson, I completely reject what you were just saying. There are a lot of very important questions to be asked about this legislation. What I wanted to ask, finally, on those consultations, Minister, is this. You said documentation of those consultations isn't on the public record. I ask if you could please take on notice to provide the documentation of those consultations for us.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       I have one further question in terms of those consultations. In terms of the rules and guidelines that have been laid out, I'm interested to know what discussions there have been with the states and territories or local governments about the arrangements with particular countries where the understanding will be that, yes, those arrangements will certainly need to be particularly scrutinised. Or is there a group of arrangements with particular countries that are ruled out, essentially because there is no worry, and so there isn't going to be considerable scrutiny of those countries. If so, has there been an articulation of which countries fall within those two buckets?

                        Obviously, we respect the confidence of the stakeholders who have been engaging with us but we have addressed every issue that they have raised. The public positions which are of interest to them can obviously be ascertained through their submissions to the committee process and from the public comments that they have made, but I do respect their confidence in the consultations.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        In relation to countries, let me be very clear: this bill is not directed at any single country, or any single arrangement for that matter. As I said yesterday, and as I said publicly when the bill was announced by the Prime Minister some time ago now, an open-source review of state and territory arrangements with foreign countries provided a tally of over 130 different arrangements with more than 30 countries which literally spanned the globe, and the alphabet actually, in terms of their breadth. There will be many countries which have been discussed in consultations with officials. But until the stocktake process is underway and is in motion, as it were, as part of the implementation of the bill, should it pass, it's difficult to identify if there's a specific sort of arrangement, or a specific issue, or a specific country which will come to the fore in this. Most importantly, though, to bring it back to the principles behind the bill in relation to foreign policy and foreign relations: we come back to that position where the Commonwealth is the part-lead voice on these matters. Australia's approach is a consistent and joined-up one, and I do think that that is a very important purpose of the bill.

There must be some documentation that you can share with the Senate that is de-identified and doesn't risk the privilege and the privacy of the stakeholder. There must be an overall summary of the documentation of the consultations that you are able to share with us relating to the issues that were raised in various consultations, and which summarises those issues and concerns.

                           I refer to the list that the minister read out. Can she confirm that all of the consultations she listed occurred after the bill was finalised? Can she also confirm that she continues to refuse to take on board amendments that take into account the concerns of affected entities? Finally, can the minister advise how many conversations, or discussions or consultations she has had with premiers, chief ministers, vice chancellors or chancellors?

                             She's answering a different question, and that simply would be time wasting. I'm happy to go through them again. I asked her a very direct question. Firstly, can she confirm that she is refusing to take on amendments which go to the concerns raised by affected entities? Secondly, can she tell us who she has spoken to? Which premiers, chief ministers, vice-chancellors or chancellors has this minister consulted with in relation to this bill?

                              In relation to amendments, obviously we have made amendments to the bill. We've taken account of a number of suggestions, and we've amended the bill ourselves in the House of Representatives. We have placed rules on the public record, as we indicated that we would. Those rules respond to concerns raised by stakeholders, and there is the opportunity under the bill for there to be future rules as well.

                                    No, Senator; I don't think there is actually a date as such. The drafting process always envisaged the incorporation of universities in the bill. That was an ongoing process up until the announcement and tabling of the legislation in the House of Representatives. That drafting process is something that, as you well know, is a very consultative process between agencies, parliamentary council and ministers, and the bill in its final form is as it stands.

                                     It's the process that dare not speak its name, isn't it? The universities didn't know about it until the bill got dropped. I know Senator Paterson said why should they be privileged? I just think it's not a bad thing, when they're involved in the foreign interference task force process, to actually let them know. You might get a better outcome. Anyway, let's just be really clear: the minister and her department have been asked this regularly, including at Senate estimates, and they refuse to answer, which can only lead to one conclusion—they were a last-minute inclusion in the bill.

                                         I don't think someone like you should tell me about being patronising, Senator Payne. My point is: they know and you won't tell us, and I don't understand why not. Actually, I do: you don't want to tell us because it was a late edition. Can the minister explain the regulatory gap between public and private universities? Why aren't private universities subject to the same requirements?

Accordingly, the way the bill is presented reflects our focus on ensuring consistency in Australian foreign policy and foreign relations across all levels of Australian government.

If we're serious that the federal government should have—and I agree with this proposition; I think it's unremarkable—the primary responsibility for Australia's foreign policy and external relations, surely, as a matter of policy, you would include private universities? On this, we've had a whole range of evidence put before the Senate committee, in the public arena and through the intelligence committee inquiry about the actions of universities. Is there a constitutional reason why private universities are not included, or is it just the privileging of

                                              I think that imputation is completely incorrect. It's not about privileging any private university entity. This is about public entities. It's about public universities being covered because they are state and territory entities established by law, because the

                                              is a Commonwealth university established under Commonwealth law and therefore also a public university. Given that the bill is about addressing foreign engagement by state and territory governments and government entities and that private universities are not government entities, they are not within the scope of the bill.

                                               might enter into agreement with a foreign government that she has a concern with? This is a bill that goes to the local shire council. The bill includes your capacity to strike down agreements of much smaller entities than a private university. Is the minister really saying that there's no possibility that an entity such as Bond or another private university could enter into an agreement which was inconsistent with Australia's foreign policy?

They are established by law as state and territory entities. While, obviously, the

The whole point of the legislation is about addressing foreign engagement by state and territory governments and government entities. Entities which are not government entities are not within the scope of the bill.

                                                 The bill covers local government. If we think about some local shire council in the Australian democracy, you could strike an agreement of theirs down but you think it's not relevant for a significant university to come within the remit of the bill. You can answer on process but there's a policy point: there's a regulatory gap which you've put in place and which you haven't justified other than in a sort of process-process answer.

My recollection is—and I'm sure the minister will correct me if I'm wrong—that all universities, including private universities, are part of the foreign interference task force process. Why was that decision made to exclude private universities from the remit of this bill? That's a policy question. Secondly, you haven't come back to me on this: can you just confirm that there is no constitutional reason that private universities should be excluded?

But this bill is directed to government entities and to state and territory local governments. That is the very specific and clear scope of the bill and, therefore, private universities are not covered.

My point is that, if it were all universities and you chose to bypass that process because you wanted this bill, then there is no constitutional reason as to why they're being excluded. Under this regime, then, foreign interference in private universities remains open, potentially, because you're excluding them from the legislation.

Foreign interference is covered by the University Foreign Interference Taskforce, of which those universities are members, along with a range of other bodies, and those issues are addressed in that context. This bill, which I think is—to use a word you use—unremarkable, is related to government entities and state, territory and local governments. Private universities, self-evidently, are not government entities and are not state, territory or local governments.

                                                              Minister, I raised the same point that Senator Wong has raised about private universities. It was stated to me that it is to do with the states and territories, and I understand that. My suggestion, then, to the advisers would be: why shouldn't we write to the private universities and ask them to be part of it on a voluntary basis? I think that was going to be put to the department. Is it a consideration that, because it could be unconstitutional to include them in it, possibly it could be a matter of writing to the private universities to ask them to be a part of it voluntarily?

That is in part the purpose of doing the three-year review and why we made that amendment. As I said to Senator Wong—I'm not sure if you'd come into the chamber at that point—there are many avenues for engagement of private universities on these important and sensitive issues. We encourage them to engage. But, in terms of the issue you have raised, that is certainly something that can be considered in that way.

Senator Wong has an amendment to the bill that would require a report from the government to be laid on the table. I'm a bit mystified as to why you would put up an amendment to the bill regarding a report to be laid on the table with regard to the bill, when this could have been done through a notice of motion. I am terribly concerned about the way the Port of Darwin was leased. My question for the government is: can the leasing of the Port of Darwin be reversed, under this bill or any other legislation by the government, so that the port ends up back in the hands of the Australian people, not foreign owned?

That is a change since that transaction was made. That provision of the Foreign Investment Review Board goes to precisely the point that you make.

That means we now have a critical infrastructure asset register to ensure that government knows who owns and operates our most critical assets.

But since 2016, through all of those steps, we have put in place protections and provisions which ensure that, should such a transaction come to the point of being made again, all of those steps that I have just gone through are now in place to address that and the concerns you have raised.

Can you guarantee the Australian people that, even under that scheme, everything China wants to buy up in Australia will come under the national interest test so they can't just come in and buy it up without it going through FIRB, without it being fully investigated and without it being in the best interests of Australia?

I would first make the point that the reason we have done it as an amendment rather than a motion is that the government can ignore a motion but it can't ignore a piece of law. That is the logic of it. You have raised that with me, and I think that is a consistent position. Why don't we do it as a notice of motion? The reality is that the minister can just ignore a notice of motion whereas you can't ignore the law—one hopes! Secondly, I don't recall the minister ever having said before what she is now saying, which is that the government is not in a position to reverse the lease on the Port of Darwin.

No, I'm not pushing back on it; everyone has hedged it when we have asked it; everyone else has ducked that question. I would like to understand why. This legislation is in effect retrospective—that is, you can veto, under this legislation, deals which were previously made. I think that's pretty clear. Obviously, the Port of Darwin is such a deal. It may be that because the Port of Darwin arrangement is with an ostensibly private entity it is outside of the bill. If that's the case, I would like to understand that. These are the issues that we traversed in the Senate committee. I don't think they were clarified. It would be useful to clarify it here.

Arrangements of that nature may only be within the scheme's scope if they are subsidiary to a core or non-core arrangement between the state or territory government and a foreign government or a foreign government entity. That's irrespective of whether the corporation is wholly or partly state owned or privately owned. Arrangements by state or territory locally owned corporations such as water corporations or port authorities are not the focus of the legislation. My understanding is that those sorts of transactions, those sorts of commercial arrangements, are best situated within the context of FIRB arrangements rather than this bill.

Second point: the Port of Darwin would not be within the remit of the legislation, because your advice is that it is with private entity. Third point: given the arrangements within China around the role of government and its engagement in the economy, does that change your view about whether or not the government could consider this lease to this private entity? Is that clear? It doesn't have a market economy. I know the Howard government said it did have a market economy. Obviously, the government has a much greater interest in, and capacity to influence, the behaviour of otherwise private companies than it does in Australia. Given that, does that change the government's view about its jurisdictional relation to the Port of Darwin?

The advice that officials have provided is that that still falls within the parameters of the statement I made earlier about commercial arrangements. They would only be within the scheme's scope if they were subsidiary to a core or non-core arrangement under the legislation, and that's irrespective of whether the corporation is—to your point about control—wholly or partly state owned or privately owned. So arrangements by state, territory or locally owned corporations are not the focus of the legislation.

Is it just the focus on the Port of Darwin? What else do we look at in Australia that's under foreign ownership?

The conversations that I've had with Senator Wong also go to that point.

That's my first question, about the arrangements. Whilst I understand your argument that, with bipartisan support, you've done what we suggested, which was a different approach on FIRB and critical infrastructure et cetera, there is no capacity for government to regulate leases that have already been signed under those arrangements going forward. Does the minister have any concerns about any foreign policy implications or national security implications of those existing arrangements?

I don't have every one of those at my fingertips in terms of who is the owner or lessee in that context, so I can't comment directly on those. Therefore I am speaking in the broad, and I should reinforce that. The nature of the commercial arrangements is also not known to me. Obviously it is case-by-case. But I was trying to respond to the specific questions in relation to the Port of Darwin. My understanding is that the critical infrastructure legislation plus the FIRB, which has clear rules on state owned enterprise investments, are the relevant framework under which these are dealt with. We do not want to duplicate those powers, and these other frameworks cover private company and commercial concerns.

Would the federal government, under this legislation, then look closely at whether the state government intended to sell those poles and wires to foreign owners? Could that be overruled under this legislation?

But, in the future, if a state government engaged in an arrangement with a foreign entity—sorry: I've forgotten what the term is under the bill—which contemplated leasing arrangements, for example, then the leases would come within the remit of the minister for the purposes of the bill and could be vetoed at that point?

I might just add that I actually think the lease arrangements for the Port of Darwin were tabled or provided to the Senate committee looking into the FIRB that specifically looked at that.

I will name just a few of those. For example, of course, we have the Uighurs in western China who are being subjected to genocide, to use the words of Mr Joe Biden.

I know some people would say that sports and politics should never be mixed, but the reality is that they are inextricably linked and there is no question that they are. That is seen in the way in which countries promote their nations or their cities in the competitions that lead up to the selection processes and the fact that all of the athletes who attend the Beijing Olympics will have come from places like the

They might say, 'I think you're wrong, Rex, and we should attend the Beijing 2022 Olympics.' I want to make it very clear that my amendments do not invoke a boycott of the Beijing 2022 Olympics. My amendments bring together those bodies within the scope of the bill so that the government, should it wish to, can initiate a boycott. It simply puts a card into the minister's back pocket for when we get to the point where others recognise what is happening in China. The

That could potentially invoke a range of different measures to compensate athletes, who devote their lives to preparing to attend these sorts of things. I want to be very clear that these amendments do not invoke a boycott; they simply give government an option to call for a boycott.

I support the intent of the bills, but I do have some concerns in relation to granting an executive power without an appropriately balanced judicial review of decisions. In that sense, I may well support some of the amendments and I'll deal with those as they pop up. But, in principle, these bills should, at the final instance, be supported.

These issues have been discussed recently within the parliament and more broadly. I understand why they are of significant and sincere concern. But, in terms of the bill, they do go beyond the scope and the intention of the bill.

We work closely with community organisations and with non-government organisations—they include sporting organisations. When there are concerns, from a foreign policy or security perspective, with Australian sporting teams attending international events, that is always something government can take up with the relevant sporting organisation.

So governments can and will engage on such matters, where it is necessary, to protect Australia's interests. That is really the point to come to, Senator Patrick, because I do understand what you seek to have government do and what you seek to have government have the capacity to do. I don't agree that the specific amendment is necessary for this to occur and, as I said at the beginning of my remarks, it goes beyond the confines of the bill, in terms of its application to state and territory government arrangements with foreign governments and related entities.

In the event that there is an Olympic event where the pressure has built up to a point where athletes are being asked to make a decision for themselves about boycotting—that's the dilemma I'm trying to solve here. You mentioned Zimbabwe. What are the mechanisms for government to protect those athletes in circumstances where the pressure has built and the government is in agreement? What are the mechanisms to protect those athletes from having to make that decision themselves rather than having a decision made by the government on their behalf?

Mechanisms per se—legislated, constructed—are not envisaged. And to be clear: at this point in time we're not considering a boycott of the 2022
                                                                                               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Olympics" rel="nofollow">

But government, as I said, works very closely with sporting organisations, peak bodies particularly, non-government organisations and community organisations in relation to these issues. I do remember that decision of the Howard government. I am in some circles known as a cricket tragic; it was a matter which I was following strongly at the time and which I strongly supported. I wrote to, I think, at least one cricketer at the time, who had taken it upon himself to take a particular personal stand. We're now friends—weird world. But there's not a structured mechanism, and I don't think that it's appropriate for that to be inserted in the context of this bill, for the reasons that I have said. But I can absolutely assure you, Senator Patrick, of how seriously government takes this, and that we can and will engage on those matters where it's necessary to protect Australia's interests.

We know, with the situation we're currently at with China, that it's a very difficult and sensitive situation as to how you can apply meaningful pressure on China to get some meaningful action on the human rights abuses that are going on, without everything just escalating out of control. These are incredibly serious issues that the world needs to be grappling with, not just allowing Chinese expansionism and not just allowing the ongoing abuse of human rights in China.
                                                                                               </p>

                                                                                                That said, the question, as I said, is how you go about it. We do not think that this legislation, including this sort of mechanism in this legislation, is the appropriate way to go about it. In fact, our position on this legislation is that we think it is too far-reaching and there is far too much control, without the appropriate checks and balances, over universities. We've got an amendment, as you know, to remove universities from the scheme. We think that the level of control and the ability to negate agreements made by local governments is overreach. So we don't think this legislation would be an appropriate mechanism to include that ability of control over the Olympic Committee.

We really need to have the conversation about what we think of that call, because we know that the Beijing Winter Olympics are going to be a massive propaganda moment for the Chinese Communist Party. They are going to milk that for all they can, saying, 'No, we are a legitimate world player, a superpower on the world stage,' and trying to brush away what is going on, whether it's the Uighurs, the Tibetans or what is happening in Hong Kong. That is something the world is really going to need to grapple with and take a multilateral approach on. I can see over the coming two years that there will be countries that will decide their athletes should not go, and that will be supported by their countries. I also think it's incredibly important that, if there is a decision for Australia to boycott the Winter Olympics, it should be a decision that is supported by government. It cannot be left to the athletes to bear that decision themselves. I also reject the position that the Olympics Committee currently have that you need to separate sport from politics. That's never happened; and it never will. At this moment, the Winter Olympics are a political moment, and they are a critical moment for China on the world stage.

It's a very serious issue, and the world needs to be dealing with it more appropriately than it is at the moment. But including the ability to deal with that within this legislation is not something the Greens support.

Senator Patrick, I note, has circulated some amendments. Obviously I don't think they're as good as mine, but they are quite sensible amendments which go to the provision of reasons. I made the point earlier that these are pretty wideranging powers for a minister. A minister can veto an arrangement that Premier Berejiklian, the

We understand why that is necessary, but I repeat what I said yesterday, which is that I think if ministers do stuff they probably should explain to people what they're doing. My concern is the extent of the power that is vested in a minister by the parliament as a consequence of this is substantial and wideranging. It isn't enough of an answer on that extent of power to simply say, 'Foreign policy is the remit of the federal government.' Yes, it is, but a suggestion doesn't proceed from that that you can simply veto arrangements without providing any reasons or having any accountability.

This is obviously a matter which we discussed yesterday and have again today. It is a matter which was considered seriously in the drafting of the legislation. The government is of the view, similarly to the way the FIRB legislation is constructed, that to prevent the potential for damage to bilateral relations, to protect Australia's position, including in bilateral and international forums or negotiations, it is appropriate for such serious decisions, as they are taken in the context of the FIRB as well, for reasons not to be publicly provided. However, I do think that the implementation of the bill, the provisions within the bill and the work of the

They are open for all to see and to scrutinise. The minister is required in section 51 to take a significant set of matters into account in relation to the state or territory that might be making the arrangement. They include the importance of the arrangement in assisting or enhancing the state or territory's functioning and the extent of the performance of the arrangement—so its implementation. They include whether the declaration would impair the continued existence of the state or territory as an independent entity.

In doing so, we have developed and put into the legislation presented to the parliament as part of section 51(2) those particular conditions. These are going to be decisions which are made robustly, made in the public interest, and made with transparency and accountability, as is appropriate given the nature of the issues concerned.

Can you confirm that you would not have to give any state government any notice of the possibility that you would veto an agreement which it had entered into?

But the process of the stocktake of arrangements which we will be undertaking with the states and territories and local government and relevant entities is part of developing, if you like—I think I used the word 'rhythm' previously in a discussion with Senator Rice or Senator Patrick—that relationship and the understanding of the nature of arrangements which might be within the purview of the bill, and the act if it is passed. And state and territory governments will be a key part of ensuring that that comes together. That goes to the point of the consultation, again, Senator. It's why we engage with jobs, tourism, science and innovation groups, and with the trade and investment group particularly, because these are issues of interest to them, and they've been productive discussions.

When another level of government in Australia enters into an agreement—leaving aside whether it's good or bad—before you as the minister make a decision to override an elected government about whatever agreement they get into, whether it's with Korea, Japan, the United Kingdom, whatever, why do you think it's appropriate the foreign minister doesn't even have to tell them she or he is considering it?

It is open to the states and territories to seek further information, to seek to vary an arrangement to ensure that it is consistent. As I've said in answer to other questions, I think the stocktake process is a very important part of this in ensuring that it provides a level of awareness and information that will give familiarity to states and territories of those issues and areas which may be affected by the provisions of the bill.

Most state governments and state councils are in huge debt. China, through Belt and Road, wants to go to Victoria and put up a lot of money to build infrastructure. This bill has come about because of concerns about China putting Belt and Road into Victoria. Why is it a concern of the federal government to not allow Victoria, or even local government, to be involved in Belt and Road? If they are signing up to these agreements, why is the federal government taking the stance of overriding their decisions?

But we recognise that, internationally, Australia's strength is greatest when we are speaking with one voice as governments across Australia. That's the purpose the bill serves. This bill will assist us in ensuring a consistent approach to Australia's international relations, in Australia's national interest, reflecting the Commonwealth government's fundamental role in setting those foreign policy and foreign relations parameters. It's our role to negotiate treaties. It's our role to represent our nation internationally. We do think that this remedies a gap, therefore, in the existing system. States and territories do not have to advise or even consult the Commonwealth in relation to such arrangements. That is a large gap in the system. It gives the Commonwealth no line of sight, no vision of what state and territory governments are entering into. We believe that the mechanisms set out in the legislation are about protecting our national interest and, importantly, addressing the consistency of our foreign policy across all levels of Australian government.

With Belt and Road, China actually put a lot of money into the Shanghai port. The port couldn't pay it back, so China took over the port. China is putting a lot of money into Belt and Road and the agreements that are made. They are using their own technology. Whether it is building a rail line or a computer system, they are using their own technology—and, in the future, you will always have to buy from China because you can't get the product from elsewhere. They are protecting their own interests. We will constantly have to buy from China. They are tying us up. We can't go outside those parameters because they have used all their knowledge, all their technology and all their infrastructure, and we are bound and tied to it.

Coming from a manufacturing background, I know that people aren't serious when they start talking about 'advanced manufacturing'. The government allowed one of our core national capabilities, one of the industries that provided critical national capability—the Australian automotive industry—to go offshore. All this froth and bubble about national resilience, all this talk about supply chain diversity, counts for nothing after the government that you've been part of did everything in its power to force offshore not just the 40,000 jobs but the national resilience and innovation and capability that comes from that. Look offshore now at what the United Kingdom is doing, as just one example, with big investments in automotive capability that they see as precisely serving the policy objectives that you've been glossing over in terms of national resilience and supply chain capability.

For political sloganeering purposes, just last year and the year before, some joker in Liberal campaign land decided that an effort to invest in electric vehicles—which is the future of automotive engineering and automotive capability—was, in some way, an effort to take away people's weekends. It was the silliest thing that I'd ever heard. It was a self-defeating thing, because of the opportunity for us to re-engage with that most sophisticated, largest job-generating industry that also gives rise to the capacity for innovation and capability. It does make me wonder about the capacity of this government to think its way through the foreign relations problems that now confront it.

One of the reasons I'm so apprehensive about this set of arrangements is that the government set the tone. I think the phrase that you used, Minister, was whether the Commonwealth should have a line of sight on the kinds of agreements that state, territory and local governments or universities are reaching with foreign entities. There is no contest at all on that question in this place. But I think the way that the bill has been formulated and the language that's been used by advocates for the bill in this place would give states and territories, and universities in particular, some real concerns about the arbitrariness of the power that the minister is proposing to exercise. I've heard you say that the power would be used in a robust way—I'm not sure what that means—that it wouldn't be used lightly and that there'd be processes in place. Those commitments are good, as far as they go. But, if you're the Premier of

For the states and territories, there's been no engagement in the construction of this most important legislation. For the universities, there's been no engagement and no consultation.

It's not a position that the government would take if it were trying to change the regulations for the retail or finance sectors. It's a contemptuous way, really, of engaging with universities, so no wonder they are so apprehensive about the way that the Commonwealth is going to engage with them prospectively, if from our most recent experience over the last three weeks we've seen the government being so contemptuous of them.
                                                                                                            </p>

One is the arbitrariness in the minister's power of veto and the other is the softer, more educative line-of-sight propositions that the minister has advanced. It appears to me that there are twin sets of objectives, which could be reconciled in the legislation if a bill in a different form had been brought to this place. It's harder to reconcile those two objectives, because of the government's behaviour and, for example, the government's refusal to provide reasons.

Those criticisms have been aired in this place and they were aired substantially yesterday. I'd like to understand why the government conducted itself in the way that it did. What was the rationale for not consulting with the university sector in this case? Does the government recognise that that failure to consult has hurt its capacity to engage constructively? Primarily, Minister, I'd like to understand why the minister and the department chose, in the drafting process that we heard so much about in estimates, not to consult with the institutions that the bill seeks to cover.

                                                                                                                  </a>

Returning to the substantive matters: I was going to the four car companies which were manufacturers in Australia—Mitsubishi, Ford, Holden and Toyota. I acknowledge that Senator Ayres is right: Holden and Toyota did make the decision and did announce their decision to cease manufacturing in Australia under the first term of the Abbott government. However, as Senator Ayres should know and may have forgotten—or has chosen to forget—the departure of Mitsubishi was announced in 2008 under the Rudd government and the announcement of Ford's departure from manufacturing in Australia was in 2013 under the Gillard government. So two of the four Australian car manufacturers announced their departure under the Rudd-Gillard government, not under this government. To attribute the blame to this side of politics for those events is, I think, curious.
                                                                                                                 </p>
                                                                                                                 <p>
                                                                                                                  Turning to the more substantive matters raised in Senate Ayres's contribution about this question of ministerial accountability for decisions made: I appreciate the perspective raised by the opposition and some crossbench senators on this question. But I do observe that in our system of government ministers are accountable to this parliament and governments are accountable to the people. If the opposition or any other member of this place is curious about a decision that the minister has made, if the minister does indeed make a decision to cancel an agreement, then they're free to ask the minister about that in this chamber. I look forward to them doing so if indeed that is the case. Ultimately, the government is accountable to the people for the decision it makes.
                                                                                                                 </p>
                                                                                                                 <p>
                                                                                                                  I was reflecting on a contribution that Senator Rice made in this debate last night. She made the good point that, sadly, it may not be the case that Senator Payne will be foreign minister forever. I hope it is for a very long time, but one day perhaps she will be succeeded by another foreign minister. It may be Senator Wong who replaces her one day as foreign minister. It may be Senator Ayres or it may be Senator Kitching, given their interest in these matters. But, speaking as a Liberal senator, I will sleep very soundly at night knowing that it may be Senator Wong who retains this power in the future. I would much rather Senator Wong have this power to make this decision and much rather she exercise her judgement using this power and the judgement of the federal government on questions of national interest and foreign policy than any state premier, Labor or Liberal—let alone any local council mayor or any vice-chancellor. That's because I know that ultimately she will be informed by the best advice and the best expertise here in Canberra and because, fundamentally, I don't think there is a really profound difference on foreign policy across the chamber. Fundamentally, I think we substantially agree.
                                                                                                                 </p>
                                                                                                                 <p>
                                                                                                                  So I'm not troubled as Senator Rice is by the fact that the foreign ministry may change hands one day. I trust that an elected government and the person they choose to appoint as foreign minister will exercise that choice carefully and that any decisions they make will be subject to the scrutiny of this parliament and the Australian people.

The first is that we do think this is a role for the federal government. But we also think that where there are substantial powers vested in any minister, as they are by this legislation—including to cancel agreements that elected state governments, elected territory governments and elected councils are engaged in—a modicum of notice and reasons for decisions are pretty reasonable propositions. I don't think that derogates from the central proposition asserted, which is that the federal government has responsibility for foreign relations.

It really goes to the point Senator Paterson made about accountability. It also prescribes the minimum contents of such reports, given we've seen reports provided by this government which avoid certain delicate topics that are actually important, such as the aged-care annual report and response to the royal commission report. In order to avoid the risk of vague and unhelpful reports, it requires statistical information about decisions and results, and the details of each decision. It's consistent with the recommendations of my colleagues on the Senate committee. It also requires an outline of the engagement that has occurred during the year with entities covered by the proposed act to articulate and explain those amendments to those entities, Australia's foreign policy and how they should engage with foreign entities in Australia's national interest.
                                                                                                                   </p>

The minister would be obliged to prepare two reports, a classified report and an unclassified report. The amendment requires the minister to table the unclassified report, but to give a copy of the classified report to the Leader of the Opposition, which they are under duty to keep secret. I would underline that this is precisely the same sort of arrangement which applies to intelligence agency reports—for example, under the

It is important, obviously, to ensure that these sorts of issues are not weaponised or politicised in any way, and to ensure the bipartisanship on these sorts of national security matters is provided on the basis of reasonable shared information. Conscious of the national security matters inherent in the decision-making under the bill, the amendment provides that, before tabling the report, the minister may make redactions, as she or he considers necessary, in order to avoid prejudice to security, the defence of Australia, Australia's relations with other countries, law enforcement operations or the privacy of individuals.

I would have preferred the latter, but I am doing what the Clerk told me was the right thing to do. If this amendment is successful, we'll then move that amendment subsequently. We're conscious of the sensitivity required in the handling of national security matters, and we have taken that into account in relation to the drafting of both amendments.

We do believe that the public register is going to be a very important process through which information is provided about the decisions that are made. It will enable the ascertaining of the minister's decisions on arrangements, in terms of the numbers and the outcomes of those arrangements; it will be completely publicly available to allow for that sort of public scrutiny over decision-making. It will help the states and territories to build a picture of the kinds of arrangements that might be deemed to be adverse to or inconsistent with Australia's foreign policy. It will include information about arrangements to support greater transparency. I think it is an important confidence-building mechanism for the public, for business and for state and territory entities themselves, that they can enter and deal with arrangements knowing they are consistent with Australia's foreign policy and foreign relations.

That includes commercially sensitive information, information that would disclose state or territory cabinet deliberations or documents, any information that's subject to legal professional privilege or public interest immunity, or national security information. That is to protect that information—to recognise that its publication could have a detrimental impact.

I note the minister's response—that she's not supporting this because she feels that the public register will be enough information. It is very clear that there is going to be much more limited information on that public register—and, Minister, you just outlined some of the things that won't be on the public register—than we think is appropriate to be either publicly available or, in the case of sensitive information, to be redacted, to take account of that sensitivity. We note that there is not full transparency because of the provisions outlined in this proposed amendment to be able to redact sensitive information.

All the legislation lays out is, basically, a framework that allows the government, if it wanted to, to come in, in an incredibly heavy-handed, non-consultative and completely over-the-top manner, without having to give any reasons for decisions that are being made, without having to account for itself, without having to give any reports and without the ability to review those decisions. It is a very authoritarian way of going about this piece of legislation and is completely at odds with the expressions that you have been using during this debate, Minister, of your commitment to a collaborative and open approach.

A consistent theme throughout all the discussion and debate we have had on this bill is that key terms and definitions are undefined or poorly defined. This is a very simple amendment. We think it would have been a pretty obvious thing to include a definition of foreign relations. We hope that it's a useful one that will provide clarity in the legislation about, indeed, the extent of what is covered by this legislation.

If the government wants to deliver on this promise it should provide guidance, and when the entities get it wrong they should explain why. That is, over time, the only way we can ensure the sort of alignment that is necessary at this time.
                                                                                                                        </p>

                                                                                                                         I also make the point that without procedural fairness, without a requirement to provide reasons and without capacity for review, this is a discretion that sits solely with the minister. There is no requirement to explain what Australia's foreign policy is and no requirement to explain how an arrangement is inconsistent with foreign policy. Now, I don't doubt the motivations of this minister. I've been critical of her performance, but I don't doubt her motivations. But any minister may make decisions with regard to all kinds of matters under this legislation, given the broad discretion given to the minister under the bill. For example, it's not unimaginable that a federal government of one political persuasion might take issue with an arrangement that is beneficial to a state or territory government of another political persuasion, and we have seen that in the way in which the government here has chosen to attack Premier Andrews through the media without actually sitting down and having a chat.

My criticism of the federal government is that they have chosen to play this through the media for political purposes rather than actually trying to resolve it. As I said, at the same time they refuse to release their own secret BRI deals—and it's a pity Senator Rennick wasn't here to hear that—which Mr Ciobo entered into. The minister can exercise powers under this regime to cancel an arrangement without the need to provide reasons, without any notice and without the capacity for review, and people wouldn't even know what factors the minister took into account; only the minister would know that. So we've taken a responsible approach in drafting the amendments to ensure that the government's concerns are dealt with, including the need for sensitivity in publishing details of Australia's foreign policy.

The statement of reasons that we have drafted would include, whether, if in making the decisions, the minister is satisfied or not satisfied of a foreign relations matter or had ceased to be satisfied of a foreign relations matter, an explanation for the basis on which the minister reached that position and, in particular, foreign relations, foreign policy or other considerations involved and an explanation of how matters have been taken into account.

I outline that because that is a very substantial protection of national security or other information that a minister reasonably believes should be excluded on the basis of public interest immunity.

We have specified that the review function should be conferred on the security division of the AAT so that the procedural requirements for classified evidence apply. For the purposes of this clause, a foreign relations matter means a matter that relates to whether or not a particular action would or would not adversely affect, or would be likely or unlikely to adversely affect, Australian foreign relations, or be inconsistent with Australian foreign policy amongst other things, to summarise.

These are very sensible amendments. It is a very substantial power. The Labor Party doesn't believe the minister should have this kind of untrammelled power to veto agreements that sovereign state governments and territory governments have entered into without at least providing reasons for the decisions and having some capacity to be accountable for them.

I appreciate the matters that Senator Wong has raised but we believe they are covered within the provisions of the bill. We are very conscious of the decisions being made under this bill and the potential impact that they have in relation to bilateral relations in relation to disadvantaging Australia's position, including in bilateral and international fora or negotiations.

The minister's decisions are made public through the register. They are open for all to see and to scrutinise. They are made on the basis of Australia's foreign policy, which is the purview of the Commonwealth government.

It's part of a framework where you have got accountability. We believe that accountability is fundamental to having a framework of actually working collaboratively together.

                                                                                                                              <p>
                                                                                                                               I think all of us here are on the same page when we think, 'Yes, it would be the best outcome if we have the Commonwealth, the state and territory governments, universities and local governments all on the same page, not cutting across each other and not making decisions that are in conflict with the decisions that the others are making.' If you've got a problem where that's occurring, the question is: how do you address it? I've done a lot of work in bringing groups of people together to work out how they can work together, see what their common aims are, see what their common purposes are and reach solutions together. I can tell you there is only one way to do it that will last, and that is to genuinely work together collaboratively, to genuinely talk with each other, to genuinely listen to each other, to genuinely hear and learn from each other and then to work together. The way that you do that is you set up a framework for those discussions that ensures that that's going to occur. You cannot have a framework where, despite lots of good words at the beginning, saying, 'Yes, we are going to work collaboratively, transparently and in an accountable way,' at the end of the day all the power rests with one person. That's the problem that we have with this legislation.
                                                                                                                              </p>
                                                                                                                              <p>
                                                                                                                               A framework actually set up for the states and Commonwealth to work together but which doesn't vest all that overarching power into the hands of the minister would be the way forward. There is clearly room for improvement compared with where we're currently at. As I said earlier, I don't think it is appropriate for state governments to be going off and signing the Belt and Road Initiative with China that the Commonwealth had no knowledge of or engagement in. That's not a sensible way forward. But there is a vast gulf between that situation and what's being proposed here. You can set up a framework that addresses that that doesn't then place all the power in the hands of the foreign minister in a way that does not have to be accountable. Yes, Minister, you might be committed to being accountable. You personally might be committed to providing reasons. Personally, your way of working may be collaborative. But, unless it's laid out in the legislation, it does haven't to occur. Unless you have guidelines for the decisions, a requirement to lay out guidelines for the reasons why a decision is being made and a requirement to actually provide reasons back to people to whom you are saying that arrangement can no longer occur, unless that is in the legislation, it doesn't have to occur. That is our concern.
                                                                                                                              </p>
                                                                                                                              <p>
                                                                                                                               I'm sure that it would have been possible to get a piece of legislation that addressed the vast majority of what you wanted to achieve with this legislation with multipartisan support, because there is support around this chamber and around this parliament for what I think the intent of this legislation is—to address the problem of making sure that those arrangements are in Australia's national interest. But the fact that you are not willing to accommodate very sensible amendments that put in place a framework of accountability shows that that cooperation is not present. That's why we are having to have this debate here today. It means that you're not going to get support from us. I don't understand the reasons. In fact, I don't think there have been sufficient reasons given as to why these very sensible amendments are not being supported by the government. Your response was, 'There are potential threats to our bilateral arrangements.' That's not a reason. There is room in this amendment to be able to redact information that is sensitive and shouldn't be in the public eye. This blanket approach of no guidelines, no review and no reasons for decisions is complete overreach and is setting up a regime that has the potential to be misused in the future.

Within the legislation there is the process of judicial review; the parameters of the foreign policy test, which I have set out in the chamber in this debate; the limited scope of the coverage; the matters in section 51 which the foreign minister must take into account; and the public register itself. The rules, of course, are disallowable and, of course, the legislation was amended by the government in the House of Representatives to also incorporate a three-year review which will give the parliament and the government the ability to address any prospective changes or amendments to the process.

We've had a number of discussions in the committee stage on that matter. I don't think that the proposed amendments add clarity, but they do run the risk of creating legal uncertainty. We believe the terms should be interpreted in the context of the Commonwealth's prerogative to determine Australia's foreign policy and foreign relations.

They are substantively similar to the amendments the Labor Party moved earlier, although there is some conflict in terms of the right of review. I would just again make the point that I think the minister's justification for opposing these various administrative amendments really doesn't make a lot of sense in the circumstances.
