        [by video link] My question is to the minister representing the Minister for Health, Senator Colbeck. It's reported the Morrison-Joyce government's COVID-19 information on the health department website, which comes in more than 60 languages, has not been updated for almost eight weeks. Does the minister agree with the health department that failing to update information eight weeks out of date is 'a short delay'? When will this be fixed?

         [by video link] Thanks, Senator McAllister, for the question. I agree with Senator McAllister that ensuring that Australians have access to updated information with respect to vaccines and elements of how they might protect themselves from the COVID-19 pandemic through utilisation of the vaccine is extremely important. I would agree with her that it's a very important thing to do. That information has, in fact, been updated. But, can I say, it should have been updated sooner; it should not have taken eight weeks. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Health
         </a>
         understands the perspective of the ministers in the portfolio with respect to that information.
        </p>
        <p>
         We don't only rely on the Department of Health website for the engagement with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CALD" rel="nofollow">
          CALD
         </a>
         communities. This is a very important part of ensuring people understand what's available to them with respect to getting a vaccine. In that context, the 'Arm yourself'
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">
          TV
         </a>
         commercial has been translated into a number of languages and has been running since 1 August. There are 20 languages covered in videos of multicultural health professionals and religious and community leaders from Sydney on the importance of staying home, getting tested and getting vaccinatedâ€”specifically for the greater Sydney region. There is an established CALD communication working group, which was set up at the start of the pandemic. It's chaired by the Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Professor Michael Kidd, and meets regularly, providing advice both to the Department of Health and back out to communities. So communication is extremely important, and this information should have been updated sooner.

            [by video link] Thank you, Senator McAllister, for the question. As I've indicated, the materials on the website have been updated. That is the advice that I've been provided. The objective of this government is to ensure that every Australian who is currently eligible and who becomes eligible to receive a vaccine has access to the most up-to-date information, and to encourage all Australians to get a vaccine. The thing that we do know about the vaccines that we have available in our vaccine strategy at this point in time is that they are safe and highly efficacious. They will protect you against death, hospitalisation and serious illness. So we're encouraging everyone to get a vaccine as soon as they possibly can, and that will remain a focus of our campaigns.

               website should have been updated in a more timely way. It has been updated now, and we will continue to work with communities across this country, through various mechanisms, to ensure that Australians have access to high-quality information, in a way that they can readily receive it, so that we can continue to encourage them to access the vaccines, because we know that the vaccine program is going to be one of the most important ways we work with Australians to come through this COVID-19 pandemic.
