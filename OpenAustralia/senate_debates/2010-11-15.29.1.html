        My question is to Senator Conroy as the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the

         National Broadband Network
        </a>
        from people like Professor Paul Kerin, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
         OECD
        </a>
        and internationally recognised experts in the field, such as Mexican telecommunications tycoon

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        could be built by private enterprise without the government having to dip into its dwindling resources? Is the minister also aware that these experts believe that the estimated cost of $7,000 per household to provide broadband services is far too high and that the government should consider adopting a multiplatform approach? Minister, why is it that all of these experts are wrong and only you are right?

         I thank Senator Macdonald for his ongoing interest. It is important for those opposite to read all of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
          OECD
         </a>
         report and not just selectively quote it. The report released by the OECD yesterday concludes that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network" rel="nofollow">
          National Broadband Network
         </a>
         has the potential to yield substantial benefits, especially in terms of productivity, and that it will improve internet services for the entire population—something those in the far corner used to believe in—and will promote fairer competition between private firms on retail services. The OECD states that the National Broadband Network is a far-reaching reform project that has been undertaken to fill the gaps in the broadband internet sector.

        <p>
         Through the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
          NBN
         </a>
         the Gillard government is ensuring that every Australian, no matter where they live, has access to affordable high-speed broadband. This was confirmed by the OECD’s report which again, if you do not take selective quotes, states that the NBN will avoid the risk of a geographic digital divide as it will cover the entire population, whereas if it were done by the private sector it would be done more gradually and only to the most densely populated areas. I recommend it to you, Senator Joyce. The OECD report also outlined that recent research suggests that the use of the new network can bring large savings, between 0.5 per cent and 1.5 per cent of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
          GDP
         </a>
         , to the cost of public services over a 10-year period in just four areas—health care, education, transport and electricity—which on its own would warrant the construction. So the OECD says that just in those four sectors—

Minister, can you go up there and explain to these people why your government is about to splurge $43 billion on this much maligned

           I am prepared to listen to the Mayor of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcoo_Shire" rel="nofollow">

           </a>
           , Mr Bruce Scott, who says, ‘We want fibre to these small communities.’ His communities are begging, crying out and campaigning to ensure that they get fibre—and this is a National Party council. They are demanding that they get fibre. They do not want the opposition’s mickey mouse wireless network. I repeat for those who want to listen that in just the four areas of health care, education, transport and electricity there will be a 0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent improvement in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
            GDP

            National Broadband Network
           </a>
           . So in all of those areas that the mayor you referred to is expressing concerns there is concrete support from the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
            OECD
           </a>
           which says that building the National Broadband Network will benefit health, will benefit education, will benefit electricity and will benefit transport.

I have to tell you that I prefer our telecommunications system and how it works to Mr Slim’s any day of the week. I invite you to go to Mexico and try it yourself, Senator Macdonald.
