        , Senator Farrell. Minister, I know, and those of us on this side know, that raising children while juggling work commitments can be challenging for many Australian families. We know that parents, employers, unions, gender experts and economists are united in their understanding that providing more choice, more support and more flexibility for families, and more opportunities for women, boost workforce participation and productivity across the economy. Can the minister please outline for the chamber how the Albanese government's paid parental leave changes will deliver more choice, more support and greater flexibility to working families?

         Thank you for that very fine question, Senator Stewart. I know you have a very deep interest in this area—personal and otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
         In our first year, the Albanese Labor government has not wasted a day in delivering a better future for all Australians. This government is making it easier for working families to get ahead. On 1 July, next week, our changes to paid parental leave come into effect, giving about 180,000 families access to a more flexible payment that promotes shared care. As a result of our changes, not only will more parents have access to the government payment but they will also have more flexibility in how they transition back to work and how they share care between them. This is an important first step for better paid parental leave. But there is more to be done, and that's why we will introduce further legislation over the coming months to provide families with an extra six weeks by 2026. That's an extra $5,000 in paid leave, based on current rates.
        </p>
        <p>
         Improving paid parental leave is a critical reform; it's critical for families, it's critical for women and it's critical for the economy.

         is an important Labor legacy, and I'm very proud—as I know you would be, Senator Stewart—to be part of a government which is building on that legacy and delivering for Australian women and families.

           I am incredibly proud to be a part of a government that prioritises women. We know the government is committed to ensuring that, as children grow older, families in difficult circumstances continue to receive the support that they need. Can the minister outline how the Albanese government will support these families, including any new measures or arrangements that will start with the new financial year?

            is just one measure alongside many other investments in families across this government. Also, on 1 July more than 1.3 million families will receive an increase to their family payments through indexation to help with the cost of living. A family with two children who receive family tax benefit part A and part B could receive around $50 extra per fortnight. On 1 July our improvements to the child support scheme come into effect, making it easier to collect child support debts and helping to prevent future debts by improving income accuracy for low-income parents. We've been clear that this is the first step in the government's longer term strategy to improve—

In addition, both the single parent payment and the rent assistance will be indexed on 20 September to help keep pace with the cost of living. Our actions over the last 12 months demonstrate how the—
