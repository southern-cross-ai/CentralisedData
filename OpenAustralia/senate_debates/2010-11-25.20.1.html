        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Brandis from moving that the Senate take note of the President’s ruling forthwith.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
         Mr President
        </a>
        , without reflecting on your ruling—which I do not do—the fact is that the motion upon which the Senate lately deliberated was a motion that the motion be put.
       </p>
       <p>
        The motion that was before the chamber at the time that motion was deliberated upon was not the motion that Minister Ludwig is now reading. And we know what this is all about because in the original motion, the only motion that was before the chamber at the time the question was put, was a guillotine motion which would have included, among other things, eliminating question time. Plainly, embarrassed by the revelation that that motion would have eliminated question time, the government sought late in the piece to change the motion to reinstate question time. But you know, Mr President, and every senator present in this chamber is well aware, that the government’s original plan was to eliminate question time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Everyone accepts that both sides of this chamber when in government have on occasions moved the guillotine, moved the gag. That charge has been levelled against us in interjections from the government benches, and it is true. During the Howard government, we moved the guillotine on a number of occasions, but never—and I think you will find, if you look at the precedent books, not once in the history of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Senate" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Senate
        </a>
        —has a guillotine motion eliminated question time. This is a new depth in parliamentary practice which has been imposed by this government with the willing connivance of the Greens—whose heroic talk about parliamentary scrutiny, the role of the Senate and transparency in government is revealed for the fraud that it is—and, I am sorry to say, with the connivance and support of Senator Xenophon and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_Fielding" rel="nofollow">
         Senator Fielding
        </a>
        as well. They perhaps, to give them the benefit of the doubt, may have been lulled into not appreciating that the motion before the chamber at the time was to eliminate question time. So let the record show that today, 25 November 2010, for the first time in the history of this Senate, an Australian government, in moving the guillotine, sought to eliminate question time. How can any Labor senator or any Greens senator ever again, without obvious hypocrisy, talk about openness in government, parliamentary scrutiny or transparency?
       </p>
       <p>
        If it is possible that it could be worse than that, it is, because we know that this was a pre-ordained plan. Senator Conroy, the stupidest person in this place, gave it away yesterday.

            Senator Conroy gave it away yesterday when at the end of question time he merrily waved across to the opposition benches and said, ‘
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Christmas" rel="nofollow">
             Happy Christmas
            </a>
            . See you next year.’ So Senator Conroy was in on the fix. He well knew that there would be no question time today, Thursday. That is why at the end of question time yesterday it caused some of us to be a little curious, I might say, as to why Senator Conroy would anticipate that he would not be here to answer questions the next day. The reason was that the government had already decided as early as question time yesterday that yesterday’s question time would be the last question time of the year.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, we can understand why this government would want to protect from scrutiny a struggling, weak and failing minister in Senator Stephen Conroy—

              A man overboard indeed, Senator Johnston. But to stoop to a new low in Australian parliamentary democracy, to actually vote to suspend the standing orders so that there could be no question time, reasonably expecting that the question time would be largely directed to the minister—the weak, struggling, failing, hopeless, flailing minister they were trying to protect—is unprecedented.

              , the ruling you have given, while I do not reflect upon it, was a ruling in relation to a motion that the question be put. The only question that this Senate has decided is that the motion—

                                    , I raise a point of order. There is no clarity at all. So far there have been two documents circulated and also Senator Ludwig before the previous procedural motion was halfway through reading his motion. So we now have two written motions before the chamber and a motion which was read halfway. So we now have three motions potentially before the chamber.

I ask you to put the question as to whether I have leave to take note of the information that you have provided to the Senate.

Senator Cormann then sought leave to take note of your ruling. You said: ‘I haven’t made a ruling. I’ve merely provided information.’ I then took another point of order, my point of order being that, regardless of whether or not you characterised what you said as providing information, you had disposed of Senator Cormann’s point of order and therefore that was a ruling, whether described as such or not. I have not had a ruling on my point of order.

                                                 , a senator may seek leave to do anything at any time. If leave is refused, he may then move to suspend standing orders if he so chooses. Mr President, I maintain that you have given a ruling on Senator Cormann’s point of order. But whether that be right or wrong, you have certainly given a ruling on my point of order. Senator Cormann is perfectly at liberty to seek leave to take note of your ruling on my point of order, which, as I understand it, is what he has done. The fact that he has done so is currently the question before the chair.

The circumstances are exactly the same. There is no difference between the motion put by Senator Brandis and the motion put by Senator Cormann. If you are now refusing to take Senator Cormann’s motion, that is a completely inconsistent ruling.

This is the second motion for the suspension of standing orders to amend the order agreed to by the Senate and such a motion is not in order. The rationale of this ruling is that, once the Senate has been asked to suspend standing orders in order to depart from the order of business on one occasion and has declined to do so, the request should not be capable of being repeatedly made because this would provide a means of permanently obstructing the business of the Senate. I am relying on a wide range of precedent that has been cited on this matter.

The opposition will be moving amendments in relation to that particular bill but, with the way these orders stand at the moment, we may well not get to them.

Those things have to be dealt with. Senator Siewert, are you going to extend your gag to each of those bills? Are you going to gag us all on those bills again? That is another indication of the lack of proper scrutiny and debate on those six very important bills. We are obviously going to be gagged on those as well.

That is accepted and is a perfectly legitimate position for them to take. They have argued that there would not be enough time to debate the bill properly under these arrangements. We sought yesterday to provide an extra three hours of sitting to debate this bill last night. The opposition determined not to support that and, therefore, denied themselves three hours of debate.

The key point to make is this: the Senate is now in a position where every minute and every hour we debate procedural motions is less time available to debate the bill. The debate on the guillotine motion has been carried. The clock is now ticking. What everyone needs to understand is when more procedural motions are moved by the opposition more time is merely eaten up to debate the bill.

So the opposition have to make a decision whether they are seriously interested in considering the bill or are interested in wrecking and preventing consideration of the bill. That is where they are now.

We have had those debates—we have had them at length. But we are now in a situation where the more we debate procedural motions the less time there is for scrutiny of the bill, and it is on the heads of the opposition whether they choose to use the time now to scrutinise the bill. We have the rest of the day and all day tomorrow under the motion carried by the Senate. It is a decision for the opposition now whether they use that time for consideration of the bill or they use it for procedural purposes.
