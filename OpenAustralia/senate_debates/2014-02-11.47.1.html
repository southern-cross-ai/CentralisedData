        My question is to the Attorney-General. I refer to the more than 6,000 organisations that have joined a global internet blackout against indiscriminate government surveillance. They are joining their voices with business, civil society organisations and even senior Republican and Democratic congress men and women to demand reforms to the dragnet surveillance conducted by the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSA" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Does this government and, in particular, the Attorney-General recognise the legitimate concerns of Australians about indiscriminate surveillance, or does he honestly believe there are no reforms necessary here in Australia?

         Thank you very much to Senator Ludlam for that question. I note that Senator Ludlam has today published on the
         <i>
          Guardian
         </i>
         website an article in praise of the American traitor Edward Snowden, displaying a photograph of a bus bearing the signage 'Thank you, Edward Snowden' and under the headline 'Today is the day we fight back'. Senator Ludlam, you celebrate and make a hero of this man who, through his criminal dishonesty and his treachery to his country, has put lives, including Australian lives, at risk. I wonder how you can sit in this parliament and hold your head up high when you celebrate a man who, through criminal conduct and treachery, has put Australian lives at risk.
        </p>
        <p>
         You should know, because you are your party's spokesman on this area, that the Australian intelligence agencies operate under a strong framework of surveillance and under very strong statutory obligations and accountability obligations. That framework includes being responsible to a parliamentary committee of which you yourself are a member—that is, the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs Defence and Trade—and the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. They are also responsible to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Joint_Committee_on_Intelligence_and_Security" rel="nofollow">
          Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security
         </a>
         ; they are responsible to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, an independent statutory officer; and they are, as I said a moment ago, under a framework of—

          What a chilling response. I thank Senator Brandis for the bluntness of his answer. Senator Brandis, are you aware of, and have you or your office evaluated, any of the proposals for serious law reform put to

           President Obama

           I will come to your question in a second, Senator, but I will if I may just finish what I was saying in answer to your primary question. The operation of the Australian intelligence agencies is undergirded by strong statutory accountability requirements and oversight.
