             is costing them between $10 million and $12 million a year confirms the correctness of the coalition commitment to re-establish the Australian Building and Construction Commission. According to Mr Kane, 'The government needs to step in and clean out the unlawful activity.'
            </p>
            <p>
             Senator Boswell, we agree with him. And that is exactly what we are seeking to do. We have already introduced legislation to re-establish the Australian Building and Construction Commission. It will see a return of a tough cop on the beat to protect workers and contractors, improve productivity and restore the rule of law in an industry that Commissioner Cole and Justice Wilcox found was wracked with a culture of lawlessness. Under the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABCC" rel="nofollow">
              ABCC
             </a>
             workers were protected, productivity was higher, fewer days were lost to industrial action and the rule of law was respected.

              The Green
             </a>
             -Labor government deliberately dismantled this successful reform to help their CFMEU mates. Commissioner Cole's findings are as true today as they were in 2001. Senator Wong and Senator Lundy, both former officials of the CFMEU, need to explain why, in the words of Mr Cain, the CFMEU gets a pass on this type of behaviour, but if the company did it they would be prosecuted.

The bad old days were back. In the first full year of Labor's toothless mouse, working days lost to industrial action in the building and construction sector tripled. Under Labor the Australian public have now witnessed the ugly public displays of industrial violence and union thuggery at Baiada Poultry, Brisbane Children's Hospital,
