        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Conroy. Does the minister agree with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
         AFP
        </a>
        Deputy Commissioner, who said that law enforcement agencies around the world rely heavily on Interpol red notices and take in good faith the accuracy and content of them, and who also testified that, in his experience, he had not encountered an inaccurate notice; or does the minister support the view of the immigration minister, who stated yesterday in relation to red notices that quite often claims have been found to be wrong?

         No, I do not accept the premise of the question at all. As Mr
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Connor" rel="nofollow">
          O'Connor
         </a>
         has said on a number of occasions, there is no contradiction here at all. Mr O'Connor has full confidence in the operational decision making of not only the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
          AFP
         </a>
         but every one of our hardworking security agencies. Mr O'Connor pointed out that he would have expected those opposite to already know that the AFP takes Interpol red notices very seriously and examines very carefully the veracity of the claims made in each notice, and in this instance Interpol did reissue a red notice in relation to a person. It is a simple statement of fact to say that from time to time Interpol notices are updated and amended.

          , I rise in relation to a point of order on relevance. I did not ask the minister about general statements that the minister for immigration had made. I asked the minister about a specific statement that the minister made yesterday, that statement being that, quite often, claims have been found to be wrong in relation to Interpol red notices. I contrasted that with the statement made by the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
           AFP
          </a>
          Deputy Commissioner, which was completely in opposition to that, and I asked the minister which statement he supported. I would therefore ask you to direct the minister to the question.

            , this is not a point of order. Senator Cash has taken the opportunity to express her views in what should be limited to a point of order. Senator Conroy was making general statements which are indeed relevant to the context of this question. Any suggestion that general statements rather than specific statements might be not relevant is ludicrous in this case.

             I took it that the minister had finished his answer. That was my interpretation of the minister sitting down. But, if there is a point of order, the minister, as far as I was concerned, had concluded his answer. So there is no point of order at this stage, Senator Cash. You have got the right to two supplementary questions.

              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">

              from August last year as a convicted jihadist terrorist did not pose a national security threat to Australia?

               Again, the opposition are engaging in serial, reckless fearmongering. We on this side of the chamber prefer to deal in facts, and I am happy to provide the opposition with the facts. First, a red notice is not an arrest warrant. Australian police cannot arrest a person solely on the basis of an Interpol red notice. There are a variety of Interpol notices for different purposes, including for persons who are wanted for extradition or who are simply subject to investigation. Interpol notices are even used to locate missing persons. A red notice can be issued for offences of a scale including issuing an unfunded cheque or causing bankruptcy. The Prime Minister has asked—

That is why the Leader of the Opposition is dressing up his proposed tough line on foreign criminals. We saw that trotted out on the weekend, when in fact what he is proposing is a watering down of current laws. That is right—a watering down of current laws.
