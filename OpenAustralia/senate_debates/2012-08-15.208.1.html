         The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) On 29 February 2021, MEAO Air Sustainment Aircraft suffered a heavy landing at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_Airport" rel="nofollow">
          Darwin Airport
         </a>
         , while en-route to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
          Middle East
         </a>
         . The heavy landing was assessed to be due to weather and wind effect. The aircraft completed the landing and proceeded to the terminal without further incident. No injuries were reported as a result of this event.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The replacement aircraft was dispatched to resume the service approximately 24 hours later, in accordance with contractual requirements. The aircraft suffering the heavy landing underwent technical inspection at Darwin.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         On 9 March 2012, this aircraft departed Darwin and recovered to a Lufthansa deeper maintenance facility for further detailed investigation and assessment. No damage to the aircraft was found as a result of the landing and it was cleared by the relevant Portuguese and European aviation authorities to resume service on 11 April 2012.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Transport_Safety_Bureau" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Transport Safety Bureau
         </a>
         continues on investigate the incident in accordance with its standards.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) The response made by the Minister for Transport and Infrastructure is correct in that no safety inspection of the MEAO contracted aircraft was made by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CASA" rel="nofollow">
          CASA
         </a>
         in relation to the hard landing incident. CASA has conducted a total of four safety inspections since contract commencement in November 2010 and full details are contained in the response to Question on Notice No. 113 taken from the Senate Additional Estimates hearing on 15 February 2012.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Australian_Transport_Safety_Bureau" rel="nofollow">

          ATSB
         </a>
         ) continues to investigate the incident in accordance with its standard procedures.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) Initial inspections were undertaken by the aircraft operator Licensed Aircraft Maintenance Engineers (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAME" rel="nofollow">
          LAME
         </a>
         ) in accordance with European and national aviation authority regulations. Further detailed inspection was undertaken by LAME at the Lufthansa maintenance facility. No damage was found to have occurred as a result of this incident.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) The aircraft was out of service for approximately six weeks, from 29 February 2012 until 11 April 2012. See response to part 1 above for further details.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (5) The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) is investigating the incident and a full report is expected in due course.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (6) As at 9 July 2012, the investigation by the ATSB was still ongoing. The report status can be monitored and a copy obtained from the ATSB website (www.atsb.gov.au)
