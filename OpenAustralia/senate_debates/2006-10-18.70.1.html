        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The speech read as follows—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It gives me great pleasure to introduce the Crimes Amendment (Victim Impact Statements) Bill 2006.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill seeks to amend part 1B of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimes_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Crimes Act
        </a>
        1914 to establish a means whereby victims of federal crimes against the person can make a victim impact statement to the court as a part of the sentencing process.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        At some point in the evolution of our criminal justice system, the victim fell out of the process and became somewhat marginalised in proceedings.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That is highly unfortunate, because when we are dealing with criminal offences against the person, if there is anyone who deserves a say it must surely be the victim.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A Victim Impact Statement is broadly “a statement containing particulars of any personal harm suffered by a victim as a result of an offence.”
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Given the proliferation of offences against the person in Commonwealth legislation, Labor believes it is time for a federal scheme of victim impact statements, so victims can be heard.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The genesis of this bill arose from the Senate’s work on the Criminal Code Amendment (Trafficking in Persons Offences) Act 2004, which dealt primarily with crimes of sex trafficking and sexual servitude.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Labor drafted an amending provision to the Crimes Act 1914 to provide for Victim Impact Statements for victims of sex trafficking offences. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Howard Government
        </a>
        , through Senator Ellison, indicated they did not support the amendments as they stood and Labor withdrew them, promising to revisit the matter at a later date.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That is exactly what Labor has done, and the bill before us presents a comprehensive approach to installing a system of Victim Impact Statements across the federal criminal regime, for offences where harm is suffered by a person.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Need for Victim Impact Statements
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        While the Commonwealth has no general head of power over crime or criminal laws, there are a number of specific areas of federal law that cover crimes against the person and the coverage of these areas have significantly expanded in response to increasing globalisation and terrorist activities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Many of these offences cover the range of human suffering and misery including slavery, child sex tourism, trafficking of persons for sexual servitude, war crimes, genocide and terrorism.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Federal criminal jurisdiction is vested in state and territory courts by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Judiciary Act
        </a>
        1903, while Part 1B of the Crimes Act 1914 (henceforth “the Act”) provides for the sentencing, imprisonment and release of federal offenders. The provisions arose from an amendment to the Act by the Crimes Legislation Amendment Act (no.2) 1990, and create a separate regime for federal offenders. This legislation has not been significantly revisited or updated since that time.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Part 1B of the Act does not make explicit provision for victim impact statements and the like, instead State and Territory law fills the gaps.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This is an unhappy situation for consistency in federal sentencing. Not all state jurisdictions have a formalised scheme of victim impact statements and there is wide variation across those that do—not only in form but on matters of substance, such as:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         the definition of victim,
        </li>
        <li>
         the types of offences in respect to which a statement may be made,
        </li>
        <li>
         whether there is provision for the victim to be cross examined in relation to the content of the statement, and;
        </li>
        <li>
         whether the victim can express an opinion in relation to the matter in which the offender ought to be sentenced.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        In the view of federal Labor, the present situation is not good enough. To ensure consistency in treatment of federal crimes (at least in respect of the issue of victim impact statements), it is therefore necessary to amend part 16 of the Crimes Act 1914.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Background to Federal Victim Impact Statements
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Labor’s drive for a scheme of Victim Impact statements has not been conjured from thin air.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There have been several well established milestones that have pointed the way forward towards a federal scheme of victim impact statements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
         UN
        </a>
        Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power (1985) endorses this approach.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Parliamentary Joint Commission on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Crime_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Crime Commission
        </a>
        (PJCACC)’s Response to Trafficking in Women for Sexual Servitude, June 2004 at page 52 also states:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Given the nature and effect of sexual trafficking offences on the victim, there is a compelling reason to require that victim impact be considered when sentencing offences.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Further at 4.36 the Committee:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … recommends that the following matters be examined in the legislative review announced as part of the Government’s package:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (including)
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … Adopting the use of victim impact statements in sentencing.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee’s Report into the Criminal Code Amendment (Trafficking in Persons Offences) Bill 2004 includes:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        3.27
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         The Committee
        </a>
        ’s view is that consideration should be given to the greater use of victim impact statements in the sentencing of federal offenders for certain types of offences, especially sexual offences involving children.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The ALRC Report, Same Crime Same Time: Sentencing of Federal Offenders (Report 103, released in April 2006) considers the issue of implementing a federal Victim Impact Statement scheme and recommends a model in which the federal scheme would apply to all federal sentencing receiving irrespective of whether the offence is summary or indictable and irrespective whether the victim is an individual or a corporation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition, the ALRC favoured an approach whereby:
       </p>
       <dl>
        <dt>
         (a)
        </dt>
        <dd>
         federal sentencing legislation makes comprehensive provision for the use of Victim Impact Statements in sentencing federal offenders; and
        </dd>
        <dt>
         (b)
        </dt>
        <dd>
         if
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_Territories" rel="nofollow">
          States and Territories
         </a>
         have laws about the use of victim impact statements that comply with specified federal minimum standards, those would be applied to the exclusion of the federal provisions.
        </dd>
       </dl>
       <p class="italic">
        Labor does not favour the ALRC scheme as it appears unnecessarily complex. The rationale for the report as a whole was to adopt a uniform system for the treatment of offenders across jurisdictions. Making the federal sentencing legislation a minimum standard would seem to run contrary to this premise.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To summarise the present position then: at the moment, use of victim impact statements for Federal criminal offences depend upon what State or Territory court the case is heard in. This is inadequate because the different states have different models.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It has been this government’s practice to leave the matter to the States.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is a general principle of justice that like are treated alike, but because federal offences are prosecuted through the State court hierarchy this is not being achieved. Only a federal scheme will achieve consistency.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Therefore Labor has proceeded to advance the victim’s rights agenda with this bill, which I shall now deal with in detail.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Provisions of the bill
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Clauses 1 though 4 set out some technical requirements of the bill—the short title, date of Assent, objectives of the bill and the amendments to the Crimes Act.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If we now turn to the Schedule, Item 1 inserts a new subsection into section 16A to include victim impact statements or victim reports in a list of matters to which the court may have regard when passing sentence.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Item 2 inserts a new section 16AA into the Crimes Act 1914. This section provides the basis for the new regime of victim impact statements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Subsection 1 sets out the definitions for the section.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A victim impact statement is an oral or written statement prepared by the victim of a crime for the court’s consideration in sentencing, setting out details of the harm suffered by the victim arising out of the offence. A victim report is a similar statement, but prepared by the prosecutor.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Harm is defined to include:
       </p>
       <dl>
        <dt>
         (a)
        </dt>
        <dd>
         Physical injury;
        </dd>
        <dt>
         (b)
        </dt>
        <dd>
         Psychological or emotional suffering, including grief;
        </dd>
        <dt>
         (c)
        </dt>
        <dd>
         Contraction or fear of contraction of a sexually transmissible medical condition;
        </dd>
        <dt>
         (d)
        </dt>
        <dd>
         Pregnancy suffered as a result of criminal activity (e.g. rape, sexual servitude);
        </dd>
        <dt>
         (e)
        </dt>
        <dd>
         Economic loss.
        </dd>
       </dl>
       <p class="italic">
        It should be noted that a rape victim, or a victim of child-sex tourism or a sexual servitude offence may consider a pregnancy suffered as a result of criminal activity to be a harm, regardless of whether they later decide to keep the offspring children who may result.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is intended that victim impact statements may only be received by a court where the offence involves an element of harm to a person, as per this definition and ss14.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Victim is defined to include:
       </p>
       <dl>
        <dt>
         (a)
        </dt>
        <dd>
         a natural person who suffers harm arising from an offence; or
        </dd>
        <dt>
         (b)
        </dt>
        <dd>
         where the person referred to in paragraph (a) dies as a result of the commission of the offence, a person who was a relative of, or who was financially or psychologically dependent on the person.
        </dd>
       </dl>
       <p class="italic">
        Access to the Victim Impact Statements regime set out in the bill is therefore restricted to natural persons.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Relative includes a relative according to Aboriginal tradition or contemporary social practice, a spouse or a de facto partner.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Subsection 2 provides that the victim of a crime will be notified that they are entitled to file a victim impact statement and given sufficient time for a statement to be prepared and ss3 provides for the creation of information guides for this purpose.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Subsections 4 and 5 provide for conditional contingencies where the victim may not be able to make a victim impact statement, while ss6 allows for the court to give permission for a person other than the prosecutor to present the statement. A Victim Impact Statement must either meet these requirements or be signed as per the proposed ss12.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Subsection 7 provides that the court shall take each victim impact statement and victim report into account in determining sentence, subject to the conditions of subsections 11, 12, 13 and 14. This is of course complementary to the amendment in item 1.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Subsection 8 allows the statement or report to refer to harms caused to the victim arising out of other offences in certain circumstances. This is necessary where for example the victim has suffered harm as a result of offences committed under both federal and State/Territory law. Both offences may be derived from the same harmful act and tried simultaneously, thus this provision is needed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Subsection 9 provides that the statement or report may contain a statement as to the victim’s wishes in respect of the order that the court may make in relation to the offence. This scheme is about hearing the victim’s voice so it is natural that such provision be made.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Subsection 10 provides that the court cannot draw inferences from the non-presentation of a statement or report, either in favour of an offender or against a victim. This ensures that presentation of a victim impact statement is a genuine matter of choice for the victim.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Subsection 11 provides that a Victim Impact Statement may be excised in whole or in part. It is intended that this discretion not be used to silence victims, but rather to maintain the dignity of the court and its proceedings. Examples could include where the statement is manifestly irrelevant or obscene or offensive in its content. In such instances, the court may strike out as it sees fit.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The offender should be made aware of the adverse impact of his or her actions on the victim, so accordingly ss13 ensures the offender gets the message. If the statement is oral, then a written or oral summary of the contents of the statement must be provided to the offender.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

         Conclusion
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Labor is proud of its work in strengthening Commonwealth legislation against criminals and terrorists but it is only half of the equation. The expansion of federal criminal legislation has naturally turned the focus of Federal Labor to the victims of crime and victim’s rights.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Labor has always been about building a caring society. It is a fundamental tenet of our philosophy that we do not believe in discarding people when their usefulness is finished.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Perhaps more than anyone else, it is the victims of crime who deserve a voice in the process of justice, yet that is not guaranteed for the victims of federal crime. Federal Labor has quietly been working away on this proposal for the best of a year to deliver a voice to the victims.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Labor cares about the victims of crime and commends this bill to all Senators, but particularly to the Minister for Justice, and those Government senators who served on either the Legal and Constitutional Committee on the Trafficking in Persons inquiry and those members of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission on the

        </a>
        inquiry. Your recommendations were in part the impetus for this bill so, I urge you to support its adoption in the Government party room and look forward to the Howard Government’s agreement to assist passage.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        With those words, I commend the bill once again to the Senate.
       </p>
       <p>
        I table the explanatory memorandum, and seek leave to continue my remarks later.
