            <p>
             I thank the senator for her question. I met with farmer representatives just today to discuss this issue, and certainly in my area there are plenty who have raised this issue with the government. That is why, during the election campaign, the government announced a review of the changes that were announced in last year's budget. We announced that we would provide relief to the sector for six months. During that campaign we announced that we would consult widely on any changes that might be proposed to us as a government and what changes could be afforded within the budget environment.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is an important change to be made to our migration and working holiday visa arrangements. I put on the record that the industry—and certainly the farmer representatives I met with this morning—recognise the need for change in this particular space. Given the changes that were made when the carbon tax came in, the tax-free threshold went up to $18,200, such that many workers on working holiday visas at the moment do not pay tax and do not contribute. I certainly believe that all Australians and non-Australians working here should contribute to our public service.

                I met with those farmers this morning, Senator Rice, and I listened to the concerns they have. The government has listened to those concerns. That is why we have announced this review and that is why we are consulting with the industry and meeting with farmers. We will make decisions shortly, once that review is complete. Those decisions will be announced before the end of the year, such that farmers can plan their business going into next year.

                   Farmers. Obviously I keep very closely in touch with those organisations in northern Australia, given my other ministry. I have met with many organisations over the past six months to discuss these issues. It was first raised with me in Bowen with the Bowen fruit and growers association. I am sure you realise, Senator Rice, that it has been a topic of conversation. But, as I said in answer to the previous question, the industry—the farming representatives themselves—recognise that there needs to be some change. The question for the government following this review will be what that change will be and how we can maintain our competitive and strong agriculture sector for the benefit of all Australians.
