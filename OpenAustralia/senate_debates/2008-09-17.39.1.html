        by leave—I congratulate Senator Joyce on his appointment as Leader of the Nationals in the Senate. I was not in the chamber when I understand he made that announcement this morning, so on behalf of the government I congratulate him on his election, wish him well and hope that his independent mind continues to be on display in his new role.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also acknowledge Senator Scullion’s performance as Leader of the Nationals in the Senate previously. His contribution to the Senate will no doubt continue, but I do appreciate the leadership he provided and the constructive way he did his duties. Also, on behalf of the Labor government, I acknowledge Senator Ellison’s announcement today that he is stepping down from the front bench. Senator Ellison has always been a worthy and decent opponent, and I wish him all the best for the future. I understand he is staying with us for a while, but I do acknowledge his service both as a minister and as a frontbencher for the Liberal Party.

         by leave—I join with Senator Evans in warmly congratulating Senator Joyce on his election as the Leader of the Nationals in the Senate. He has been a very strong advocate for rural and regional Australia in the three years that he has been in this place. He has made a big contribution to our coalition, both in government and in opposition, and I am sure he will be a great ally to us in our opposition to the great many faults of this Labor government. I look forward to working with him in opposition. I also join with Senator Evans in congratulating
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Scullion" rel="nofollow">
          Nigel Scullion
         </a>
         on his leadership of the National Party in the Senate. I thank him for his cooperation with us both in government and in opposition. I look forward to working with Senator Scullion in his role as Deputy Leader of the federal National Party, a role he will perform superbly.
        </p>
        <p>
         I also join with Senator Evans in acknowledging the tremendous role that Senator Ellison has played for the coalition as both Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate, the most difficult of tasks as those on the opposite side know. He has done it with great skill and endeavour and patience and tolerance, as well as being an outstanding minister in the previous government. I join with Senator Evans in wishing Senator Ellison a very happy and prosperous future.

          by leave—I spoke earlier about Senator Ellison but he was not here at the time, so I want to repeat that he is a good bloke. He has been very good to work with, very honourable and a very decent member of the Senate who has worked hard here. When the time comes, I wish him many post-Senate years of happiness. Senator Scullion, likewise, is a very good, friendly opponent and, on occasions, an ally to work with. We welcome Senator Joyce to the front bench.

             I do not know why there should be such merriment about this. Senator Joyce is a great advocate for rural and remote Australia. I think all Australians also recognise his ability to be very independent in adjudicating on decisions in this place and he is to be congratulated for that. I hope he enjoys the role that he has now been given.

              congratulates Senator Joyce on his appointment as Leader of the Nationals in the Senate. I do not know whether that means he moves from being a neighbour of mine in the same corridor, which was originally very quiet. Anyway, I wish him well on that. I also wish Senator Scullion well. I thank him for his work and linking in. Senator Ellison will be missed from the front bench.
