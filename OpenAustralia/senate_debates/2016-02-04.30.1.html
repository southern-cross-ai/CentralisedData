            First, the basis of establishing this inquiry to investigate school funding with particular reference to 'the impact of the cuts announced in the 2014-15 budget' is false. Since 2014, Commonwealth spending is providing higher levels of school funding than ever before: a record $69.4 billion in total Commonwealth funding over the forward estimates period, representing an increase funding of 27.3 per cent.
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_ABC" rel="nofollow">
             The ABC
            </a>
            <i>
             Fact Check
            </i>
            in 2014 concluded:

             The Government
            </a>
            did not cut $30 billion from schools in the May budget.
           </p>
           <p>
            Second, there has been a previous Senate inquiry: the Senate
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committee" rel="nofollow">
             Select Committee
            </a>
            on School Funding, which tabled its report
            <i>
             Equity and excellence in Australian schools
            </i>
            only in July 2014 and which covered similar areas. As that inquiry was very thorough—involving 3,000 submissions, and hearings in all states—running a similar inquiry so soon would be a considerable and questionable cost the taxpayer.
