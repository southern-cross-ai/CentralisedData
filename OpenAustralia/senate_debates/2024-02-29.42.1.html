        Senator Pocock moved a second reading amendment that referred to the introduction of a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPA" rel="nofollow">
         DPA
        </a>
        scheme, which is an important issue; however, it only went as far as saying it was worthy of consideration. I will be moving an amendment in the committee stage to formally, not just by way of a second reading amendment, amend the bill to ensure that a scheme is not just worthy of consideration but, indeed, adopted.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amendments that I have just moved, though—amendments (1) and (3) on sheet 2042—are in relation to a statutory review which the coalition has proposed as part of the bill. This is a very simple and sensible proposition. As I said in my speech in the second reading debate, we support the provisions of the bill that the government has put forward. These are sensible changes to the law which adopt coalition policy from the previous parliament. But we acknowledge, of course, that best practice in this space evolves over time. That is why we have proposed a statutory review. It is a straightforward solution to ensure that the measures are working as intended and it demonstrates our commitment to ensuring that our corporate criminal laws are appropriately calibrated in a rapidly changing world.

         Thanks, Senator Cash, for that contribution. The government will be supporting amendments (1) and (3). Under the deferred prosecution agreement scheme proposed by the former government, companies engaged in serious corporate crime, including foreign bribery, would have been able to negotiate a fine, agree to a set of conditions and have their cases put on indefinite hold, subject to compliance with that agreement. The government will entertain the introduction of a deferred prosecution scheme only after the measures introduced by this bill have been implemented and given time to work.
        </p>
        <p>
         We do, however, support amending the bill to include a statutory review provision whereby the amendments made by this bill will be reviewed after 18 months. A review will ensure that the measures introduced and debated today can be assessed after an appropriate period and guarantee that companies engaged in serious criminal wrongdoing, like foreign bribery, feel the full force of the law.
        </p>
        <p>
         I thank senators from the

         and Senator Pocock as well, who have indicated that they will support the review mechanism. The bill, with these amendments, shows the government's commitment to tackling corruption and, in particular, ensuring that our laws are effective in detecting, investigating and prosecuting foreign bribery.

          On behalf of the Greens, I indicate we support these two amendments—amendment (1) being a commencement provision and amendment (3) being the review of the operation of the bill's amendments. I was glad to hear in the government's contribution that the review of the operation of the amendments will also include consideration of deferred agreements. We supported Senator David Pocock's second reading amendment to the effect that a proper and prompt review of deferred prosecution agreements would be essential in looking at the efficacy of these amendments. We are grateful that the government is leaning into it. We would hope that the review would, as far as possible, have a public element and seek public submissions, but, in any event, we think a statutory review, which is tabled in the House, to see if what's promised is delivered is a very sensible step forward.

           Senator Pocock had brought forward a second reading amendment in relation to this particular issue, but, on this side of the chamber, we were not of the opinion that a DPA scheme in Australia is 'worthy of consideration'. We are actually of the opinion that this is an issue that should not be kicked down the road.
          </p>
          <p>
           Our amendment is not a second reading amendment. This is an amendment within the committee stage itself, so it does formally amend the bill. It would reinsert a deferred prosecution agreement scheme into the legislation. Why are we moving these amendments? It's because the evidence on this issue is impossible to ignore. When the Senate Legal and
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Affairs_Committee" rel="nofollow">
            Constitutional Affairs Committee
           </a>
           looked at this particular version of the bill, they had the benefit of weighty submissions by entities with a respected track record in integrity issues. The committee heard from the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniting_Church" rel="nofollow">
            Uniting Church
           </a>
           Synod of Victoria and Tasmania, Allens Linklaters, the Law Council of Australia and Transparency International Australia. The overwhelming position that has been put forward by these bodies is very, very clear. All of these bodies support a deferred prosecution agreement scheme. But it doesn't actually stop there. If you look at what Austrade said, Austrade itself was clear on its support for measures that incentivise self-reporting which, as we know, is exactly what a DPA scheme is intended to do.
          </p>
          <p>
           Of course the Senate has previously had the benefit of submissions from the Attorney-General's Department and the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Federal Police
           </a>
           again supporting a DPA scheme. The
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
            OECD
           </a>
           Council—the entity that is responsible for overseeing the antibribery convention that we're trying to implement through this legislation—has also expressly recommended that members implement non-trial resolutions and in this case a deferred prosecution agreement scheme. It doesn't stop there. The
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Institute_of_Company_Directors" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Institute of Company Directors
           </a>
           has also been clear on their support for a deferred prosecution agreement scheme. In fact, when you actually look at the evidence in relation to whether or not this legislation should be amended to include a deferred prosecution agreement scheme, the evidence is nearly unanimous. I would have to say that that is actually quite a rare situation, but it's not hard to see why when you actually read through the justifications for implementing a deferred prosecution scheme.
          </p>
          <p>
           The arguments for a DPA scheme like the one we have proposed are rooted in evidence, as I said. International experience from partners like the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
            US
           </a>
           , the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
            UK
           </a>
           , France, Canada, Singapore, Brazil and other countries show that DPA schemes have been highly successful in enforcing corporate criminal laws. They can achieve the same justice outcomes as a successful conviction. They allow punitive requirement of justice to be satisfied. Prosecutors usually secure significant penalties, sometimes involving fines that actually amount to billions of dollars. They also serve, obviously, the corrective purpose. They provide a mechanism that can drive changes to corporate behaviour through measures like enhanced compliance and monitoring programs to ensure the offending cannot happen again. They can also be used to assist in crime prevention and deterrence, for example, by requiring the company to cooperate in prosecuting individuals who themselves have committed offences.
          </p>
          <p>
           In addition to the above, deferred prosecution agreements have a number of other benefits. They actually incentivise self-reporting, which is a good thing. You actually want people or companies to self-report corporate entities who would otherwise face the uncertainty of litigation and unknown quantum of penalties. They also lead to an increase in detection and prosecution of foreign bribery; I personally would have thought that that was a good thing. The evidence shows that, far from being a get-out-of-jail-free card, they increase prosecutions. They assist law enforcement by freeing up resources to focus on other crimes, noting the average foreign bribery case in the OECD takes over seven years to prosecute. It may involve millions of documents from multiple countries and has uncertain outcomes.
          </p>
          <p>
           Contrast that with the deferred prosecution agreement. Looking at where deferred prosecution agreements have indeed been successful, in 2017 Rolls-Royce agreed to pay 671 million pounds in global penalties across various jurisdictions for systematic bribery to secure major contracts and falsification of documents. In 2020 Airbus agreed to pay 3.6 billion euros in global penalties under DPAs in multiple different countries for engaging in bribery in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka" rel="nofollow">
            Sri Lanka
           </a>
           , Indonesia, Taiwan and Ghana relating to corruption in the sale of aeroplanes.
          </p>
          <p>
           The scheme we are proposing by way of our amendments leverages the benefits I have just referred to. It was carefully put together by the Attorney-General's Department, working with the C
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPP" rel="nofollow">
            DPP
           </a>
           and the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
            AFP
           </a>
           , under the previous government. So the scheme we are putting forward is not something that has been dreamed up; it is something the Attorney-General's Department themselves put forward as the scheme that should be in place under this legislation, when we were in government. It also, importantly, includes safeguards. Under our amendments, both the Director of Public Prosecutions and an independent former judge, the approving officer, must be satisfied that the terms of a DPA are in the interests of justice and are fair, reasonable and proportionate. The DPA must also be satisfied it is in the public interest to enter into the DPA itself. Importantly—and this is a transparency measure—any deferred prosecution agreement must be published unless doing so would pose a threat to public safety, prejudice an ongoing investigation or fair trial or contravene a court order. The combination of external oversight and public transparency is intended to support public confidence in the proposed scheme.
          </p>
          <p>
           In light of these sorts of measures, the implacable refusal by the Attorney-General of Australia and the Albanese government to even consider the scheme, quite frankly, just doesn't make sense—given, as I said, the Attorney-General's Department, when we were in government, were the ones that worked with the CDPP and with the AFP and were the ones that put the scheme together. Arguments that Australia is somehow just not ready for a deferred prosecution agreement scheme do not stand up to scrutiny, in particular given the overwhelming weight of the evidence and, as I said, the evidence from so many bodies, which is highly unusual within itself. These are sensible, widely supported amendments that will benefit the Australian public, and I would hope that the government, and perhaps even the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Greens
           </a>
           , in the time we have before we vote on the amendments are able to give them some further consideration.
          </p>

           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
            Can I
           </a>
           just ask the minister this. Deferred prosecution agreement schemes are used effectively in comparable jurisdictions such as the UK, the US, Canada, France and Singapore, and there is considerable evidence highlighting their utility in the context of identified foreign bribery conduct. Why should Australia lag behind its overseas peers?

            Thanks, Senator Cash. We've made our position clear, as I outlined in my contribution in committee before. When ordinary Australians commit crimes they feel the full force of the law. However, under the deferred prosecution agreement scheme proposed by the former government, companies that engaged in serious corporate crime, including foreign bribery, would have been able to negotiate a fine, agree to a set of conditions and have their cases put on indefinite hold. The introduction of a
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPA" rel="nofollow">
             DPA
            </a>
            scheme should only be entertained after the measures in this bill have been enacted and given time to work, which is why we supported the original amendments. There is universal agreement that the existing foreign bribery offences in the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Code" rel="nofollow">
             Criminal Code
            </a>
            are grossly inadequate, and the government is of the view that the reforms in this bill further enhance Australia's implementation of its obligations under the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
             OECD
            </a>
            antibribery convention. Whilst a DPA scheme could encourage companies to self-report foreign bribery, there are existing mechanisms where a country can self-report conduct involving a suspected breach of division 70 of the Criminal Code. The

             Effectively, the answer from the minister is that Australia will just lag behind its overseas peers, because that answer did not address the fact that in comparable jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom, the

              OECD
             </a>
             takes over seven years to prosecute. It involves many millions of documents, which you've got to work through, and multiple countries, but it also has uncertain outcomes. When you have the deferred prosecution agreement scheme, you suddenly go from seven years down to getting an outcome. In relation to that success, 671 million pounds in global penalties was paid by Rolls-Royce in 2017. That was a successful

             </a>
             scheme. In 2020, Airbus paid 3.6 billion euro in global penalties in multiple different countries. The answer given by the minister does not stack up to the evidence that is actually on the record and, in particular, to the fact that they are already utilised in comparable jurisdictions, and they are getting outcomes. But Australia can just lag behind, and, perhaps later on down the track, we may or may not have a look at a deferred prosecution scheme.

             In the context of the failure to prevent offence and the bill's broad definition of an associate, which includes subsidiaries and contractors, a DPA scheme would provide an opportunity for a corporation to self-report in circumstances where it detects foreign bribery conduct by one of its associates. However, self-reporting would not compel the

              DPP
             </a>
             to offer a DPA. It would remain entirely at the DPP's discretion and could be pursued in parallel to a criminal investigation. Given this, why is the government opposed to a measure such as a DPA that could help combat foreign bribery?

               I'll indicate, on behalf of the Greens, that we won't be supporting these coalition amendments. We did support the second reading amendment, which indicated our preference for Australia to rapidly adopt a deferred prosecution agreement scheme but to do so after some rigorous review. The amendments that have been brought forward by the coalition, on face value, cover the bulk of the necessary elements for a successful deferred prosecution agreement scheme, but we haven't had the benefit of a thorough consideration of whether or not the offences that are covered by a
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPA" rel="nofollow">
                DPA
               </a>
               scheme, which are set out in proposed 17B, are the appropriate set of offences. On one view, they are too narrow. We've heard that from some stakeholders. Another view we've heard from stakeholders is that they're too broad. So we encourage the government to use the statutory review as a way of rapidly and promptly considering this and doing it with due process. I do hear Senator Cash's urging of alacrity on the government, saying: 'You should act now. You've waited too long.'

               I will share with the Senate a media release from Norton Rose Fulbright, one of the large global law firms. It says:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               The Minister for Justice … has announced that the Australian Coalition Government will today introduce new laws to establish a Deferred Prosecution Agreement as part of a raft of new reforms to Australia's anti-bribery and corruption regime. The introduction of these reforms comes ahead of International Anti-Corruption Day on Saturday and have been announced despite the Senate Economic References Committee being given a further extension to publish its report on the foreign bribery inquiry by 7 February 2018 rather than by 7 December 2017 …
              </p>
              <p>
               That media release is dated 6 December 2017. So what happened? What happened for five years under the coalition from 2017, when that was introduced? The coalition has been a little bit 'St Augustine' here: 'Oh Lord, give me a deferred prosecution scheme, but just not yet.' So let's get a little bit of historical perspective on some of this political debate. Hopefully, we all want to achieve a successful deferred prosecution scheme. Hopefully, we can use the statutory review to do it, and, hopefully, we can do it in less than seven years.

                Minister, you referred to the fact that there are ways in which companies can self-report. I note that there was a case that occurred last year where an agreement was entered into. It was reported by the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
                 Australian Federal Police
                </a>
                that a company called Oxiana Ltd, which became part of the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OZ" rel="nofollow">
                 OZ
                </a>
                Minerals Ltd group, had self-reported actions of foreign bribery in Cambodia, and an agreement had been entered into between that company and the Australian Federal Police. The guidelines for prosecutions were applied, and a total of $9.3 million was paid in both penalties and forfeitures under that agreement. So for all intents and purposes, that was a deferred prosecution agreement. But the difference is that it was made under guidelines which aren't part of the laws of Australia. Wouldn't it be better to have a deferred prosecution scheme made under a bill passed by this parliament, as opposed to agreements, as the agreement was made last year, under guidelines which have not been passed by this parliament?

Again, can the minister explain the logic of enabling deferred prosecution agreements under guidelines which have not been legislated, which has occurred during the course of this government—an agreement made for a deferred prosecution under this government, during the term of this government, by the Australian federal police, an agency of this government—as opposed to supporting a legislated scheme where this parliament imposes and considers the process, and the process is done in accordance with an act of law as opposed to guidelines.

                        Given that an agency of the government is already entering into deferred prosecution agreements, in effect under guidelines as opposed to law, how many other such agreements does the government propose its agencies will enter into before the review takes place? Will any other of these arrangements occur before this review takes place, as was the one entered into by

                          Minister, stakeholders have raised with me the fact that clause 3 of the guidelines, which I think were signed off on 8 December 2017—that was two days after that media release that I spoke to earlier—provide that the

                          will review the operation of the guidelines within two years, or earlier in the event that a deferred prosecution agreement scheme commences. That's now 6½ years ago. Have the guidelines ever been reviewed? Were they reviewed by the former government at any point? Have they been reviewed by your government at any point? They were novel, they didn't go through any external scrutiny process and they've now actually been tested, so have they ever been reviewed?

                            Regarding the comments that have been made about the former coalition government, let us be very clear: the coalition is the only party in this debate that has a consistent track record on this issue. The deferred prosecution scheme we proposed was reviewed by this Senate twice before and, despite the words of both the government and the

                            , was actually opposed and delayed by Labor and the Greens. We didn't have the numbers in the Senate. Hello, people! We did not have the numbers in the Senate. Had you wished to work with us to implement this, this could have previously been done and set up. Seriously, a lot of posturing going on about why certain things may not have been done. Both of those parties, Australian Greens and Labor, opposed it when we put it forward when we were in government.

                           <p class="italic">
                            The sophisticated, and organised nature of corporate crime makes it difficult to detect, investigate and prosecute corporate criminal offending, due to mechanisms that conceal conduct. There is a lack of incentive for corporations to cooperate particularly as it relates to obtaining evidentiary material held by the corporation, out of reach from law enforcement. Establishing a DPA scheme will enhance the prospects of cooperation with law enforcement and is expected to lead to greater opportunities to self-report together with providing an additional method for Commonwealth agencies to remediate criminal conduct as it relates to corporate entities or legal persons in Australia. This has the potential to free up investigative resources for other serious offending and provide a mechanism for corporations to address criminal conduct orchestrated by employees without damage to reputation and financial activities that may result from protracted and costly formal court proceedings and conviction.

                            Again, this is consistent with the Attorney-General's Department's statement, a submission to the Senate in 2017 and a similar submission by the AFP in 2020. These are unequivocal endorsements by the agencies responsible for investigating those offences. What has changed?

                             As I've explained consistently on this, the government will entertain the introduction of a deferred prosecution scheme only after measures introduced in this bill have been implemented and given time to work. That's been consistent from us. I do note, again, that you had a period in government where you could have pursued this. You never actually did it, and you continue to delay it now.

                              Again, Labor recommendation 1.20 in 2020 says, 'Schedules 2 and 3 should be deleted from the bill,' and schedule 2 was actually the deferred prosecution agreement scheme. We didn't have the numbers, so I find those words a little disingenuous.

                              The problem I have with the position of the government and the position of the Attorney-General is, as I have already stated, that we know that foreign bribery cases take years to prosecute. The figure that is usually quoted is about 7.3 years. Even if this bill passes this week, the commencement provisions mean it most likely won't fully come into force until, say, next year. Then, if we're generous and assume that the offences can be prosecuted in, say—I don't know—five years, as opposed to 7.3 years, then the soonest we would be able to know if these offences actually work is going to be in the 2030s, when you could accept an amendment which the body of evidence shows is already working well in other parts of the world in comparable jurisdictions. The Attorney-General's Department itself when we were in government supported it. The

                              supported it. The body of submitters to the inquiries over time have supported it. If we take the Attorney's words at face value, what Labor will have effectively voted for today is that they won't even entertain a

In its submission to the Senate committee—just to ensure that we hear all of the evidence in relation to why we should have a deferred prosecution agreement scheme in Australia, if you're actually serious here about combatting foreign bribery—this is what the

The reality is that in the absence of a DPA, many corporate crimes carried out by middle managers that would otherwise be self-reported to law enforcement agencies by the corporation itself will go—

                                .

                                DPA schemes have the potential to facilitate more expeditious resolutions of foreign bribery investigations and prosecutions. In our firsthand experience, major foreign bribery investigations can take five to ten years to resolve. The inherent uncertainty of outcomes inherent in contested criminal proceedings, and the risk proceeding to trial carriers for both a prosecuting agency and a corporate defendant is a major contributor to this. DPA schemes have the potential to create greater certainty of outcome for corporates, while ensuring appropriate penalties are still imposed.

                                When you look at the expert evidence received by the committee that looked at this bill, putting aside the other committees that have also looked into deferred prosecution agreements under the former coalition government, every single body that made a submission about this bill—bar one body, but they did not mention it—either supports or has supported a DPA scheme. What is the point of having the committee inquiry if the overwhelming body of evidence—all but one, who didn't mention it—says the government should implement a deferred prosecution scheme? It is a near-unanimous weight of evidence, yet what we have is a government that just says, 'We're not going to.'

                                I am sure the Attorney is well aware—he would have to be, because officers read the submissions and the Attorney-General's Department would have told him—of the widespread support for DPA schemes across the legal profession and also civil society. The truth is that this government is opposing good, sensible policy because, let's face it, it came from the coalition. Last time we were in government they didn't like it either. Now the government, particularly in relation to the body of stakeholders that put forward the evidence, is in the embarrassing position of having to explain to the Australian people why—because this is all about the Australian people and making sure they get back what they are entitled to—they can't enjoy the benefits of a policy that leads to an increase in prosecutions and better outcomes in fighting corporate crime. That is what we are talking about. We are talking about better outcomes in fighting corporate crime.

                                The sad reality—and this will shortly go to a vote—is that the Australian people are in that position because the

                                , particularly this Attorney-General, have put the political tactics of the Labor Party ahead of the interests of the Australian people. That is quite sad.

                                 We've got the rewriting of history from the coalition about why their bills were never brought on to a vote.

                                 were never tested on it and were always engaged in the deferred prosecution scheme, always engaged in the issue. A little lesson going forward: if you want to find out how parties will vote in the Senate, bring your bills on for a vote. The coalition never did.
