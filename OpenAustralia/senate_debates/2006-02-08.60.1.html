        My question is to Senator Santoro, the Minister for Ageing. Can the minister confirm that 31 December 2005 was the deadline for aged care providers to meet upgraded fire safety standards introduced in 1999? Can the minister confirm that, as at 19 January 2006, 36 per cent—53,000 residential aged care beds—failed to meet the deadline and do not yet meet the 1999 standards? Is the minister aware that his predecessor indicated last year that all nursing homes that failed to meet the 1999 standards by the deadline would have their certification reviewed? Is this still the government’s policy, and when will those reviews be carried out? Will non-compliant facilities be sanctioned in any way?

           I mean her question. I have been reliably informed by my department that there are only 10 nursing homes in Australia that do not fall within the accreditation and certification processes that have been referred to by Senator McLucas. I am more than happy to expand on that through a more detailed reply if she wishes.

            , I ask a supplementary question. I ask why the website has not been upgraded. Why was the website changed from 19 January to 23 December? As to those 10 homes, I think it would be appropriate that the information be tabled in this place as to which homes are not yet compliant with the 1999 fire regulations.

             I can assure the Senate and I can assure Senator McLucas that the performance of this government in terms of the issues referred to by Senator McLucas is exemplary compared to the previous government’s record. Senator McLucas asked me about the website, and I can assure Senator McLucas that immediately after this question time I will ask the question of my department. If the website needs to be updated, I will certainly arrange for that to be the case.
