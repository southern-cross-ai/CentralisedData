        Introduction
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Environmental offsets are measures that seek to compensate for the residual adverse impact of an action on the environment and achieve equivalent environmental outcomes. Under national environmental standards all reasonable steps should first be taken to avoid and then mitigate adverse impacts on the environment, before environmental offsets are considered.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Offsets can provide an important and scientifically-robust means to deliver environmental outcomes while achieving social and economic benefits associated with Australia ' s development.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Use of environmental offsets has grown over the past decade. Internationally, Australia is among a number of countries that have adopted the use of environmental offsets as part of the environmental assessment and approval process. Within Australia, the Commonwealth and all states have legislation or policies in place on environmental offsets.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC_Act" rel="nofollow">
         EPBC Act
        </a>
        ). The
        <i>
         EPBC Act environmental offsets policy (2012)
        </i>
        guides the use of offsets under national environmental law. The policy is accompanied by the
        <i>
         offsets assessment guide
        </i>
        , which is a metric that is used to determine the suitability of offsets for listed threatened species and ecological communities. It measures an offset against a relevant impact to determine whether the offsets proposal is suitable, and whether the net environmental impacts are acceptable.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The
        <i>
         EPBC Act environmental offsets policy
        </i>
        applies to all matters of national environmental significance protected under the EPBC Act with the exception of water resources in relation to coal seam gas and large coal mine developments, which was added as a new matter of national environmental significance after the release of the policy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The offsets policy applies to offsetting requirements in terrestrial and aquatic (including marine) environments and for both project-by-project assessments and strategic assessments approved under Parts 9 and 10 of the EPBC Act, respectively. The policy has had effect for all referrals made since 2 October 2012, and to projects that were undergoing assessment and had not had a proposed approval decision made by 2 October 2012.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The
        <i>
         EPBC Act environmental offsets policy
        </i>
        and the
        <i>
         offsets assessment guide
        </i>
        were released in October 2012. The policy and guide were developed following detailed research and stakeholder consultation. This included the release of a consultation draft for public comment, targeted stakeholder engagement with peak industry and environmental bodies and close collaboration with researchers from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_National_University" rel="nofollow">
         Australian National University
        </a>
        and University of Queensland through the National Environmental Research Program. The development of the policy also gave consideration to the Business and Biodiversity Offsets Program Standard on Biodiversity Offsets (2012).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The offsets policy articulates the role offsets play under the EPBC Act and how suitable offsets are determined. It makes a significant contribution toward the establishment of national standards for environmental offsets.

         One-Stop Shop
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government is working towards delivery of a One-Stop Shop for environmental approvals. States and territories will only be accredited when they can demonstrate that their processes meet high environmental standards. The standards are on the Department's website at http://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/40e7000f-4d52-47fe-9a61-ff2b321aec3b/files/standards-accreditation-2014_0.pdf. The standards are based on requirements of Commonwealth law and will facilitate the maintenance of environmental outcomes through the One-Stop Shop.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The standards specify that any offsets delivered through an accredited process must achieve long-term environmental outcomes for matters protected under the EPBC Act and be consistent with either the EPBC Act Environmental Offsets Policy, or another policy which achieves the objects of the EPBC Act to an equivalent or better level.1
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        has developed an assurance framework which will put in place arrangements to provide ongoing confidence to the Government and the public in the long term durability and effectiveness of the regulatory arrangements under the One-Stop Shop policy. This will provide a series of safeguards designed to provide ongoing confidence about environmental outcomes and the effectiveness of the regulatory system.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There remain opportunities to improve the implementation of offsets. Recent audit reports of offsets required as conditions of approval under the EPBC Act have identified issues in relation to ensuring protective mechanisms are attached to the title of a property in a timely fashion. There are a number of causes of these delays, including the complexities of negotiating with land owners for the protection and management of areas proposed as offsets as well as the legal complexities of registering a restrictive covenant on a title. There may be an opportunity for the Commonwealth to work with states and territories to streamline covenanting arrangements to achieve better outcomes for approval holders and the environment. The states and territories have responsibility for the legal mechanisms available to secure offsets and changing these mechanisms would ultimately be a decision for the states.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The policy and offsets assessment guide were scheduled to undergo a technical review one year after its release and a complete review of effectiveness against the aims of the policy every five years thereafter. The performance of the offsets policy against the stated objectives will be evaluated as part of these review processes. The one year technical review has been temporarily delayed to allow consideration of state and territory processes that may be accredited through the One-Stop Shop policy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The EPBC Act offsets policy also commits to the development of a register for offsets, and that once completed, that information on offsets be made publicly available where it is possible to do so. This work is currently being considered in the context of improved coordination and display of environmental information across the jurisdictions that will support the Government's One-Stop Shop policy.

The AFP and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (CDPP) appeared before the Committee at a public hearing held on 7 April 2014.

        Act). On 9 May 2014 AGD responded to these questions on notice.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee's report was published on 15 May 2014. The report makes nine recommendations relating to investigations in support of civil action under the POC Act.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In responding to the recommendations, the Government has taken advice from the following Commonwealth Government departments and agencies with responsibility for and expertise in matters relating to investigations in support of civil actions under the POC Act:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Agreed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government notes that the AFP provides training to investigators that focusses on proceeds of crime and asset confiscation. The AFP will refresh its training and investigative guidance resources to address more directly the nature of investigations in support of proceeds of crime actions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 2:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That, when making applications for search warrants under s 225 of the POC Act, the AFP presents all relevant information to the issuing magistrate, including full details of any other information gathering activities undertaken by the AFP in relation to the matter and whether such activities are ongoing.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Agreed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government agrees that when making applications for search warrants under the POC Act, the issuing officer should be presented with all relevant information.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As part of normal practice the AFP makes all relevant information available to issuing officers when making an application for a search warrant under the POC Act. The matters examined by the Committee in relation to this recommendation arose because quality assurance was not as stringent as it should have been in this specific instance. The AFP established the Investigations Standards and Practices portfolio in April 2014 to mitigate against this issue occurring again, and to ensure consistency against standards and practices within AFP investigations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Agreed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The AFP considers it best practice for its investigators to have with them copies of the relevant legislation when seeking the authorisation of warrants, orders or otherwise, from relevant judicial authorities under the POC Act. This is already part of AFP standard local procedures and has been reinforced through an all staff reminder issued on 21 May 2014.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 4:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Commonwealth Government investigates options for distinguishing literary proceeds matters from other matters under the POC Act with particular consideration given to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        -retaining literary proceeds matters within the POC Act, and amending the POC Act to distinguish clearly between literary proceeds matters and other proceeds of crime matters; or
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        - removing literary proceeds matters from the POC Act altogether and creating standalone legislation to deal with literary proceeds matters.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Noted.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Not agreed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government does not consider that distinguishing more clearly in legislation between literary proceeds matters and other matters under the POC Act would significantly assist law enforcement officers or a magistrate to fulfil their functions in relation to an investigation of a literary proceeds matter or further the policy aims of the POC Act. More effective support to literary proceeds investigations could be afforded by providing clear guidance to law enforcement officers and to magistrates regarding the protocols associated with investigations of literary proceeds matters. This will be achieved through implementation of recommendations 1–3 of the Committee's report.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In considering this recommendation, the Government has taken into account that creating a separate regime for literary proceeds orders—whether within the POC Act or in standalone legislation—would add to the complexity of legislation. Keeping literary proceeds orders with other kinds of orders within the POC Act aligns with the Government's commitment to legislative clarity.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Literary proceeds actions, like the majority of actions in the POC Act, are civil, rather than criminal in nature and the information-gathering mechanisms contained in these provisions are common across a range of civil proceedings. The name of the Act reflects the policy intent of the laws to ensure that criminals do not profit from their crimes, and does not imply criminality on the part of the companies that are party to investigations under the Act. The Government does not agree with the view expressed by the Committee that the name of the POC Act may give rise to the impression that any company investigated under its provisions must be involved in criminal activity.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Not agreed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government considers that in order for the AFP to conduct effective investigations under the POC Act, it is important that the AFP retains flexibility in the choice of investigatory tools it may employ. The full suite of information gathering and investigatory powers provided for under the POC Act should be available to the AFP in investigations of proceeds of crime matters. The Government considers that implementation of this recommendation would potentially hamper investigations of proceeds of crime matters.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government also considers that it is possible that in some circumstances, issuing a production order prior to obtaining a search warrant is likely to prejudice an investigation by putting a person on notice that they are being investigated, thus giving them the opportunity to move their assets out of the reach of law enforcement.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 6:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Commonwealth Government investigates options for introducing enforceable undertakings powers as an option available to law enforcement agencies during literary proceeds investigations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Not Agreed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        At a hearing before the Committee on 7 April 2014, the AFP indicated that it was open to considering the viability of introducing enforceable undertakings in literary proceeds investigations. Such undertakings, which would be voluntarily entered into, would require an organisation to notify the AFP that it has granted, or will grant, a benefit to a person who the AFP suspects has committed a relevant offence. Following this consideration, the AFP has determined that enforceable undertakings would be of no operational benefit in literary proceeds matters. The process of negotiating an enforceable undertaking is likely to be complex and would require both the AFP and the relevant organisation to expend considerable time and resources, particularly as the commercial interests of an organisation in publishing a story are unlikely to align with the aims of a POC Act investigation to prevent the flow of literary proceeds.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As a result of these complexities, negotiating an enforceable undertaking is unlikely to be a viable option for either police or media organisations, especially in circumstances where the payment of literary proceeds is imminent. Delay caused by protracted negotiations is likely to impede and frustrate the ability of the AFP to lawfully acquire information relevant to the payment of literary proceeds.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Not agreed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government considers that implementing this recommendation would introduce further impediments to investigations of proceeds of crime matters and would frustrate the ability of the AFP to lawfully acquire information during investigations of proceeds of crime matters.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Any person or organisation that is party to a police investigation is required to comply with relevant laws. The Government does not support creating specific arrangements for media organisations, as distinct from other organisations or individuals, during investigations of criminal matters. In order to effectively investigate suspected criminal behaviour, it is important that the AFP should have timely access to all relevant information, irrespective of the nature of the organisation that is in control or possession of that information. The introduction of enforceable protocols during investigations by the AFP may also generate uncertainty concerning the interaction of such protocols with existing obligations under the POC Act.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 8:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The AFP and relevant media and publishing stakeholders develop guidelines to be observed during the execution of search warrants on the premises of media organisations in circumstances where a claim of journalists' privilege is made.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Agreed in principle.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Journalists' privilege is currently recognised in section 126H of the
        <i>
         Evidence Act 1995
        </i>
        (Cth), which provides protection for confidential journalists' sources during court proceedings, and ensures that journalists and their employers cannot be compelled to identify a confidential informant in court.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In considering this recommendation, the Government has noted that the privilege enjoyed by journalists is not the same as legal professional privilege. Whereas legal professional privilege applies during investigations of criminal matters, journalists' privilege does not apply during criminal investigations. Journalists' privilege in Australia is a product of evidence law, and is relevant to the admissibility of evidence in court proceedings only.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The AFP will work with relevant stakeholders to develop a search warrant execution protocol. The protocol would apply only in circumstances where a journalist has agreed with an informant to keep the informant's identity confidential. Generally speaking, the journalist's source in a literary proceeds matter will be known to the AFP, because it is the exploitation of the individual's criminal notoriety that is the basis for seeking the literary proceeds order. For this reason, the protocol would also apply only where the informant is not the subject of the proceeds of crime investigation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Not agreed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As noted above, journalists' privilege in Australia is a product of evidence law and is only relevant to the admissibility of evidence during court proceedings
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government considers that this recommendation, if implemented, would in practice elevate journalists' privilege to the same status as legal professional privilege in that the status of the material subject of the claim would need to be adjudicated by a court prior to any access by investigators. Implementing this recommendation would introduce further impediments to the investigation of proceeds of crime matters, and therefore frustrate the ability of the AFP to lawfully acquire information during such investigations.

        Noted. The economic base for Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands is extremely narrow and the opportunities to diversify are limited.

        Noted. The former Quarantine Station on West Island is not currently being utilised to accommodate illegal maritime arrivals and has not been required for this purpose since October 2013. Therefore, there is currently no operational need for cyclone shelter facilities on this site. Notwithstanding this, contingency plans have been developed for use in the event of a cyclone or extreme weather event on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands.
