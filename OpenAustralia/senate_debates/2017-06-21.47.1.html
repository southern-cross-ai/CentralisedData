        SA, is a woman-led internationally renowned specialist service with decades of experience. This crucial frontline service currently delivers the 1800RESPECT hotline for victims of DV and sexual assault, but they are at risk of losing their funding under a tender by Medibank Health Solutions—a highly profitable private company. Can you, right now, rule out any funding cut for RDVSA, and will the government step in if

         , the current provider of 1800RESPECT, has commenced a tender process, as Senator Waters outlined, for the trauma specialist counselling component of the service. MHS is responsible for this subcontracting arrangement under its contract with the department to deliver 1800RESPECT. MHS has included a sector expert with a background in domestic and family violence helpline services and an independent probity officer on the evaluation panel. In late May this year MHS advised the department that it had agreed to an extension of the current contract with Rape and Domestic Violence Services Australia until the end of October this year. This will ensure that all callers will continue to have access to trauma specialist counselling while MHS conducts negotiations in good faith to finalise the outcome of the tender.

         I do not have a direct answer to the question Senator Waters asked. I am sure she will appreciate that. I am not in a position to rule in or out a matter outside my direct portfolio. I will seek further information and come back to the Senate.

           I appreciate the minister taking that on notice. I am very much looking forward to his response. There have been reports of a spike in complaints about 1800RESPECT due to flaws in the new triage model implemented by

            MHS

            I do have some data on performance of the 1800RESPECT line. The most recent figures show that, since the introduction of the first response triage model in mid-August last year, 73 per cent of calls have been answered within 30 seconds. Data from
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHS" rel="nofollow">
             MHS
            </a>
            from mid-August to the end of March this year shows that approximately 30 per cent of callers required intensive support provided by trauma specialist counsellors. MHS data on call-out shows that of the remaining callers 38.1 per cent received information, 34 per cent of callers received initial trauma informed counselling and education and 19 per cent received information about provider options. There are some other smaller categories, which time precludes me from going through. The remaining callers were referred to R

                   have announced that they have projected a doubling of profits from their health call centre services, including 1800RESPECT. Why does the government believe that it is acceptable that private companies can profit from domestic violence and sexual assault services?

                    Quite frankly, I do not think it is fair or reasonable to try and load a question about the role of profit-making enterprises in the health sector in such a way. I do not think it is appropriate.

                      I do not see an issue, Senator Waters, with people making a profit from providing a service, because everywhere else in our community and across our economy that has proven to drive improvements in service. There is no problem whatsoever with someone making a profit out of a health service. I do not think it is appropriate or reasonable to load the question. I know the Greens do not like profit making in health. I know they do not like profit making in a whole range of the economy. Indeed, the Greens have done their best to destroy profit making right across the economy. But the government does not have a problem with profit-making enterprises fulfilling the terms of contracts, as long as they do what they commit to in those contracts.
