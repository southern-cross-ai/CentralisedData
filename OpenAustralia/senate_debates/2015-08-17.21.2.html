        My question is to the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis. I refer to the Attorney-General's statement in the Senate last Thursday that the Liberal Party function known as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Garfield_Barwick" rel="nofollow">

             bar. So I do not doubt for a moment that there is a Liberal Party connection to the Sir Garfield Barwick lecture—of course there is, because it is being promoted by an entity within the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party—but the audience to which it is promoted is not Liberal Party members but barristers.

             Lastly, the lecture, or the event, is run at cost price. No profit is made from the lecture at all. No funds are raised, and I would not describe something as a fundraiser at which no funds are raised.

              Liberal Party director Tony Nutt's statement that the surplus from this event would have been 'a couple of hundred dollars' and that the suggestion that the event constitutes 'a significant fundraiser' is 'ridiculous'. Does the Attorney-General agree with

               No, I do not agree with that characterisation at all, as a matter of fact. I do not, because if you read
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Nutt" rel="nofollow">
                Mr Nutt
               </a>
               's statement, from which you have selectively quoted, you would see that Mr Nutt has made an inquiry of the venue provider and has established that the cost per ticket was $80 and the cost of providing the dinner was between $74 and $75 per seat. Therefore, Senator Conroy, you may think that to budget with a small surplus of $3, $4 or $5 constitutes a fundraiser; I do not. In fact, I would have thought that, if you were organising an event not designed to run at a profit but not designed to run at a loss either, you would build in a very small margin of a couple of dollars.
