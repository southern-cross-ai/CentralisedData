        My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Gallagher. In May last year, Prime Minister Albanese committed the Labor government to having 'real, lasting plans for cheaper mortgages'. Given Australian families have now faced 11 interest rate rises since the election of a Labor government, can the minister report progress on the government's real and lasting plans for cheaper mortgages?

           Thank you for that interjection, Senator Birmingham, but it is part of a broader suite of policies that relate to Labor's housing agenda, of which the Housing Australia Future Fund is one. We have one of our signature policies, the Housing Australia Future Fund, a $10 billion fund, being blocked by those opposite, who refuse to acknowledge that the Commonwealth has a role to play in housing policy. This is not my portfolio area, of course, but I'll take the question—

             Thank you, Senator Smith. I think by definition mortgages go to housing. The minister is being relevant. But I will listen carefully and, if she is not relevant, I will draw her to your question.

              We went to the election with a very significant policy in relation to housing. It had a number of different features. We had the $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund. We have the negotiations that we are having with the states and territories on national housing and homelessness agreements. In the budget, we included incentives to increase the build-to-rent accommodation. We have an additional $2 billion in financing for community housing providers. We have the recent social housing accelerator, another $2 billion. We have the Commonwealth rent assistance increase, the largest increase in 30 years.

We have the help-to-buy scheme, which is a program to support eligible Australians on low to moderate incomes to purchase their own homes with a smaller deposit, which will result in smaller mortgages and smaller mortgage payments. We're working with states and territories on that.

                       Well, no. You do need to take responsibility for the fact that the Commonwealth completely vacated the field, particularly in relation to public, social and affordable housing, and it was about just letting the market rip. We are back at the table, working with the states and territories, and the program that the Prime Minister is referring to—

                             There's a lot in that to unpack, but the government is implementing all of the policies it took to the election, including the Help to Buy scheme, which we are working with states and territories on. This is why the cost-of-living package that we brought in through the budget and otherwise has been so important to assist those households who, we acknowledge, are under pressure because of rising interest rates, because of high inflation and because of the impact of the global economy on some of our supply chains, which is feeding the inflation issue in the country. We accept that that is the case. That is what's happening in the economy and is why, when we brought here $3 billion worth of energy bill relief support and you voted against it, we couldn't believe it. You actually voted against people receiving cost-of-living relief in an environment where they're doing it tough. This government will deliver on all the things we said at the election, and we will do more, as we have been doing since we formed government.
