        I present the 149th report of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_of_Privileges" rel="nofollow">
         Committee of Privileges
        </a>
        entitled
        <i>
         Person referred to in the Senate, Mr
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ergas" rel="nofollow">
          Henry Ergas
         </a>
         .
        </i>
       </p>
       <p>
        Ordered that the report be printed.
       </p>
       <p>
        by leave—I move:
       </p>
       <p>
        That the report be adopted.
       </p>
       <p>
        This report is the 63rd in a series of a reports recommending that a right of reply be afforded to persons who claim to have been adversely affected by being referred to in the Senate either by name or in such a way as to be readily identified. On 15 October 2011, the President received a submission from Mr Henry Ergas relating to an interjection made by Senator Conroy during questions without notice in the Senate on 13 October 2011, which was recorded in the
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        . The President referred the submission to the committee under privilege resolution No. 5. The committee considered the submission at its meeting on 3 November 2011 and recommends that the proposed response be incorporated in
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee reminds the Senate that in matters of this nature it does not judge the truth or otherwise of statements made by honourable senators or the persons referred to; rather, it ensures that those persons' submissions and ultimately the responses it recommends accord with the criteria set out in privileges resolution No. 5. I commend the motion to the Senate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Question agreed to.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         The response read as follows—
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On Thursday 13 October, 2011, Senator Conroy made the following statement in the Senate:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        "Henry Ergas went bankrupt".
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This statement is completely incorrect and has no basis in fact. It is plainly derogatory and had it been made outside Parliament, would have given rise to proceedings for defamation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I therefore request that a correction be promptly entered in Hansard stating:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        "Senator Conroy's statement is completely incorrect and has no basis in fact."
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Yours sincerely,
       </p>
