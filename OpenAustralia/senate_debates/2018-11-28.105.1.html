        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Cormann. For over 12 months, the government has resisted Labor's calls for the establishment of a national integrity commission. On Monday, the Prime Minister declared the establishment of a national integrity commission a fringe issue. Does the Prime Minister stand by that statement?

         What the Prime Minister has consistently said is that it's very important we have effective measures in place to fight corruption. Of course, in Australia, traditionally, under governments of both political persuasions, we have had a multi-agency framework in place to ensure that corruption is appropriately detected and dealt with. Now, we've always said, consistently, that we're always open to suggestions and ideas on how these current arrangements can be further improved.

           We've got all these interjections. Senator Collins is not interested in an answer. We know that Mr Shorten announced a headline about a year ago saying that that was based on 12 months of consultation, but we haven't actually seen a single draft bill. We haven't seen any detail to deal with some of the complex issues that have to be dealt with in this context. We know, of course, the legislation that has been put forward by the crossbench, and, to their credit, at least they have gone to the effort of putting forward a bill, but there are a whole range of issues, complexities and problems with that, so we are currently considering the best way forward.
          </p>
          <p>
           Any change actually has to improve current arrangements. Every change actually has to make things better. Just making change for the sake of change is not the right way forward. I might also just say that Australia, under governments of both political persuasions, internationally has a very good track record when it comes to the fighting and the prevention of corruption. Australia has got a very good track record, by international standards, and we will continue to ensure that whatever reforms are pursued make the current arrangements better and more effective rather than cause a whole range of undesirable problems.

             It's been 14 months since the Senate committee reported on this issue—a comprehensive report proposing clear ways forward. Minister, why did the government vote in the House of Representatives to support the establishment of a national integrity commission only two hours before Prime Minister Morrison declared it a fringe issue? Does the government support the establishment of a national integrity commission—yes or no?

              Again, all we've had from the Labor Party is the announcement of a headline about 12 months ago without any detail. What the government has said is that we are always open to considering suggestions for improvements. We are carefully assessing all of the available options, and we'll make announcements in due course.

                The Prime Minister voted against the banking royal commission 26 times before claiming it was his idea. He supported the National Energy Guarantee before opposing it. He opposed the national integrity commission and now he says he supports it while he declares it a fringe issue. How is this consistent? How can Australians know when the Prime Minister is actually committed to something as opposed to just pretending?
