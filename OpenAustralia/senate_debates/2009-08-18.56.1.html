        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Sherry. Is the government proposing to proceed with opening an additional 10,000 square kilometres of the Western Deepwater Trawl Fishery and the North West Slope Trawl Fishery, off the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia

         Thank you, Senator Siewert, for your question and the notice you gave. We did anticipate that there would be a question on this, given your comments on the matter over the last few weeks. I am advised by the minister, Mr Burke, that he has been assured by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Fisheries_Management_Authority" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Fisheries Management Authority
         </a>
         , known as
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFMA" rel="nofollow">
          AFMA
         </a>
         , that it is working hard to resolve the issue with its
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         n fishery colleagues. There is and has been a good working relationship on matters of seabed boundaries in respect of fisheries between the Commonwealth, through AFMA, and all states, and that includes Western Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am aware, Senator Siewert, of your recent comments regarding the Commonwealth’s so-called proposals to change fishing boundaries. Unfortunately, these comments do not reflect a full appreciation of the issues that are currently before AFMA and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australian
         </a>
         government. In 2007, as an interim measure, AFMA made a temporary closure to the North West Slope Trawl Fishery for two years while the boundary listed within the Offshore Constitutional Settlement, known as the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCS" rel="nofollow">
          OCS

           I will get to the so-called mistake in a moment. I am sure you will have a couple of supplementary questions. The intent of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCS" rel="nofollow">
            OCS
           </a>
           that I have just referred to, the offshore settlement, whilst the boundary issue is being considered, is for the Commonwealth to manage trawl fishing in waters deeper than 200 metres and for
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            Western Australia
           </a>
           to manage all other types of fishing in waters shallower than 200 metres. Since 2008,

            , I ask a supplementary question. I ask the minister if the government is aware of opposition to this opening from the fishing industry? Is the government further aware that the North West Slope Trawl expansion would impact on coral reefs and sponge gardens, that it is in fact up to 1,500 metres, not 200 metres, that key species in the Western Deepwater Trawl have been identified as overfished and depleted and that the WA Department of Fisheries believes that the proposals carry significant risks to the sustainability of fish stocks and fisheries in WA? Has the government sought any environmental assessment of the proposal to expand these fisheries to allow bottom trawling?

             The central issue here is the definition of the boundary, as determined by the 200-metre isobath, and, in effect, the waters inside the 200-metre isobath and those outside the 200-metre isobath. Those waters inside the 200-metre isobath are in the state jurisdiction. Those outside the 200-metre isobath are in the federal jurisdiction, as managed by
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFMA" rel="nofollow">
              AFMA
             </a>
             . That is the central issue here.

              Geoscience Australia
             </a>
             are the appropriate organisation to determine the boundary and what is inside and outside the 200-metre isobath. The issue revolves around where exactly that 200-metre isobath falls.

I would like to note that the minister did not answer, at all, the question I just asked about whether there was going to be any assessment of the environmental impact this proposal will have on the sustainability of the fisheries and the sustainability of the environmental qualities of those particular areas. So I will ask it again.
