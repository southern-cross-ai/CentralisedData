        My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Wong. I refer the minister to the government's spending priorities for rural and regional Australia in the upcoming May budget. Is the minister aware of the Rural Australia Medical Undergraduate Scholarships, known as RAMUS, which were introduced by the previous coalition government in the year 2000? Given that the RAMUS scheme provides scholarships for students from rural and regional areas to study medicine and become doctors and the fact that more than 1,800 scholarships have been awarded since the program was introduced, will the minister guarantee that the government will not cut funding for this program in the upcoming May budget?

         First, this government is the greatest supporter of regional Australia this nation has seen in a very long time. We have put more money into regional health and regional infrastructure than you ever managed to get out of the Liberal Party. The National Party really have to be known as the doormats, because they never managed to get this sort of investment into regional Australia when they were in government. They never managed to get the great

           I am asked to guarantee, rule in or rule out. Firstly, I will guarantee that we will ensure that we properly cost and fund our policies. We will ensure that our budget adds up. We do not have $70 billion of cuts to services including in regional Australia, unlike those opposite. We will go through the proper budget process and no-one in this chamber would expect any minister to come in and do a rule-in rule-out when it comes to the budget. I can tell you this: we do not have $70 billion worth of services to cut, which is what the opposition has.

             . For example, in terms of the budget, we committed $3.2 billion to health infrastructure projects with 37 per cent going to regional areas. Just recently, I understand that the Regional Priorities Round of the Education Investment Fund of $500 million has been opened. I would have thought that the National Party would have welcomed that. But no, you do not want to welcome it, do you, even though it is going to the people you represent because you cannot bear the fact that it is a Labor government which has delivered these initiatives for regional Australia.

                    , we have a primary question which dealt with rural health; then we had a supplementary question that dealt with Roads to Recovery—completely outside the primary question, not even close to the primary question. I know that Senator Wong could answer the question, but the point I make is this: it should be ruled out of order. Why? Because those from the other side have continued to raise the issue that this side when answering questions may not be directly relevant. I refute that, but on the basis that they raise that issue then they should maintain that the supplementary question is part of the primary question.

                      I am interested that the coalition appear to believe that somehow a question about a roads program is a supplementary to a question about health. I would ask you,
