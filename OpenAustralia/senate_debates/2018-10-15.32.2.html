        My question is to the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Fifield. In response to damning allegations of political interference with the ABC, the minister asked the secretary of his department to undertake an inquiry to establish the facts. Given the minister's direct personal involvement in the scandal, did his secretary ask questions of the minister in relation to allegations of political interference with the ABC and, if so, what was the substance of those questions?

         Thank you, Senator Wong, for your question. As colleagues know, I asked the Secretary of the Department of Communications and the Arts to undertake an inquiry, following newspaper articles that raised issues in relation to the independence of the ABC. I was asked at a doorstop interview whether the secretary of the department would be talking to me. I indicated that he was perfectly at liberty to talk to me. I have indicated to the secretary that which is consistent with the advice of the former managing director and the former chair to the secretary of the department, which is that I in no way, shape or form have ever sought to influence employment matters at the ABC and I never would.

           What did the minister and former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull say in the meeting with former ABC chair Justin Milne that left Mr Milne with the clear impression that the

            Thank you, Senator Wong. I do not know what was in the mind of Mr Milne. I can't put myself in someone else's mind. It's not something I've yet been able to achieve. But let me make absolutely clear that this government has never linked ABC funding or ABC budget measures and editorial matters at the ABC.

              The point of order is relevance. The question is: what did the minister say? I didn't ask what Mr Milne thought; that is on the public record. What did the minister say that left Mr Milne with that impression so that he undertook the action which he did, which was to seek the sacking of a journalist?

                I'm very happy to give Senator Wong a flavour of the discussion. No media organisation is perfect. All media organisations should continually strive to be their best selves, including the ABC. The former Prime Minister has said privately the same as he has said publicly, as have I, which was that concerns about the ABC don't relate to bias. They relate to factual errors, and the ABC should always seek to be—

                      Just because Senator Wong keeps repeating something does not make it true. You can't come into this place and keep repeating things that are not true. As I have made extremely clear, I have always respected the independence of the ABC. I have never sought in any way, shape or form—not hinted nor intimidated in any way in relation to ABC staffing matters.
