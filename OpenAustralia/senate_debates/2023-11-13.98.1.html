        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. On Friday night, the Jewish Shabbat, pro-Palestinian protests turned violent and forced the Jewish congregants at a nearby synagogue to return home for their own safety. The Jewish Community Council of Victoria, said that the violent incident 'impacted on Jewish life in Melbourne and created a heightened sense of fear and anxiety in our community.' On Saturday a pro-Palestinian motorcade deliberately drove through Sydney's

         Eastern Suburbs
        </a>
        in actions that cannot be interpreted in any way other than to intimidate Australia's Jewish community. Has the Prime Minister spoken with representatives of the Jewish community since these incidents? And what actions has the Albanese government taken since Friday night to better ensure the safety of

         first say that I thought the events that we saw in Caulfield were utterly unacceptable, and they must not be repeated. I was also concerned about some of the footage of the events in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Suburbs" rel="nofollow">
          Eastern Suburbs
         </a>
         of Sydney that you reference. In relation to what occurred in Caulfield, we know—and you have seen that I've said this publicly, Senator—that having a protest near a synagogue was not the right thing to do. It shouldn't be repeated, and the organisers have apologised, which is the right thing to do.
        </p>
        <p>
         I again want to reaffirm publicly—you asked what we've done, and I will repeat what I've said publicly, including yesterday—that the Jewish community in this country has a right to feel safe and to be safe. All Australians have a right to feel safe and to be safe. And no-one in this country should be fearful because of who they are or the faith they practise. We have been very clear, including in this chamber, that there is no place for hateful prejudice in our society, that there is no place for anti-Semitism, that there is no place for racism and that there is no place for Islamophobia. So, I understand how those events have been extremely difficult for members of the Jewish community. I understand how distressing the current conflict is for a lot of Australians, and I reiterate what I said yesterday: let us not let distress turn to division.

            I'm not sure what you mean by the suggestion 'link'. We take a consistent position, and I think you know me well enough, Senator Paterson—I take a consistent position, where I stand and the government stands against all prejudice and all racism. That was a particularly upsetting and frightening event, and I think that the organisers apologising is the right thing to do. But I won't make an apology for always standing against all forms of prejudice and racism; we should. We should be clear in this country: no-one should feel fearful because they are a member of the Jewish community and they practise the Jewish faith, no-one should be fearful because they are a practising Muslim, no-one should be fearful because they are an

              While, appropriately, standing against hate crimes or acts of any sort, will the government undertake not to draw false equivalences in the future and to unequivocally condemn antisemitism when it occurs, as it should unequivocally condemn any other hate crime or act when it occurs?
