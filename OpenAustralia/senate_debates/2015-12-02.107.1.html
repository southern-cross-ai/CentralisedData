        My question is also to the Minister Assisting the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Minister Cash. As a senator, I regularly visit rural and regional Queensland to meet and talk with people in local communities. Last week I toured businesses and community groups in Cairns, Townsville and Mackay. The main issue affecting the region is of course lack of jobs.
       </p>
       <p>
        I spoke with abattoir workers from a rural town where many people are out of work and want jobs. The local abattoir, which should be the main employer for the town, is employing few locals. Instead, 75 per cent of the workers are 457 visa holders who are brought in, because they are cheaper to employ. What is the government doing to stop the rorting of the 457 visa system to ensure Australians are given the first opportunity to secure jobs across our country?

             <p>
              I thank Senator Lazarus for his question. In the first instance in answering your question, the government always believes that, where there is an Australian who is ready, willing and able to undertake a job, an employer should always look to that person first. That is the basic principle under which this government works.
             </p>
             <p>
              In relation to employment growth under this government, since the government came to office in September 2013, the level of employment has risen by 3.2 per centâ€”that translates into approximately 366,400 jobs. So there has been a rise in employment growth under this government.
             </p>
             <p>
              In relation to the 457 program, you will also be pleased to know that, under this governmentâ€”compared to the former governmentâ€”there has been a decrease in the number of 457 visa holders in Australia. Under the former governmentâ€”Minister O'Connor, in particularâ€”there was a rapid escalation in the number of 457 visa holders coming to Australia and it peaked at approximately 110,000. Under this government, you have seen a decrease in the number of those people.
             </p>
             <p>
              In relation to the exploitation of any workerâ€”and your question is also about foreign workersâ€”we do not tolerate the exploitation of workers. I know that you have previously asked questions about a dob-in lineâ€”and certainly the government does have a particular line that people are able to call, if they believe that exploitation of workers is occurring.
             </p>
             <p>
              So, in answer to your question, Senator Lazarus, where there is an Australian who is ready, willing and able to perform a job, we absolutely stand by the principle that an employer should look to them first. Where there is no-one, we believe that there does need to be a program, because an employer who has no-oneâ€”

               , I ask a supplementary question. I understand the government has lists which are used for the issuing of 457 visas and special purpose visas. How often are these lists reviewed against Australia's national interests, jobs, information and the employment needs of rural and regional communities across Australia?

               <p>
                Thank you, Senator Lazarus. I believe you may be referring to the skills lists. You will be interested to know that when I was the Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection there was a body referred to as MACSM, the Ministerial Advisory Council on Skilled Migration, which is a body which represents not just employers but unions as well. In fact, Ged Kearney, the head of the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACTU" rel="nofollow">
                 ACTU
                </a>
                , is on this body. MACSM is looking at the varying skills lists that are chosen when looking for 457 visa holders. The 457 visa program is very much a demand driven program. So if there is a shortage somewhere and the skill is on the relevant skills list, the employer is, subject to fitting in with all the criteria, able to bring someone in. But going back to the general premiseâ€”

Given there appears to be clear evidence of rorting and of employers doing the wrong thing in rural and regional Queensland, will the government introduce a 457 visa dob-in line and increase resources to deal with complaints and compliance issues?

                 <p>
                  Thank you. Again, Senator Lazarus, I confirm that the government condemns any form of exploitation. We already have a dob-in line that people are able to access if they believe that there is exploitation. You would also be aware, though, that recently this placeâ€”and I understand it was last weekâ€”passed a piece of legislation which will mean that you are now unable to charge for a migration outcome, and we have introduced exceptionally hefty penalties for those who are doing this. You may also be aware that it is this government that stood up Taskforce Cadena. That is a very specific task force that is looking at addressing worker exploitation. I have also stood up a ministerial working group on worker exploitation. We see this as a whole-of-government issue. It is not necessarily limited to one portfolio. That is why we have the ministerial working group. We have it so that a number of us can come together and look at ways we can work across government to ensure that workers are not being exploited.
