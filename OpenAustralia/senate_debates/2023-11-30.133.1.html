                    I know that those opposite don't like to be reminded that the laws that were struck down were laws that Mr Dutton had put in place or schemes that he'd put in place, but that is the case. The point I'd make is that you don't make Australians safer by shouting or by putting in place laws which the High Court strikes down, but that seems to be Mr Dutton's approach.

                        Thank you. The government have, at all times, made community safety our first priority. Do you know what those opposite have made their first priority? Their political interest. You can always count on the coalition and you can always count on the Liberal Party to put their own political interests first. You can always count on Mr Dutton to put his own political interests first. Of course, please do ask me another question, because I want to get to the fact that you voted with the Greens against strengthening the laws.

                             A bit of robodebt—that's what you want to do, isn't it? You want a government that doesn't comply with the law. But what we have done is put in place a stronger legislative framework to assure community safety. That's in stark contrast to what occurred in the House yesterday, or the day before, when Mr Dutton, despite beating his chest about how tough he is and how much he cares about community safety, voted with the Greens against legislation which was about strengthening visa conditions. So, every time you talk tough on this, let everybody know Senator Cash's party voted with the Greens against stronger conditions.

                              Order! The level of shouting and disorder in this chamber—from both sides, but particularly from my left—is quite disgraceful. There is little point in me calling for order and trying to shout louder than those who are shouting. I'm asking you to be respectful. I'm asking you to listen in silence. I should not have to repeatedly call for order. Senator Cash, a second supplementary?

                               claimed the coalition's preventive detention proposal was 'utterly impossible', but then she said the parliament would rise without legislating it. Now, the minister can't or won't explain how one of the 141 criminals she released managed to avoid the authorities. Why is the minister's job safe when the Australian public is not?

Instead of seeking to remove him from Australia, he made a decision that enabled the convicted person to stay in Australia. So he was in Australia until the day the High Court made the decision because of a decision of Mr Dutton's.
