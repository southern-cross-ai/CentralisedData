        In the very few minutes that remain—it's a great shame I only have a few minutes, because the topic I wanted to talk about is a matter of great importance to our region and a matter of great significance to me—I want to extend my deepest appreciation to the

        </a>
        and the people of Mizoram state in India. A few weeks ago, I had the privilege of travelling independently, by myself, to India in order to get to the border with Burma, in the north-east of India, to see for myself the unfolding Burmese refugee crisis that is happening in the north-west of Burma, across the border with India. I particularly want to congratulate and thank the people of Mizoram state, because, unlike the government of India, Mizoram state, who share ethnic and religious similarities to the Chin people of northern Burma, have been tremendously generous in their support in providing safe haven and refuge to many of the Chin people that have crossed the border into India.

        I wanted to use this very brief opportunity today to extend my deepest appreciation for the great warmth and hospitality that was shown to me when I travelled all the way to Aizawl on the border between India and Burma. I want to thank the government of Mizoram state, and the chief minister and governor who made their time available to meet with me. To the many religious leaders that came out supported my trip, I want to say a very, very generous thank you. I gave the Chin people who are sitting in refugee camps on the border with India a commitment that I would come back to Australia and fight for their cause, so that those who already have humanitarian visas issued by the Australian government can get an exit permit from the Indian government so they can come and find a new future for themselves here in Australia. I recommit myself to that commitment I gave to them when I was in India a few weeks ago.
