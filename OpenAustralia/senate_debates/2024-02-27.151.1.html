         The speech read as follows—
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This bill enables the manufacturing division of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
         CFMEU
        </a>
        , which includes the Textile, Clothing &amp; Footwear workers, timber workers and furniture workers, to hold a secret ballot to demerge from the Construction Forestry &amp; Maritime Employees Union (CFMEU).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Just two weeks ago, the amendments in this bill were moved as amendments to the Government's Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Closing Loopholes No. 2) Bill 2023.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Just two weeks ago, the Greens and the government voted together to block the amendment and deprive these union workers of the opportunity to have a say in their future.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Textile Clothing Footwear sector (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCF" rel="nofollow">
         TCF
        </a>
        Sector) is currently part of the CFMEU.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The TCF Sector is the part of the CFMEU with the greatest number of women.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Many of these women are from non-English speaking backgrounds.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Many of them have had first-hand experience of exploitation, underpayment and unsafe conditions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        After the merger the TCF Sector moved into the CFMEU's offices.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        One of the union secretaries told
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age" rel="nofollow">
         The Age
        </a>
        newspaper about the first meeting with the CFMEU:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         "It was a male-dominated space,"
        </i>
        she recalled.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But the Textile Clothing Footwear Union TCFU had merged with the CFMEU and that also meant sharing office space.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Union" rel="nofollow">
         The Union
        </a>
        rep told the paper that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         "Within the building there were jokes about domestic violence. It was very uncomfortable to the point where our division had to leave the building."
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To say the CFMEU have had 'women problems' in the past in an understatement.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But I am not going to go on about that today.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Except to say that the past behaviour of the CFMEU and indeed the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builders_Labourers_Federation" rel="nofollow">
         Builders Labourers Federation
        </a>
        —the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLF" rel="nofollow">
         BLF
        </a>
        —before that—really did and do give unions a bad name.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That's a shame, not just a shame about the behaviour—but a shame that is so often overshadows the good things the union movement has achieved for our country.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The first unions were formed by free workers—that is—not convicts—in Sydney and Hobart in the 1820s.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The earliest unions in Tasmania were organised by craft workers in the late 1820s.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Print workers', tailors', carpenters', bootmakers' and bakers' unions followed in the 1830s.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Early trade unions were working people who came together to support each other during illness, death and unemployment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 21 April 1856, stonemasons in Melbourne walked off the job in protest over their employers' refusal to accept their demands for reduced working hours.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It led to Australia becoming the first country in the world to have a mandated 8 hour work day.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But this only applied to a minority of workers—mainly those in the building trade.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Women became active in the union movement in the 1870s and often formed their own unions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Most workers, including women and children, generally worked longer hours for less pay.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Working people and their unions kept fighting and, in 1916, the Eight Hours Act was passed in Victoria and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It would take another 32 years for the Commonwealth Arbitration Court to approve a 40-hour, five-day working week for all Australians.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But in the nineteenth century—Australia was a male-dominated society
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Women weren't allowed to vote.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There were Jobs for the blokes—not so many for the sheilas.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Even if women could get a job—they weren't welcome in most workplaces.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Not that they didn't work at home—doing all the domestic stuff—but of course women still don't get paid for that!
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia's first union for women, the Tailoresses' Association of Melbourne, was founded in 1882.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A year before Australia's first female student graduated from the University of Melbourne.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In 1883 these ladies went on strike, the Tailoresses' strike of 1883, to protest a reduction of wages and an end to 'sweatshop' hours.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These 200 brave women going out on strike was described by commentators at the time as being 'extraordinary' and 'sensational'.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Their strike resulted in changes to their working conditions—And it got the attention of a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Commission
        </a>
        which ultimately led to the factory reform act.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The fight for women's working rights continued and kicked up a notch after
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WW" rel="nofollow">
         WW
        </a>
        2 when women took over jobs done by men who were now fighting overseas.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The ladies got a shock when they opened their pay packet and found it was less than the blokes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Victorian Trades Hall established a subcommittee for equal pay in 1943, taking up the long-standing demands of female-only unions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Once the war ended, many women wanted to keep their jobs, and keep the pay they had fought for—the unions had to campaign for this issue well into the 1950s.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It wasn't until 1972 that women were granted equal pay for work of equal value.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Trade unions in the late 70s and early 80s were getting a bad reputation—and were often in the headlines for all the wrong reasons.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Builders Labourers Federation was headed up by a very corrupt bloke called
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_Gallagher" rel="nofollow">
         Norm Gallagher
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The unlawfulness of the BLF's relentless industry-wide intimidation, violence, extortion, sabotage and financially-damaging stoppages is widely documented.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Following a Royal Commission into the BLF's business affairs—the union was deregistered and Gallagher was convicted—amongst other things—of obtaining building materials to build himself a beach house!
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        While the bad boys of the Union movement did their best to overshadow the good parts of the union movement—the union movement itself was changing.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Yes, union membership was falling—not helped by Norm and his mates—but the unions that survived and grew were often dominated by women.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Nurses, teacher, aged care workers, textile workers, footwear workers—the modern Australian Unionist is more likely to be a woman.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        According to the last census women make up a greater proportion of trade union membership (54%) than men (46%).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And yet and yet—a union mainly made up of women isn't allowed a secret ballot to take charge of their own union.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Why does it need to be secret—that's a good question.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And a depressing answer.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It's because they have been intimidated in the past.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The CFMEU doesn't want to let them go because they want their money.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        So, let's review—a union with thousands of women, many of them from non-English speaking backgrounds, wants to be able to have a secret ballot to leave the CFMEU and take control themselves.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Who in here could in all conscience vote against these women?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I would like all of the Senators in here to go home and think deeply about this tonight.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If your party is telling you to vote against this amendment, I want you to think about how you will feel about betraying these women?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        All the passionate speeches I have heard in this place about domestic violence.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        All the speeches about how women should be empowered to take control of their own lives.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Did you mean them?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Will you stand by your words?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Will you stand by your principles?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Will you stand up for these women?
       </p>
       <p>
        I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted; debate adjourned.
