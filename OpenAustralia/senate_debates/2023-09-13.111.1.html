        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. It is just over one month before Australians head to the polls to vote on the referendum on a Voice to Parliament. Can the minister explain to the Senate how the Voice is an opportunity to bring Australians together and help achieve better outcomes for Aboriginal and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
         Torres Strait Islander

        people? And can the minister outline why the government supports constitutional recognition through a Voice to Parliament?

         I thank Senator Payman for her question. I thank her for her genuine interest in closing the gap and for her determination to build a better future for all Australians. On 14 October all of us—every Australian—will have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to bring our country together and to change it for the better, to vote for recognition and listening so we get better results.
        </p>
        <p>
         Constitutional recognition through a Voice is the form of practical reconciliation that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
          Indigenous Australians
         </a>
         requested as part of the Uluru Statement from the Heart. It is supported by an overwhelming majority of Aboriginal and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
          Torres Strait Islander
         </a>
         people.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Voice" rel="nofollow">
          The Voice
         </a>
         will offer ideas and advice so governments can make better decisions to address the challenges facing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. It is an advisory committee made up of representatives from across the country. It won't have the power to make or veto government's decisions. What it will do is improve outcomes in Indigenous health, housing, education and employment.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australians from all walks of life are coming together, united in their support for a Voice to Parliament enshrined in the Constitution. Meanwhile, we have the 'no' campaign, who've put forward many varying reasons for their opposition in their campaign. But what is noteworthy is that Mr Dutton has in fact promised not one but two referendums—another referendum on constitutional recognition—although I note that his shadow minister for Indigenous affairs has publicly stated that she does not support it. So, more politics, more political games, because Mr Dutton didn't do something when he had the chance. And now that someone else is to trying to do something, he wants to tear it down.

                   that the no campaign has instructed volunteers to use fear and doubt rather than facts to trump the arguments used by the yes campaign. I look forward to Senator Cash joining with me in condemning such an approach, which is not the approach we should be taking to this discussion. This is nothing more than fear mongering by those who will do and say anything if they think it will help them politically, spreading lies and sowing fear, even when it means standing on the way of a better future for Australians. You see, this is a political tactic we have seen, regrettably, from some on the other side in so many ways. Certainly, Mr Dutton has an approach; he builds himself up by tearing things down.

                     Thank you, Minister, for the update. Can the minister remind the Senate about efforts to achieve reform in Australia in the past. What lessons can we take from history as we seek to make progress towards a better future for all Australians?

                        and complaining about it, maybe you should do something about it. Surely, if you want this debate to be a decent debate, if you want this debate to be a debate that is worthy of the Australian people, then surely those opposite and Mr Dutton might use their leadership to ensure that we see facts not fear as the basis of the debate. We know of course that those opposite do like to resort to fear tactics. We remember words such as 'economic wasteland'. We remember an assertion that secure jobs and better pay would leave supermarket shelves bare.
