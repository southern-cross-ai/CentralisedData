        My question is to the Minister for Defence, Senator Reynolds. Can the minister update the Senate on how the government's strong economy and strong budget management has helped to regenerate Australia's naval capabilities?

         I thank Senator Rennick for his question and also his support for the ADF. The Morrison government does have a very comprehensive strategy for establishing and also sustaining a strong Navy to secure Australia's security and prosperity. The rapidly evolving strategic circumstances in our own region mean that the ADF needs a strong maritime presence both within and beyond our borders. We need to be in more places at the same time and be capable of responding to our region. For that reason, this government is investing over $90 billion in our national shipbuilding endeavour for the Navy. We are building 57 naval vessels in Australia by Australian workers with Australian steel. But it is not just about building ships; we're also sustaining our fleet and working with industry to generate world-class naval capability, to foster innovation and also to create thousands of long-term multigenerational jobs for Australian workers.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are building state-of-the-art shipyards in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         that will deliver the new Hunter class frigates and also the Attack class submarines. The first two offshore patrol vessels are already being built in South Australia. For the third ship, they'll transfer to Henderson in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         . In Western Australia, we're also building the 21 Guardian class Pacific patrol boats. They will provide our near neighbours with enhanced maritime security capability. All of this work will support our security and create Australian job opportunities in South Australia, Western Australia and the rest of the nation. It is truly a national shipbuilding endeavour.

            I thank Senator Rennick for that question. Last week I was very privileged to return to the Sea Power Conference conducted by Navy. Last week, it was the 11th such conference they've held, and it was in Sydney. And it was a huge success. Over 3,000 registered participants attended from the military to industry and also academia from over 50 nations. We all gathered to discuss the significance of sea power and also their contribution to Australia's military capability. In the keynote speech, I highlighted the vital role that our Navy plays in supporting Australia's interests in regional and also global security and stability. As I explained there, we are acquiring new naval capabilities because we must. Our nation needs these capabilities. But our Navy is also working in new ways with friends and allies to support the changing realities. In short, the Navy is busier than it has ever been before.

               The sad fact is that this government has had to rebuild our naval shipbuilding capability following its destruction by those opposite after six years of cuts, failures and indecision. Labor's Australia industry content in naval shipbuilding was—how much was it? A hundred per cent of nothing. In stark contrast, the Morrison government is committed to creating a productive and globally competitive and sustainable Australian defence industry for building ships. Already, work is underway to create jobs for over 15,000 Australian workers. I saw firsthand at the Pacific 29 conference more than 600 industry stands, many of them—hundreds of them—displaying Australian ingenuity and the workforce at its best. Naval shipbuilding truly is an Australian national endeavour, and this government is extraordinarily proud, as I am as the minister, of this endeavour.
