        of Peace. This year's theme, 'Actions for Peace', is a call to action, recognising our individual and collective responsibility to foster peace. This year it feels more important than ever to remember our responsibility. We are lucky that Australia is a relatively peaceful country. It is the reason so many people have come to call this place home. To preserve and strengthen peace in our country, we should all be focused on reducing inequalities, engaging respectfully in political debates and celebrating the immense value of our diverse, multicultural society.

        Recently, I met with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nell_Potter" rel="nofollow">

        and Andrew Telfer from the Palestine Israel Ecumenical Network. It was wonderful to meet them and learn more about their work, which is focused on promoting peace in non-violent ways. Learning about their work and hearing their dedication to peace in the region so far from Australia, I was reminded that we all have a role to play. We should not accept that Palestinian families in the

        live under military occupation or that children are prosecuted in military courts without fundamental trial rights and protection. Everyone deserves to live in peace. I'm proud that this government recognises the rights of both Palestine and Israel to exist as two states with secure and recognised borders.
       </p>
       <p>
        As we observe the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day_of_Peace" rel="nofollow">
         International Day of Peace
        </a>
        , let us remember the importance of diplomacy and dialogue in promoting peace and stability around the world. The women and girls in Afghanistan who face daily repression deserve peace. The people of Ukraine who are defending themselves against an illegal invasion of their home deserve peace. The people of Israel and Palestine deserve to live in peace.
