        My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for

        . Does the minister recall that in answer to a question on notice from me dated 14 June, question No. 1681, he said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Medicare pregnancy support counselling items are specifically targeted towards women who have, or have had, an unintended pregnancy, or who are unsure about whether to continue with a pregnancy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Following concerns that have been raised by the AMA and others about the privacy risk that this would pose to women who are considering a termination, regardless of their ultimate decision, the health minister, through a spokesperson, in August said that the item number would be available to ‘anyone who is anxious about their pregnancy’. Can the minister confirm whether the item number will apply to all pregnant women or only those with an unintended pregnancy or who are unsure about whether or not they want to continue with that pregnancy?

         Yes, I do recall—not in precise terms, but generally in the terms outlined by Senator Stott Despoja—my reply to one of her questions earlier on in the session. I think it is worthwhile reiterating that the government is committed to ensuring that non-directive counselling is provided to people who avail themselves of the services that were announced by Minister Abbott and the Prime Minister on 2 March 2006. I think it is important that I go on the record here quoting the advice that has been provided to me—and that is that to date there have not been any complaints provided to ministers, the government or anybody else in relation to clients who have used that service.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to reiterate that the department has not received any complaints from clients and there is no evidence whatsoever that the AFPSS are not meeting the terms of the funding agreement. The advice that I can give to Senator Stott Despoja—and I am sure that all senators would agree—is that when a woman is unsure about whether to continue with a pregnancy it is important that she is able to quickly access professional counselling and support that can provide her with the information and support that she needs to come to an informed choice about her pregnancy. They were the general terms that surrounded the announcement, on 2 March, by the Prime Minister and the Minister for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_and_Ageing" rel="nofollow">
          Health and Ageing
         </a>
         , about the introduction of new
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MBS" rel="nofollow">
          MBS
         </a>
         items and the new pregnancy support helpline.
        </p>
        <p>
         One of the very strong conditions that underpinned that announcement was that the service was non-directive. I would advise Senator Stott Despoja, any other senators and any interested members of the public, that if there is evidence to suggest that the non-directive requirement is not being met, we would certainly want to hear about it.
        </p>
        <p>
         It might be of interest to senators, including senators opposite, that Dr Andrew Pesce has been appointed chair of the Pregnancy Counselling Expert Advisory Committee. He is joined by another six committee members. I want to outline to the Senate who those people are because I am sure that all senators would agree that they are highly respected individuals. They are people who will help ensure, through their supervisory and overseeing roles, that the terms of the funding are maintained.
        </p>
        <p>
         The expert advisory committee members are: Dr Andrew Pesce, the chair, an obstetrician and gynaecologist; Mrs Jenny Brandon-Baker, a midwife; Ms Rosemary Bryant, the

         ; Dr Leslie Stephan, a psychiatrist; and Professor Harvey Whiteford, Professor of Psychiatry at the Queensland Centre for Mental Health Research.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am sure many senators would be aware of the eminent qualifications of those people who have been asked to assist in providing advice to Dr Andrew Pesce, and I again stress that they are people who are very aware of the responsibilities that are entrusted to them via the charter. In terms of who precisely receives the advice—to come back to the question that Senator Stott Despoja asked—it is my understanding that that service is available to all who ask for it. But to be absolutely sure, I will seek some further specific advice from the minister for health’s office, and get back to you after question time.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for his answer and for endeavouring to confirm that that service will be available to all women. I acknowledge the minister’s point that there have been no complaints. I presume that that is because the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MBS" rel="nofollow">
           MBS
          </a>
          item has not started yet. So I am just wondering, Senator Santoro, whether the minister would outline for the chamber the time line for the tender process of the government’s pregnancy support telephone hotline, and whether the hotline is still due to begin operating by the end of this year. I also ask the minister to elaborate on his comment regarding the provision of non-directive pregnancy counselling information, and ask the minister, specifically: does your definition—the minister’s and the government’s definition—of ‘non-directive’ include information about, and referral for, a termination?

            MBS
           </a>
           items will commence on 1 November 2006 and that the selection of the helpline operator should occur by the end of 2006. She would be aware that the

            Australian Federation
           </a>
           of Pregnancy Support Services is currently funded to provide non-directive counselling through a 1300 telephone number.
          </p>
          <p>
           As to Senator Stott Despoja’s request that I further define ‘non-directive’, I think that I have answered the question to the best of my ability. Non-directive means precisely that—non-directive. But, again, I will see if I can receive any further advice from the Minister for
