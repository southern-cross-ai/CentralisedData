        I rise to acknowledge an inspiring and very successful local charity in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        , based just five minutes from my electorate office at Wangara in Perth's northern suburbs. Wheelchairs for Kids was founded in 1998 and is a group of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australian
        </a>
        volunteers that produce wheelchairs for impoverished children around the world, many of whom are living with disabilities caused by disease or war. It cannot be overstated how life-changing these wheelchairs are for the children who receive them and for their families and communities. In many cases, they would have no other way of receiving an adequate wheelchair that enables them to live a full life with freedom of mobility.
       </p>
       <p>
        I recently visited Wheelchairs for Kids' production centre with my colleague, the member for Moore, Mr Ian Goodenough, where we saw firsthand the love and dedication shown by these volunteers. I sincerely thank them for the time they spend giving so much attention and thorough professionalism to what is a very, very important local and global charity. The volunteers work tirelessly to produce wheelchairs that meet global standards, with the latest model including postural supports, a harness, a tray, a waterproof cushion and even a soft plush toy for children to enjoy. A wheelchair is produced for every $200 that's donated, reaching more than 90 locations in 70 countries. Wheelchairs for Kids produced their 50,000th wheelchair in August this year—a truly remarkable milestone.
       </p>

        It's also important to note that one of the major sponsors and supporters of Wheelchairs for Kids is the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Rotary Club
        </a>
        of Scarborough, with many of the wheelchairs produced by Wheelchairs for Kids produced by Rotary members. A visit not long ago to my own Rotary Club of Perth reminded me how Rotarians across our state and, indeed, across Australia embody the best of community values—that value of selflessness. It's certainly an ethos shared by those at Wheelchairs for Kids, and I and many others applaud them for their fantastic charity work.
