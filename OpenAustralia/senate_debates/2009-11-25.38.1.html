        My question is to Senator Carr as the Minister representing the Minister for Resources and Energy. It is a question that relates to radioactive waste management in Australia, which rightly belonged in Senator Carr’s portfolio before it was for some reason transferred to resources and energy. When will the government implement its very clear election promise, its policy platform and a great many public undertakings, including from you, to repeal the Commonwealth

        —scientific, transparent, accountable and fair and which allows access to appeal mechanisms? What exactly is the reason for the delay of nearly two years having elapsed since you came to government? Will you acknowledge that this is actually a very clear breach of an election commitment?

         Management Act is in fact an election commitment which we will honour, which we stand by. However, it will be done as part of a total package which will involve a long-term solution to the profound difficulties associated with the management of radioactive waste. Australia, of course, as a signatory to the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, has an obligation to ensure that radioactive waste is safely and securely managed. In fact, this is a problem that has defied the wit of governments over 35 years. There is a long history of attempts that have been made by the Commonwealth government to secure this matter—

          , I rise on a point of order which goes to relevance. I wonder whether the minister is planning on addressing in his answer any of the following words: ‘scientific’, ‘transparent’, ‘accountable’, ‘fair’ or ‘access to appeal mechanisms’. Thus far, with a minute left on the clock, we have heard nothing of relevance.

            Australia has radioactive waste stored at some 30 temporary locations around the country—they are the Australian government agencies, I should say. There are in fact some 100 locations throughout the country which state governments are using to store radioactive waste—in hospitals, in universities, in factories. Most of these existing stores are not specifically designed for long-term radioactive waste management. The very words that Senator Ludlam has used are the words that we will be applying to a holistic national approach to radioactive waste management. We will be able to do that once the processes have been completed and agreed to by government. I look forward to the continuing support of the opposition parties on this matter, and we will get an opportunity to test that support very shortly.

              As to the tabling of particular documents, I will have to seek the advice of the minister responsible on those matters. The previous government had announced that there would be a process to establish the suitability of a number of defence properties in the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
               Northern Territory
              </a>
              . The previous government has also agreed to assessment of the voluntary Aboriginal site at Muckaty Station and has signed a site nomination agreement which committed the Commonwealth to a $12 million compensation package if the voluntary site was selected and used as a facility.
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsons_Brinckerhoff" rel="nofollow">

              </a>
              were contracted by the previous government to undertake the assessment of the relevant site. So all of those matters I can confirm. However, the issue of establishing a transparent, accountable and fair process for identifying that site is one that we have maintained, and we as a government are committed to ensuring the repeal of the Commonwealth

                 </a>
                 and Muckaty Land Trust, which did provide a schedule of payments to a charitable fund, as the minister noted. Given that this contract was highly contested and remains to this day a matter of considerable public interest and given that it is for an amount exceeding the Murray motion Senate requirement of 2001, which requires contracts over $100,000 to be made public, will the government refer this contract to the Auditor-General’s office for it to undertake an assessment of the contract to determine whether or not it should be deemed commercial in confidence? If not, why not?

                  I think the critical issue here is the fact that Australia currently holds some 3,820 cubic metres of low-level radioactive waste and produces some 35 cubic metres of such waste annually. Also, Australia currently holds approximately 435 cubic metres of long-lived intermediate-level waste and produces some 3.5 cubic metres annually.

                   , I raise a point of order. I was not seeking an inventory of Australia’s radioactive waste; I am more than aware of what is in Australia’s radioactive waste inventory. I ask you to draw the minister’s attention to the question, which related to government referral to the Auditor-General’s office.

                     I draw senators’ attention to the fact that Australia does have significant holdings of radioactive waste, which are held at some 130 sites across this country. The critical issue—

                      , on a point of order: I am sorry from tying up the chamber’s time, but the minister appears to be about to restate the inventory of Australia’s radioactive waste, which was not the question. I asked whether he would refer that contract to the Auditor-General’s office.

                       , on the point of order: I think it is a bit rich to raise a point of order that says, ‘The minister is about to do something and I take objection to what he is about to do.’ Foresight about Senator Carr’s contributions is impressive, but we are getting to a pretty sorry state if a point of order can be taken on what you think the minister might say next.
