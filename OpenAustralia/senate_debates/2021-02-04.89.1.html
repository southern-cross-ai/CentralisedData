           claim to have a plan for manufacturing, but all this is is a plan for locking in a climate catastrophe and destroying the future of regional communities, for the corporate profits of your mates. What we need is industry powered by renewable energy, not oil and gas, where we make, re-use and remake durable, ecologically sustainable goods. Our manufacturing future is one where manufacturing doesn't just work for the corporate profit but works instead for people, communities and the environment, where workplaces are inclusive, democratic, innovative and ethical, where meaningful, safe, well-paid work isn't rare or at risk but the norm. The future is achievable and it's achievable now. The coalition needs to get with it or get out of the way.

              supports the general thrust of this motion. We also support the reinsertion to this motion of page 18 of the Nationals' manufacturing policy that was released last week and the reinsertion of all references to coal that the Nationals did not have the courage to include in today's motion and removed from the policy. The largest cost category of manufacturingâ€”and increasingly agriculture, due to electricity prices risingâ€”today is electricity prices. Without including coal, the Nationals' motion is a hollow stunt. Without coal-fired power, the Nationals' policy and motion are pointless.

                 Labor will not be supporting paragraph (a) of this motion. Labor supports Australian manufacturing and the jobs it creates. Hence we'll be supporting paragraph (b). Labor does not need rogue National policy ideas that the Liberals don't themselves support, like new publicly funded coal-fired power stations. We have our own ideas, like the National Rail Manufacturing Plan. We agree with the Nationals backbench that they and their coalition partners have neglected the manufacturing industry, having presided over the loss of 90,000 jobs in manufacturing since their election in 2013. Australian manufacturers need meaningful support. They don't need an empty stunt by disgruntled Nationals in the Senate, who have had nearly eight years to speak up. This is a plan which was rejected on day one by senior Liberal Party ministers. This motion is simply an embarrassing demonstration of how ineffective the Nationals are within their government. Every time they put up an idea, the Liberals shoot it down. They get shot down day after day, and here's another example.

                    I just note that the motion refers to the Nationals' Manufacturing 2035 plan, and I'm a little bit confused as to whether that's the government or whether it's the Nationals or whether it's the Liberals. It might not surprise you that plans of the Nationals are not high on my reading list. If you had come to me with your plan, I might have been moreâ€”

                      It might be online, but it's not necessarily high on my reading list. Have the courtesy of perhaps providing the plan to people before you ask them to vote on it.

                       This motion is being split, so I'm putting the first half. The question is that general business notice of motion No. 973 paragraph (a) standing in the name of Senator McKenzie and others be agreed to.
