        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Senator Watt. I refer to the now Treasurer's comments on 21 November 2021, where the Treasurer said industry-wide bargaining was 'not part of our policy'. Given the government is trying to introduce industry-wide bargaining by stealth in its extreme industrial relations legislation, will the minister apologise to the Australian people for this broken promise?

         A government senator: On a broadcast day!

         . Is this the third we've had so far? I've lost track of just how many we've had in question time today. I'm not sure whether Senator Brockman knows that he is misleading people with what he's saying, but I'm here to help him. There is a distinction between industry-wide bargaining and multi-employer bargaining. Industry-wide bargaining involves a whole industry; multi-employer bargaining involves multiple employers. They are different things. We are in favour of allowing employers and employees, where they choose, to pursue multi-employer bargaining. That is not the same as industry-wide bargaining. It's in the name. Again, it's just another false scare campaign from an opposition that is—

           I'm looking forward to the supplementary questions because we might get to our fourth and fifth scare campaigns in one question time alone. This one is yet another one that is completely baseless and completely misunderstands how industrial relations actually works in this country. What we've got is a coalition that is so intent on running scare campaigns to stop wages rising that they are clutching at straws, making things up and misinterpreting how their own laws actually work in order to throw mud at a government that is trying to do something about wage rises. It's actually a little bit sad to watch the coalition so completely misunderstand how industrial relations works that they would be making up these kinds of things. Anyone could just look at how those words operate—industry-wide; multi-employer. They're actually kind of different concepts. Do you know what? Industry-wide bargaining is also different to single-interest bargaining, which is another thing that we're providing for. They are completely different concepts. What you're talking about is not part of the government's agenda. It never has been part of the government's agenda. The only agenda this government has is to get wages moving again.

             A survey of businesses by the WA Chamber of Commerce and Industry has found that nine in 10 businesses would be damaged by measures in the Albanese government's extreme industrial relations bill and four in five would be damaged by multi-employer bargaining. Businesses are saying it will make it harder to run a business and employ Australians. It's not a scare campaign; they're scared. Why is the government turning its back on job creators in

                 So it is hardly a surprise that when we finally have a government in this country that wants to get wages moving again that we see some business groups opposing it. But isn't it interesting that the opposition doesn't want to pay attention to those business groups that actually do support multi-employer bargaining? As I was saying yesterday, in the Senate inquiry we had evidence from the executive director of the Community Child Care Association, which represents over 750—

                        So apparently if you are a business that provides childcare services you can't have your say. You also can't have a say if you are involved in manufacturing and related associations.

                          The same survey has found the government's radical industrial relations legislation will put 34,000 workplaces at risk of employing fewer staff in the years ahead if the changes proceed. Employers are universally saying these changes will make it harder to run a business and employ Australians. Why is the government pursuing policy changes that will see fewer jobs for Australians and will see even more job losses than are already expected under this government?

Senator Brockman is talking about our changes as being radical. So is it radical, Senator Brockman, that what we are trying to do is make gender equity an objective of the Fair Work Act? Is it radical, Senator Brockman, that what we—

                             President, I ask you: is it radical to have a government that wants to ban pay secrecy clauses in employment contracts? I think it's not. Is it radical that we have a government that wants to ensure employers have a duty to prevent sexual harassment? How radical is that? What a radical proposal to do something about sexual harassment! Is it radical to have a government that wants to make the sexual harassment dispute process fairer and more effective? How naughty and how radical of this government to want to do something about that! That's why we are doing this. It's to look after women and to look after businesses.
