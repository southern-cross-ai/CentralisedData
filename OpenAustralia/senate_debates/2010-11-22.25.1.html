            research by the Australia Institute has shown that the typical full-time employee works 70 minutes of unpaid overtime a day, which equates to six and a half standard working weeks a year, effectively meaning that Australian workers are ‘donating’ more than their annual leave entitlement back to their employers in the form of unpaid overtime,

 Many of these orders were made by consent.

       <p class="italic">
        The bill attaches the same rights and liabilities to affected orders as would have resulted if the court had made a specific finding that the child spending equal time or substantial and significant time with each of their parents was reasonably practicable.

 Those rights and liabilities are to be treated as though they are and always have been exercisable and enforceable in the same manner as if the order were validly made.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill also includes a minor policy refinement to provide that where all parties consent to a parenting order, the court may but does not have to consider all of the issues required in a contested case.

 This will reduce court time and improve court efficiency. The best interest of the child would remain the paramount consideration.

         The Government
        </a>
        announced on 3 November 2008 a plan to restore student services and amenities, representation and advocacy across the higher education sector. The bill provided that higher education providers may choose to charge a compulsory student services and amenities fee, capped at a maximum of $250 per annum (indexed) from 1 July 2009.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Due to delays in the passage of the bill through the previous Parliament the implementation date was amended to 1 July 2010 and now needs to be further amended to 1 January 2011.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill will honour the Government’s commitment to ensure that higher education students have access to amenities and support services to address the impact of voluntary student unionism. The bill will ensure that all students are provided with information on, and access to, important health, welfare and financial services and provide independent and democratic student representation and advocacy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government will provide access to a new element of the Higher Education Loan Program, SA-HELP, enabling eligible students, if they choose, to take out a loan for the payment of the student services fee. It is intended that higher education providers would not be able to charge the student services fee if they do not also provide access to SA-HELP.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In order to have the fee and loan in place by 1 January 2011, higher education providers require upgrades to their
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT" rel="nofollow">
         IT

New information pamphlets and Commonwealth assistance forms must be developed and printed with sufficient time for distribution prior to the commencement of the fee and loan. The loan information and associated forms require the passage of the bill before legal authority.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Furthermore, a further delay in the passage of the bill would result in insufficient time to authorise the additional data elements to implement the required data collection for the Higher Education

       <p class="italic">
        The bill establishes an entirely new scheme for delivering support for R&amp;D conducted in Australia that will (retrospectively) commence on 1 July 2010.

 The new R&amp;D tax incentive will be the Government’s primary means of supporting the innovation efforts of Australian businesses.

 In order for businesses to plan their R&amp;D activities for 2010-11 onwards, they need access to guidance material from the scheme administrators.

 Such guidance material cannot be issued until the scheme’s enabling legislation comes into effect.

 It is therefore important that the bill receives passage in the 2010 Spring sittings.
