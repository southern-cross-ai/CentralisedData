        These amendments do two things. Firstly, they abolish indexation on trade support loans to prevent these loans becoming a debt trap. With student and training debts expected to rise by 15 per cent in just two years of the Labor government, this amendment is necessary to prevent the debt crisis from becoming even worse. I have to say, my heart really breaks for the many who will suffer the long-term effects of soaring student debt. People are already being locked out of the housing market, denied personal loans and are rethinking dreams of further study because they are being crushed by student debt, and things will only get worse because Labor is not acting on this.
       </p>
       <p>
        I did hear the minister say something along the lines of 'it would not be appropriate to remove indexation on these loans as they are part of an overall bigger system of loans'. Well, Minister, I say to you: you are in government and the best thing to do would be to scrap indexation on all loans, because the system that you talk about is utterly and thoroughly broken. Better still, just make

        and university free and wipe student debt. But in the meantime, at least let's start here, when we have an opportunity today to relieve some of that pressure.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second amendment raises the minimum repayment income for those loans to the median wage, which is currently $65,000 annually so that people only have to start repaying their loans once they are earning a decent income. This is an important measure to ensure that people on those lower incomes are not spending money on student debt, money that they so desperately need for bills, for rent, for food, for medicine. It is a cost-of-living relief measure.

         and Nationals will not supporting these amendments. The coalition supports the bills and the expansion of trade support loans to the new Australian Apprenticeship Support Loans scheme as outlined in the bills. The intention of these bills—to expand access to cost-of-living supports to Australians as they undertake training and to help them complete their courses—is admirable, but we recognise that this support must be targeted and temporary. We believe that, once workers are in a position to start paying back their loans, they should do so. We cannot support the abolition of indexation on these loans, because that provides a perverse incentive for people not to repay them as quickly and efficiently as possible. Australians receive this support because, as a community, we have made the choice to help support the aspirations of those looking to take on a new skill. This is not a cost-free exercise, and policies that provide support must be sustainable.
        </p>
        <p>
         I also note that the quantum of the loans under this scheme will be much, much lower than that experienced by many university students. It is not adequate to draw a direct link to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HELP" rel="nofollow">
          HELP
         </a>
         system. Further, given record low unemployment and the high demand for skilled workers, graduates who qualify for these loans will overwhelmingly find employment rapidly, and only once they've got the employment will they be required to pay the loans back. We're very comfortable with the existing settings in this bill, and we don't believe that the new approach to delaying the repayment of these supports, as suggested by the Greens, is appropriate. We know that support provided by the Australian Apprenticeship Support Loans will make a difference to the lives of students, but, equally, we know that once they have a skill they'll be on the right path to great job opportunities and a prosperous future. We support the existing settings in the bills and do not support these amendments.

          The government will also not be supporting the amendments proposed by Senator Faruqi. I thank Senator Faruqi and Senator Davey for their contributions on this. As it did for the second reading amendment, the government notes that trade support loans are a small subset of the student and training loans offered by government, all of which are repaid on the same income-contingent basis. It would be inappropriate to treat trade support loans differently to other loans, and, as a result, the Trade Support Loans Amendment Bill is not the appropriate forum to make substantial changes to that approach to student debt. Any changes to the current system of indexation of student debt should be considered on the whole and particularly in the context of the Australian Universities Accord, the National School Reform Agreement and the wider reform agenda that the government has so that the cost, the broader policy context and the long-term effects and consequences can be taken into consideration for such a substantial change.
         </p>
         <p>
          Recipients repay their income-contingents loans through the tax system and do not need to begin making repayments until their income exceeds the minimum repayment income. These repayments do not change on the basis of the size of the debt—only on the basis of the income received. The intention of this system is to protect students from burdensome repayment obligations by basing repayments on students' capacities to repay rather than on the total value of their debts. This leads to significantly slower repayment rates than would occur at commercial rates, and it ensures that students are protected from the financial pressures of fixed-term repayments and the risk of default. Further, on successful completion of their qualification, recipients will receive a 20 per cent discount on their total loan. This provides an incentive for recipients to complete their qualification as well as reduce their total loan amount, enabling more people to study as a result.
