        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. Today is day 190 of the 90-day review—making it 100 days overdue—that the minister for infrastructure told us would be short and sharp. More than 400 productivity-enhancing infrastructure projects have been put on hold by the government because of this review. Labor have spent $2.9 billion less on road and rail infrastructure last year than you said you would in your October budget. That was on top of the $9.6 billion in cuts to infrastructure in that budget. The Treasurer yesterday said that 'difficult decisions' would need to be taken on infrastructure projects as a result of the review. In response, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Premier" rel="nofollow">
         Deputy Premier

        of Queensland, Dr Miles, has said today that cutting road and rail projects in Queensland is a bad idea economically and politically. Minister, will you rule out any cuts to the

         I thank Senator Canavan for his question. What I will rule out is repeating the mess that the former government left us with in this space, making announcement after announcement which was never, ever followed through on. Senator Canavan, we're the adults in the room. We are trying to make sensible, economically sustainable decisions for this country, not simply issuing a press release and then doing nothing about it to follow through, in terms of either any construction or providing any funding for those projects.
        </p>
        <p>
         What we want to do, Senator Canavan, is get back to where we always should have been, and that is making sensible decisions on infrastructure for this country that are in the best interests of the country, whether that might be in Queensland, in my home state of

         , or anywhere else in the country. The comments by the Treasurer on the weekend are exactly to this point. We're going to make decisions in this country that are based on the best interests of all of our citizens and that are in our national interest, and that means doing a thorough investigation into all of those—

               I can't remember how your government made the announcement about its support for the Darwin port, Senator Canavan, but I never heard any complaint from your government about the decision of Chief Minister Giles to lease that port to a Chinese company. But what we know about this Prime Minister is that he's a prime minister who actually knows something about infrastructure. So, when this government makes decisions about government infrastructure spending, you can rest assured that he's going to make the best decisions in the best interests of this country because he actually knows what he's doing.
