       <p>
        Given the Turnbull government's plan to axe the energy supplement has no prospect of passing this parliament, will the Turnbull government now abandon its unfair attack on the two million Australians, including 400,000 age pensioners, who depend on the energy supplement?

         I thank Senator Farrell for the question. The Turnbull government are committed to ensuring Australia's welfare system provides appropriate support to those in need while remaining sustainable for future generations.

                       Senator Wong, I'm happy to come back. I took notes on the question and that the final part of it referred to the maintenance of the energy supplement. I took Senator Fierravanti-Wells to be directly talking about that in her answer. If I'm incorrect, I will come back to the chamber, but I've interpreted—

                        It doesn't surprise me to hear that interjection; you don't even know what your position is on this measure. Let me take you back: in their 2016 election document, the Labor Party published a list of 30 measures that they would reverse in government. It's a detailed list, but there's not one mention of reversing the decision by the government to end the carbon tax compensation of the energy supplement. After the election, the Leader of the Opposition confirmed that this document would be their consistent position. Which is it? The member for Jagajaga says they're against it. The member for Maribyrnong says they're going to bank it and spend it. Only in the minds of the opposition could you have both. Meanwhile, the shadow Treasurer is sitting there wondering if he has a $1 billion hole in his books. Therefore, as I have said, had the carbon tax not been repealed in 2014, it would have caused long-term increases in electricity prices. When the carbon tax was repealed on 1 July 2014, the Australian—

                           Thank you, Senator Farrell, for that. When the age pension was introduced, the average male life expectancy was 55 years. To ensure the pension is sustainable, the government supported the move, under Labor, to a higher pension age of 67 in 2009. While not yet legislated, increasing the age pension qualification age to 70 by 2035 remains government policy.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           Labor's measure was, and is, to increase the pension age to 67 by 2023. It's laughable that those opposite, who extended the pension age, because it was responsible reform, now do not want to keep the pension sustainable. You were the ones who put this in legislation. We supported you, so don't hypocritically come in here and ask the sort of stupid, silly question you just asked.

                             I do have one and it's not silly or stupid. How is it fair to force Australians to work until they're 70 and to cut $365 a year from single age pensions, and $550 a year from couples, while handing out $80 billion to big business?

                               Since the coalition came to government in 2013, pensions have increased by more than $99 per fortnight for singles and by more than $149 per fortnight for couples, and pensions will continue to rise twice a year. The age pension is paid at the highest fortnightly rate of income support and has the most generous indexation arrangements in Australia's social security system.

                               In 2015, the government made a decision to rebalance the age pension asset test to make the system better targeted and more sustainable.
