          This is a question for the Minister for Education and Training representing the Minister for the Environment and Energy. The government has been in power for four years, and the entire energy system is crumbling. The government's plan has consisted of ripping up the carbon price, slashing the renewable energy target and keeping open this clunker of a coal-fired power station. What have we got?

            Under no circumstances and no view of this question can this be seen as anything but a speech, a cheap political point while we're on broadcast. If the senator has a question, he should ask the question and not make a speech. You will note from the standing orders that is not allowed in asking questions.

             Thank you, Senator Macdonald. It has been allowed over many, many years that senators can provide context and can provide a preamble to their question. However, by doing that, they run the risk of making it easier for a minister to range widely with their response in relation to the preamble as well as the question. Senator

                         the energy crisis in Australia would be much, much worse than it is today. Indeed, Senator Williams is right: the lights probably wouldn't be on in here if the Greens had had their way. If the Greens had had their way, every single renewable energy target that was put forward would never have been enough. If the Greens had had their way, every single carbon tax proposal put forward would never have been enough. If the Greens had had their way, they, of course, would have taxed to closure every single coal-fired generator in the country by now. That would have been the policy proposition of the

                         . Would we have had any dispatchable base load power today? No, we would not have had anything that the Australian energy market could have relied on if the Greens had had their way. So the very idea of Senator

                         coming in here, wanting to talk about energy affordability or energy reliability, is preposterous, because the Greens have been the ones who have gone on and on over the years, seeking harsher policies that would have simply driven prices up, driven affordability down, driven reliability down, driven energy generation out of business and ensured that we had nothing that was reliable, nothing that was dispatchable and nothing that was base load.

                           Yes, indeed, it is a point of order. It won't surprise you to learn that my point of order goes directly to relevance. We've been very patient here. We've given Senator Birmingham until he has less than 20 seconds left. He has not come within a million miles of addressing the question. President, I remind you: the question wasn't about the Greens policy; it was about the government's lack of a coherent energy policy and the fact that things are crumbling around them. I ask you to remind the minister of the question.

I was helping him to look at some of the Greens policies, some of the failures of their policies and, of course, the dire situation that Australia would be in. The Turnbull government's getting on with fixing the retail market, fixing the network market, dealing with generation and delivering affordability and reliability.

That is the reality that we are dealing with. Senator Di Natale can come in here and try to claim that the solution to that is to somehow further invest in intermittent energy, but we know the solution is to ensure you have greater reliability of base-load dispatchable energy. Senator Di Natale still doesn't seem to have comprehended the differences between intermittent energy and dispatchable base-load energy. We understand it. We are seeking to get the balance in the energy market that can improve affordability and reliability for all Australians.

                                    My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Brandis. Can the minister confirm that despite the government's promise to reduce power bills by $550, the average Sydney household is paying $935 more for their power bill since the Liberal government came to office?

                                     No, I can't confirm that. But what I can confirm is that this government is doing more than the previous Labor government ever did to deal with the issue of energy prices for Australians. Never was that more clearly revealed, Senator McAllister, than when your shadow minister, Mr Mark Butler, last week revealed, accepted, confessed that it was as a result of the Labor government's decision not to regulate the export of gas from the Australian market that Australian energy prices have increased. One of the reasons why Australian energy prices have increased, as your own shadow minister has conceded, is a mistaken decision made by your government to allow unregulated exports of gas from the Australian gas fields. Now, Senator McAllister—

                                       measures that the Australian government has taken to ensure that there is downward pressure on energy prices. First of all, we haven't repeated the mistake that you now admit that you made in deregulating the export of gas. We have regulated the export of gas to ensure that that resource is available to Australian consumers before it is available to overseas consumers. Secondly, Senator McAllister, the Prime Minister and the minister for energy have intervened directly with the energy suppliers to ensure transparency in their billing to Australian consumers.

                                             (—) (): Senator McAllister, I can certainly not confirm that, because it's not true. This government is determined to make its policy choices on the basis of economics and engineering, compared to you, Senator McAllister, and your party, who seem to be driven by your need to compete with the Greens to secure an ideological approach to energy policy. Our approach to energy policy, Senator McAllister, is not ideological; it is pragmatic. We are determined to ensure that Australians have affordable and reliable power, and we do that by being pragmatic. We are agnostic as to the source of the power, whether it be coal, whether it be gas or whether it be renewables. We have an all-of-the-above approach—whatever is available and whatever is most affordable.

                                               I thank Senator Duniam for his question. He, like everybody on this side of the chamber, appreciates that there are no silver bullets to address the energy challenges that Australia faces. It requires consistent, comprehensive action across all of the different components of the energy market: retail, network, distribution and generation. All of those are essential for us to tackle, and that is why as a government we are taking action across each and every one of those fronts. It's why we are taking action in terms of generator reliability obligations, ensuring that they must balance intermittent renewable generation with storage backup to guarantee dispatchability; ensuring energy security obligations, so that the systems must deal with maintenance of inertia, to guarantee that systems continue to work effectively in the future; new arrangements around guaranteed closure notice periods that can provide governments with time to deal with the uncertainty created by intended closures such as that at Liddell, for example; and further pressure applying in terms of the abolition of the limited merits review process, so networks can no longer game the system, something that has hit consumers with about $6 billion in additional costs over a period of time. We're taking that action.
                                              </p>
                                              <p>
                                               Those opposite criticised us, saying that it had been taking too long for the abolition of limited merits review to happen. The member for

                                               attacked that in June this year, and yet the opposition in this chamber, when we bring legislation here, then delays its consideration, delays that action being put into place. It shows the hypocrisy we get from those opposite. Equally, we are taking the steps to get more gas into the market. This is important for direct gas users as well as energy consumers overall. Just last week, Santos announced it would provide an additional 30 petajoules into the domestic market as well as 27 petajoules for feedstock suppliers. This is critical. Labor again admitted they knew in government there was a problem there but did nothing. This government is fixing it.

We know that that's not true. We know that their approaches in the past are what got us into this mess today. We know that the approaches of state Labor governments got those states into an even bigger mess and are getting some states into bigger messes still. We know that, in Victoria, the closure of Hazelwood has contributed to a $135 increase in average household electricity bills. That's triple what Premier Dan Andrews promised. It's triple the cost estimates that he made in terms of that closure. We know that the closure of Northern in
