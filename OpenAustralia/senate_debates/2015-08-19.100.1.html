        My question is to the Minister for Human Services, Senator Payne, representing the Minister for Trade and Investment. Can the minister inform the Senate how the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement will create new jobs and opportunities for Australians? Is the minister aware of any misinformation being peddled by those opposed to this job-creating and historic agreement with our largest trading partner?

         I thank Senator Bushby very much for that question. I can in fact inform the Senate about the very valuable China-Australia Free Trade Agreement and the jobs and opportunities that it will create for so many Australians. It is, as I have said before, a landmark free trade agreement. It is going to open up absolutely huge opportunities for Australia's resources, for our agriculture, for manufacturing and for service industries, and it will create thousands and thousands of jobs into the future.
        </p>
        <p>
         So it is unfortunate that those opposite, particularly at the behest of the union movement or aspects of the union movement, seem to be continuing their effort to derail the agreement by repeating what are utterly false claims in relation to investment facilitation arrangements and to labour market testing. It is a campaign which is simply disingenuous. The investment facilitation arrangements negotiated in parallel to ChAFTA will not reduce existing migration safeguards or permit overseas workers to work in Australia in preference to Australians. The Department of Immigration and Border Protection guidelines make it crystal clear that employers must demonstrate a labour market need and prove that Australians are being provided the first opportunity. There is also a mandatory requirement for employers to consult with stakeholders throughout this process, including with unions. Any suggestion that the Australian government would enter into any agreement that deprives Australians of the first opportunity for jobs is absolutely ludicrous.

           The irresponsible campaign against this historic agreement is something I would expect from the

            CFMEU
           </a>
           and from people of their calibre. Their protectionist attitude is infamous and, frankly, widely ridiculed. But I do not expect it from people such as the shadow minister, Senator Wong, who I thought would know better than to support a factually incorrect and highly damaging campaign such as is now being peddled on a daily basis.

             I can in fact confirm that the labour provisions associated with the ChAFTA sit within our existing skilled visa program, including our 457 visa program. This of course is the same 457 visa program that elements of the trade union movement have been attacking for years. So, as Minister Cash said earlier this week, given the revelation that multiple trade unions in Australia have employed subclass 457 visa holders, the long-term coordinated campaign the union movement has waged against the 457 program, and what they are now trying to do against the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, is frankly an act of incredible hypocrisy and duplicity. In fact, over at least the five years, at least 41 subclass 457 visa holders have been sponsored by over eight unions in Australia. That level of hypocrisy is quite remarkable. As we said in the chamber earlier this week, not since Mr McTernan was employed on a 457 visa have we had such blatant hypocrisy from the union movement.

               Every day that the opposition refuses to support this landmark agreement is a day of lost opportunities for Australians. And I am going to remind this chamber every day I have the opportunity of where those opportunities will be lost. Failure to ratify the agreement will cost the red meat industry $100 million, the dairy industry up to $60 million, the wine industry up to $50 million and the grains industry more than $43 million. The coal industry says that every week of delay will cost it about $4.6 million a week in extra tariff payments on thermal and coking coal. And, as I have said, the Financial Services Council warns that if the ChAFTA does not proceed it would cost our economy more than $4 billion and some 10,000 jobs in financial services alone by 2030. So those opposite face a major economic test. Will they continue decades of bipartisan support for freer trade and support this outstanding agreement, which will create tens of thousands of jobs, or will they not?

                 As the minister representing the Minister for Trade and Investment, I am not going to comment on a future advertising campaign. I do not know where the shadow minister was on budget night—I have no idea where the shadow minister was on budget night—but we can go to 'Budget Paper No. 2: Budget Measures—Part 2: Expense Measures' and examine what is under 'Foreign Affairs and Trade—Free Trade Agreement Promotion'. As best as I recall, the budget was handed down in May. But, apparently, in the shadow minister's press release this is a revelation. I am fortunate enough to have the document here—revelations that
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Abbott" rel="nofollow">
                  Tony Abbott
                 </a>
                 will spend tens of millions of dollars. The budget was, in fact, revelatory on so many levels, because it was such a superb budget. But calling it—from May to August—'revelatory' is bordering on high farce. It is hardly a secret. Here we go—let me quote for those opposite:

                  , I ask a supplementary question. I refer to the
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOU" rel="nofollow">
                   MOU
                  </a>
                  and investment facilitation arrangement negotiated as part of the ChAFTA which sets out migration arrangements for Chinese-funded infrastructure projects valued at just $150 million or more. Can the minister confirm that the MOU states, 'There will be no requirement for labour market testing to enter into an investment facilitation arrangement'?

                            It is not a flow chart; they are the words of your agreement. With the number of unemployed Australians standing at 800,000—the highest in more than 20 years—why is this government scrapping labour market testing safeguards and engaging in a taxpayer-funded spin campaign for an agreement that risks Australian jobs?

                             I am quoting from the Department of Immigration and Border Protection guidelines. I will support Senator Wong with a copy of the chart, if that would be helpful to her. And, of course, I would note in appreciation the government's thanks to Professor the Hon.
