        and champion of the people, a friend and political colleague, the Hon. Terance Gerald Roberts, Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Reconciliation and Minister for Correctional Services, who passed away on 18 February, 2006. Born into an

        working-class family in 1946 to parents Tob and Tet Roberts, Terry grew up with his brother John in Millicent in the state’s south-east.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was here that Terry joined the

        , secured his trade qualifications before working as a merchant mariner and was elected shop steward for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMWU" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Millicent was also where he met and married in 1972 Elizabeth Braham, and together they raised two sons, Nick and Tim. In November 1985 he was elected as a member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislative_Council" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        of South Australia. Terry had a deep commitment to working people. He knew not only where he was from, but whose side he was on—the side of workers, the side of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
         Indigenous Australians
        </a>
        , the side of those who needed someone to speak up for them. A man of principle, Terry was always prepared to give to all, even those with opposing views, a fair go, a fair hearing. But his overriding principle was to ensure any decisions were made in the best interests of those he represented as a union delegate and, for two decades, as a member of the South Australian parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        His state funeral last Friday in Adelaide was attended by more than 600 people from all walks of life and political persuasions. Particularly notable were the many people from Aboriginal communities who came to pay their respects to the man they claimed had been their minister and their mate. Outside perhaps an Indigenous football carnival, it was probably one of the largest gatherings of Aboriginal people across South Australia. Such was the high esteem in which Terry was held that the Ernabella choir, made up of community members from Ernabella, Mimili and Pipalyatjara, travelled a 3,600-kilometre round trip to acknowledge his commitment to their cause.
       </p>
       <p>
        He recognised a need and so established the bipartisan Aboriginal Lands Parliamentary Standing Committee which had a positive impact on addressing housing, local government and infrastructure for Indigenous communities, and his work with Reconciliation South Australia was invaluable. Terry cared deeply about and was committed to advancing the cause of our Indigenous people. He walked among their communities, he walked their land with them. From education and health, to native title and Aboriginal heritage, no issue was out of bounds or beyond his understanding.
       </p>
       <p>
        A man of gentle nature and remarkable patience, Terry would sit down and listen, taking in all that was said and working through ways of adequately addressing the issues that were raised. His commitment to the trade union movement, to the struggle to achieve social justice for the working class and to effect change for the disadvantaged—and in particularly Indigenous Australians—was unwavering.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last Friday flags flew at half-mast around the state, including in Terry’s home town of Millicent. Just prior to the service, the South Australian Premier,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Rann" rel="nofollow">

        , announced a special scholarship to be established in honour of the memory and contribution of the former cabinet minister and 20-year member of the legislative council. Terry cherished the time he spent with his sons Nick, Tim, Harry and Tom and partner, Julie. He shared memorable experiences with them.
       </p>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Roberts" rel="nofollow">

        was not known as a man of few words. In fact, those that knew him knew that he was a man of many words. But when he left his office two weeks ago, unbeknown to him for what was to be the last time, he scribbled a note that he left behind, which quoted the words of former Labor Premier,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Dunstan" rel="nofollow">
         Don Dunstan
        </a>
        . It read, ‘There remains much to be done.’ And so, like the true believer that he was, in his own quiet way, Terry ensured that his work would continue. So few words on this occasion, but a volume of meaning for those that follow.
