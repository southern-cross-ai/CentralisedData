        I seek leave to make a personal explanation for the purpose of correcting the record.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted
       </p>
       <p>
        This is the first opportunity I have had to correct the record since it was drawn to my attention. I seek to clarify the record with regard to correspondence between me and the live export industry in relation to animal welfare matters. On 30 November 2010 I met with representatives of the industry to discuss animal welfare issues in the live export trade. Following on from this meeting I wrote to the industry on 17 January. This letter was addressed to the Australian Livestock Exporters Council and also sent to LiveCorp. In that letter I made it clear that I was seeking industry support and advice on systems to improve animal welfare outcomes achieved in the live trade generally and in particular during the Eid festival. On 24 January I received a response from the Australian Livestock Exporters Council which was copied to LiveCorp. This letter made it clear that, after my involvement, the Australian Livestock Exporters Council, LiveCorp and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat_and_Livestock_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Meat and Livestock Australia
        </a>
        were taking steps to deliver better animal welfare outcomes through the trade.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 21 March I again wrote to the Australian Livestock Exporters Council reiterating my support for the industry and again asking for proposals to improve animal welfare outcomes across the trade. On 22 March I received a response from the Aust­ralian Livestock Exporters Council. That response again made it very clear that, as a result of my engagement with the issues, the industry—the Australian Livestock Exporters Council, LiveCorp and Meat and Live­stock Australia—had commenced a process to deliver better animal welfare outcomes.
       </p>
       <p>
        I table a copy of those letters. Any suggestion that Meat and Livestock Australia were not aware of any of my concerns about these issues is not correct.
