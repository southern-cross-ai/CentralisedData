         Over the weekend, the Prime Minister gave the most significant speech on Indigenous affairs by an

         . He outlined the government's plan to implement the Uluru Statement from the Heart in full, and, specifically, he laid out plans to enshrine a voice to parliament in the Constitution, proposing a referendum question for consultation:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Do you support an alteration to the Constitution that establishes an Aboriginal and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
          Torres Strait Islander
         </a>
         Voice?
        </p>
        <p>
         It's a straightforward proposition; it's a simple principle; it's a question from the heart. Our starting point is a recommendation to add three sentences to the Constitution in recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Peoples" rel="nofollow">
          First Peoples

        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <p>
         We are seeking momentous change, together. But it is also a very simple one, because, at its heart, it's about consulting our
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          First Nations
         </a>
         brothers and sisters, our First Nations peoples. It's about consulting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples on the decisions that affect them. It is nothing more and nothing less. And, as the Prime Minister said, it is simple courtesy and common decency.

            I thank the senator for her supplementary question. The voice will be an unflinching source of advice and of accountability. It's not a third chamber; it's not a rolling veto; it's not a blank cheque. It's a body with the perspective and power and platform to tell the government and the parliament the truth about what is working and what is not—to tell the truth with clarity and with conviction. So it's not an either/or proposition. We can and must do both.
           </p>
           <p>
            It won't delay our plan to train 500 new Aboriginal healthcare workers or stand in the way of our new investments in lifesaving kidney dialysis treatment. It won't slow us from upgrading roads or expanding education and economic opportunities. On the contrary, recognition and a voice will accelerate progress, because the accountability of the voice will help us get on track to close the gap.

               parliamentarians—including the good senator—than ever before, and that does make an enormous difference. But elections mean parliamentarians come and go. The voice will exist and endure outside of the ups and downs of election cycles.
              </p>
              <p>
               Let's recall that the Statement from the Heart is the outcome of the most significant consultation process of First Nations Peoples Australia has ever seen. It builds on the work of the Expert Panel on Constitutional Recognition of
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
                Indigenous Australians
               </a>
               and the 16-member Referendum Council. There had been many years of consultation by the time the council travelled to 12 different locations around Australia and met with over 1,200 Indigenous representatives. Whilst I respect that there are differences of views, including in this place, I do urge senators to recognise and respect the years of concerted effort that have got us this far.

                 I could certainly start to provide an answer, but, if there is more information that I can provide to the senator, I will following question time. I think the idea that the Prime Minister outlined on the weekend is for the consultations to commence on a whole range of detail about progressing this to the referendum stage. I think the Prime Minister was very clear on the weekend that he didn't want to determine arrangements without consultations with
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
                  First Nations
                 </a>
                 people, but the regional voice arrangements will be put in place and they will provide a nationally-consistent system for First Nations people and government to work in partnership at the regional level. The regional voice arrangements will complement a First Nations voice at the national level. Obviously, there will be consultations across the board not just with First Nations communities but also with state and territory governments, but, if I can provide further information for the senator, I will do that following question time.

                    (—) (): My understanding is that there has been deep consultation with a whole range of stakeholders around the development of the advice that informed the speech the Prime Minister gave on the weekend.

I would make this point, and it picks up really what Senator Price asked my colleague Senator Gallagher: I appreciate that this is a big change for many people. And I appreciate that there are those who wish to ask questions of detail. Sometimes, even if those questions are answered, they will not change their position. I respect that, but—
