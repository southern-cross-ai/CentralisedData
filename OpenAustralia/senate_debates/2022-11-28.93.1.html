        I rise today to speak about the rising floodwaters currently impacting my home area of the Riverland in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        . Modelling shows that the floods that are about to hit the Riverland are likely to be the highest water levels we've seen in over 50 years, in fact the highest water levels we've seen since 1956.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to acknowledge the efforts of the community, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SES" rel="nofollow">
         SES
        </a>
        , the councils—of all of the people in the Riverland, including our very hard-working local member
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Whetstone" rel="nofollow">
         Tim Whetstone
        </a>
        —as they prepare for the flows that are going to inundate our communities over the summer period. Everybody in the Riverland is going to be impacted in some way by these events, from the families who have riverfront shacks; the tourism operators like the caravan parks, who will not be able to access their fantastic summer trade, as the skiers won't be able to come up to the caravan parks; to the primary producers and irrigators, who are likely to be without power for that period; the small business owners, who are still only just recovering from the impacts of COVID; and those that will be impacted by road closures, making it difficult for them to get to and from work.
       </p>
       <p>
        That's why it's so important, as we prepare for this serious event, that we make sure that tourists to the Riverland are still encouraged to visit. Despite the media reporting, it is still safe to visit this really beautiful part of my home state of South Australia. It is an incredible time for them to be visiting. Now is a once in a lifetime opportunity to witness the river come alive. With water flows at record highs our whole river system is flourishing with wildlife. You can also visit the local wineries, the breweries and the distilleries, and indulge in the spectacular Riverland produce, which is never better than it is during our summer period. You can also enjoy a fantastic climate. As much as this is a spectacle, we also need to respect it. Please come to the Riverland and enjoy it this summer.
