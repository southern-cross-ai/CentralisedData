        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, Senator Evans. Can the minister confirm to the Senate the costs incurred by the

         I thank the senator for the question. As I understand it, he is asking me to give him the cost of the fuel used across the defence forces. I think it will come as no surprise to the Senate—and I suspect this is a set-up for a supplementary—that I do not have that answer at my fingertips. I am sure that if I were the Minister for Defence and not just representing him I would have had that information at my fingertips, but as it is I do not. I will have to assure the senator that I will take it on notice and make the appropriate inquiries. I suggest that questions of such detail would probably be best asked at estimates. I am sure Senator Johnston will spend some time at estimates pursuing answers of the defence minister and the department. Clearly, as a representing minister I do not have access to that sort of detail at question time, but I will certainly do what I can to get an answer for the senator as soon as possible. I suspect that will not be until after parliament rises today, and therefore he will get it when he pursues the issue at Senate estimates sometime next week.

           Again, I cannot give the senator the detail that he seeks. I can say that Defence is considering the potential implications of the introduction of a carbon price on its activities. Noting the widespread nature of goods purchased by Defence, it would be reasonable to forecast the impact on Defence to be broadly equivalent to that of the wider community, namely, about 0.7 per cent. While looking at the question and its implications, Defence is also aggressively looking to reduce its carbon emissions. It has committed to reducing emissions to the extent practical, particularly in non-operational and support activities. It supports the use of renewable energies through its purchase of green energy. As part of its electricity agreements, it currently purchases 10 per cent green energy. That is the information I can help the senator with. If there is more I can get for him I will provide that.

            will be exempt from paying the carbon tax on its carbon emissions of 1.7 million tonnes per annum, which is 68 times the government's tonnage threshold for the carbon tax?

             As I indicated in my responses to the primary question and the first supplementary, I do not have briefing on the level of emissions Defence is responsible for, nor the amount of fuel used et cetera, but I will get what information I can. As I say, I suspect it will have to be pursued at Senate estimates next week. What I can say, and what is important to put on record, is that defence operations are funded on the basis of no win, no loss, so there will be no impact on Defence's actual operations. The actual costs of operations are funded on a no win, no loss basis. I think the senator well knew that he would not get the sort of detail he asked for until Senate estimates or later. We will do our best, but I suggest that if he wants to use question time for that he got the answer that he thought he would get.
