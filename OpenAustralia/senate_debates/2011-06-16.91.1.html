        <p>
         Thank you. In terms of cattle for Indonesia, the office around March and April had some indication from animal welfare associations that there were concerns about animal welfare outcomes in Indonesia. But, to be clear about this, the evidence that was relied on in making a decision in relation to the suspension was supplied to my office and me on 30 May, the day that the

         television program went to air. From that decision a range of events occurred. That evening I banned 12 facilities after preparing advice from the department. All of that is in this context: right back through from January I had been writing to industry and indicating to industry that they needed to improve their animal welfare outcomes. In doing so, I have been en­couraging them to improve their animal welfare outcomes over time. They responded with a plan during that period, and with that plan I clearly indicated to them that (a) I did not endorse it; and (b) it certainly did not go far enough—its time lines were too short. What I continued to say to industry during this period was that they did need to improve their animal welfare outcomes—unlike, of course, those on the other side, where today we still see that the opposition and the

         government would condemn cattle to cruelty, because they have no idea where the cattle would be sent if you were simply to tick off abattoirs as we speak and allow cattle to be sent into Indonesia.

          , I ask a supplementary question. The minister is a lawyer so, in legal speak, 'further and better particulars, please'. When did the government first raise with the beef industry any concerns that some Australian cattle were being treated cruelly in some Indonesian abattoirs? Who in government raised those concerns, with whom in industry, and precisely how?

           As I have been saying consistently, in terms of animal welfare there are outcomes for the live animal export industry. I wrote to industry in January and since that time, and right up to the

           program—if we can use that as a bookend to that period—I have spoken to a range of industry representatives, including LiveCorp and

            MLA
           </a>
           . There was also the opportunity in April to raise animal welfare outcomes with the Cattle Council of Australia in Katherine in the

            Northern Territory

           .

           In addition to that, through my office, at meetings I have had with the

            RSPCA
           </a>
           and Animals Australia I have raised the issues of how to improve live animal welfare outcomes in live animal export markets during that entire period. In addition to that, I have worked consistently with a range of stakeholders to improve animal welfare outcomes over that entire period.

             </a>
             provided back to me an action plan dealing with animal welfare outcomes. As I indicated, what I have said consistently to them is that (1) I did not endorse it; and (2) it did not go far enough—its time lines were far too long. Consistently through that period we spoke to the MLA and other industry bodies—LiveCorp—about this particular issue and about how they needed to improve their opportunity to ensure that they could continue to have a live animal export industry while maintaining animal welfare outcomes for the industry.
