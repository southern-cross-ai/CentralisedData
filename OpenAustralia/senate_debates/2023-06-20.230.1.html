        </a>
        raising significant concerns about the delay in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Gymnastics Australia
        </a>
        signing up for the National Redress Scheme. Since late 2020, Gymnastics Australia has been listed as an organisation intending to join the Redress Scheme. I'm advised the process usually takes three to six months but that it has still not been completed by this institution. With the Redress Scheme ending in mid-2027, every delay by institutions at this stage means more survivors who will not be able to access the scheme.
       </p>
       <p>
        My office has spoken with survivors of abuse who have applied for redress payments from Gymnastics Australia but are still waiting, some for up to two years, for the organisation to complete the process of joining the scheme. Meanwhile, they get no information and no details—nothing from Gymnastics Australia about the delay. They are worried that Gymnastics Australia are only saying they will join the scheme to ensure they continue to receive federal funding from Sport Integrity Australia—funding which would be denied them had they not been in the process of joining the scheme. Obviously, if that is true, it is deeply concerning and cynical.
       </p>
       <p>
        Across the country, there are a number of active criminal prosecutions against perpetrators from this organisation, Gymnastics Australia. It is a significant issue, and across the country there are likely hundreds of affected people, mainly women and girls, who are waiting for the sport to act and take responsibility. I say to the survivors now: you have a right to fair compensation. You have a right for the institution to take responsibility for what happened to you.

        Since the ousting of Pakistan's former Prime Minister Imran Khan in April last year, we've seen excessive force being used against protesters, mass arrests of political opponents, prominent journalists going missing and civilians being tried under military law. All of these actions are contrary to international law. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Greens
        </a>
        remain deeply concerned about the escalating tensions in Pakistan, with growing protests and government led suppression leading to extensive violence. That dangerous cycle of violence must end.
       </p>
       <p>
        These developments have impacted Australians as well. In 2020, Australian Hasan Askree was sentenced to five years in prison for the crime of writing a letter which was critical of a military official. Mr Askree was released last week only after prolonged advocacy by his family and by the Pakistani diaspora, who raised awareness of his case and continued to put pressure on to secure his release. I want to commend the work of my Greens colleagues Senators Steele-John and Faruqi, who, along with me, advocated in this place for Mr Askree's release. The Greens will always stand up for human rights around the globe, and we continue to urge the government of Pakistan to uphold the human rights of its people and hold those who violate them accountable under law.
       </p>
       <p>
        My office has been hearing from the Pakistani diaspora, who are deeply concerned about the political situation in Pakistan, and today in this parliament I'm here in solidarity with them. The Greens urge the government of Pakistan to hear these calls from across the global Pakistani diaspora and commit to free and fair elections, open to all to nominate for election, because the people of Pakistan deserve the right to elect the representatives of their choice and to have their votes counted and their democracy respected.
