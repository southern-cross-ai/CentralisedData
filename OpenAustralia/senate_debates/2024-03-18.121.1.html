        Over the past few weeks I have had the honour of visiting a number of schools in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        that have benefited from an investment by the Labor government in the Capital Grants Program. I recently attended Playford College in Elizabeth for the opening of the new

        building. This school has a wonderful story to tell. It started as a vacant piece of government property and is now a thriving community for Muslim students from diverse backgrounds. Its inception was a vision of that community, and what has been built is a community hub where students work alongside the community, in these facilities that the government has been able to contribute to, to build their opportunities for the future. It's a great learning environment, and the dedication and commitment of the teachers, students and the broader community is a joy to behold.

        I also recently visited Tyndale Christian school at Strathalbyn for the opening of their new resource centre and hospitality area. I was lucky enough to receive a lesson from some of the hospitality students on how to use an induction stove top, which is part of their new installation in that area. It was so clear that in that school it's not just the bricks and mortar, it's not just the facilities and the opportunities that they bring, but it's the community that is building the confidence of those students, investing their trust in those students and building a community hub where the students feel deeply valued and can engage in building their opportunities for the future. It was an absolute delight to be out there. It's a reminder of what we need in our schools, that holistic dedication to commitment. The government is delighted to partner with the schools in achieving that end for their students.
