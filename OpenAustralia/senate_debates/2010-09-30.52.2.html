          Both the government and opposition whips have indicated that there is no support for this motion, so what I want to do briefly is test the room to see whether it is possible to get a brief statement or whether Senator Ludwig was planning on putting something on the record.

            You are? That is great. This motion relates to some announcements from the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Minister" rel="nofollow">
             Chief Minister
            </a>
            of the Northern Territory yesterday relating to the Angela Pamela uranium proposal, which is about 20 kilometres from

             Alice Springs
            </a>
            , that were followed shortly afterwards by Mr Terry Mills, who is the leader of the Territory Country Liberal Party, that there is now cross-party support—

             ALP

            and Greens—in the Northern Territory, responding to longstanding community opposition to the Angela Pamela uranium mine on the outskirts of Alice. What this motion really seeks to do is draw out from the Gillard government as to whether the wishes of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Australia" rel="nofollow">
             Central Australia
            </a>
            n community would be respected or not, as the Rudd government assumed overarching responsibility for signing off uranium mines in the Territory. It is quite clearly within the power of the Gillard government to override the cross-party opposition to the uranium mine, which reflects a strong community sentiment. In the context of a by-election which is playing out in Central Australia at the moment, I do not think it is unreasonable for both the government and the opposition to put some kind of comment on the record if they believe a motion in the Senate is too much of a blunt instrument. I would invite comment on this.

              The words that I am going to use do not go strictly to the point that you raised. Now that you have put it on the record, I will seek further information from the minister for a reply. The current words that I am going to use I do not think go strictly to the point that you have raised, but I will get back to the Senate as soon as I can with a response for you. It may not stop you from moving the motion that you are now proposing.
             </p>
             <p>
              In accordance with the position of seeking leave, can I add that the Northern Territory Mining Act sets out the process by which any exploration or mining in the Northern Territory must be approved; any role that the Commonwealth has in such process will be undertaken strictly in accordance with the law. The Minister for Resources and Energy has advised me that there is no application before the Commonwealth relating to mining at the Angela Pamela mine and therefore the Commonwealth has no decision to make at this point. The government therefore does not support the motion.
