         I thank Senator Keneally for that question. I just note, too, that I thank her for my first question as the Minister for Defence in this capacity. I would also acknowledge that there is no greater responsibility for any minister than this portfolio and the safety and security of our nation, and I look forward to working with all in this chamber and the other on all of these issues.

         In relation to the question on the meeting with the

We had a very productive discussion with them. The governor of Manus was in attendance and, again, we had a discussion about the future of Manus and about the base and also the facility. We agreed that we will continue to work together to further develop the facilities there with a view to new employment opportunities for those on

                   Again, there is nobody in detention there. The reason anybody was on that island is your responsibility. Australia takes its international obligations seriously, and we provide protection to refugees consistent with those obligations, which are set out in statutory refugee frameworks.

                       You might not like my answer because you're the one who is responsible for the mess that we are cleaning up. However, Australia, along with the United States of America and Canada, collectively offer the majority of global resettlement places every year.
