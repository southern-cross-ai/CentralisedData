        My question is to the Minister for Defence, Senator Payne. I commend the government for delivering on its pre-election commitment to build 12 new submarines in Adelaide and I congratulate the successful bidder,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DCNS" rel="nofollow">
         DCNS
        </a>
        . Minister, I note that the French were the only bidder to have nuclear powered submarines. I also remind the minister of my question to her predecessor, Senator Johnston, in this place in December 2014. In his answer to my question, the minister congratulated me for commencing the nuclear submarine debate. I note that
        <i>
         The Financial Review
        </i>
        observed yesterday that some of our new submarines could in fact be nuclear powered by the time they enter service. Minister, could some of the 12 Future Submarines be nuclear powered?

         Senator Day, I thank you very much for the question. The answer is no, that is not in the government's contemplation.

          Royal commission into the nuclear fuel cycle has delivered interim findings and will release its final findings this Friday. Given that there might be a potential nuclear powered component for Future Submarines will the government commit to investigate and publish a cost-benefit analysis of the French nuclear industry helping to expand South Australian and national nuclear capabilities?

            , I ask a further supplementary question. Given that the French have just six submarines, as do the Germans—and the Japanese have 17—is the minister confident that, by the end of the Future Submarines build, Australia will have the capacity to build its own submarines without relying on an international partner or, indeed, selling its capacity to other nations?

            <p>
             As I said yesterday, I think in response to a question from Senator Reynolds, one of the most important aspects of the decision the government has made in relation to an Australian build for the 12 Future Submarines in Adelaide relates to the capacity to develop a sovereign capability for ourselves—that is, the capacity to sustain and maintain submarines without the need for reliance externally. That is a fundamental aspect of the importance of our decision making in that regard. I indicate to the Senate that, as the capability is developed—as the training, the jobs, the high-technology and the innovation requirements are brought together in the design process—we will have a multiple-decade plan for the sustainment and maintenance of these submarines, let alone the build. That will give us a very strong capability and a very strong foundation on which to continue to operate that capability.
