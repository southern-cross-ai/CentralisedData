        First responders and emergency service workers must be supported by the governments that employ them. Unfortunately, there is not a consistent approach around Australia and, disappointingly, my own state falls down in this regard, especially in addressing the effects of their service on their mental health.
       </p>
       <p>
        These women and men risk their lives to keep us safe. They are not just ordinary employees of the state. They are asked every day to rush into dangerous situations and either resolve them or provide care to those in need. Many are even volunteers, such as those serving in regional ambulance stations or in the

        . As a veteran, I am acutely aware of the nation's moral obligation to care for the soldiers that have served in conflict. This is an immutable concept. The identical moral compact must be extended by state and territory governments to their first responders and emergency service workers.
       </p>
       <p>
        The federal government is proposing in its Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Closing Loopholes) Bill that first responders, at the federal level and within the

        no longer be required to prove that their work significantly contributed to their condition when making a claim. While my party has difficulty with other aspects of this bill, I personally support this initiative.
       </p>
       <p>
        My former colleague from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        n Legislative Council, the Hon. Frank Pangallo, has a bill before that chamber that seeks to likewise change these laws in my state. It is my hope all parties support the passage of Mr Pangallo's bill.
       </p>

        Honourable senators will be aware that I know many in the paramedic community through my volunteering with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John_Ambulance" rel="nofollow">
         St John Ambulance
        </a>
        and my subsequent advocacy for their noble profession. I have been consistent in my advocacy and even went so far as to march alongside my paramedic friends in 2021 when they joined together to protest against ramping levels under the then state Liberal government.
       </p>
       <p>
        Studies have demonstrated that paramedics have one of the most dangerous professions in Australia, working under extreme pressure and in high-risk environments. Paramedics face burnout as a result of their service. They regularly experience sheer physical, emotional and mental exhaustion. They face high levels of workplace violence. They are twice as likely to develop PTSD than any other emergency service worker. They are twice as likely to suicide in comparison to the general public. To expect paramedics to endure a challenging and stressful claim process for their injuries is unacceptable and, in my view, an act of cruelty. It is critical that first responders, emergency service workers and volunteers can access treatment before a workers compensation claim is accepted. There will be the petty in my state parliament who may argue against such a proposal because of the cost. I ask that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         South Australian
        </a>
        Legislative Council ignore them. Members of this unhelpful disposition, such as the former Liberal Treasurer in the last government, have been consigned to the irrelevance they deserve. Morally, I do not see how South Australian parliamentarians of any persuasions can stand in the way of this legislation, given there is broad acceptance of its need at the federal level. It is time to properly address our obligations to support those who keep South Australians safe.
       </p>
       <p>
        Further, with a greater focus on early intervention and prevention mechanisms, combined with helping workers and volunteers build resilience through training programs and support structures, there should be a reduction in the reliance on workers compensation claims. With improved programs supporting wellbeing, we can aspire to rely on workers compensation only as a last resort, and at the same time have our first responders, in their respective services, remain healthier and for longer periods of time.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is already some fantastic work being done in South Australia to support paramedics. I recently toured
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flinders_University" rel="nofollow">
         Flinders University
        </a>
        paramedicine department and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide_Institute" rel="nofollow">
         Adelaide Institute
        </a>
        for Sleep Health. Both have exceptional leaders, teachers and researchers. I thank the Vice-Chancellor of Flinders University, Colin Stirling, and the university's distinguished alumnus Anastasia Bougesis for facilitating these visits. The paramedicine department is very mindful and focused on preparing its graduates for a career in which they will be constantly experiencing trauma and stress. The institute is undertaking incredible research in sleep science which will yield significant benefits for paramedics handling shift work. Studies show that lack of sleep increases the risk of mental health problems.
       </p>
       <p>
        We need a whole-of-government approach. I thank all the first responders and emergency service workers and volunteers in my state for their incredible commitment.
