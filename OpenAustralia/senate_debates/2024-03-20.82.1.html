            We have consistently said that we have complete confidence in the Community Protection Board, which was established by this government and is comprised of former and serving police and other national security officials, to provide advice to government on how this particular cohort should be treated and who should have bracelets and other conditions attached. It's also worth remembering that the reason this situation has arisen is there was a High Court decision that overturned many years of precedent.

                 Multicultural Affairs

                , will soon issue a community protection update containing the sorts of details that Senator Paterson is seeking. This government does support transparency and supports those figures being provided on a regular basis through an orderly process through the Community Protection Board that we have established. We've also made clear that at all times we'll be guided by the protection of Australian people and adherence to the law. We've seen the laughable situation where various Liberal and National party members and senators have demanded that this government ignore the law and disobey rulings of the High Court. This government has no intention of doing so. We will adhere to the law and we will keep the Australian people updated, through that community protection update.

                   senators want to criticise the government for the way that we've handled this, what they are actually doing is criticising people like former police commissioners who we are relying on for advice about all of these matters. If we want to have trumped-up senators who want to spend their time scaring the Australian community and if we want to rely on their advice rather than that of former police commissioners and people who actually take into account community safety issues each and every day, that's a matter for the opposition. The government is prepared and willing to rely on that advice from high-quality personnel.

Given the government has allowed at least 36 former detainees and at least one rapist to be free in the community without electronic monitoring, how can that possibly be the case?

                          It does distract attention from the fact that the Leader of the Opposition, as the home affairs minister, presided over a corrupt immigration system that has been described as such in a number of reports nowâ€”a completely broken system.

                          's Acting Deputy Commissioner Nicholls, who said in Senate estimates:
