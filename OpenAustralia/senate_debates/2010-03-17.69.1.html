         As Senator Evans indicated, the government is examining the coroner’s finding from his inquiry into the tragic events of 16 April last year, but I can certainly make some preliminary comments in answer to Senator Forshaw’s question. The coroner concluded that at least three passengers were involved in a plan to set fire to the vessel and that crimes may have been committed in connection with the explosion. He is referring his findings to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory_Police" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory Police
         </a>
         and the Northern Territory Director of Public Prosecutions.
        </p>
        <p>
         The coroner praised the conduct of the ADF after the explosion. He said in his findings that the timely and proactive response by the ADF to these deaths is commendable, as is the cooperation shown with the coronial process. The coroner noted the great efforts, professionalism and bravery of the ADF members collectively in rescuing survivors from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIEV" rel="nofollow">
          SIEV

         36. He specifically commended the bravery of ADF members Faunt, Keogh and Jager.
        </p>
        <p>
         I do acknowledge that the coroner also noted that the boarding and management of the SIEV36 was deficient in a number of respects, covering the boarding, search, securing and management of the vessel, as well as communications with the passengers. The Coroner noted that the ADF had taken appropriate action to address practices and procedures which had been identified in the inquiry officer’s report. He said that he was satisfied that the recommendations were being acted upon and that an incident such as occurred on SIEV36 is unlikely to occur again. The coroner noted he had been assisted by the ‘frank and honest evidence of the ADF witnesses’, but made adverse comments about the evidence given—

                  36 tragedy is among the most extreme of the situations they have confronted. I am very satisfied with and proud of the way the ADF personnel involved in the incident dealt with the rescue in extremely difficult circumstances where they themselves were at great risk and suffered injuries. I am confident that the ADF has taken a thorough and appropriate approach to ensuring that we learn lessons from this incident. Within two months the ADF had completed an internal inquiry, which I tabled in the Senate. The report was completed in June last year and made 59 recommendations going to the policy, procedures and training for boarding operations for SIEVs.
