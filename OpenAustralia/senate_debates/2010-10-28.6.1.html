           In the meetings that we are going to there is a sense that somehow the parliament has in a fashion deliberately and mischievously created an ambiguity. I think it is vitally important that we show the Australian people that in this parliament, in this Senate, we are trying to hide nothing. We have got no problems with anything being investigated. They wanted it explicitly stated and I gave an explicit commitment that I would do it. I think this is a good way to honour that commitment. The Labor Party believes there is no ambiguity in the act. I know the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government_Solicitor" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Government Solicitor
           </a>
           â€™s response said there is no ambiguity in the act. But I think it is extremely important that we show ourselves to be transparent and decisive in how we address this issue in this inquiry. Adding this section will do that.

                  I have sought and obtained leave to make a short statement. It appears that the last vote did not reflect the numbers in the chamber. We are going to find out exactly what has happened. I am asking for that vote to be recommitted at a later hour. Because it is an amendment to a substantive motion, I would then ask that that substantive motion be held over to that time. I understand that we generally have broad agreement within the Senate that that is permissible. I do apologise that we have not been able, in the short space of time, to ascertain the exact nature of the problem. Given that the opposition, with the support of the Greens and with the support of Senator Xenophon, would normally negative the vote, I can reasonably surmise there is a problem with the counting.
