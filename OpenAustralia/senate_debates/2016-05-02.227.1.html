         . This bill was the result of an independent review of the Water Act, and the government's response released last year was subject to extensive consultation with the basin communities, including Indigenous community stakeholders and all of the states. All of the state ministers and governments have expressed enthusiastic support for the current amendments passing as they are, and for this reason the government will not be supporting the amendments put forward.

          The opposition—Labor—also will not be supporting these amendments, for similar reasons. As we understand it, they do not have the support of the basin states. They have been delivered at pretty much the eleventh hour, and as we have contacted some of those basin states we understand they have not been consulted on these amendments. Therefore we cannot support these amendments, because the principle of our negotiated position has always been that this is a bipartisan position which includes the support of the basin states.

            . Could I just put on the record that the government has very strict requirements in relation to reporting. This matter was also raised by Senator Xenophon in his speech in the second reading debate—that is, the necessity for stringent reporting requirements around all aspects of the act and the implementation of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan.
           </p>
           <p>
            We ask the chamber to note that we have added a statutory requirement in the act for the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder to report annually on any trading that has been undertaken in the previous year. We will continue to consult with all senators in the chamber in relation to the very important issue of reporting arrangements.

             Similarly to the previous amendments, these have been provided with only a few hours notice, again with no consultation with the basin states. It goes outside of the arrangement that both the opposition and the government have had for some time now of consulting with basin states before we move amendments, particularly amendments that deal with reporting requirements. As the minister has just outlined, there are stringent reporting requirements around the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. We also acknowledge that the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder reporting annually is a good thing. But, on the basis of there being a principle of negotiated agreement on the Murray-Darling Basin Plan and changes to it, particularly those that are outlined in these amendments by the Greens, we will not be supporting these amendments.
