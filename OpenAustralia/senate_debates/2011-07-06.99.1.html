         Advertiser
        </i>
        today as saying that a carbon tax could cause small businesses running large trucks to 'go broke or cut corners'? Can the minister guarantee that the carbon tax will not apply to fuel used by small businesses running large trucks?

         I have been asked again to give details of a package that the government will be announcing on Sunday, and I do not propose to do that. I am interested to know whether or not Senator Birmingham is one of the so-called ginger group of modest members who have been set up to ensure that the coalition does not desert—

           , I raise a point of order on the grounds of direct relevance. As usual, this minister spends the first half of her question period attacking the questioner because she is incapable of answering. But the question was: did she agree with a colleague? That is not hypothetical or asking for a future policy announcement.

            That is not a point of order. I have ruled it is not a point of order. Senator Wong, you have one minute and 29 seconds in which to respond to the question.

             If one is asked about agreement with one's colleagues, I would have thought the coalition would not mind being reminded that some of them do not agree with the deserting of rational economic policy. This is what this group is: set up to ensure the coalition does not desert rational economic policy.

As I have previously said, that will be announced on Sunday. As the government has made clear, this is a plan to price pollution because we want to reduce it. It will be a plan that looks to the future, not to the past; it will be a plan that is based on facts and not on fear; and it will be a plan that recognises the climate science. All of those attributes are missing from the current coalition benches. All of those attributes of policy are missing from the coalition benches.

Will the minister heed the warnings of her Labor colleagues with experience in the transport sector, such as Senator Gallacher and Senator Sterle, about the impact of the government's carbon tax on road freight and other transport related costs, or can we expect Labor MPs and senators to behave like lobotomised zombies once the carbon tax is released on Sunday?

                            I am asked about lobotomised zombies by the man who used to support a price on carbon and who used to support an emissions trading scheme. Give us a break! This is extraordinary, isn't it? We have those who used to believe that climate change is real, who used to believe the science was correct, who used to accept the advice from Australia's and the world's best scientists, who used to look to rational economic policy to deal with it, and who now are lining up with those who believe that climate change is 'absolute crap'.
