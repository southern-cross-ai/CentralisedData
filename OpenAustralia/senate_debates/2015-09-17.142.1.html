        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the Senate notes the economic, social and other benefits of motorsport in Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        This speech may not start where a few people think it will, but bear with me; I will get back to why I am starting this way. It is a matter of great regret that large-scale new vehicle manufacturing in Australia is going to cease by the end of 2017. Of course this is not new news but, as with any good relationship gone bad, it is news that does not get better with time. Between my home state of Victoria and our neighbour to the west,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        , it is forecasted that between new vehicle manufacturers, original equipment manufacturers, downstream parts suppliers and the subsequent flow-on effects we will see upward of 150,000 to 200,000 jobs lost. This is at a time when unemployment is already at an uncomfortable high. I do not think we need to be contributing to that.
       </p>
       <p>
        The way I see it, we can either sit on our hands and do nothing, as appears to have been allowed to happen with our automotive manufacturing, or turn our focus to what we do well and allow new and existing businesses and opportunities to flourish. It is hard to argue that subsidising an auto sector—like every other country which manufactures cars does—at a time of need would not represent value for money. But there we were, not long before I took my seat in this place, essentially goading the auto sector into leaving our shores. It was a very disappointing point in our history and one which, in my eyes, stands out as almost economic vandalism. Subsidising the sector, keeping a potential 150,000 to 200,000 people in the southern states in a job, makes sense. Allowing the industry to leave, potentially putting those people on welfare, makes no sense at all. If we are not a country of manufacturers, we are a country of importers. This leaves us at the mercy of others in a very uncertain world. Some say, now that new vehicle manufacturing is leaving our shores, that the auto sector is dead. This is far from the truth. Much as I would like to see a rise of the phoenix in our vehicle manufacturing, an important fact that many people are not aware of is that new vehicle manufacturing is one-fifth of our auto sector. We need to focus on the other 80 per cent that is still there, and there are opportunities for it to grow, expand and even start in new directions.
       </p>
       <p>
        So how does this statement tie in with the economic and social benefits of motorsport? I will start with a report written by Ernst &amp; Young commissioned by the Confederation of Australian Motorsport,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAMS" rel="nofollow">
         CAMS
        </a>
        , in 2013. As the report states, it:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … highlights the importance of the motor sport industry to Australia, by estimating the economic contribution, value add and employment of the industry in 2013. This study also estimates other key measures, such as the number of participants, clubs and venues across Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        At this point it is important to mention that this report only covers four-wheeled motorsport and does not cover the economic benefits of two-wheeled motorsport. The report identified that four-wheeled motorsport contributes $2.7 billion in direct industry output and $1.2 billion in direct value-added, and creates 16,300 full-time jobs. This is an astounding economic contribution—and, as previously mentioned, it does not include two-wheeled motorsport. The report also notes that there are 17,419 licensed volunteer officials in Australia, who are responsible for running the majority of motorsport events held each year. It notes that motorsport is the fourth most watched sport in Australia and that 80 per cent of the people surveyed said that 'being with family and friends' is an important reason why they are involved. We all need a sense of belonging. The family culture around motorsport, which I, alongside hundreds of thousands of other Australians, am very familiar with, provides an important sense of belonging.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Ernst &amp; Young report also identifies that 30 per cent of motorsport participants live in regional areas and that 85 per cent of motorsport venues are available to those in regional areas. When attending a round of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_Supercar" rel="nofollow">
         V8 Supercar
        </a>
        s in Winton, Victoria, earlier this year I was glad to hear that this one event brought $17 million dollars to the local economy in just that one four-day weekend—$17 million to a rural community. I believe that Winton running that event each year creates around 400 jobs. There is no arguing that that is a huge benefit to the regional area—and other regional areas—and one that should be looked after and maintained well into the future. I have been informed that the Mildura drag strip contributes $60 million to the local economy every year. This is money and employment created just by people getting away from their
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and enjoying their lifestyle.
       </p>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycling_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Motorcycling Australia
        </a>
        hosts a number of national and international events each year that contribute significantly to the national, state and local economies as well. Events such as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MotoGP" rel="nofollow">
         MotoGP
        </a>
        , world superbikes at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillip_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Phillip Island
        </a>
        each year, world trials championships and world speedway grand prix events contribute tens of millions of dollars to the economy. Events like the motocross national championships, Australian speedway and supercross championships and Australian Superbike Championship contribute millions more. In 2014, Motorcycling Australia through its state controlled bodies and affiliated clubs issued licences for more than 66,500 people to participate in organised motorcycling activities. This included participation in competitive and non-competitive events as riders, officials and coaches. Over 5,500 permits were issued for Motorcycling Australia affiliated clubs across Australia, of which more than 300 were to conduct motorcycling events, which worked out to an average of 105 events being run per week.
       </p>
       <p>
        Naturally, hand in hand with motorsport comes the aftermarket industry. The aftermarket industry is heavily supported by motorsport and is a $13 billion industry. In 2013 it was worth around $11 billion. So it is actually growing without government financial support; it is currently highly successful without the need for subsidies. It also employs around 30,000 people. Of the $13 billion generated by this industry $5 billion is from local manufacturing in Australia. A decent proportion of this $5 billion is generated from the manufacturing of specialty equipment specifically designed for motorsport. An example of such a manufacturer is Albins, which is located at Delacombe in my home state of Victoria. Albins manufacture transmissions and gears for a range of motorsport applications. And as times change they have also diversified into the defence industry, supplying product for the Bushranger armoured vehicles. They also supply transaxles for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_Supercars" rel="nofollow">
         V8 Supercars
        </a>
        and export internationally.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PWR" rel="nofollow">
         PWR
        </a>
        Performance Products manufacture cooling systems for the Red Bull Formula One Team and have a huge variety of bolt-in aftermarket accessories for a variety of standard applications right through to the many different disciplines of motorsport. And this is not to forget successful Australian businesses such as SupaShock—for whom my colleague Senator Xenophon has become a passionate advocate—Xforce Exhaust, Turbosmart and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARB" rel="nofollow">
         ARB
        </a>
        . ARB are an Australian specialist manufacturer in aftermarket four-wheel drive accessories. They are an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASX" rel="nofollow">
         ASX
        </a>
        listed company with operations in Melbourne, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        and Thailand and they export to over 100 countries. That is only a very, very small proportion of our small businesses that manufacture aftermarket products in Australia; there are thousands more.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are many different disciplines of motorsport. People seem to think that motorsport consists of V8 Supercars, Formula One and MotoGP. However, this is far from the truth. These are highly successful, high-profile events but there are many more types of motorsport: motocross, hillclimbs,one-eighth mile and one-quarter mile drag racing, rally, speedway and go-carting. And there is even lawnmower racing on modified ride-on lawnmowers—they do not have the cutting deck anymore!
       </p>
       <p>
        One area I am extremely supportive of is grassroots motorsport. Like all sport, you don't begin at an elite level. None of us is lucky enough to walk straight into the V8 Supercars and have a career. But you have to start somewhere and that is generally at the local club level. Grassroots motorsport is typically entry level motorsport, the type of sport you can enter at a minimum cost. It gives those who may have an interest in competing in a safe and legal environment a place to compete and a facility to help encourage people to keep antisocial behaviour off our streets. We give those who want to play cricket a field, we give those who want to play football an oval and we create parks for those who want to skate. Yet in 2014-15 CAMS received only $339,800 of federal assistance. In comparison, sailing received a $1.25 million boost to its allocation, which took its funding up to $8,096,400.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Gippsland I have been working in close contact with a local club at Bairnsdale that is currently in the process of creating a 'multiplex'. The facility is being built on the site of a drag strip which unfortunately was demolished a few years back. Currently in its rebuild stage, the Bairnsdale multiplex has run some very successful 'show and shines' and large burnout competitions while it is awaiting the necessary funds to finalise the track to get it back to being able to host drag racing events. The club is also hosting multi-events once every month, which includes Supermoto. It has a near-complete four-wheel drive track, which will create an opportunity for people to race off-road in a four-wheel drive in a safe and legal environment. It is an affordable place for people to go to spin their wheels in a competition style if they so desire. It is not everyone's cup of tea. But we know people like to do it, so we should be providing them with a facility.
       </p>
       <p>
        This has strong support from the local police as they see the value of having the venue to point people in the right direction. That is not just something I am reading from a bit of paper. It is an actual statement. I have spoken directly to the local police. They are very supportive of having this venue to encourage people to go to the right place. If we did not provide people with a football oval on which to play their sport, there would be plenty of people playing football on the streets. We have seen many reports in the media about hoons doing the wrong thing. I do not support antisocial behaviour at all. If someone is doing the wrong thing, they absolutely deserve to have the book thrown at them. But we should at least be encouraging people to go to the right place. We have seen the economic benefits and, of course, we have seen the social benefits of keeping it off the streets and making our roads a safer place. If we want to encourage people to keep it off the streets, I think the social benefits of having a track to go to makes a great deal of sense.
       </p>
       <p>
        It would probably come as no surprise that many, many people are calling for access to tracks at which they can compete at a grassroots level. It is often said that if you get your kids into cars they will not have the time or money for drugs. These grassroots motorsport clubs provide a sense of community, extended family and belonging. Motorsport clubs provide members with personal support networks. These are all key ingredients in providing positive mental health outcomes. I am part of the Maffra &amp; District Car Club. They hold a junior development program. So the motorsport facility is also used as a driver education facility. The junior development program gives you an opportunity to learn how to brake in a car, take off in a car and position yourself in a car.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rather than someone passing a test at 16 years of age and then going on to look at their learner's permit and hitting the road for the very first time without ever having taken their foot off the clutch, there is an opportunity to teach them how to drive. Many other motorsport venues do the same thing. There are so many volunteers who get involved who like to participate in a better outcome for young drivers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Something that is not so much motorsport related but which is tied in, is that motorsport clubs generally have a tendency to get heavily involved in charities—charity rides to raise money for cancer events or missing children events. One I have heard of recently was from somebody in the Victorian Torana Club. The Melbourne Old School Cruisers club got together about 600 cars to raise money for a missing child. I think that is an important social factor which is regularly missed out on. I am aware that I am running out of time, so I might have to cut some of the speech out—actually, I will continue. I have never really gone for the whole 20 minutes!
       </p>
       <p>
        In Queensland recently, motorsport and enthusiast clubs from a variety of backgrounds came together in support of a charity need. Bravehearts Highway Thunder is a convoy of road cars, four-wheel drives, bikes and trucks that all meet up at a 'show-n-shine' to raise money for programs to educate, empower and protect Australian children against sexual abuse. For the last 15 years Four Wheel Drive Queensland has run the annual
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraser_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Fraser Island
        </a>
        Cleanup. In mentioning this event, I would also like to single out Jeff and Nola Chase, who I have been told have been the driving force behind this event. It was their idea to utilise the resources of Four Wheel Drive Queensland in the beginning. I have it on good authority that Jeff and Nola were both recognised for their volunteer commitment to the event and to Fraser Island when they were presented with an award by the Queensland Parks and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Wildlife Services
        </a>
        in 2012.
       </p>
       <p>
        I should mention why I started with the death, or perceived death, of our automotive industry. I have mentioned the after-market industry, the passionate people in the car clubs and so on. With the correct policy settings, we can use this after-market industry—which is already very self-sufficient—and create an industry that can grow and soak up some of the jobs that are going to be lost when automotive manufacturing leaves by 2017. We can encourage motorsport and the industries that are supported by it. We are good at it, so we should be doing everything we can, no matter how big or how small, to allow our industries to soak up the excess jobs that are going to be lost.
       </p>
       <p>
        During the recent Australian Automotive Industry Summit of the Motor Trades Association of Australia, comments were made that there is not enough spoken about motorsport in Australia at a federal level. I have two minutes and 30 seconds left, although I have cut part of my speech out, so I hope at least that this motion has started a new direction in conversation and covered that!

         I rise also to address Senator Muir's motion on the economic, social and other benefits of motorsport in Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ever since I was a child I have been drawn to motorsport. I recall well the many Sunday mornings in early October each year watching 'the great race' as a child—with my most enduring memories being the epic battles between the big

         Over the course of my adult life I have since participated in a number of entry-level motorsport events—mainly hill climbs, track days and the like. I have even managed to compete occasionally since I joined the Senate—most recently in the inaugural Targa Hellyer Gorge event in north-west Tasmania earlier this year. My interest is shared by many Australians—large numbers of whom participate and even more who spectate.

           I have a Ford in the garage down there now. Our combined passion—those many Australians who enjoy and appreciate motorsport—has created enormous benefits for this great country of ours. Indeed, it is a fact that motorsport is the fourth-most-watched sport in Australia in terms of spectator attendance, behind only Australian rules football, horseracing and
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_League" rel="nofollow">

           .
          </p>
          <p>
           Last year I rose in this place to pay tribute a true international giant of motorsport and a truly great Australian, Sir John Arthur 'Jack' Brabham AO,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBE" rel="nofollow">
            OBE
           </a>
           . Sir Jack was a pioneer of Formula One racing in Australia. He was a relatively late starter to Formula One racing, entering his first race at the age of 30 and winning his first drivers' world championship at the age of 34. He successfully defended his championship the very next year, and reclaimed the title five years later in 1966 at the age of 40. His success was credited to his personal qualities, including hard work, perseverance, flair and courage—traits that all Australians aspire to. I am certain that Sir Jack played a big role in cementing the popularity of motorsports in Australia.

           Beyond the myriad 'larger than life' personalities and innumerable motorsport champions that the sport and its fans inevitably create, motorsport has provided some wonderful benefits to the Australian economy. Motorsport relates to any form of land-based motorised competition, regardless of whether it has four wheels, two wheels or any other combination. The various disciplines—listed in order from highest to lowest number of participants—include, speed, circuit, karting, rally, speedway, social, autotest, drag and off-road.

           , some of the economic contributions to Australia are remarkable. The Australian motorsport industry directly generates $2.7 billion of direct industry output and $1.2 billion of directly value-added contribution. This investment directly supports over 16,300 jobs in Australia. If you add indirect jobs, this figure increases to over 31,300 people working in the motorsport industry in Australia. In Tasmania, my home state, motorsports directly contribute an output of $98 million dollars with a value-add output of $42 million, and employs some 585 Tasmanians in full-time equivalent jobs.
          </p>
          <p>
           There are spin-offs from having a strong motorsport industry, including innovation, some of which give Australia a cutting-edge advantage in the development of technologies. This technology can have practical application well beyond the motor industry. Another advantage of motorsports is to enable a very strong automotive aftermarket industry—which Senator Muir also touched on—providing numerous jobs and export opportunities which would otherwise not exist. The Australian Automotive Aftermarket Association, or the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAAA" rel="nofollow">
            AAAA
           </a>
           , supports manufacturers, distributors, wholesalers, importers, mechanical repair and modification services, and retailers of automotive parts, accessories, tools and equipment, as well as companies and consultants who service the automotive aftermarket industry.
          </p>
          <p>
           Total value of Australian parts manufacturing is estimated to be worth $5.4 billion each and every year. It is difficult to value the aftermarket proportion of production, but, given the decline in local new car manufacturing, it could be assumed that a large part of this contribution is within the aftermarket. The largest areas of production include exhaust systems and other parts and accessories, accounting for 39.4 per cent of the automotive aftermarket industry, with motor reconditioning accounting for 14.9 per cent, seats and interior components 9.8 per cent and brakes and parts 6.5 per cent. The AAAA believes the total size of the industry will grow to $34 billion and has great optimism about the future. Recently, 76 per cent of AAAA member companies shared an expectation that their businesses will continue to grow. This sort of optimism breeds confidence in the economy and helps provide the certainty needed for new job creation in Australia.
          </p>
          <p>
           Looking more closely at motorsports participants' direct contribution to the economy, the average annual spend per participant on motorsport related activities is $12,000 to $15,000 and the average spend on motorsport vehicle purchases and modifications is $60,000. Whilst these numbers appear high, as I will later illustrate entry cost does not prove to be an insurmountable barrier for those wishing to enter the sport. In other words, the average costs are skewed due to the investments at the high end of the sport.
          </p>
          <p>
           Motorsport events generated 30 per cent of the motorsport industry's output, namely $800 million in direct industry output, $400 million in value added and 5,050-odd jobs. In analysing a single event, the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Formula_One_Grand_Prix" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Formula One Grand Prix
           </a>
           held in Melbourne each year, the scale of the sport becomes obvious. Based on an
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_and_Young" rel="nofollow">
            Ernst and Young
           </a>
           report in 2011, this event singularly increased the Victorian gross state product by around $39.34 million and created an additional 411 full-time equivalent jobs. I suspect the contribution of this event to the economy has only grown since 2011. The Grand Prix also provides significant branding and positioning for Melbourne and Victoria, both nationally and internationally. Past Melbourne F1 Grands Prix have each provided a media or advertising equivalent value in excess of $35 million to the state. The event also attracts over 230,000 international visitors each year and generates significant benefits, including tourism attraction, investment attraction and community involvement.
          </p>
          <p>
           There is a myth about motor sports, and that is that relatively few people can participate due to the high cost of competing. If that were the case, then I am sure that neither Senator Muir nor I would ever have had the chance to participate. The fact is that there are around 55,340 Australians who compete in motorsport in Australia every year and a further 17,420 people who officiate. There are 76,775 other people who are members of motorsport related clubs. There are 334 tracks and venues throughout Australia, 1,390 motorsports clubs and 6,250 events are conducted annually. Clubs and participants are involved in circuit racing, rally driving, off-road, speed, autotest, social, drag racing, go-karting and speedway. Direct participant expenditure accounts for around 49 per cent of the Australian motorsport industry's output. Importantly, around 30 per cent of participants, as noted by Senator Muir, are based in regional areas and around 85 per cent of tracks and venues are located in regional areas.
          </p>
          <p>
           I am proud to say that in my home state of Tasmania more than 5,000 people compete in motorsports—the highest per capita participation rate in the country. Tasmania has 20 motorsport tracks or venues, 72 motoring clubs and an average of 273 events per year, proving that it punches very much over its weight. Tasmania hosts the whole gambit of motorsports, from stock cars to go-carts and everything in between, from Symons Plains in the north, which hosts an annual round of the

            Targa Tasmania
           </a>
           . The 2016 Targa Tasmania will see a potentially record field as it celebrates the milestone 25th running of this iconic event. The genesis of Targa racing goes back to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targa_Florio" rel="nofollow">
            Targa Florio
           </a>

           continued this legacy in continental Italy and was held 24 times from 1927 to 1957—13 before the war and 11 from 1947. The Targa Tasmania continues in the tradition of

           . The event traverses every electorate in the state and Tasmanians look forward to the excitement the event brings each year, not to mention the economic benefits. Competing in Targa Tasmania is on the bucket list of many motoring enthusiasts across Australia and even the world The Tasmanian government sees Targa Tasmania as a pillar of its strategy of making Tasmania the boutique events capital of Australia. Events generate great economic and cultural benefit for the state, as well as being a key driver towards the government's target of attracting 1.5 million visitors each year to Tasmania by 2020. Capitalising on the popularity of Targa Tasmania, as mentioned, the inaugural Targa Hellyer Gorge was held in February this year. This modified event provides a number of hill climbs and time trials and is designed as a way for those looking to get into Tarmac rallying to get a taste of touring motor sports and test out their own skills and their vehicles.
          </p>
          <p>
           Beyond the economics and participation, motorsport contributes in other ways to Australia's social profile. We can be proud of the fact that, according to Volunteering Australia, 36.2 per cent of people aged 18 years and over participate in formal volunteering each year.    Motorsport makes a rich contribution to volunteering. There are 17,419 licensed volunteer officials in Australia who are responsible for running the majority of motorsport events each year. This figure underestimates the true number of motorsport volunteers. If all of the unlicensed volunteers involved in motor sporting events, charity events, club events and in other ways could be added up, perhaps the true number of volunteers may be a factor of 10 on that number.
          </p>
          <p>
           Motor sport also offers up opportunities for Australians of a variety of ages and genders to compete. Unlike so many other sports, the competitor age profile peaks in the band with an age profile of 55 to 64 years old and has a rapidly growing rate of female participation. Indeed, my eight-year-old daughter, Emily, will tell you, if you ask her, that she wants to be a racing car driver when she grows up. There is also overall rapid growth in motor sport participation, with over 45 per cent of participants being involved with the sport for less than five years. This fact alone should ensure that policymakers are vigilant in ensuring the ongoing health of the sport, especially when considering the average participant enters six events every year, pays for nine nights away and on average takes 1.8 people away with them, which further increases the penetration of the sport into the community.
          </p>
          <p>
           According to a recent CAMS official survey, over 80 per cent of respondents indicated that to be with family and friends is a very important, or somewhat important, factor in choosing to participate in motor sport. As Senator Muir noted, these are much higher numbers than most sports and sporting codes in Australia. It demonstrates that motor sports are family friendly and often undertaken with other family members. Policymakers need to pay close attention to participants who have indicated that they are seeking improved venues and facilities, more events, new and different events, streamlined regulations, improved event awareness and improved training and coaching.
          </p>
          <p>
           Motor sport also plays an important role in advocating for road safety and related themes. In May 2011, the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile—otherwise known as the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIA" rel="nofollow">
            FIA
           </a>
           , which is much easier to pronounce—launched its Action For
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_Safety" rel="nofollow">
            Road Safety
           </a>
           in support of the United Nations Decade of Action for Road Safety. The FIA's initiative aims to lower the alarming figures associated with global road accidents and to spread the safer motoring message. CAMS Ignition is a road safety initiative supported by the FIA under the FIA Action for Road Safety program. This initiative focuses on educating Australia's pre-licensed youth. Driver education delivered through CAMS Ignition is designed to assist young people to develop awareness of their involvement in motor vehicles and road use. In 2013, over 4,000 Australian young people participated in the program. In addition to this road safety initiative, there are numerous other levels of involvement with road safety, including campaigns around defensive driving, speed control and drink-driving.
          </p>
          <p>
           Corporate involvement in motor sport also contributes both economically and socially. An example of this is

           Australians are very philanthropic. According to Philanthropy Australia, Australian households donate more than $2.4 billion to philanthropic causes, with business donations exceeding $850,000 on top of philanthropic organisations, which have distributed over $1.7 billion over the last decade to worthy causes. Motor sports well and truly pulls its weight when it comes to its share of philanthropic giving, as also noted by Senator Muir. It is not often that motor sport philanthropy is recognised and, on behalf of the numerous philanthropic causes which are supported by the sport, I would like to recognise a few in this place today.
          </p>

           to raise money and awareness against this acute illness, helping Australia's only non-profit organisation dedicated to the care and cure of those with blood cancer and related blood disorders. The organisation funds blood cancer research and provides services to support people with leukaemia, lymphoma and myeloma at no cost. These major event related charity partnerships often underpin the major fundraising drives of charities involved and exist at all levels and varieties of motor sport.
          </p>
          <p>
           In addition to major event based charity partnering, as also noted by Senator Muir, there are other motor sport events which are dedicated to philanthropic ends. Again, all of these kinds of events are worthy of mention; however, I will share a couple of these with the Senate on behalf of all of the others to pay them their due tribute. Such has been its success, I would think almost every Australian would have heard of the Variety Bash—an event held across every state and territory of Australia.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bash" rel="nofollow">
            The Bash
           </a>
           has been staged by Variety since 1985 and the spirit of the original idea has been retained. Every entrant has to raise money for Variety and all vehicles must be 30 years old or older at the time of entry and be non-performance modified The bash is not a race, rally or speed trial; rather, the single most significant rule of the bash is to relax and enjoy the Australian outback and help raise funds for kids in need.

           The Black Dog Ride involves groups of motorcycle enthusiasts who ride together to raise awareness and money for suicide prevention and mental health awareness. Lifeline Australia is one of the biggest, and worthiest I might add, recipients of money raised by the Black Dog Ride. I would like to commend to the parliament the work that Steve Andrews has done in founding and managing the Black Dog Ride. Another great event is the Hogs for the Homeless charity ride.

          <p class="italic">
           I've visited a few hospitals in Australia and it's in those places that I've seen people who were much less fortunate than me. People for whom every day is a struggle. As I started to do well out of my own profession, it made me want to give something back and to help people back home. I don't like to shout about it, but that's my philosophy and that's what I'll continue to do.
          </p>
          <p>
           Mark Webber's philanthropy extends to the Mark Webber Foundation, the Aylesbury College Trust and Wings for Life.

In doing so, he is pioneering a new kind of sponsorship deal, one which seeks to also have an altruistic element. This altruistic approach may well become the template for all major sponsorship deals across all sports in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
           Already we have seen V8 Volvos roaring around racing circuits in Australia supporting charities like beyondblue, which is a national initiative designed to raise awareness of anxiety and depression, and the Cure for Life Foundation, which seeks to accelerate treatments for brain cancer. Indeed, philanthropy and the social benefits which it can and does provide have become synonymous with motorsport.
          </p>
          <p>
           I finish by endorsing Senator Muir's words in recognising the enormous benefits that motorsport brings to Australia on a whole range of levels, not just measured in the enjoyment experienced by participants and fans, but also measured by the economic, social and philanthropic advantages that it provides to the Australian community.

            I have a few brief remarks to make. A lot has already been said on this matter, and I think there is a fair amount of bipartisan support. I want to acknowledge the contributions of Senator Muir, which I will touch on in a bit more detail, and also of Senator Bushby. There was a bit of banter across the chamber during those contributions about whether people are Ford people or Holden people. I can proudly say that I am

             Yes, it is very old. When we talk about motorsport around Australia there is an important motorsport that we sometimes forget, and that is called 'the Sydney commute' which can be for about two or three hours to travel a short distance with many obstacles on the way.

             I am delighted to rise in this place on behalf of Labor senators and support the motion moved by Senator Muir that this Senate notes the economic, social and other benefits of motorsport in Australia. I am reliably informed that Senator Muir will be joining the proud revheads of my home state at Bathurst, which will be his first visit, in about three weeks. I will be there this weekend.

             , confirms the benefits of motorsport to our economy. It generates more than $2.7 billion and more than 16,000 jobs. There are more than 150,000 people participating across Australia at more than 6,000 events every year. Motorsport contributes significantly to regional economies, and I know that is something that Senator Muir has spoken about in this place on many occasions.
            </p>
            <p>
             While CAMS does not put a dollar figure on the impact in regional Australia, 85 per cent of sanctioned tracks are in regional areas and around 30 per cent of participants are from regional Australia. The data demonstrates the value of motorsport to Australia, but it is much more than just an economic consideration. For many Australians motorsport is a way of life at the front and centre in the national sporting psyche.

            <p>
             On behalf of Labor members and senators I thank Senator Muir for bringing this motion before the Senate. I thank Senator Muir and I thank the contributions of other senators in this debate.

              I, too, rise to make a small contribution on the motion put by Senator Muir to acknowledge the substantial contribution that motorsport makes to, not just the economic fabric of our society, but also our social culture. I acknowledge the commitment that Senator Muir has made to this particular topic. He is a great advocate for the motoring industry in Australia and in particular for motorsport. I acknowledge that my fellow whip is also a great supporter of motorsport and often comes to work on a Monday morning and tells us of exploits of driving his car very fast up and down hills, which is done of course in a controlled environments and certainly not on the road.

              Through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, Senator Bilyk comes from Tasmania and may well know something about Senator Bushby's driving habits more than I do, because I do not drive on the same roads as Senator Bushby as a general rule. I am sure that he is a terribly law-abiding citizen when it comes to obeying the road rules.

             <p>
              This is a much more serious issue than the fun and frivolity of the last few minutes. The social and economic benefits of motorsport in Australia are quite significant. Apart from the fun that is associated with driving a car very fast in a controlled and safe environment, there are some really huge benefits that go our communities. If you have a look at my home state of
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
               South Australia
              </a>
              —and your home state, Mr Acting Deputy President Gallacher—motorsport has played a very big role in our state for a very, very long time. In fact it was back in the 1930s that the first Grand Prix was held in South Australia. I do not know whether you realise it, Mr Acting Deputy President, but it was held in
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Harbor" rel="nofollow">
               Victor Harbor
              </a>
              . Whilst everybody was greatly pleased when the Grand Prix came back to Australia in 1985 and was held in Adelaide, everybody also thought that this was the first time that a Grand Prix was held in Australia. But that was not the case. We in South Australia were actually early adopters of the concept of fast Formula One motorsport.
             </p>
             <p>
              The Grand Prix was a fantastic economic contributor to the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
               South Australian
              </a>
              economy, and for most of the 10 years that South Australia had the privilege and luxury of owning the rights to hold Australia's Grand Prix in Adelaide it was a very, very beneficial thing for us to have. It was not just the fact of the expenditure on the event itself. I will admit that in many years it actually cost South Australia money to hold the event. The knock-on impact of the economic activity that was achieved through the event was very, very significant. Many, many times the amount of money that was invested by the South Australian government in getting the event to South Australia was returned to the community through visitation and increased economic activity.
             </p>
             <p>
              It was interesting to find some statistics on these instances. Every Grand Prix had attendances in excess of 250,000 people, but also the economic benefit of the Clipsal 500, for example, is around half a billion dollars a year for South Australia, so you can see that it makes a very significant contribution.
             </p>
             <p>
              Regarding the Clipsal 500, there is an interesting anecdotal story. During the Grand Prix one year, the Supercar drivers decided that they wanted to be paid appearance money at the Grand Prix. Until that time, the touring cars had just been a support event for the Grand Prix. So the decision was made that we would tell the touring car drivers that we would not worry about paying them and, if they decided they were not going to come to the Grand Prix, so be it; that was bad luck. Luckily, some reasonable wisdom prevailed and a survey was undertaken of the South Australian public. Very interestingly, it found that in excess of 60 per cent of the people who attended the Grand Prix in Adelaide went because they wanted to see the touring cars, not because they wanted to see the Grand Prix cars. From the information from the survey that was undertaken, and when the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOCA" rel="nofollow">
               FOCA
              </a>
              rights for the Grand Prix had become so excessively expensive that the economic benefit that was generated started to be eroded, it became very evident that the touring cars could have the capacity to generate reasonably similar amounts of economic activity in South Australia but without the extraordinary expense of the rights to buy the Grand Prix. So we sent the Grand Prix to Victoria—I think they were quite happy to have it for a while; I am not sure that they still are—and South Australia now has the premier touring car event for Australia, the Clipsal 500.
             </p>
             <p>
              Whilst we can talk about all these major motorsport events that have an economic benefit to Australia, it is also quite interesting to realise the benefits to the car industry and to car accessory and car part manufacturers across the whole of Australia—and across the whole of the world, for that matter—and also, indirectly, to car sales. You only have to look at the continued competition that occurs between Ford and Holden to realise that there is a benefit there through car sales, but also there are other developmental benefits to cars that occur. Obviously, when you are driving a car at extreme speeds, you have to make sure that they are extraordinarily safe, so the safety components and developmental components that come from racing cars are also extremely important.
             </p>
             <p>
              As I said, there is huge economic benefit from the big events, but there is also economic benefit that can be generated in our regional communities. I, for one, have been known to be a bit of a petrolhead—I have raced in the Classic Adelaide Rally—but, like Senator Bushby, I always obey the road rules, so I only drive fast when the roads are closed and I have permission to do so. There are economic benefits in our regional communities from things like rallying, off-road buggy racing and the local speedways. All of these smaller motor-racing events have massive individual economic benefit for the communities in which they operate. They also provide the young people in our communities the opportunity to drive fast and do things that all young kids like to do but without the added risk of being on the road. If you look at motorsport, there is far more than the economic benefit that you see from big events. There is such a huge knock-on effect in our local communities in giving our young kids the opportunity to learn how to drive fast in controlled conditions—not on roads—where medical attention is available should an unfortunate situation require it.
             </p>
             <p>
              As I said, I am a great supporter of motorsport and a great supporter of Senator Muir's motion today to acknowledge the economic and social benefits of motorsport. I commend Senator Muir on his continued and ongoing interest in and support for motorsport in Australia.
