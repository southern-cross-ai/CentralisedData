        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Health, Senator Gallagher. Health workers are the backbone of our health system. For people confronted with a cancer diagnosis, navigating their cancer treatment journey can be overwhelming. Cancer nurses provide invaluable support to patients who are confronting some of their toughest days. Could the minister please update the Senate on the landmark funding announced today to deliver more cancer nurses and additional cancer care for patients?

         I thank Senator Bilyk for the question. I can confirm that today the Albanese government has announced the biggest investment in cancer nurses on record. I know this is a matter close to your heart, and I note the attention that you have placed on health services and cancer services through your work in the Senate.
        </p>
        <p>
         Today's announcement builds on the government's combined investment of over $500 million to establish the National Lung Cancer Screening Program and improve cancer outcomes for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          First Nations
         </a>
         people with cancer announced earlier this year. With the recent release of the Australian Cancer Plan developed by Cancer Australia and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Cancer Plan developed by the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation, it's timely that the government is announcing this funding today.
        </p>
        <p>
         For people who are confronted with a cancer diagnosis, navigating their cancer treatment journey can be overwhelming. That's why we're investing in additional support for patients during this time. The government is committing $166 million for a first-of-its-kind Australian cancer nursing and navigation program. The program will improve cancer outcomes across Australia from cancer prevention and early detection through to recovery, treatment, survivorship and end-of-life care. It will ensure people have access to the resources and support they need to better navigate their cancer journey. I'm proud that this government is building on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGrath_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
          McGrath Foundation
         </a>
         's well-established cancer nursing model to recruit a hundred new cancer care nurses in health and hospital services across the country who will support all people with cancer, regardless of their cancer type. We have asked the McGrath Foundation to lead the cancer care nurse program in partnership with the cancer sector, including organisations like the Lung Foundation Australia, the Melanoma Institute Australia and Rare Cancers Australia.

           Thank you, minister, for your answer. I'm pleased to learn of the government's response to the high-quality, multidisciplinary and integrated cancer services for all people with cancer. Can the minister provide more details on the cancer navigation service announced today and other programs to support cancer patients through their diagnosis and treatment and beyond?

            I thank Senator Bilyk for the supplementary. We want to ensure that everyone with cancer gets the care that they need when and where they need it, whether that be lung cancer or a rare cancer. We also recognise the depth of experience the cancer sector has in delivering specialised support to their patients. This is why we'll also be funding these organisations to deliver specialised telehealth support to patients across the country, integrating care with their cancer care nurse in hospital. This funding will also see the Cancer Council of Australia connecting people with cancer to information and support relevant to their needs through a new cancer navigation service. And it will see Canteen, in collaboration with
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Quality" rel="nofollow">
             Camp Quality
            </a>
            and Redkite, continue the very successful child and youth cancer hub and Canteen Connect programs which are vital to young Australians experiencing cancer and the individual needs that they have.

Can the minister please further outline how these investments are complementing the significant investments already made in the Albanese government's first two budgets to improve cancer outcomes across Australia from cancer prevention and early detection through to recovery, treatment, survivorship and end-of-life care?

               I thank Senator Bilyk for that supplementary. The government is making this record investment in our trusted nursing workforce and the broader cancer sector so that they can get on with the job of providing comprehensive care to people with cancer now and into the future. We have also announced today that the Albanese government is investing $48.2 million to support implementation of a national strategy for the elimination of cervical cancer in Australia. These investments build on the government's other significant investments through the 2023-24 budget to establish the National Lung Cancer Screening Program, support the Aboriginal and Community Controlled Health Organisation sector to support cancer care needs of

               people on the ground and ensure mainstream cancer care services are culturally safe and accessible to First Nations people. These measures take the Commonwealth's investment in improving cancer outcomes to almost $2.5 billion over the next four years, excluding the cost of Medicare services and pharmaceuticals.
