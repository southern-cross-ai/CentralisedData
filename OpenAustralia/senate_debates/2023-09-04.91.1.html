        for all those peaceful protesters who are heading to Tarkine's ancient rainforests this week. They're heading to the rainforest this week because next week, on 13 September, our Minister for the Environment minister

        Mining. They have other options, yet they seem to be insisting on going into these beautiful Gondwana rainforests, some of the most carbon-rich biodiverse rainforests on the planet. It's an absolutely enchanting place.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to say thank you to those protesters. I and two of my colleagues, Senator Rice and Senator McKim, have been in there a number of times. We were there when the protests were occurring. Hundreds of people were arrested a couple of years ago, and it turned out that the company was clearing the land illegally—the Tasmanian government had given the go-ahead illegally—and that was stopped. I know the environment minister has approved four coal mine since she was appointed environment minister under this government, which has disappointed a lot of people. They are probably fearing the worst, but I would urge the environment minister, Minister Plibersek, to do her job and be the minister for the environment. Protect these beautiful Gondwana rainforests, which are some of the oldest forests left on the planet. They are so special. We need to do everything we can to protect them for future generations, and we need to remember that they are our first line of defence on climate change through the way they sequester carbon.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want also to say that the protesters, the people that have been out there, the Bob Brown Foundation—a whole range of people—do a great job under very difficult circumstances. I know it is not easy when you're being pursued by the federal and state governments, but stick at it, guys. I know the minister will make the right decision next week and kill this project.
