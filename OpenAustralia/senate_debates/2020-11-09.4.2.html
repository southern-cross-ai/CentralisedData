        I advise the Senate that the updated ministry list reflects the updated ministry following my appointment as Minister for Finance on 30 October 2020. Updated representation arrangements are outlined in the ministry list. I also advise the Senate that I have been appointed

        and Senator Cash has been appointed Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate. I congratulate Senator Cash upon her appointment.
       </p>
       <p>
        This chamber and its practices are crucial to the good functioning of our country, our government and, particularly, this parliament. Senator Cash and I, as the government's leadership team in this place, look forward to working hard across the chamber with all parties and representatives to seek to achieve the best possible outcomes and to uphold the traditions and practices of the Senate. I thank the Senate.

          Leader of the Government in the Senate

         and also Senator Cash as deputy. It is a very great honour and a very weighty responsibility to lead a party in this chamber, and I welcome him to this table and look forward to working with him and against him.
        </p>
        <p>
         I'll make a brief comment. There is a fine tradition of leaders in the government in this place from my home state of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         . We've had Senator Nick Minchin and, of course, Senator Birmingham's mentor, Senator Robert Hill. I of course trust that, like Senator Hill, Senator Birmingham will be a voice of moderation from his new position. I am advised that this is the first time since the first decade of Federation that the leaders of government and opposition have both been South Australians, so we have a unity ticket on this being a great day. I look forward to working, as I said, with and against Senator Birmingham in his role, and I congratulate him on his appointment.

          , congratulations, Senator Birmingham and Senator Cash, on your elevation. It's good to see a woman in the leadership team from your side of politics, and we look forward to engaging strongly on climate, inequality and all the other issues that this chamber should spend more time talking about.
