        I seek leave to amend general business notice of motion No. 1199, standing in my name for today, relating to the establishment of a select committee. I understand the amendments have been circulated. It's simply the tightening up of some wording.

           The Centre Alliance will not be supporting this reference. There've been more inquiries than I can list in a one-minute statement. But, to give you an idea, we've had the Finkel review, we've had the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
            ACCC
           </a>
           review, we've had a Senate select committee into the resilience of electricity infrastructure in a warming world, chaired by Senator Hanson-Young, we've had the numerous reports leading to the final detailed design for the National Energy Guarantee by the Energy Security Board, we've had the House Standing Committee on the Environment and Energy doing an inquiry into the modernising of Australia's electricity grid and we've had the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEMC" rel="nofollow">
            AEMC
           </a>
           and the Climate Change Authority doing an inquiry into delivering affordable, secure and lower emissions power, and I've got a number of others here. We just can't see the value for money in the conduct of another inquiry. What will it educe that has not already been educed? We don't need a further inquiry into electricity; we actually just need some action.
