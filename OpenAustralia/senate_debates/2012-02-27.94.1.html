         I thank Senator Furner for his question and for his interest in rural health. When it comes to health and hospitals the Gillard Labor government delivers to all Australians, including those living in rural and regional areas. That means better access to health services and infrastructure and more health professionals on the ground. Through the regional priorities round of the Health and Hospitals Fund the Gillard government is bringing modern practice and better facilities to remote and regional Australia. Through the regional fund, 63 projects are sharing in $1.3 billion in funding. This means that facilities in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennant_Creek" rel="nofollow">

         , Townsville,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Lincoln" rel="nofollow">
          Port Lincoln
         </a>
         , Sheffield, Kerang, Geraldton, Bega and many more will receive invaluable funding for better services, increased infrastructure and economic development. The priority round builds on the $3.2 billion already allocated through the Health and Hospitals Fund right across Australia, where one-third was given to regional Australia. The Gillard government is delivering 24 regional cancer centre projects, including two additional centres announced in the 2011 budget, for Geelong and Albury-Wodonga. While the government is delivering spending for infrastructure and getting the best facilities for our region, we are also ensuring that our regions have health professionals on the front line delivering in those facilities. To attract health professionals to our regional areas we are delivering training and incentive packages. The government's $134.4 million Rural Health Workforce Strategy is designed to encourage doctors to work in isolated rural and remote communities and to keep them there. As a result of this strategy in 2011, almost 8,000 doctors were assessed as eligible to receive an incentive payment for the first time.

           would be aware that when it comes to health and hospital reform the Gillard government has made reform happen—unlike those on the other side when they were in government. We made these reforms in a Labor way, which means not leaving rural hospitals behind. We will deliver a more efficient health system through activity based funding, but we also make specific allowances for rural hospitals to ensure services continue to be provided and improved. That is why some small rural hospitals will continue to be funded by block grants where activity based funding would not maintain community service obligations. A significant proportion of our health reform funding is being directed into specific rural health programs; for instance, $12 million over four years for additional rural allied health scholarships—

             I thank Senator Furner for his second supplementary question, because he has identified that there are risks. Of course, there is no doubt that the biggest risk posed to longstanding health and hospital reform is those on the other side: the opposition—the Liberals and the Nationals. I have outlined the tremendous amount of investment that the Gillard Labor government is bringing to regional and rural Australia. This is in contrast to the record of Mr Tony Abbott, whose team only cut, cut, cut health and hospital funding. Mr Abbott as health minister cut $1 billion from the health budget and now Mr Sloppy Joe Hockey has got to find another $70 billion in cuts, and guess where they are going to come from?
