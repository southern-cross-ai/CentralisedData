        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Senator Gallagher. Minister, it has been reported that a national shortage of saline intravenous fluids has now reached disaster levels. These fluids are absolutely critical to the emergency health care provided to patients in Australian hospitals. This is an issue of national importance. When did the government first become aware of concerns for Australia's supply of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IV" rel="nofollow">

              Thank you, President. I was just checking to see if we had an exact date, which was the actual question that I was asked. I will come back if I can provide that to you, but I am aware that the minister for health is across this and being briefed closely by his department on how to manage the shortage of
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IV" rel="nofollow">
               IV
              </a>
              fluids, and that is work that is being done across states and territories to manage the supply of IV fluids within their jurisdictions.
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commonwealth" rel="nofollow">
               The Commonwealth
              </a>
              and the jurisdictions and other professional bodies have initiated a national IV fluid working group, which consists of state and territory representatives, private hospitals and the AMA, to work collaboratively on IV fluid supply issues and to co-ordinate the national response. There have been a number of outcomes to that meeting, which I am happy to go through, but we cannot compel sponsors to increase manufacturing for supply of medicines in Australia. However, the TGA monitors and mitigates medicine supply issues and has approved several alternative suppliers from overseas, under section 19A of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, to supplement the local production and supply of other registered products.

                Well, it is my understanding that the government should have been aware since May that there was an impending shortage of
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IV" rel="nofollow">
                 IV
                </a>
                fluid in Australia. Can the minister outline what actual actions the government has taken and what actions were taken at the time it became aware of the IV fluid shortage to guarantee supply of these essential fluids to ensure Australia's healthcare system remained functional?

                 I am very happy to do that. I understand that across Australia the shortage of saline products has been ongoing since early 2023 but has recently worsened. This is in part due to the major sponsor, Baxter, experiencing delays in procurement of overseas registered saline since May/June 2024. A delayed shipment for another supplier has also contributed to the worsening shortage and, in addition, sponsors have reported a further increase in demand in recent months as jurisdictions began to experience low stock levels.
                </p>
                <p>
                 There have been a number of steps that have been taken, including the ones that I just outlined in answer to your previous question, which was around the role of the TGA has taken to approve additional suppliers; asking
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IV" rel="nofollow">

                 </a>
                 fluid suppliers if they need assistance in addressing delays in shipping and unloading containers at docks; asking Baxter and other sponsors of Australian registered IV fluid if any regulatory actions could assist with increasing supply; increasing national coordination of monitoring of supply; publishing a web statement and information about the shortages and overseas registered alternatives. I have some more which—

                   fluids, restricting the amount that is used for their patients. Will your government commit to a coordinated and urgent national response, not just monitoring, to this crisis? Are you delegating leadership on this issue to the TGA or a monitoring committee that was set up last Friday?

                    I have answered this question. There is a national response being led with the Commonwealth, jurisdictions and the professional bodies to coordinate the shortage of

                    fluid supplies. It is not unusual, where there are shortages, that health professionals are asked to manage the supply while more supply comes on board. As you would expect, that is actually part of a response to a supply shortage.

                    There are a number of steps that have been taken, but you would expect the TGA to be one of those that would be taking steps, of course, so I don't think you can diminish the role of the TGA. There are a number of steps being taken, including nationally consistent clinical guidance, to support appropriate prioritisation measures to manage demand. As you would expect, and as these things are managed in the health system all the time, these are being led, there is a nationally consistent response and it is appropriate, and you shouldn't be driving fear and a scare campaign.
