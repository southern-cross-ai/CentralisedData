        My question is to the Minister for Indigenous Affairs, Senator Scullion. I refer to the minister's answer in the Senate yesterday where he referred to Budget Paper No. 2, and I quote:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If you look carefully, the $409 million had a contribution of $355 million, of which $239 million was a save but the other $115 million came back into the budget in terms of our savings.
       </p>
       <p>
        Given that the minister's own arithmetic yesterday in question time does not add up and Budget Paper No. 2 does not reflect the minister's numbers, does the minister maintain his answers contain accuracy, not just fantasy?

         Of course, I do stand by the numbers. The numbers do stand at both $239 million as a proportion of that and at $115 million. Many senators opposite would be interested to learn that $54.1 million of those funds were invested, as we promised before the election. That is what we on this side do; we make an election promise and we stick to it. There is $2.5 million for community engagement police officers, $3.8 million—

           There is $3.8 million for the Child Abuse Task Force; $13.4 million for Indigenous education engagement through the Sporting Chance Program. Of course, that would be very popular with those on the other side. They were the 3,000 young Aboriginal and

            Clontarf Foundation
           </a>
           , but we forgot to put anything in forward estimates.' Well done! It is all right; we have repaired the damage. We have provided $13.4 million, which was accidentally left off your forward estimates. So these people now actually have a future, as a part of what I think is one of the greatest engagement programs around, the Clontarf Foundation.

           Of course, people working and living in very remote areas are very dependent on renewable energy and we have ensured that the Outback Power program of $10.6 million will in fact be maintained.

            , I ask a supplementary question: I refer to the portfolio budget statement of the Prime Minister's department which at page 48 shows a reduction in the funding to remote Australia' strategies, which includes support for remote housing. Is the minister prepared to repeat his guarantee to the Senate yesterday that there will be no cuts to remote housing? If not, can the minister outline what other programs for remote communities will be cut.?

             I am prepared to repeat that guarantee. As you would be aware—or maybe aware—Senator, through the President, is that we deliver that housing through NPARIH, and NPARIH, as I have said, is not subject to any savings. It is not a part of the savings regime.
            </p>
            <p>
             But I did say yesterday—and perhaps it is an opportunity for me to seek a clarification in this regard: in an answer to yesterday's question time, I stated in relation to the National Partnership on Remote Indigenous Housing that we will no longer be continuing the national partnership and we are now having negotiations through a bilateral round. What I intended to say was that we will be negotiating separate bilateral agreements under the National Partnership Agreement on Remote Indigenous Housing. But the short answer to your question is: of course I stick with my words of yesterday.

              , I ask a further supplementary question: I refer to the minister's assertion yesterday that 'It beggars belief to know that the Commonwealth is actually delivering municipal services.' Given municipal services include water, sewerage and rubbish collection, can the minister guarantee that no Indigenous community will lose their services under this government?

               When I said it beggars belief, I was indicating that just a perfunctory scrutiny of section 51 of the Constitution generally lays out in blicky blocky parts what is the responsibility of the statement and territories, what is the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth government. In regard to municipal services, it has always been around local government who have delayed that.
              </p>
              <p>
               Over some time in some jurisdictions, not all, you will not find any provision of municipal services through the Commonwealth government. Over some time, the municipal services have been provided by government. It is this government's intention that they go back to being the responsibilities of states and territories as it is, for example, in

                   government is very proudly putting over $12 billion into veterans' affairs in the 2014-15 budget; $6.5 billion in pensions and income support; and $5.4 million in health services. This is $12 billion, and this figure is very important because, if you look at the quantum of that figure, that is the same quantum of Labor's legacy of debt—$12,000 million is the same amount we are spending on veterans' affairs. This is the magnitude of the legacy that has been left those opposite.

                   I want to go through some of the budget commitments today for Senator Bernardi. We are delivering of course on our DFRB/DFRDB indexation commitment opposed by those opposite for three long years—delivered and delivered in full. We are putting $1 million back into advocacy funding—again, ripped out from those advocacy services providing services to veterans all over this nation, the length and breadth of this nation, and just ripped out by the former minister. We are expanding mental health services for veterans. We are recognising— (

                         My question is to the Minister for Finance representing the Treasurer. The budget plans to terminate the Automotive Transformation Scheme by 1 January 2018, some three years earlier than planned. The budget papers specify cuts of $618.5 million over eight years from 2013-14. Given that the scheme has a critical role in the restructuring and diversifying of the automotive components industry once Ford, Holden and Toyota cease manufacturing in Australia, what consultation and economic modelling has the government done on the job losses, business closures and lost manufacturing output this budget measure will have on the 33,000 direct employees of the automotive components sector and its multiplier effect? How does this fit in with Minister Cormann's statement to the chamber yesterday that the government wants to fix the economy by 'creating a stronger environment in which all businesses large and small can prosper'?

                          In relation to subsidies for the car industry, what we have done in this budget is to face the facts, and the facts are that Holden and Toyota have followed others previously in saying that they will no longer manufacture cars in Australia. As such, it is entirely appropriate that from 1 January 2018 onwards we will not continue to provide for subsidies towards manufacturers, given that at that point in time they will no longer be in Australia manufacturing cars.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Having said all that, we are very conscious of the fact that there is the need for an appropriate transition through the period between now and when Holden and Toyota stop manufacturing in Australia.

                          government is working very closely with relevant state governments and with Holden and Toyota to work through that transition. Indeed, we have made funding available to facilitate that transition. And we expect that Holden and Toyota also will provide appropriate support to their employees to assist them and their families through the transition of what has been caused by the decisions they have announced.

Does the government acknowledge Mr Riley's concern on behalf of his members that unless this move is reversed 'thousands of jobs could be lost in the sector within the next 18 months'?

                            I thank Senator Xenophon for his supplementary. No, we don't agree with that proposition. What I would like to point out in this context is that, as part of our budget, the government has actually established the $476 million Industry Skills Fund to support businesses seeking to enter the export market diversify or improve competitiveness in the global market. This industry skills investment fund is a strategic vehicle for supporting businesses to be competitive in the global market and to grow the Australian economy. It will commence on 1 January 2015 and will deliver up to 200,000 targeted training places and support services over four years. It addresses key industry feedback provided in particular to the

                             , I ask a further supplementary question. I will have another go. What does the government say to automotive product manufacturers' concerns that the slashing of the automotive transformation scheme will render it ineffective and will not only create huge investment uncertainty in the sector but could hasten the departure of vehicle manufacturers from Australia and in turn destroy any real chance of component manufacturers successfully restructuring?

                              The one thing that has put irreversible pressure on manufacturing in Australia is the bad performance of the previous Labor government over the last six years. The previous government killed manufacturing in Australia over the last six years, pushing up the cost of doing business with the carbon tax and choking business with all of the additional red tape—in particular in the workplace relations area. If we want to be competitive internationally in manufacturing we have got to focus on—

                                 But you cannot consider one without the other. Obviously, anything that pushes up the cost of doing business in Australia, which makes our manufacturing sector in Australia less competitive, is going to have implications on the sustainability of manufacturing into the future. The decisions made by the previous government did push up the cost of doing business recklessly and irresponsibly. What we are doing is facing the facts. You cannot continue to provide for subsidies to manufacturing that will no longer happen post a particular period.

                                  My question is to Senator Brandis as Minister for the Arts. I refer to the minister's decision to abolish the $6.4 million Get Reading! program. I also refer to his well-known love of books, with the construction of not one but two taxpayer funded bookshelves to house his taxpayer funded book collection. Given the minister is happy for taxpayers to fund his own reading, why is he cutting a program that encourages other Australians to read?

                                              , I ask a supplementary question. Let us see how we go with this one. I refer to the $9.5 million cut to the Indigenous Languages Support program. Given the Prime Minister has claimed he will be a Prime Minister for Aboriginal affairs, why are the government and this minister ripping funding from a program that preserves and revives Indigenous languages?

                                               Once again, as I pointed out in relation to the Get Reading! program, so was also the case with the Indigenous Languages Support program: not all of the funding within that program had been allocated. So, when the government addressed the arts budget, economies were sought among other things from programs which had not been fully expensed. That enabled us to keep the economies within the arts budget very low—relatively low. The arts community did very well out of this budget. It also gave us the flexibility to introduce new measures. I mentioned the residence of the

I refer the minister to his 2007 claim that the minister who had been most generous to the arts in terms of funding was 'me'. Given the government has ripped more than $100 million from the arts funding across Australia, isn't it now more accurate to say that he is the minister who has been the most destructive for the arts.

                                                 . Indeed, it was the case that in 2007 the Howard government, which that year brought back its 10th consecutive budget surplus, had a lot of extra money to spend on the arts, as it had a lot of extra money to spend on other beneficial social programs and a lot of extra money to spend on tax cuts. But you know what? After six years of Labor government there is not a lot of extra money. In fact, there is no money; there is $123 billion of accumulated budget deficits, and for that you need look no further than to your colleague Senator Wong, who was the finance minister who presided over those accumulated budget deficits. So look no further than Senator Wong for the answer to your question—
