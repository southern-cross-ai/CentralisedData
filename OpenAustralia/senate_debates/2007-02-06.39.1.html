        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Resources" rel="nofollow">

        report
        <i>
         Tracking to the Kyoto target

        out at the end of last year? What does the minister have to say about

         AGO
        </a>
        advice that Australia will massively exceed its generous target under the current government policy? How is it that Australia’s electricity sector has actually increased both carbon emissions and carbon intensity in the last six years? Why is it that, with greenhouse emissions set to reach more than 127 per cent of 1990 levels by the end of 2020, the Prime Minister keeps saying, ‘We’re on target’?

         Whether or not the minister, Mr Turnbull, has read that particular report I am unable to say. I will pass that aspect of the question to Mr Turnbull for his consideration. I simply say that, as he has been in the job for a very short period of time, I do not know whether he would have done, but I will pass that aspect of the question on to Mr Turnbull, my colleague. In relation to greenhouse gas emissions, I think we are all agreed that it makes very good sense to try to limit the amount of greenhouse gases that are emitted into the atmosphere. The difference, I think, that divides this place is that we believe in practical solutions rather than signing documents and becoming involved in a degree of mantra. So we are in a position where, not having signed the Kyoto protocol, we are in fact on track—much more so than other countries that actually have signed the protocol—in achieving or coming very close to achieving the outcomes that are being sought.
        </p>
        <p>
         We as a government are addressing these issues, as I have indicated and we have indicated in previous times. I think it is a hallmark of the Howard government that we approach these issues not on the basis of some extreme ideological bent but on the basis of a measured approach which is sensible and practical. At the end of the day, that is what the Australian people want and that is in fact what we are delivering.

          , I thank the minister for his answer and ask a supplementary question. Minister, the Australian Business Council for Sustainable Energy said last month that on current programs Australia will need to find greenhouse cuts of six million tonnes every year to 2010 just to meet our target. Minister, what exactly is the government’s plan to cut that 18 million tonnes of CO
          <sub>

          </sub>
          over the next three years? Can the minister explain why the Prime Minister imagines a voluntary carbon trading system will cut emissions of this order? Why does he think that businesses will take on a cost when their competitors do not have to? Isn’t it the case that businesses need clear and mandated price signals—in other words, a carbon levy and emissions trading? Doesn’t the minister know that it takes years to plan and construct low- and zero-emission power generation? Just what is the plan to achieve these cuts and to deal with the billions of tonnes that will need to be cut by 2050?

           What is the government doing in relation to seeking to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas being emitted? We are discussing issues, such as nuclear power, that the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Democrats" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Democrats
           </a>
           will not even consider. We are talking about supporting a forest industry which those over there are not willing to support. We have been instrumental in seeing 650—I think that is the figure—wind turbines either built or being built within this country, which, of course, will see the use of alternative fuels. Australia’s climate change response measures are projected to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 87 million tonnes per year by 2010 compared to what they otherwise would have been. So, yes, we are taking practical, sensible approaches to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
