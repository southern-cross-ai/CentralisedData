        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. I refer you to the answers you gave yesterday regarding secret government modelling in a document titled 'Estimated impacts of

         I thank the senator for his question, and I did have the opportunity overnight to follow up some of what he asked yesterday. I'm advised that the closures he talked about were in fact announced under your government. So I do find it somewhat passing strange that you try to make political mileage, as you are doing and as you did yesterday, about a closure that was actually flagged under you. That's probably a fact I should have been aware of, and I'm grateful to my colleagues and to the departments for letting me know that. But these are closures that were flagged under the former coalition government.

         Obviously we are working with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         government—which I note has an emissions reduction target of 50 per cent by 2030, so I look forward to your criticism of them, if that is in fact the way you want to approach this—to ensure that the Hunter and other regions benefit from new jobs and opportunities in clean energy. One of the differences between those on that side of the chamber and those on this side is that we want to look after workers. We're a movement and a party that has workers at our core.

          Yes, I know it's hard for those who spend so much of their time arguing against pay increases and telling us the sky is going to fall if there's a $1 pay increase and saying we can't afford to give aged-care workers or those on the minimum wage an increase. But those on this side understand that a transition is occurring and that will occur as a consequence of what is happening in global markets as well as what is being committed to I think by both sides of government. The difference between you and us is that we will ensure that there is a transition that is about—

            article, when referencing the Prime Minister's guarantee, the Prime Minister is quoted as saying that this wasn't about policies and 'not only can we guarantee it but our modelling guarantees it'. Does the Prime Minister stand by the Labor Party's pre-election modelling? Or does he accept the official government modelling that says Labor's policies in the Hunter will cause 800 job losses?

                        Is the modelling that the Prime Minister relied on to make those false promises of job guarantees to the people of the Hunter the same modelling that the Prime Minister and the government used to promise 97 times before the election that Australians would see a $275 reduction in their power bills? If that is the modelling, how can anyone trust what the government and the Prime Minister say?

You are also signed up to net zero by 2050, remember? I know you want to talk about that a lot in Kooyong and

                           Well, this goes to policy. Meanwhile, Senator Canavan gets up and gives that rant, which shows that it was all fake. You thought you could say one thing in one place and one thing in another. Well, we are really clear: there is a transition that is occurring, a change in the global economy. We either get ahead of it and we help workers and communities thrive in that, or you keep going to them and lying to them, misleading them, about what is happening, because you're signed up to the same policy. You just don't have anything to back it.
