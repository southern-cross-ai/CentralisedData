         The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) The 2011-12 Budget contained new savings and increased Efficiency Dividend measures for the portfolio. There were also a range of new Budget expense measures and processing activity variations which increased program expense estimates.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         In aggregate terms (and as reported in the 2011-12 Portfolio Budget Estimates Statements) there will be increases in staffing levels across
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIAC" rel="nofollow">
          DIAC
         </a>
         and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRT" rel="nofollow">
          MRT
         </a>
         -
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RRT" rel="nofollow">
          RRT
         </a>
         , the greatest proportion of these increases are targeted at meeting the estimated resourcing requirements associated with the care and management of Irregular Maritime Arrivals (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMA" rel="nofollow">
          IMA
         </a>
         ). Given the complexity of the mix of expense variations in the Budget it is not possible to break these down to specific staffing adjustments.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The Efficiency Dividend and savings measure requirements will be managed through detailed business planning and prioritisation of resources. The Department also has a range of projects underway which are aimed at achieving efficiencies generated by business improvements. Where possible any staff impacted by reduced program appropriation or the achievement of efficiency measures will be redeployed to program areas where increased staffing levels are required.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) The 2011-12 Portfolio Budget Statement estimates (PBS) indicate an increase of 476 average full-time equivalent employees (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTE" rel="nofollow">
          FTE
         </a>
         -A) when compared with the 2010-11 Portfolio Budget Statement Estimates (PAES) of 7715. Likewise, MRT/RRT reported an expected increase of five in the PBS (page 103). This is an aggregate outcome and the current reduced budget will necessitate changes in staffing levels in business units within the Department, particularly those not engaged in IMA work. Managers are accountable for remaining within budgeted FTE levels through rigorous business and workforce planning. Negotiations for the Department's new Enterprise Agreement have led to additional costs which will also require a reduction in staffing levels. This reduction will be met through the natural attrition of 180 staff by 30 June 2015.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) Action is currently underway for the Department to recruit up to 70 graduates for the 2012 graduate program. This is higher than the number recruited in each of the last four years.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The Department continues to support the Australian
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Public Service Commission's Indigenous Pathways Program for 2012. Five Indigenous students have accepted offers of a cadetship with the Department; this represents an increase on the number of cadetships supported in 2011. Indigenous traineeships will be offered for the first time in late 2011, with an initial commitment of ten placements being offered.
