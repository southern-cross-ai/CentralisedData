                  , on the point of order: the question was about conduct, and the conduct included threats of physical violence and vulgar abuse—sexist abuse and homophobic abuse. It is entirely appropriate for the minister, in responding to that question, to quote the very words that comprised the conduct which was the subject of the question. I point out that, shamefully, notwithstanding the gravity of the sexism and homophobia that was evident, Senator Cameron and Senator Collins were laughing aloud during the answer.

Allegations being treated as facts in this place is not correct, and we should not be using this place as a kangaroo court.

                     , on the same point of order: Senator Moore expressed concerns about the language being used. We share that concern. It is highly inappropriate language. But, exercising our freedom of speech in this parliament, in order to make the point to substantiate what a serious concern there is in relation to these matters, the minister needs to quote what actually happened. The minister should be allowed to proceed with her answer.

                      Order! I have listened to the points of order. I will make two comments. Firstly, just because you state something in parliament does not shield you from the fact that the language could be inappropriate. That is the first point I make, and I took that advice from the Clerk. Secondly, I am concerned about the language that is being used, but I am also concerned about the rights of individual senators to be able to express what they want to express in response to an answer. With the indulgence of the Senate, for the remainder of today's question time I would ask that the language be contained to what we would consider to be appropriate language. I am going to reflect on this and report back to the Senate tomorrow in relation to how language will be used in questions in the future.

                       , given that you have foreshadowed that you are going to reflect upon the matter, will you be prepared to take submissions on the point, perhaps by writing? This is a very important question: should senators have the right, as Senator Cormann has said, of freedom of speech to quote language—not language of their own, but language in direct speech—to directly make the very point that they seek to make in their answer?

                                   In relation to bullying, harassment and intimidation in the workplace Mr Luke Collier is an official whose pattern of behaviour demonstrates that he is no stranger to this type of behaviour on building sites. He allegedly spat at an inspector's feet on the Barangaroo site and called her something quite disgraceful. Given your ruling,

                                   , I will not repeat it, but it is certainly something that should be condemned by all of us. At a meeting of workers at the same site Mr Collier announced a building inspector's name and his mobile number and invited workers in the crowd to 'call him and let him know what they thought'. At a recent Senate estimates hearing, it was revealed that Mr Collier is now serving a jail term for assault and entering premises with intent to commit an indictable offence. Those of us on this side of the chamber do not like having to come in here and reveal this type of conduct—

So we're up around the 50,000 mark. So bring it on. We're ready to rumble.' These are just some examples of union members in Australia who have complete, total and utter contempt for the law. None of us are above the law, including officials in the union.
