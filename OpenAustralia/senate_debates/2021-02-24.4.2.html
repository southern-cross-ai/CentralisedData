        These amendments will make clear that a decision to designate a platform under the code must take into account whether a digital platform has made a significant contribution to the sustainability of the Australian news industry through reaching commercial agreements with news media businesses. A digital platform will be notified of the government's intention to designate prior to any final decision, noting that a final decision on whether or not to designate a digital platform would be made no sooner than one month from the date of notification. Nondifferentiation provisions will not be triggered because commercial agreements result in different remuneration amounts or commercial outcomes that arose in the course of usual business practices. Final offer arbitration is a last resort when commercial deals cannot be reached, by requiring mediation in good faith to occur prior to arbitration for no longer than two months.

         We've had some radical changes to this legislation overnight, and of course there are a lot of questions, both from Labor and, really, the Australian community as a whole. I will ask at the outset: does the government intend, in this case, for the threat of regulation to do most of the work in levelling the imbalance in bargaining power between news media and digital platforms? Is it the instrument itself that will have this influence, or is it now the threat of regulation that is going to level that imbalance in bargaining power?

           Yes, we do understand that, but clearly there seems to have been a flurry of activity in terms of deals being done now because of the so-called threat of platforms being designated. How do you relate what's currently going on to those deals being made and addressing the imbalance in bargaining power?

            The government has always said that it's preferable if deals can be done outside of the code, and we've seen a number of media organisations that have already entered into letters of intention with Google. Yesterday of course Seven West Media announced it had entered into a letter of understanding with Facebook. This is all good news. We expect the digital platforms to continue their efforts to enter into agreements with more news media businesses. They can do this outside of the code by putting a standard offer on the table which publishers can choose to accept or as a catalyst to reach a commercial agreement. It's important to remember that, in deciding whether to designate a digital platform, the Treasurer will have regard to whether the digital platform has made a significant contribution to the sustainability of the Australian news industry through agreements relating to news content.

             We've seen big sticks from the government in relation to energy in the past and an argument that the threat of a big stick would bring people to negotiate and address issues. Why was this done in a rush in the last few days as opposed to having these kinds of principles embedded in the legislation earlier? Couldn't the outcome have been reached much earlier than today?

              The aim of these amendments, obviously, is to provide more clarity to the digital platforms and to the news media businesses about the way the code is intended to operate and to strengthen the framework for ensuring news media businesses are fairly remunerated. It's all about clarification. These amendments were done on the advice of Treasury and after hearing submissions that were made to the committee that was scrutinising this bill.

                   The code and the amendments make it clear that a decision to designate a platform must be taken into account in terms of whether a platform has made a significant contribution through commercial agreements with news media businesses. What thresholds will apply to the concept of a significant contribution?

                     That doesn't really tell me what the threshold of a significant contribution is. Does that mean that the minister, in assessing a significant contribution, has full access to the contracts that have been signed, or are they commercial-in-confidence?

                           I think Senator Pratt is narrowing in on what is quite a concerning new development in this media bargaining code story. It appears as though we've gone through a situation where the gauntlet was laid down and the government came up with strong legislation that would assist public interest journalism. Then what happened was that Google and Facebook pushed back. We saw Facebook do so in a very terrible manner in the last week or so. I was moved by some of the Prime Minister's statements—for example, when he said:
                          </p>
                          <p class="italic">

                           Bargaining Code.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           He also said:
                          </p>
                          <p class="italic">
                           I would just say to Facebook: This is Australia. If you want to do business here, you work according to our rules.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           That's what the Prime Minister said.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           In the meantime, the Treasurer has gone around and started a discussion with these tech companies, and they've effectively managed to get to a point where bargaining is taking place and we're getting some good results for the big players: the Murdochs and the bigger news organisations. What this amendment signals to everyone is that as long as those guys are okay the minister will not designate as per the act. What's going to happen? We can see here that this legislation will pass, the minister won't designate because the deals will have been done with the big guys, and the little guys and the regional guys are going to miss out. That's what this amendment says. You know what? In a year's time, when Mr Murdoch says, 'I need a bit more money,' the Prime Minister is going to remind everyone of this legislation and threaten designation, there will be another deal and Murdoch will be happy. But the little guys will miss out again. That's exactly what is happening here. No-one should have any misconception about exactly what's going on.

                           , a good journalist, calls up the Prime Minister and says, 'Google isn't negotiating with me; please designate them,' he'll get a very different story to the one Mr Murdoch gets.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           This signals a complete backdown by the government in the face of the pressure. It is inconsistent with what the Prime Minister has indicated publicly. It was hollow rhetoric from the Prime Minister. This is a most concerning amendment. It lowers the threshold. So I ask the minister: is it the intention of the minister, based on current facts, to, once it receives royal assent, designate Facebook and Google in accordance with the act?

In fact, final offer arbitration is still a last resort, when commercial deals cannot be reached, by requiring mediation in good faith to occur prior to arbitration for no longer than two months. Importantly, the amendments strengthen the hand of regional and small publishers in obtaining appropriate remuneration for the use of their content by the digital platforms.

                              This is all about outcomes. We have made our expectations very clear, and the news of the recent deals that have been done is proof that Google understands our expectations and, indeed, now so does Facebook. The government has not indicated that it will hold off on the designation process. We're very much focused on getting the code through parliament, first and foremost. We have indicated that Google and Facebook can reach commercial agreements outside of the code. It strengthens the hands of the digital platforms to make a case to the Treasurer that designation might not be needed. We have been very clear that nothing currently prevents Google or Facebook from reaching a commercial agreement outside of the code. Indeed, this bill provides a pathway for such deals. The bill is obviously still in parliament—we want it to become law—so it's premature to say that a decision has been made about a designation.

If you do not designate these larger companies, there is no mechanism for arbitration for them. My question is: how do the smaller players get access to the minister to be able to make representations to say, 'This threshold has been met,' because the small guys have effectively been mistreated and been subject to the very large corporations that Google and Facebook are?

                                The government's amendment to the bill requires the Treasurer to consider: whether there is significant market power imbalance between Australian news media and the digital platform and whether the digital platforms have made a significant contribution to the sustainability of the Australian news industry through agreements relating to news content. This means that the Treasurer will have regard to the deals that Facebook and Google have done with news media businesses, which will include agreements they have entered into with regional publishers who fall within the parameters of the code.

Facebook restoring news pages also helps small community news that operates solely within the Facebook environment or relies heavily on Facebook to disseminate news to local communities. I want to remind you that this code has not yet been passed into law, so I think that some of your questions are premature. There is a review that is taking place in 12 months time.

                                 Again, it goes to what processes you're putting in place to make sure the smaller players, the regional players, are able to make proper representation to the Treasurer, in relation to these amendments, to make sure that it's not just the big boys that are getting looked after.

                                 probably doesn't. I'm really just trying to understand what mechanisms the government will put in place to make sure the smaller players can get access to the Treasurer to make their concerns known and to pressure the minister, in making the designation, to be informed by the smaller players, not just the big players.

                                  Senator Patrick, as I mentioned to Senator Pratt earlier, the digital platforms will be compelled to report to the Treasurer on the deals that have been done or that are underway, and it will become apparent from those reports whether a designation is necessary.

                                   I, too, have some concerns about the government amendments as circulated, particularly to schedule 1, proposed subsection (3)(b). I am worried that this does not give significantly enough assurance to small, medium and regional media organisations that their welfare—for lack of a better word—and their ability to negotiate with Google and Facebook have been considered before the government makes any decision either to designate or not designate under these new provisions. I am extremely worried. Whether or not the government's intention is to keep small, medium and regional companies out, it looks like they will fall between the cracks. I wonder whether the government would be opposed to simply adding the words 'small, medium and regional' to make it absolutely crystal clear.

                                    The legislation talks about the Australian news industry, which, of course, already includes small, medium and regional publishers. So they are already encompassed in that legislation.

                                     I understand that. But there is a concern about the power imbalances not just between these big tech giants and Australian media but between the big media organisations and the small and regional media organisations. I don't think it would be particularly difficult for this government to send a clear message that small and regional media are being looked after if, indeed, that is what your intention is.

But I think the government's made it very clear that the amendments that we've put forward here are to improve the opportunities for regional and smaller publishers, because a decision to designate a platform under the code will now take account of whether a digital platform has made a significant contribution to the sustainability of the Australian news industry as a whole.

                                       Perhaps we could just step back a little bit and consider how this is going to work in the real world in terms of how small and regional companies will now engage in negotiations with either Google or Facebook in the absence of any designation by the minister. Could the minister outline for me how small publishers such as Women's Agenda, Junkee or Her Canberra would be able to use the provisions in this piece of legislation to ensure that Facebook come to the negotiating table and are prepared to speak about ensuring that they too get paid for their content?

                                        Those publishers will have to register under the code, and then they will fall under the criteria for the reporting that's coming back from the digital platforms when the decision for designation is made.

                                           I was asking about thresholds in relation to the concept of the significant contribution, and I think that integrates well with questions that others have asked. Has the government given any undertakings or signals to Facebook, Google and the news media around thresholds that might be attached to the significant contribution? We have been talking about regional media. Can a threshold be met if, for example, it only included news outlets with a national footprint as opposed to those who have a regional footprint?

                                            There is a benefit in flexibility in the definition of significant contribution. The range and breadth of the deals that are done, as well as the type of outlets and publishers that the deals have been done with, will be taken into account.

How do we know that these will be addressed within the thresholds of a significant contribution? Have undertakings been given to organisations such as Facebook and Google that they must look to making these kinds of deals in order to meet that threshold?

                                                 I understand that. Nevertheless, we have had a radical amendment overnight and things have purportedly settled down with Facebook. In that context you would expect that there have been some signals or undertakings given to Facebook, Google and news media around what those thresholds look like. I think the Senate, in considering this legislation, has a right to know what those undertakings or signals are.

                                                  There have been no undertakings provided around thresholds, and, moreover, we would disagree with you quite vehemently that these are radical amendments. We haven't taken final offer arbitration out of the code. That still remains and it's there as a last resort when commercial deals can't be reached, by requiring mediation in good faith to occur prior to arbitration for no longer than two months. The most important thing about these amendments is that they will strengthen the hands of regional and small publishers in obtaining appropriate remuneration for the use of their content by the digital platforms.

                                                   In that context, we know we've got competing local news media. It's great to have a diversity of newspapers across our suburbs and our towns. It's terrific. But sometimes it's difficult for two news outlets to be sustainable. We've seen some fall by the wayside. Is it good enough, for example, for a digital platform to make a deal with just one syndicated owner covering, say, all the regions that they represent and leave the other player and their competition out of such a deal?

Just because the deals have not been struck yet with smaller or regional media companies, that's not evidence to suggest that they won't be and that that will remain the case, or that the standard offers won't be made by those digital platforms. We're well aware that discussions are taking place right now and that the digital platforms are taking steps to address this issue.

I still don't have a clear indication of how you're going to judge the significant contribution.

I mean, I must say, I've spent months now working on this issue with a number of small and independent publishers, and their constant frustration has been the inability to even get around the table with a number of these tech giants. Facebook in particular has been by far the worst when it comes to its attitude towards Australian publishers, particularly the smaller players, refusing to even get back to them, to answer their calls and their queries, let alone sit around the table and have a genuine negotiation.
                                                                        </p>

I'd just like to know what happens if Facebook still refuses to contact, sit around the table or behave in a fair and decent manner, particularly with small publishers? I'm not worried about the big players; they will look after themselves—they already are. I'm worried about making sure there is a genuine line of communication and good faith between these tech giants and the small publishers, who, let's be honest, are the ones that really do deliver the local news, the information to their communities and who curate it sometimes in a narrow way but give a very significant contribution to their audiences and their readers.

The fact that deals haven't been struck with the smaller and regional media companies doesn't necessarily provide evidence that that will remain so. In fact, we expect standard offers will be made by the digital platforms. Certainly, the Treasurer has been very clear that in his discussions with Mr Zuckerberg, both over the weekend and prior to that, Mr Zuckerberg has indicated a willingness to negotiate in good faith with Australian news outlets.

My understanding of the history of this is that it was originally in the bill but got taken out, and for that reason I haven't really paid enough attention to this. I want to get an understanding about the mediation and where it fits into the total schema in terms of companies negotiating with Facebook and Google: how it applies in circumstances where the company's not designated, how it applies if it is designated—so if Google and Facebook are designated—and what happens in the event that mediation fails.

There's nothing in this that would overturn the fairness of those contracts and would cause the minister to assess whether those deals are fair? I know, indeed, that part of the assessment would have to be whether or not the digital platform has made a significant contribution. So if a digital platform puts forward, 'We've already cut these particular deals; we think that's significant,' and you've got a whole bunch of new players who want to participate in arbitration because they've been locked out, surely that might indicate that deals that have already been done aren't significant enough to qualify as a significant contribution and therefore they should be revisited.

For example, a digital platform does deals that suit big news media outlets—they're already dominant players—really well. There are smaller players that feel forced into making deals because they can see, for example, that the existing advertising revenue they get from other sources is going to be gobbled up and stolen by news media deals between the big players and platforms. They try to save themselves from this by signing a deal. The minister has to assess whether that's significant. Then you get other players who aren't part of that deal with that platform that say, 'We don't think we're being treated fairly; we can't get a deal at all.' How can you not consider whether the minister needs to revisit the deals that have been done when assessing significance?

This is for those arrangements that aren't yet in place and should be. I think we're now getting back into the area of hypotheticals, and I don't think it's appropriate to talk about hypotheticals here. The code isn't yet in place. The fact that deals have been struck already with large media organisations is a good thing and is an indicator of the good faith these platforms will use in their approach to deals they will strike with smaller and regional providers.

Again, we're talking hypotheticals here. I'm not sure whether Senator Pratt has an example of a deal that's been struck on unfair commercial terms. Perhaps, if we could deal with specifics rather than hypotheticals, we could get a better answer for you.

It's important that we talk specifics here. I have a lot of questions because, while I understand the argument the government are making—you're trying to keep it as broad as possible—sometimes you can make it so broad that people miss out, so I'm just trying to make sure people are not going to miss out. I want to know if a television channel that doesn't have links to a newspaper or a radio station—it's purely a standalone television channel in this country—was not included, if it wasn't able to strike a deal with Facebook or Google, would the government still consider Facebook or Google to have given a significant contribution to Australia's media landscape? Just to be clear, Minister, what I'm asking is: we don't have many channels, so, if one of the three commercial channels was not able to strike a deal, would the government consider Facebook and Google to have made or not made a significant contribution?

I find that not very reassuring. Our media landscape is highly concentrated as it is. There are not that many players, even in the medium space, let alone the large space. I can't imagine that people up in the gallery in Channel 10 right now are feeling very good about your answer. I'd like you to consider that again. Are you suggesting that, if Channel 10 were not able to strike a deal with Facebook but Channel 7 and Channel 9 were, that would be enough to tick a box for this government in terms of Facebook's contribution?

The fact that deals are being struck now is a good sign, not a bad sign, before this has even been legislated. So I wouldn't actually go out there frightening the horses and suggesting that the sky is going to fall, when the code is not yet in place. There are plenty of opportunities here for good work to be done, and I think that the digital platforms have demonstrated that in just the last few days and weeks.

The issue of significant contribution is based on available information at the time. The fact that we haven't actually passed this legislation yet means that we can't define what 'significant contribution' means, because it hasn't come into play yet. It should be flexible. It should take all information into account, and it does.

I think it's reasonable for Senator Hanson-Young to put a proposition. Of course, you could say that the legislation wouldn't permit that, but, in circumstances where you can't say that, it's proper for us to explore how these laws may in fact play out, particularly in circumstances where you've just said to the chamber that the words 'significant contribution' have not been defined.
                                                                                                                          </p>

                                                                                                                           I find that extraordinary because drafters, when they use language, are precise in what they do and words like 'may', 'must' and 'reasonableness' tend to play out very significantly if a matter is brought before a court. It's very difficult, in these circumstances, when a minister is granted a discretion because the courts are very reluctant to play into those sorts of discretions and to interfere. It is important to understand what that means, and I find it almost unbelievable that in the drafting of those words there isn't a definition in mind in which the words 'significant contribution' were used. There must've been some discussion, reason or definition that sits behind those very important words in the provision.

In a fast-moving landscape like this where you have ministerial discretion, it's important to maintain that flexibility; otherwise, poor outcomes could be made as well as good.

If a very large company does not become designated, we still end up with a proposition that the smaller, typically, country or niche media organisations are left in the very same situation that the ACCC warned against and was trying to remedy. Again, I'm very troubled by this provision and how it will affect the implementation of what the ACCC has raised as a concern. Does this not undermine the ACCC's desire to deal with huge imbalances between a small player and a large player because the Treasurer has found that in a number of different cases a deal has been done? However, it doesn't resolve the power imbalance for perhaps a smaller player that we want to have fostered amongst our journalist community.

What if some smaller players—one in your home state, one in my home state—make representations to the Treasurer that they are still finding themselves in a situation where they're dealing with a goliath? Would that fit within these new provisions? Could the Treasurer make a ruling on the basis that these small players can't negotiate, or haven't been able to negotiate, and therefore make a statement that the significant contribution test has not been met?

It's not an unreasonable thing. The parliament is being asked to grant a discretion to the minister. It's not unreasonable to ask how that discretion may be exercised. We can do that by putting forward a few different examples and trying to tease out what discretion we are actually granting to the minister.

What you can't do in these hypotheticals is describe the context at the time: what deals have already been struck, what the digital platform is and what the contribution to the sustainability of the Australian news industry has been that's being assessed. That can't be done, so your hypotheticals are simply impossible to answer in these circumstances.

However a responsible digital platform corporation can differentiate between news media businesses on the basis of a commercial agreement and can remunerate different news media businesses differently under different commercial agreements.

The current version, which is being replaced by these amendments, says 'a responsible platform cannot differentiate between news media businesses by reason of their participation in the code'. I understand that, therefore, remuneration might be different under different commercial agreements. How does that relate to agreements that might also affect the access of someone who has a deal versus someone who doesn't have a deal in relation to not just remuneration but also distribution?

The plan is to clarify, via these amendments, that digital platforms would not be penalised from engaging in normal commercial practices such as paying different remuneration amounts to different news businesses and promoting or boosting a news business's news content as part of the terms of those commercial deals. The scope also of the news content that's captured by the anti-avoidance provisions is also clarified here. It will be made abundantly clear that a news source must regularly produce news content that's the subject of bargaining and arbitration. So that's the definition of covered news.

It doesn't mitigate my concerns. So if, for example, a digital platform does a deal with a local newspaper and says, 'We're going to help drive traffic and we'll complement other's advertising,' that's a great commercial deal. But the competing paper sits on the

Previously, it said you can't differentiate between businesses by reason of their participation in the code. I'm now concerned, and I would like an explanation about how those commercial agreements for those that are left out isn't just about whether they're going to get a benefit of revenue but whether, in fact, that benefit is created and gobbled up from increasing the competitive pressure on the other media players. I want to know how you'll assess that issue. It seems to me that these deals might not contribute to a positive significant contribution. Indeed, they could undermine a contribution if players that are left out of the deals become more unsustainable.

We have seen that a number of media organisations have already entered into letters of intention with Google. Obviously yesterday Seven West Media announced it had entered into a letter of understanding with Facebook. We expect the digital platforms to continue those efforts to enter into agreements with more news media businesses and they can do this by putting a default offer on the table which publishers can choose to accept or use as a catalyst to reach a commercial agreement. It's important to remember that, in deciding whether to designate a platform, the Treasurer will have regard as to whether they have made a significant contribution to the sustainability of the Australian news industry through agreements relating to news content.

I am very happy to frame it as my own question: do we have any definition of 'intentionally'? The legislation says it only covers news content that's made 'intentionally' available. Now, I'm assuming that means that if I copy and paste a news article then there's no way of tracking the outcomes and the revenue streams. Or does it also mean that, if I tweet something and I get people to share it and it all goes back to a particular news article, I can't artificially drive up the revenue streams? What does 'intentionally' mean?

The reason I'm asking all this is that there is still uncertainty; people are feeling like they're going to fall through the cracks. I'm urging the government to consider what other services or support they need to offer to ensure that people don't unnecessarily fall through the cracks here.

It is an amendment to the government's amendment in relation to schedule 1, item 1, page 8, proposed subsection (3)(b). It goes to this point that we've been debating here this morning in relation to significant contributions to the sustainability of the Australian news industry. I think it's fair to say that all the questions this morning have been surrounding this element. As I said, there is a concern that, unless this is specifically referenced, small, medium and regional publishers will be overlooked in that definition of the significant contribution. So all I am asking for is that we clarify that in paragraph (3)(b) with the words 'including by entering into agreements with a significant number of those businesses'—and this is the important amendment—'that include small, medium and regional organisations'. The government has said it intends to ensure that this is the case. I don't see why there would be any problem in ensuring that they are included. I urge the government to accept this amendment. It would put at ease a number of nervous organisations this morning.

Out there in the real world, media organisations small and medium and in the regions are worried that they will be overshadowed by the big players. The whole point of this legislation is to ensure there is a power rebalance to make sure that those creating public interest journalism in this country are paid for the contribution they make. I am extremely concerned that these big global tech giants will weasel their way out of this unless we make it absolutely crystal clear that, when we talk about the ecosystem of Australia's news industry and public interest journalism landscape, small, medium and regional players play a significant role in that. All we're asking is for them to be noted and given the nod that this government also believes that they are a significant part. I don't see why the government wouldn't agree to this. It would put to bed the criticism that is coming. After all the questioning today from those of us on this side of the chamber, I must say I feel that, if the government isn't willing to put this in, it begs the question: can we really believe you? Why wouldn't you accept it? You say this is the case. Let's just put it in there.

As to your specific amendment, this is not simply government opposition. We have actually received advice from Treasury on this amendment and the effect of this amendment, and Treasury have come back to us with official advice saying that the amendment is unnecessary and will actually reduce the flexibility of the Treasurer to take into account the full considerations relevant to whether a digital platform has made the significant contribution to the Australian news industry that we're looking for.

You've said that commercial agreements aren't subject to the code, so I guess it would just be a different commercial agreement. However, you would also have to rule out whether the use of such offers are making a contribution to sustainable media or not. Can these offers only be picked up by people on the ACMA list?

It is important that we protect the small players. The government's amendment basically allows the Treasurer not to make a designation in circumstances where some of the players are happy. The minister can't define what 'significant contribution' means. That leaves this chamber with great ambiguity, and, in those circumstances, the chamber should act to protect the smaller players.

Minister, do you have a comment? No? Thank you. The question before the chair now is that the amendment to the government's amendments, as moved by Senator Hanson-Young on sheet 1215, be agreed to. That is the question before the chair.

Could the minister please outline what the Treasurer's process will be in determining what those terms of reference are? Who will the Treasurer consult with and is there somebody in the Treasurer's office who is going to be responsible? If so, who?

Did the government not consider strengthening the current standards within current organisations rather than saying, 'Well, let's just have a diversity of other standards?' How will the government address a proliferation of different standards? We've still got to keep this within the realm of journalism and news, yet, unless there's a consolidation of those values within our current perceptions of that, I'm really concerned about how perhaps the government could use this regulation.

You said it's not your intention to override them, but I don't understand why you need to take a code of practice from one professional council and put it into another.

I just want to be clear. What you've brought to the chamber today are amendments to your own legislation because Facebook had a dummy spit. What is the mettle of the Treasury and your government in designating Facebook News Feed if they don't do deals that satisfy the needs of small independent regional players?

In that context, in relation to ranking preferentially by digital services, I think you've explained that it allows commercial deals to be made, but they can still be considered for their contribution to the sustainability and success of news services. What does 'ranked preferentially' actually mean? What do these deals or agreements look like? They're in that overall section of the legislation about those agreements. I'm assuming it's algorithms or something. I'm hoping for an explanation.

Would that mean you can, therefore, differentiate within the contracts about how you might relate to other players in your agreements with them? I'm assuming that's the case. Is this part of the critical change? Why did you come to this conclusion? This seems to be a key change. Before it was, 'You can't differentiate'; now it is, 'You can'. Why has this change been made? What's key about it?

So, yes, the new one is the relevant one. Under this legislation, it will be possible to rank digital services preferentially and alter your algorithms et cetera based on the deals that you've done so that you can create some more sustainable revenue with your news partner. It might mean that you're not handing over money but you've made a commitment to generate more traffic for them. In that context, can you please come back to how you assess the impact of those deals if they are outside the code on the ultimate question about the sustainability of the Australian news industry and players that might not be able to get in the tent with such a deal? Are those players able to critique the fact that it's not only that they haven't been able to get a deal but that the deal that's been done in this preferential ranking is damaging their existing revenue streams?

We're aware that the bill's been introduced and amended by the government in the context of these negotiations with digital platforms and news media that we've been seeing. We've seen reports that the Prime Minister himself has been sending signals to the platforms as part of these negotiations and that the Treasurer and minister have been involved in a range of those discussions. We would note that neither our shadow minister nor our party has been in the room or at the table, and we are very conscious that ad hoc amendments can impact the balance of negotiations that the government is undertaking.

We've had some discussion about those in the context of the Press Council already—

We appreciate the sentiment of this amendment, but we do not regard that the amendment cures the uncertainty around designation at all. In that context, we note the minister's advice to the chamber and therefore oppose the amendment.

However, the precise role of this chamber is to improve legislation to make sure that it doesn't have unintended consequences. And our concern remains that small, medium and regional players will get left out in the cold. If the minister doesn't want that to happen, notwithstanding the success of this amendment, be very sure that week after week after week we are going to be keeping a very watchful eye on this. We are going to make sure that for every media organisation in this country who is not able to get a fair hearing with these tech titans the minister sorts it out. If he wants the discretion in relation to this, if this government wants to make sure that the power is in the Treasurer's hands, it will be on the Treasurer's head if anybody misses out. And we will expect answers in this place over and over again as to who has been screwed over by Facebook or Google—until you understand that it is your job to look after all players, not just the big monopolies, not just the Murdoch press, not just the

In this country, media diversity is at a crisis point because of not just the power that these big tech giants have but the concentration of media ownership across the various different platforms. I don't think it would have been too much for the Labor Party, or indeed the government themselves, to send a very clear message to Facebook and to Google today that we, the parliament of Australia, expect them to understand that small, medium and regional media in this country are essential, are absolutely fundamental to the sustainability of the news industry in this country. So we will be holding your feet to the fire, Minister, and the Treasurer's, in relation to this issue going forward. And we expect, in the review in 12 months time, transparency and honesty about how this has impacted on the various different players. If deals are done with only the friends of this government, those in the media who are their mates, and not with the small and regional publishers, it will be quite clear that this government has been duped. So here is an opportunity to fix it. If you're not going to take it, expect a fight in the months to come.

The government is in the middle of sensitive negotiations. We have seen people's Facebook accounts blocked and all sorts of crazy things happen. We have no indication of the effect of this amendment on those negotiations. We have small publishers, small businesses, community health organisations and stakeholders right around the country who are already in a difficult place. We have this amendment, thrown in at the last minute, when Labor has not been at the table. We have no explanation of how such an amendment would impact on the very organisations that you, Senator Hanson-Young, purport to protect. So it seems absolutely ridiculous to me to be lectured by the Greens on this issue. The government is at the table in these negotiations. If the government were to tell us that this is the best way of protecting small players, then we would be at the table in supporting that amendment. However, not being at the table, we have no evidence to go on that this would make the situation any better. It seems ridiculous to be inserting such things at the last moment.

Labor raised concerns about this amendment this morning. Whilst the argument used in relation to Senator Hanson-Young's amendment was that you didn't understand the consequences of her amendment, or you suggested there might be unintended consequences, if we were to remove this provision of the government's amendment, we would go back to where we were with the understanding we had yesterday. So Labor should be in a position to reject this amendment.

I would liken it to the two wires on the service module of Apollo 13. They might seem like just small wires, but after launch of this legislation we're going to find that it doesn't accomplish the mission. We're going to find that the Treasurer will simply be able to not designate Facebook and Google in accordance with the act. That would leave all of the small players, all of the regional players, without the ability to bargain properly against these very large digital companies, these foreign companies. We would, in effect, still have the very thing that Mr Rod Sims of the

We saw a host of crazy things happen out there, and yet we have—just like Senator Hanson-Young did—coming from Senator Patrick, an amendment that does not mitigate those risks. It does not cure the uncertainty that is here. Putting a number on it does not address in any way the power imbalances that need to be addressed. It could, in fact, further distort them, because we don't yet know who's been at the table in the deals.

If Senator Patrick wants to stand up for these players that he's concerned about, why not include all of them? Why not say, 'not just a significant number, but all players'? That is what takes us back to this complete circular logic—when the original version of the bill said, 'You've got to treat everyone the same and you can have no preferential treatment.' You can't just find the balance of that in the middle of these negotiations with the words that Senator Patrick is seeking to put into the legislation. So it is incumbent on this place to consider these issues properly and in the context of the negotiations that are already underway. It is ridiculous to me that inserting words like 'significant' versus 'substantial' will make any assessment of the kinds of difference they should make in the long-term credibility of this regime. It is impossible to make an assessment of what that looks like, particularly in the context of the negotiations that are already underway.

What I'm asking is that the chamber does not support part (1) of the amendments by the government, because it introduces an uncertainty that Senator Pratt herself has raised questions about today. Let's just understand what's happening here: Labor are capitulating to Facebook and Google. They want to be an alternative government but they're not prepared to stand up to two big international corporations. I've said many, many times before that I'd love to have a strong opposition because I think it makes government better. But, unfortunately, we simply don't have that. I'm not asking for anything to be added to this legislation; I'm asking about the offending provision that talks about a significant contribution, which creates a real possibility that smaller media entities and, indeed, regional media entities will not be protected or get the benefit of being able to negotiate with these very large behemoths of companies.

The government has introduced a last-minute amendment and the Labor Party can't actually react in that time frame because they have to take things back to the minister, who is not in this place, and interact, and then they have to take it to caucus. They are a large organisation that is not nimble and is unable to react to what has happened, and the government has just played them. The government has just played the Labor Party, introducing this at the last minute so that Labor has no ability to think this through and come to a decision. That's exactly what's happening here and it's very disappointing.

That's absolutely within his right. Let's be honest, the attack on Senator Patrick from the Labor Party really just exposes their uncomfortableness with this whole thing. It must be very difficult coming into this place day after day after day and not knowing where you stand on things. That's the truth of it. That is the problem with the Labor Party. I also accept that the government have not just done a deal here that satisfies Facebook and Google, and that they have blinked in relation to that; they have also, in this amendment, delivered for their mates in the Murdoch press. That is what is going on here. That is why this is in here. And that is why the Labor Party is gutless about taking this on. Mr Albanese, we all know, has no chance in any universe of doing anything if he's having to have a fight with the Murdoch press. That's what is going on, so let's just be honest; we're not debating anyone else's amendment but the government's. Our job in the Senate is to hold this government to account.

This is about sending a message directly to media corporations that there is an expectation that for the parliament to introduce this type of mandatory code, to go through this arbitration process, to ensure that the money is actually spent on creating more public interest journalism, not just more money for shareholders. I would like the government to at least give an indication that that is their expectation: that this money is spent on journalism jobs here in Australia and on creating public interest journalism in this country. It's not to be frittered away on extra curricula activities by board members or executives.

It could be onerous if unevenly applied. We've seen that a number of news media businesses have negotiated deals ahead of the passage of this bill. How, then, this legislation relates to reporting against this, in terms of how it's enlivened, auditing and enforcement—there is a clear risk, in our assessment, that this kind of reporting regime could underline the independence of some news media outlets.

We did cover quite a bit of this earlier today. I understand the government intends that to be the case. But I think it's important to ensure that there is a discussion in this chamber, which is why I previously circulated this amendment, and I would like the government to consider it.

It is, clearly, in the public interest that public interest journalism be assessed as part of the review. However, I think the government should be able to make an undertaking, in that regard, without biasing the other issues that might also emerge in the time of the implementation of this legislation. We would expect, for example, the work of the Public Interest Journalism Initiative, PIJR, and the Australian news mapping project—these are all important considerations. However, we need to address a context in which the department has failed to produce basic information about newspaper coverage in Australia, particularly given the department's role in relation to the Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund. That was announced back in 2017 as well as the Public Interest News Gathering program announced in 2020. So there are a wide range of issues that need to be researched and assessed in terms of the balance of this kind of review. We're very happy to emphasise the needs of small and independent journalists and the Public Interest Journalism Initiative et cetera, but this inquiry and review has to address the needs of a much greater diversity of stakeholders.

In some senses I think greater uncertainty has been brought about by the government's amendments this morning. It's clear that the bill addresses only a small part of a range of measures that are needed to improve media diversity in Australia and to further support public interest journalism. It will also address other major issues, including the international tax practices of the digital giants that operate across the globe.

A fairly new area of engineering, which I know might be foreign to those present in the chamber, is where independent auditors look at algorithms—it can be algorithms in respect of commercial applications or algorithms used by government—to make sure that those algorithms are performing the functions that they ought to perform and, indeed, not introducing unintended consequences into what are automated processes. Not much needs to be said, for example, about robodebt and the way in which that algorithm did not perform properly. Had there been algorithm auditing, the government may have been in a substantially better financial position than it is in now after having to make payouts to people who, it turns out, robodebt robbed of money.

Their anticompetitive practices and how their algorithms operate are shrouded from any oversight or accountability. This secrecy has deep implications for our democracy. These platforms have unquestionably amplified the spread of misinformation and falsehood aimed at undermining public confidence in, for example, the COVID-19 health response. They have undermined trust in democratic institutions and supercharged political polarisation. Even during debate on this bill, Google's public campaigning involved actively limiting the information that 250,000 Australians could access, through their so-called experiments. Similarly, Facebook's arbitrary decision to ban news sites extended to government, political and community organisation pages, amply demonstrating the outsized impact that the company's algorithms have on the way we do business here. This has implications far beyond those of the news bargaining code, and in order to deal with them we do need to have a level of scrutiny.

Whilst they have the power now, there is no requirement for them to do algorithm audits. There is no requirement to go in and have a look at what Google and Facebook might be doing, what their algorithms are actually doing, and make sure there is no anticompetitive behaviour being implemented through those algorithms, either intentionally—and one would hope that doesn't occur—or even unintentionally. That would be consistent with the role of the ACCC.

We need to open our minds to the fact that auditing is going to be required right across society where algorithms are being employed. It's no different to the auditing of books. In order to establish confidence in our corporations, we require them to be audited. That gives public confidence and it gives confidence to shareholders. This is no different. It's simply saying: let's audit the algorithms.

They'd simply examine the code, make sure there was nothing in there that was untoward and report back to the public that everything was in good order. If everything were not in good order, they could act in relation to that using their existing regulatory powers. So the amendment doesn't seek to in any way compromise Google and Facebook in their operations. It doesn't seek to require anything to be revealed about how they do their business. It seeks simply that the ACCC regularly audit these algorithms and deal with anything untoward within them.
