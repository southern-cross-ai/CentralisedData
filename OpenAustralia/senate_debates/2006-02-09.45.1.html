         I have had questions privately from people interested in the debate in the chamber as to how the matter would proceed. Senator Barnett, I am looking for some guidance and some input from the other participants in the debate as to the process that will be followed for the committee stage. It would seem to me that there are two sets of amendments before the chair, those on sheet 4828, revised 1, standing in the names of Senator Barnett and Senator Humphries, and those on sheet 4830, standing in the names of Senators Colbeck and Scullion. I want to clarify that there are no more amendments to be considered before the committee. The second thing is that it seems reasonable to me that the amendments of Senators Barnett and Humphries be dealt with and disposed of, and then, if the first amendments fail, the amendments of Senators Colbeck and Scullion be dealt with and disposed of. Is there any objection to that process?

           Yes, except for amendment (2), which is schedule 1, items 1 to 5 on page 3 to be opposed. That will need to be put separately. But it is subject to the wishes of Senators Barnett and Humphries and whether they seek leave to move amendments (1), (3), (4), (5), R(6), R(7) and R(8) together. That has not happened at this stage. I note that it is past one o’clock and that sessional requirements require me to report progress.

             I hear your point, and that is why I was interested to take the chair. It is not within my province to allocate time. I suggest that the interested parties get together during the next hour and work out a time allocation as a guide to the chair and the clerks. We have always held to the guidance from interested parties. I am sure it can be worked out in a reasonable and mutually advantageous way for all parties.
