         I thank you, Senator Reynolds, for that question. Senator Reynolds, as honourable senators may be aware, has a particular knowledge of the matters concerning national security, having been herself a former brigadier general in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Army
         </a>
         Reserve and a former adjutant general of the Australian Army. So thank you very much indeed, Senator Reynolds, for asking me that question.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is very important that we maintain an attitude of bipartisanship when it comes to matters of national security because, as I explained yesterday and the day before yesterday and as the Director-General of Security, Mr Irvine, pointed out in his speech to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Press_Club" rel="nofollow">
          National Press Club
         </a>
         yesterday, the level of domestic threat to Australia from terrorism, arising in particular from recent events in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
          Middle East

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Iraq" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Iraq
         </a>
         , and the activities of the terrorist group ISIL—now seeking to establish a caliphate in Syria and Northern Iraq—presents a higher level of threat than we have seen for some time.
        </p>
        <p>
         In that regard, I want to acknowledge and thank the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten, for his remarks yesterday morning. When asked about this, he said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         When it comes to national security, Labor sees this as a matter above politics.
        </p>
        <p>
         Mr Shorten is right. It is a good thing that he said that and it behoves all the members of the Senate to observe the injunction that Mr Shorten has given. We appreciate and acknowledge the Labor Party's bipartisan support for the important measures in which the government has embarked to keep our country and our people safe.

           The government is keeping the opposition close. Many of the measures that we are introducing were in fact the outcome of a bipartisan report of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Joint_Committee_on_Intelligence_and_Security" rel="nofollow">
            Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security
           </a>
           that was tabled at the end of the last parliament—I want to acknowledge Mr Anthony Byrne, the member for Holt, who chaired that committee, for his work.
          </p>
          <p>
           In recent weeks, the opposition has been briefed on no fewer than five occasions by the government and agencies. Mr Dreyfus has been briefed on all five occasions. Mr Shorten participated in two of those briefings and Ms Tanya Plibersek participated in three of those briefings. The briefings were given by the Director-General of Security, Mr Irvine, by the officers of the Attorney-General's Department and my office. We will continue to keep the opposition informed as we appreciate their bipartisan support.

             One of the things we are doing, Senator Reynolds—and this was part of the package of measures the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I announced on the 5 August—is investing additional money in community engagement.
            </p>
            <p>
             I met with the Islamic community leaders on 2 July. Last week the Prime Minister met with the Islamic community leaders in Sydney, and the Prime Minister and I, together, met with Islamic community leaders in Melbourne. Tomorrow I will be meeting with Islamic community leaders in Sydney once again and next week in Melbourne once again.
            </p>
            <p>
             As I have said many times, the moderate mainstream of the Islamic community are our essential partners in this task and we will keep them close and engaged. As the Prime Minister and I committed to them, we will develop these measures in collaboration and cooperation with them, because we acknowledge their importance in these measures.
