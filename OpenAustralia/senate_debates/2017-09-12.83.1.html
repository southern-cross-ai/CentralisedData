       <p>
        As I foreshadowed yesterday, I have some further information from the Minister for Human Services for Senator Hinch in relation to a question he asked me last week concerning eligibility for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSP" rel="nofollow">
         DSP
        </a>
        . The minister advises that eligibility for the DSP is determined by assessing the impact the condition has on an individual's capacity to work rather than the condition itself. To be eligible for the DSP, the legislative requirements are that an individual's condition needs to be fully diagnosed, treated and stabilised as well as attract a rating of at least 20 points under the impairment tables. While I can't comment on the specifics of the individual case that the senator referred to, it is important to note that there are specific eligibility criteria for all income support payments. So I emphasise again that eligibility for the DSP is determined by assessing the functional impact that a condition has on the person in question and not on the presence of any particular medical condition itself.
       </p>
       <p>
        To be granted a DSP, a person must, in addition to meeting other eligibility criteria, meet both the income and assets tests, except of course unless they are permanently blind; have a permanent physical, intellectual or psychiatric impairment with a rating of at least 20 points under the impairment tables; be unable to work for 15 hours or more per week within the next two years because of their condition; and have actively participated in a program of support—for example, JobSearch, rehabilitation, educational or training—unless they have a severe impairment or they're manifestly eligible, such as where a person has a terminal illness. While a disability support pension claim is being processed, other income support is available, such as Newstart allowance or youth allowance, with an exemption of all mutual obligation activities, including looking for work.
       </p>
       <p>
        In relation to the qualifications of DSP assessors, job capacity assessors in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Human_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Human Services
        </a>
        are qualified health and allied health professionals. There are a variety of professional qualifications, ranging from registered nurses to psychologists and occupational therapists. The department works to align individuals with an assessor who has related qualifications to assess the condition in question. The department also has a health professional advisory unit staffed by qualified medical practitioners and can also contact a person's treating health professional.
