        [by video link] I'm very pleased to be joining the Senate today from Cairns and to talk about the wages of workers in Queensland. What we know is that real wages are going backwards under the Morrison government—it is built into their budget predictions that wages will not increase—and we know that wages have been stagnant for many years under this government, not just through the pandemic but well before the pandemic started. Real wages are going down, and yet the cost of living is going up. People are seeing childcare costs go up. They're seeing petrol prices go up. Insurance costs, in

        Labor government—will fix this issue is by introducing legislation to make sure that if you work the same job then you get the same pay. I'm very pleased to see that Anthony Albanese introduced this bill in the House of Representatives this week. This is a bill that can't wait until the election, as this issue is so important.

        , in regional Queensland, to undercut the wages of working people. We know that this leads to more casual work, more insecure work—insecurity in our regional communities. We know that this leads to safety issues on site, where people are afraid to speak up when they see a safety issue. We need to put a stop to these bad practices, and only a Labor government will do that.

        It is not surprising to have already learnt that some government members have said that they won't support this legislation.
