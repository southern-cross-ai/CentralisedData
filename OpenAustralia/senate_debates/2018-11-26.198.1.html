           The government established the financial services royal commission to ensure Australia's financial system works efficiently, effectively and in the interests of consumers. The commission has received over 3,200 phone calls and over 5,500 emails from members of the public, and 10,140 public submissions detailing consumers' experiences with financial service providers. Each and every one of these submissions has been read and considered by the royal commission. The government awaits the outcome of the royal commission and will take the necessary action to restore the public's confidence and trust in our financial system, and to ensure our financial system operates in the best interests of consumers.

              Labor will not be supporting Senator Anning's motion for another broad-ranging Senate select committee inquiry into financial services and banking. The most effective inquiry mechanism with the strongest, broad-ranging powers to compel documents and witnesses is actually the current banking royal commission. This royal commission would never have been called except for years of pressure from Shorten Labor. Labor would prefer to see the royal commission have its reporting date put back to allow more witnesses and victims of banking scandals to be able to appear before it. This should be the focus of the Senate and the parliament at this time.
