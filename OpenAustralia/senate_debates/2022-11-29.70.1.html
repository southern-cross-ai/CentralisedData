        Today I want to amplify the words and hopes of one young Victorian who I represent. The Raise Our Voice Campaign helps turn up the volume of the voices of our young people and put on the record what matters to them. It is a wonderful initiative that brings the passionate views of young Australians straight to this parliament. I reckon that Sarah, a 19-year-old university student from the electorate of Goldstein, has a pretty good take on what she wants to see change in Australian society. Sarah says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australians continue to grapple with growing inequality in recent years to the extent that 10% of the nation's people now possess 46% of its wealth. Furthermore, the cost-of-living crisis persists in disproportionately impacting lower income households.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Coming from the electorate of Goldstein, my life has been characterised by privilege.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In particular—like the other 64 per cent of Goldstein kids who went to an independent school—my education has provided me with skills and experiences that have equipped me to have the fair go that embodies the Australian experience.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As inequality worsens, I am horrified to witness the cycle of privilege be cemented through our education system where in a compounding of disadvantage, families privileged enough to fork out tens of thousands of dollars on their children's education are rewarded with school better supported by the government than those who cannot.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I hope this parliament sees equality as an objective worth pursuing and prioritises education at a primary, secondary and tertiary level and uses it as a tool to empower all of Australia in getting a 'fair go'.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sarah, I urge you to continue speaking up and raising your voice into the future; we would do well to listen to you.
       </p>
