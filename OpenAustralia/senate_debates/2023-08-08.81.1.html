        The robodebt scheme was one of the darkest chapters of Australia's social security system and, indeed, of our history. It caused devastating emotional and psychological harm to people across the country. At least two people took their lives because of robodebt and it cost the country over a billion dollars. The report of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Commission
        </a>
        into the Robodebt Scheme was a step towards justice for the hundreds and thousands of people traumatised by the brutal scheme. The report was the culmination of years of fighting, advocacy and bravery from thousands of victims and their families, who were indiscriminately targeted and traumatised by this callous and illegal scheme. Commissioner Holmes' thorough and scathing review proved what victims had been saying for years, and how the harm, trauma and debts could have been avoided if not for the inhumane actions and lack of accountability from the government and, in particular, from the former Prime Minister, Mr Scott Morrison. Thousands of innocent people were made to feel like criminals, when it was robodebt that was criminal, and the Prime Minister, his cabinet and senior departmental officials responsible for this scheme must be held to account for this brutality.

        will continue to fight until all those responsible for robodebt are held accountable, all the royal commission recommendations are implemented, until Centrelink debt recovery is suspended and justice is served for the victims of this horrific scheme.
