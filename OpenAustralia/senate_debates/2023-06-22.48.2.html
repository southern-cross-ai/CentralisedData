        I rise to formally put on record the position of the coalition on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2023. I personally have particular affection for the defence forces, having been a reservist, and I know the high and the lows and the disappointment and the pride that comes with wearing the uniform. I also know and understand the difficulties that some of our veterans have had in managing their way through veterans' affairs and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Veterans'_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Veterans' Affairs
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The veterans community is a highly valued but often forgotten group in this nation. In recent years, we've seen an increasing impact on those who have served our country and face ever more new traumas in doing their duty. That's why when we were in government the Liberals and Nationals invested more than $11 billion each year to support around 340,000 veterans and their families, and I am pleased that the current government is continuing this investment.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill makes technical amendments to four sections of the veterans' affairs legislation to clarify, improve or streamline its delivery. While the amendments are minor and, in effect, tidy up several piece of legislation, they will make our veterans' interactions with the department a more transparent and hopefully a more positive experience. That's why the coalition will be supporting this legislation.

         I'd like to acknowledge and recognise Senator Davey's contribution to the debate on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2023 and acknowledge the continued tradition of bipartisan support for Australian veterans. I thank any other senators who have spoken in this debate, and I commend the bill to the Senate.
