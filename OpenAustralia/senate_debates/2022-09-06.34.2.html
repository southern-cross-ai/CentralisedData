           As I say, what is it about these people? They were in government for nine years. They delivered a wages and bargaining system that is completely broken. They had low wages as a design feature of their economic policy.

               It really is a shame, after an election, after a jobs and skills summit which saw the country brought together by a new government, that the only group that doesn't want to accept that people want to cooperate is the opposition. We know what it's like to be in opposition; we were there for a few years. The approach we took was that you pick your fights—you actually look for constructive opportunities when you can, and you pick your fights when you really have to. But this opposition—all they seem to do is: whatever the idea, they're against it.

                   The government have made very clear that we will be consulting employers, unions and a range of other people as to how this agreement will be implemented and will deal with all of those issues. But, again, I was very concerned to see some reports this morning in
                   <i>
                    The Australian
                   </i>
                   that, in response to COSBOA's comments about reaching an agreement on these matters, coalition backbenchers were 'out for blood' on the issue. Now, we've heard a lot about thuggery and intimidation from the other side when it comes to industrial relations. Well, who are the thugs now? Who's doing the intimidating now? In fact, some coalition MPs argued that COSBOA had betrayed small business owners, likening it to a snake. That's the kind of behaviour—

                               is correct. We do see cost of living pressures in this country at the moment and that's why we have a range of policies in place to deal with it, such as delivering wage rises. The best way to deliver cost-of-living relief is to get people's wages up.

We are acting on cheaper child care. We're acting on them in cheaper medicines. We are putting downward pressure on energy prices. That is part of our commitment, as we have said. More importantly, we are lifting wages at the same time. Which government supported a minimum wage rise? The Albanese Labor government. Who opposed it? The opposition. Which government supported a wage rise for aged-care workers? The Albanese Labor government. Who opposed it? The opposition. That is how we will fix cost-of-living pressures, not by dragging our
