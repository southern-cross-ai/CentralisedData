        All of us in politics and the public life understand that our partners and families also bear the burden of our careers. For the leaders of our parties, and especially when those leaders become Prime Minister, the costs and the challenges that are faced by their partners are even greater. They step into a spotlight they did not choose. They are scrutinised for their ability to do a job they did not apply for. It is a job with few guidelines and many expectations. Hazel Masterton, who became
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazel_Hawke" rel="nofollow">
         Hazel Hawke

        in 1956, met those challenges with grace and with humour. She was a woman of strong political opinions and had a deep commitment to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and the values of the Labor movement. But she refused to try to shortcut the normal processes of policy development with a word in the Prime Minister's ear.
       </p>
       <p>
        She was actively engaged in many causes—women's rights, environment, education, social justice—but refused to be labelled with any of them. She was fiercely private but accepted that public and media attention were part of her 'job' after
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Hawke" rel="nofollow">
         Bob Hawke
        </a>
        became the Labor leader—and she insisted it was a job—and was open and matter-of-fact about personal, painful matters in her private family life. Her courage and her refusal to act as if these challenges were a stigma or a source of shame gave strength to many others in our community facing similar difficulties in their own lives. The same would be the case when Hazel spoke publicly about having Alzheimer's disease.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1999, Hazel Hawke gave the second annual John Curtin Prime Ministerial Library Anniversary Lecture. She took as her topic 'In search of the Light on the Hill. 'We must look forward,' she said, 'we must seek, we must hope; but we must do this in a spirit of compassion, and with a sense of inclusion. The whole of this nation, in all its diversity, must be on board. It must be a journey not only for the bold and brave, the healthy and strong.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Hazel understood that even the boldest and bravest are not immune to the catastrophes that unexpected health and life events can wreak on families. I suspect Hazel's feet were too firmly on the ground for her to be comfortable being called an inspiration. But she was an inspiring figure for a great many people who found in her an example of dignity and good humour in adversity, and of a constant commitment to making the world a better place at every opportunity.
       </p>
       <p>
        Hazel was regarded with great affection by Australians, and she was much loved within the Labor Party. Both her hard work and her kindness were legendary. She will be greatly missed by those who knew her and those who did not, but of course most acutely by her family—her children and her grandchildren who were so dear to her. I offer my deepest sympathy to Sue, Steve and Ros and their children at this difficult time.
