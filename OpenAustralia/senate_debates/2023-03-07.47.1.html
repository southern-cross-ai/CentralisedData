        A couple of days ago, on Sunday 5 March, it was
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Up_Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Clean Up Australia Day
        </a>
        . This is an annual event that sees thousands of Australians get out and about in their communities to clean up, fix up and conserve our environment. It's the good old-fashioned power of people. It's a recreational fishing group removing marine debris. It's school students keeping their neighbourhood clean and tidy. It's tree planting groups removing litter from a local reserve.

        It's no different in my neck of the woods in

        , held their own clean-up event, and it was very well attended. We know the challenge of cleaning up at these events is a positive, practical action that makes a difference to the health of our planet, but that challenge goes far beyond one day. I also know that there are individuals, groups and businesses right across this country that are doing their bit day in, day out to help. As

        for the Great Barrier Reef, I see this commitment every single day in our communities, with groups like the Tangaroa Blue foundation, who I was fortunate enough to join forces with recently to host a community beach clean, alongside the Dawul Wuru rural rangers and local residents. We removed over 33 kilograms of rubbish from a local beach and waterway that feeds directly into the Great Barrier Reef.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am incredibly proud of these groups and the work that they do. I'm also proud that as a Labor government we've got straight to work to restore our environmental credibility, to recognise the value of our natural environment and to take real action on climate change. We couldn't do it without the community on the ground. We will back their commitment with real action, and we're seeing that already. Just a few months ago, Australia signed a strong determination to end plastic pollution around the world.
