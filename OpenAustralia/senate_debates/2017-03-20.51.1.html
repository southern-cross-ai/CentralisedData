         Yes, I can—thank you very much indeed, Senator Fawcett. In the 58 days since President Trump was inaugurated, the Turnbull government has been swift to engage with key figures in the new administration. As we know, Prime Minister Turnbull has spoken with the President. The outcome of that conversation was the President's honouring of an agreement by America to accept refugees from

        <p>
         My meetings, like those of Ms Bishop and Senator Payne, are a timely reminder of the depth and breadth of our relationship with the United States and, in the case of the meetings from which I have recently returned, in particular, its intelligence and security agencies.

           <p>
            During the meetings in which I participated, I was able to raise key national security matters including the current threat posed by ISIL both in the

               Thank you, Senator Fawcett. As you know, the United States has been and remains Australia's most important strategic partner on national security matters. As I said a moment ago, that partnership is unaffected by changes of administration in Washington or of government in Canberra. It is as crucial to Australia's national security today as it has ever been.
              </p>
              <p>
               Since 12 September 2014, when the national terrorism threat level was elevated, Australia has experienced four terror related attacks, and 12 potential attacks have been interdicted and disrupted by our agencies. As I have said before, a number of those disruptions—which, had they not been interdicted, would have led to the deaths of many Australians—were the direct consequence of the deep and effective intelligence sharing between Australia and its allies and, in particular, the United States. The Turnbull government understands that, and so does the Trump administration.
