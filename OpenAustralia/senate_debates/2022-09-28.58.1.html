        A couple of weeks ago I spoke in the chamber about the Tasmanian bid for the 19th standalone team in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">
         AFL
        </a>
        and questioned the demand from the AFL for a new stadium as a part of that bid. My questions with respect to the requirement for the stadium by the AFL remain, because, as I said in my previous presentation, other new teams didn't have that requirement.
       </p>
       <p>
        Regardless of my doubts, it is clear that the Tasmanian government and the AFL have continued to press on with the bid process. It is clear that Tasmania and its bid have met all of the hurdles, all of the requirements for an AFL team as part of the bid process and as part of the work plan that was set out through the agreement between Tasmania and the AFL. The presidents of the AFL clubs are now in a position to grant Tasmania that 19th standalone AFL team for Tasmania.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is only one thing that remains between Tasmania now and the AFL team. The Tasmanian government has indicated its support for a new statement stadium. The AFL has indicated its support for a new stadium. The Tasmanian government has put $375 million on the table and indicated the site for the new stadium.

        Only one thing remains now between Tasmania and an AFL team. The Tasmanian government has indicated its support for a new stadium. The AFL has indicated its support for a new stadium. The Tasmanian government has put $375 million on the table for the stadium and indicated the site for the new stadium. The only thing that remains for the AFL presidents to be able to say, 'Yes, Tasmania can have that 19th team,' is funding from the Albanese government. So the decision as to whether Tasmania actually gets a 19th team—its deserved team, as a state in the AFL competition—depends on a decision by the Albanese government to support the construction of that stadium. Tasmania's on board; the AFL is on board. Does
