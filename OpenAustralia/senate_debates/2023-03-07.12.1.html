         I would like to get a better idea of the time frames that are sitting around the additional information around the time frame in which the new bundling arrangements are to come into place. Could the minister advise when we expect to have an idea of the mechanism of the bundling and the timing of that bundling?

          I'm advised that two weeks ago we initiated consultation on these questions. It's expected that that consultation will run for another six weeks. Sometime after that the government will be in a position to make public the relevant information. The bills commence on 1 July.

           changes that are going to be necessary to enable the change in the bundling application by 1 July. I'm wondering whether you've had any concerns raised by the sector about your ability to meet those time frames.

            , thanks again for the question and apologies for taking time to consult officials. I am advised that the bundling issues that you refer to are not in fact contained in this bill but that they are being dealt with through a separate process.

               In relation to the changes that are going to take effect as a result of this particular legislation, in relation to the levy and, obviously, the changes to the cost recovery framework—I suppose they're the two main components—what requirements does the government believe that industry will have to put in place by 1 July?

                      Thanks for the question, Senator Pocock. I did step through that in my second reading remarks, but I am happy to touch on it in brief terms again. I think, for a number of reasons, we didn't support the Senate making a direction of this kind. The first reason is that, essentially, this power exists with the
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
                       ACCC
                      </a>
                      . The Treasurer has a capacity to require an inquiry of this kind, but, in the end, the ACCC has a capacity for investigation, and they establish their priorities according to their resources and the issues before them. I think the second one was really about time frames. There is a new compliance framework being developed. It includes the ability to gather information from stakeholders and share information with relevant regulators on matters of noncompliance. There is a framework which is being brought forward. In the meantime, as I indicated in the second reading remarks, there are a number of existing powers which apply to participants in this market.

                        is a Treasury agency. The public sector advisers who are here to provide advice today in the Senate are drawn from the health department. However, I think Minister Gallagher would be happy to have a further discussion with you about this, but we would need some time to obtain the necessary advice.

                         In relation to the decision to take a number of items off the Prostheses List and put them into general-use bundling, the Clinical Implementation Reference Group went through a process to make a decision on these particular items. I'm wondering if there's any brief summary you can give us on the determination of those items. There must have been some sort of clinical definition as to why they were removed, and I'm wondering whether it's possible to get the meeting papers in relation to the removal of those items.

                              , I understand from your question that you're referring to the bundling. I refer to my earlier answer, which indicated that there's a consultation process on foot at the moment, which I understand will extend for approximately six weeks.

                                   That's interesting: you have the preference of the department already out there and trying to lead the consultation, yet you haven't sought to find out the preferred mechanism of your stakeholders, the very people who are required to actually implement these changes.

                                      RUSTON (—) (): Thank you. In December, when questioned in relation to the removing of these particular items into the general use bucket, the minister said, in response to their funding, that the payment of them by the insurers would be mandated. I'm just keen to understand the intended length of time for that mandate.

                                            nator RUSTON (—) (): Thank you. I accept that you've taken it on notice, but I think what I'm trying to get to is the very nature of the fact that we have before us this bill that actually provides a whole series of enabling capabilities for the government to do things, not the least of which is the removal from the Prostheses List of in excess of 400 items that now have to be dealt with by an alternative funding model. Obviously, this is of significant concern more broadly because it could potentially have very significant impacts on the delivery of services. I accept that you're not the minister—you're a representing minister—and I appreciate you want to take these on notice, but, given that this bill is going to come back a little bit later this afternoon or maybe tomorrow, I'd really appreciate being able to understand whether you've actually assessed the impacts of how you might proceed in dealing with the funding or the payment of these particular items as it impacts on actual procedures.

                                            As an example, I asked in my speech in the second reading debate: can you guarantee that bariatric procedures, which use a significant number of the items that will be transferred off the Prostheses List into this new general use area, will remain cost-effective for delivery by private hospitals through this insurance mechanism following the changes? The thing that I think everybody is wanting to find out about what's going on here is whether the procedures that are currently being undertaken are not going to be detrimentally impacted by the changes. That's all we're seeking to understand, so it's concerning that we're standing here today without having that information.

                                            We're about to get gonged because we're going to the next stage of procedure in this place, so I look forward to perhaps being a bit more detailed when we come back.
