        Yesterday, it was a huge honour to be in the chamber as the Senate passed the Fair Work Amendment (Paid Family and Domestic Violence Leave) Bill. This is a hugely important reform that will help so many people, particularly women, be safer. As I said in my speech in the second reading debate, it was terrific to have the opportunity to consult with my community, to bring together frontline service providers, experts, the Small and Family Business Ombudsman and employer groups to talk through the details, to talk about the implementation and to nut out any unintended consequences. We had great conversations, and everyone left that roundtable knowing more. I left that roundtable with a really clear view of what my community wanted.
       </p>

        That consultation sat alongside a Senate committee process looking into this amendment. That committee had 28 calendar days in which to hold public inquiries, receive and consider submissions, draft a report and, ultimately, form a view. Although important, it was a relatively straightforward piece of legislative reform. Last year, for the Respect@Work amendment bill the committee had 43 days to look at the legislation, and for the Fair Work Amendment (Supporting Australia's Jobs and Economic Recovery) Bill it had 92 calendar days to do the same. Now we're faced with a massive bill dealing with industrial relations—something that it is so crucial we get right for Australians, not only for workers, whose wages need to grow, but for employer groups, who have concerns—for which the committee will have only 22 days. While I applaud the Greens' talking about more transparency, it's disappointing to see them backing having a short time to consider a bill.
