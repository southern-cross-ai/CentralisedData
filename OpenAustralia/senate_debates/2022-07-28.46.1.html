        Brave farmers in the Netherlands are protesting their government's draconian and tyrannical climate policies and, through peaceful protests, they're defending their livelihoods and their liberty. They deserve our support. They're standing up for their own country and everyone who opposes the elitist, globalist agenda being imposed on people throughout the world.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dutch" rel="nofollow">
         The Dutch
        </a>
        government, led by the

         World Economic Forum
        </a>
        , is imposing a climate agenda that will result in thousands of farmers having to forfeit their land all because their government says that cows and soil are contributing to climate change. This is all in accordance with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations
        </a>
        2030 agenda for sustainable development. These actions will do nothing more than transfer wealth and property from the hands of hardworking people into the hands of the already ultrawealthy elites. This is a weaponisation of fear, falsehoods and threats.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Labor government in this country is now seeking to pursue its own reckless emissions policy, with Mr Albanese referring to climate change as a 'national security issue', a bizarre and nonsensical claim, unless he means that climate policies weaken us and make us more vulnerable to outside threats like the

        , in which case I agree. There's no way to achieve these reductions without transforming society in ways that will cause many Australians, including farmers, to lose their livelihoods.
       </p>
       <p>
        How long before the Australian government tells Australian farmers they're not allowed to work? Good, hardworking people have had enough of these senseless, arbitrary government intrusions into their lives, and they're standing their ground. Whether these are the Dutch farmers or the Canadian truckers, freedom-loving people are peacefully holding the line. And if the Australian government pushes further with the 2030 agenda in this country, then, God willing, Australians will need to start speaking up.
