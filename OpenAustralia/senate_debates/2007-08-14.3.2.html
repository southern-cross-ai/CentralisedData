            Parliaments around this country and around the world have recognised the importance, for good governance and for democracy, of having independent speakers and presidents of their parliaments. It is an important tradition that we can follow in this parliament as well. Today presents us with an opportunity to stand up for good governance and to stand up for democracy. I submit myself to the will of the Senate.

             I put to the Senate that, firstly, there is a club arrangement in the Senate which means that the President automatically comes from the government and the

              Deputy President
             </a>
             comes from the opposition. That is not an arrangement which the Greens support. It means, effectively, that the best person is not necessarily elected to the position. That is what we should be aspiring to, short of the ideal that Senator Nettle put forward—that there should be an independent

               Senator Ray says: ‘About 30 quotas.’ That is a club arrangement. A club arrangement between the two big parties excludes the alternative and, in this case, better candidate in Senator Nettle. Let me put this to the Senate: this year, Senator Ferguson—and I think he will make an admirable President—has made six submissions to this Senate. Senator Nettle has made 102 submissions to the Senate. So when you look at diligence, hard work and contribution, you see that Senator Nettle presents an option which ought to be favoured and is the better option. What is more, she is an intelligent, fair-minded senator who, in taking the chair, would give it the dignity it deserves.

                 I have an interjection from opposite, Clerk, which says it is appalling behaviour to be standing up in a democratic forum, taking part in a democratic debate about a democratic vote, and the government does not want it—appalling behaviour indeed! Anyway, this is a serious matter—the Greens providing democracy—because, if you have no contest, you have no democracy in this chamber, part of the fulcrum of democracy in this country. I am proud we are doing this, I am proud of Senator Nettle being presented here for this vote for the presidency, and I recommend her to thoughtful senators as the next

                  I thank the Senate for the honour it has bestowed upon me. Honourable senators, thank you for the enormous honour you have done me by electing me as your President. I will endeavour to repay the trust that you have placed in me. I could not be elected to this office without the support of my party and the people of

                  I pay tribute to my predecessor in the chair, my close friend Senator Calvert, who has been an excellent

                   President of the Senate
                  </a>
                  for the last five years and who did much to reform the bureaucracy of the parliament. Senator Calvert has chosen his own time to retire—something not everyone in this building has the chance to do—and I know all honourable senators will wish him well for the future. It was a South Australian,

                  , who was the first President of the Senate at Federation; and six senators for South Australia have now occupied the President’s office—more than from any other state. We also claim Senator Margaret Reid, who spent all of her formative years in South Australia. If my memory is correct, she was the first president of the

                 <p>
                  Apart from the support from my party and my colleagues, the greater personal debt of gratitude I owe is to my wife Anne and my family. They have been a continual source of support during my political career. It is a career which I know comes at a personal cost to all households that contain a politician. I cannot express my gratitude enough for that support. Together with Anne and other family friends in the gallery, two of our three daughters are here—along with Grace Heaslip and Jim Le Messurier, two of our five grandchildren. As President, I aim to continue the unbroken tradition of my predecessors to endeavour to treat every senator equally, and I hope all honourable senators will play their part in helping in that endeavour—and those who assist the President in the chair.

We are sure that you will bring wisdom, balance and independence to your duties as President and, with 15 years of great service as a senator and as chairman of various Senate and joint parliamentary committees, you bring considerable experience to the job of President.

On behalf of all coalition senators, I assure you of our willingness to cooperate with you to ensure the smooth and efficient operation of the Senate and to support you fully in your new and important role. Mr President, it has been my privilege to share a house with you in Canberra for some 14 years and, while you have now achieved this new and august role, I still expect you to do your own washing-up!

                    . I am sure you will conduct your duties with dignity, fairness and impartiality. We think that, if the President has to be a government senator, you are a good choice. I point out that Labor did not support you in the election because we are part of a club but because we hold to the principle that the President ought to be provided by the government of the day. It is a principle we hope that the coalition would support were a Labor government to be elected. We wish you well in your role. We think you will bring your sense of humour to your role in the chair, which is always an advantage. I am sure the opposition will test your patience. That is part of our function in applying pressure on the government. We wish you well in your role and look forward to your term as President.

Good luck, Mr President, and we welcome you to this position.

                         . As a colleague and a very good friend over the last 15 years, I know that you have all the qualities that are needed to make an excellent President; particularly important are fair-mindedness and a good sense of humour. I was privileged to have the goodwill of senators in carrying out my role in the chair over the last five years and I trust that senators will extend to you the same courtesy. It will be a pleasure to sit back here and watch you in the chair at question time!
