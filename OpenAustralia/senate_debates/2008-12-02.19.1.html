        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for

        , Senator Wong. I refer to the fact that only around 320 naval personnel will be on active duty protecting Australia’s borders for two months over the Christmas period and that only half of the patrol boats that defend our shores will be deployed. I ask the minister how many of the eight Bay class Customs vessels will be on active duty protecting our borders over that period?

         I thank Senator Johnston for the question. As the Senator is aware, the government is committed to strong border security arrangements and is determined to deal effectively and appropriately with the perpetrators of people smuggling and similar such crimes that put lives at risk. It is the case, I understand, that Labor will continue to ensure extensive patrolling of our borders—

           My advice is that the stand-down over Christmas that Senator Johnston refers to will not impact operations and that there will not be any diminution of the border security arrangements. Also, I want to emphasise that, since the Rudd government was elected, there has been no reduction in the number of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Navy" rel="nofollow">
            Royal Australian Navy
           </a>
           patrol boats and no change in the number of

           . I am also advised that patrols of Australian waters will continue throughout the Christmas-

            New Year

           period. There has been no reduction in Border Protection Command’s operational capability, and the

            RAN
           </a>
           and Customs vessels under the control of Border Protection Command will continue their important border protection duties. There is no diminution of activity. I understand, Senator Johnston, that this is consistent with the answers that have been previously given to the opposition on this issue.

            With respect, that answer is inconsistent with Senator Faulkner’s answer when he said that half of the patrol boats would be withdrawn. But we will bat on.

Can the minister explain why the government is leaving our maritime borders exposed by giving the Navy two months Christmas holidays at the very time there has been a surge in people smugglers bringing illegal immigrants to Australia?
