         I congratulate the senator on getting a question on the

         ! It is quite amazing! I am sure you will assist me in the course of my answer. Telstra have remediated, I understand, over 120,000 pits, and there have been notices or incidents reported to Comcare—I think, 29, of which a number have nothing to do with the National Broadband Network. So, even if you add those in, that is about 0.02 per cent.
        </p>
        <p>
         Let me be very clear about this: not one shortcut is acceptable. There are no shortcuts here when it comes to dealing with asbestos. Everyone is required to follow the rules—

           And that is why the procedures were written into it, Senator Brandis, who knows all! That is exactly why, if you go and have a look, Senator Brandis—instead of pontificating and pretending you are in the High Court; if you could just manage not to be an expert on every topic, Senator Brandis, I would be able to complete my answer. I know that is very hard!

           So, no shortcuts are acceptable to the government—none whatsoever. In the meeting that Mr Shorten and I convened, we brought together Telstra,

            NBN

           Co., the contractors, Comcare and all of the relevant authorities, including the trade unions involved, and the agreement reached at that was that Telstra's remediation of pits would cease until training standards were all agreed and to make sure everyone was given adequate notice that every single aspect—

            , I rise on a point of order. There were a number of very specific questions that were asked of the minister, such as at how many sites has remediation work by Telstra been delayed and whether there has been any delay to the handover of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
             NBN
            </a>
            sites and what number of delays had been experienced. Mr President, I note there are 10 seconds left on the clock. If the minister does not have answers to those specific questions, which he has not answered in the one minute and 50 seconds he has had to date, perhaps he might at least take those specific questions on notice.

             That is not a point of order. I believe the minister is answering the question. The minister now, as you rightly pointed out, has 10 seconds remaining to answer the primary question before you get the opportunity for your supplementary questions.

                Co. themselves have agreed that, when they find a pit that needs to be augmented—as you are now familiar with that phrase, Senator—they will actually bring in experts who are specialists in handling asbestos.

               <p>
                So, in NBN Co.'s work, that is continuing. They are not using their existing workforce; they are ensuring that they are all adequately trained to meet all the standards that were set out. In terms of whether there has been any rescheduling of handovers, I think I have usually described it as Telstra are about six months, on average—that is an average figure—ahead of the point where NBN Co. come in and start connecting people's houses. I do not have any information at all on that. I am happy to take on notice to see if there is any information that is available, but I have not been—

                  The working party has had a number of meetings. It is being chaired by Mr Shorten, and I do not have an up-to-date brief. A number of agreements were reached when we held the first meeting, including that everyone would be adequately trained, and there was a discussion about what the appropriate level was, depending on what sort of work there was.

                  At least you were present when Mr Quigley stated that they took it very seriously from the day they engaged in this with Telstra.

But there is an agreement and a process that is going on at the moment in that working group.
