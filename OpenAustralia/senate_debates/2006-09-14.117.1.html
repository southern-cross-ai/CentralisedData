        My question is also addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and it relates to the deteriorating situation in Darfur. I ask the minister: what efforts are being made by the Australian government in the form of contributions to the peacekeeping effort, both currently and in future? What support will the government provide, say, in terms of funding, technical assistance or troop deployments? I acknowledge the government’s provision of more than $40 million already in humanitarian assistance, but I ask whether the minister is aware of recent reports that suggest that this funding may provide little assistance if peacekeeping efforts cannot be reorganised and strengthened so that that money can be used.

         I thank Senator Stott Despoja for the question. There is no doubt that we all watch with great dismay the very serious matters in Darfur.

         just say on behalf of the government as a starting point—I will go through what the government is doing in relation to this matter—that we welcome the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
          UN
         </a>
         Security Council’s resolution 1706 of 31 August, last month, calling for the transition of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Union_Mission_in_Sudan" rel="nofollow">
          African Union Mission in Sudan
         </a>
         , or
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMIS" rel="nofollow">
          AMIS
         </a>
         , to a UN force by no later than 31 December 2006. So at least we do have a focus on how we might assist more effectively in getting a handle on this terrible problem. We reject the government of Sudan’s demand that AMIS troops withdraw from Darfur and that they not be supported by the UN and we call, as a government, on the government of Sudan to accept the UN peacekeepers in Darfur. We call on the international community to continue to urge the government of Sudan to accept the transition of AMIS to a UN force. The government is very concerned by reports that Sudanese government forces are involved in bombing villages in north Darfur and that the entire Darfur humanitarian operation, to which Senator Stott Despoja alludes—and hundreds of thousands of more lives—are at risk.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since the signing of the peace agreement on 5 May 2006, attacks against humanitarian workers have persisted while access for humanitarian operations is at its lowest since the conflict began in 2003. So I will say in response to Senator Stott Despoja that we have translated our concerns over Darfur into action. Since May 2004, the Australian government has provided $52.6 million in humanitarian assistance to Sudan, mostly to Darfur, including the announcement just on 1 September of another $5 million for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Food_Program" rel="nofollow">
          World Food Program
         </a>
         in Darfur and a further $510,000 for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AUSTCARE" rel="nofollow">
          AUSTCARE
         </a>
         in both Darfur and southern Sudan. It seems to the government that, with the current state of affairs and with the aid we have given, it is premature for us to be commenting on a possible Australian contribution in Darfur. We would have to assess any formal request against our existing contribution in Sudan and our extensive commitments elsewhere. Having said all that, I can assure Senator Stott Despoja that this government takes a very close interest in the unfolding events, and we will do whatever we can to work with all the agencies to ensure that the humanitarian effort—we are making a very extensive humanitarian effort—meets the targets and meets the needs.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for her answer. I understand from her latter remark that the government is not necessarily ruling out a contribution in the form of peacekeeping. I will ask the minister to refer that to the Minister for Foreign Affairs for a specific response. I also ask the minister: what diplomatic efforts has the Australian government engaged in in recent times, in this year alone, in relation to the deteriorating situation in Darfur?

           I thank Senator Stott Despoja for her supplementary question. Obviously, we are working very closely with all agencies in relation to the deployment of our aid and in relation to the situation as it unfolds in Darfur. I can also confirm that we have 10
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
            AFP
           </a>
           officers on the ground there working with the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
            United Nations
           </a>
           . So we have made that additional contribution in personnel to the efforts there on the ground. As I have said—and I repeat—any further deployment would need to be considered in the context of our extensive commitments elsewhere and the existing contribution we have made in Sudan.
