          The Rudd Labor government is absolutely committed to strong border protection measures: we have been consistent in applying the excision of offshore islands; we have increased provisions for border patrols, we have 25 per cent more border patrols occurring than under the previous government, and we have invested $650-odd million in extra funding for border protection measures in the last budget. As a result, we are able to intercept any unauthorised boat arrivals, take them to
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island" rel="nofollow">
           Christmas Island
          </a>
          and have them processed under the excise offshore place provisions.
         </p>
         <p>
          That provides us with strong border security measures that then allow us to detain mandatorily, as we have done, all unauthorised boat arrivals, and then to ensure that they have the appropriate health, identity and security checks. Those checks are vigorous; they are designed to protect Australians, to ensure that no-one is released into the Australian community until we are satisfied about their health, security and identity. Those measures that are in place are the same as those that were in place under the previous government, except that the border patrol measures have been enhanced. We have more border protection patrolling than under the previous government.
         </p>
         <p>
          Yes, we do maintain strong border security and strong control over our borders so we can identify who seeks to come into this country—either authorised or unauthorised—and maintain the integrity of our migration system.

           Will the minister now concede that it is not the so-called ‘push factors’ that are actively encouraging people smuggling to Australia; it is the fact that the pull factor is practised by the Rudd government?

           <p>
            From the outset, I make the point that push factors are responsible for the increased movement of people throughout the world. We see increased arrivals in Australia consistent with the increased arrivals in many other Western nations. I understand that Greece has had 15,000 arrivals in the first six months of the year, which doubles the number they received last year.
           </p>
           <p>
            We have seen a large number of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka" rel="nofollow">
             Sri Lanka
            </a>
            ns on the move. They have been fleeing to
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Europe" rel="nofollow">
             Western Europe
            </a>
            , to Canada and to Australia. We get our share, although it is still a small proportion, of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankans" rel="nofollow">
             Sri Lankans
            </a>
            seeking asylum in the world. The particular gentleman referred to was on
            <i>
             Lateline
            </i>
            . I had dinner with Pal in Sri Lanka a couple of months ago. He is a former serving official of our
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" rel="nofollow">
             Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
            </a>
            , so he obviously has a very fond view of Australia. He made the point that Australia is a very attractive destination, and that is right. All the western democracies are attractive destinations for people seeking safety.

              Again, this is a point of order which has been taken and which provides a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ response request by the opposition. The minister is answering the question and he is being directly relevant to the question. When you require a yes or no answer, I think it misplaces where the question is and where the answer should be. The opposition already know, in fact, from their own position what they want the response to be. They may not like the response by the minister in this respect, but the minister is being relevant in answering the question. To use that device is, in my view, not a point of order at all.

               I believe the minister is answering the question. I cannot instruct the minister how to answer the question, nor can I make the minister respond in a particularly desired way that the questioner may have. I draw the minister’s attention to the fact that if he has further to add, he has five seconds remaining.
