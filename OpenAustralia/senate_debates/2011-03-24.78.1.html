        My question is to the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator Carr. My question relates to the situation at the Fukushima nuclear power complex in Japan, including reports that radioactive iodine, at levels unsafe for consumption by infants and pregnant mothers, has been detected in Tokyo’s water supply. Has the minister been briefed by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSTO" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        ,

        or any other relevant agency on the disaster and will the minister table any such briefings?

         I thank Senator Ludlam for his question. I have been kept up to date with advice from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSTO" rel="nofollow">
          ANSTO
         </a>
         . I have not received advice from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
          CSIRO
         </a>
         and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANSA" rel="nofollow">
          ARPANSA
         </a>
         reports to another minister. That is fitting because the agency within the innovation portfolio with the relevant nuclear expertise is ANSTO. It provides the specialist expert advice to the government as a whole. This advice is provided through an interdepartmental emergency task force chaired by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
         </a>
         . There are detailed briefings made public on these issues, particularly in regard to the current situation, and I understand they have been available on the ARPANSA website.

         Regarding the levels of iodine 131 that are exceeding the Japanese government-set levels, there have been detections of iodine 131 in water, milk and spinach collected outside of the 30-kilometre exclusion zone. However, the levels measured are said, according to the advice I have, to pose no immediate threat to human health and will diminish rapidly due to the short half-life of iodine 131. This is obviously a matter that is being continuously monitored and, according to the advice I have been provided, the Japanese government has taken appropriate actions, such as banning the shipment of certain foodstuffs. The levels of radioactivity that have been reported have been detected in seawater in one location near a discharge channel—

          I thank the minister for the answer and I ask a supplementary question. For the agencies that the minister does have portfolio responsibility for, what is the policy on agency spokespeople commenting to the media or the general public, and has the minister instructed these agencies not to comment on the radiation impacts of the disaster?

           I can indicate that the whole-of-government response to these matters is being dealt with through
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANSA" rel="nofollow">
            ARPANSA
           </a>
           . I have not directed any agency not to comment on these matters. I am advised that ARPANSA has been acting as a regulator and has been providing technical advice to the government, and it has not sought to make running commentary to the media. It has been working through an interdepartmental committee which has been advising the government.

             I do not have to take that on notice. I have a note here from the relevant minister indicating that
