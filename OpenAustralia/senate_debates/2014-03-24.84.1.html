        My question is to the Minister for Employment and the Minister representing the Minister for Agriculture, Senator Abetz. I ask: can the minister advise the Senate how the government's improved trade relations with Indonesia, Egypt and other nations have strengthened the live cattle export trade for my home state of

         I thank Senator Back for his question, and acknowledge his longstanding interest in ensuring that Australia has a sustainable livestock export trade that increases the economic returns to our farmers and exporters for the long term, and especially his interest in this regard for his home state of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         The value of the livestock export trade is increasing. Last year, after Labor's debacle, we were able to increase the quota for an additional 75,000 Australian live cattle. The government is committed to building on this progress. I am also pleased to inform the Senate that the government has reopened the live cattle export trade between Australia and Egypt. This follows our announcement in February that the trade of live cattle and sheep with Bahrain will also recommence. Bahrain has historically been an important market for Australian live sheep exports. Prior to the suspension of the trade in 2011, Bahrain imported 400,000 Australian sheep and 2,500 Australian cattle. These agreements will collectively sustain the jobs of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         sheep producers who provide the vast majority of live sheep for export. During the seven years of the former Greens-Labor government, not one live sheep was exported from Australia to Egypt. Labor's reckless ban of live cattle exports to Indonesia, in a knee-jerk reaction to a

         report, really did untold damage to our reputation to our nearest Asian neighbour. Indeed, the Indonesian market accounts for more than 62 per cent of Australian live cattle exports, on which so many of our Indigenous-run cattle stations rely. And so this is not only for the white farmers, but also for our Indigenousâ€”

           , we welcome the increase in the live cattle export trade, because it will sustain a significant number of the 370,000 jobs in agriculture and create many more jobs for farmers, primary producers, exporters and, as I have already said, in Indigenous communities. In particular, these agreements will secure the growing number of jobs in the 96 Indigenous-owned pastoral leases across
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            Western Australia

           , Queensland and the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
            Northern Territory
           </a>
           . The 14,000 Indigenous people living on or near these pastoral leases stand to significantly gain from the coalition government's success in boosting the live cattle export trade since coming to office. The government is committed to promoting jobs growth in Western Australia's live cattle export industry by opening up even more avenues for trade and investment.
