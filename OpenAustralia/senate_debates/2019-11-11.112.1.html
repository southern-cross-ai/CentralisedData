           Australia needs to develop more gas to help bring down energy prices for Australian families and to support jobs. The Beetaloo Basin has the potential to be a world-class gas province. Some estimates say that around 6,500 full-time jobs could be created, including jobs for
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
            Indigenous Australians
           </a>
           . The Australian government expects all gas producers to engage with the traditional owners, and they must achieve consent where required under native title laws. By rigidly opposing the Beetaloo Basin development, the Greens are denying Indigenous people their right to choose and are consigning Australian families to higher living costs and fewer jobs.

              Labor won't be supporting this motion. We believe that proper process must be followed when it comes to mining and gas exploration. We acknowledge calls from traditional owners and believe that they should be heard and respected, but motion after motion from the Greens in the Senate is not how projects are, or should be, determined. Labor believes science, consultation and proper process should be at the heart of decision-making.

               I thank the chamber. A month ago, fracking for gas began in the Beetaloo Basin in the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
                Northern Territory
               </a>
               against the wishes of local traditional owners, local farmers and pastoralists. This motion calls on the government to listen to traditional owners and landowners in the Beetaloo, who are terrified about the impact of fracking on their water resources. Uncle Ray Dixon, who is a Mudburra elder, has pleaded with
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_Energy" rel="nofollow">
                Origin Energy
               </a>
               to stop fracking and protect water. Northern Territory pastoralists are so concerned about access and environmental impacts that the owner of Amunjee Munjee Station has commenced legal action challenging the fracking plans. Fracking the Beetaloo threatens water resources and would unleash a carbon bomb that would undermine any prospect of Australia's meeting its international climate responsibilities, yet neither the climate impacts nor the water impacts of this fracking are even considered by our national environmental laws. This motion calls on the government to respect traditional owners, to listen to them; to support my bill to ban fracking; and to fix our environmental laws.
