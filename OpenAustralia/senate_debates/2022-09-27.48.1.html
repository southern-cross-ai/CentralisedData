         I welcome the opportunity to talk about the Albanese government's plan to fix the budget and to deliver on our promises. We have made it clear, and we made it clear during the election campaign, that our focus would be on multinational tax reform. We outlined that in our plan for a better budget. We were clear about the revenue this would return. We were also clear about the savings that we would seek to put in place to fix the budget that you broke. That is clear in our—what would we call it?—'Better budget, better economy: Labor's plan for a better future.' This is the plan that got endorsed.

            There was so much disorder then. I think the minister was, apart from one interjection. I remind senators once again that interjections are disorderly and that comments need to be directed to the chair. Please continue, Minister.

             Thank you, President, I was just getting started. We will not be lectured—when you lot were in government you were the highest taxing and highest spending government in history. And here you are trying to lecture us about it. We've been clear about what our plan is. Our focus is on multinational tax reform. You could also support our approach to reduce taxes on electric vehicles. We actually want to lower taxes.

               President, I have a point of order on relevance. Senator Cash's question was very clear, asking about tax increases or new taxes on Australians. It wasn't about multinationals; it was about taxes on Australians.

                    Of course I will follow that ruling. We won't be lectured by those opposite about taxing when their record on taxing was as the highest taxing government. We are doing the responsible thing. We will be implementing the commitments we took to the election.

                       This budget will be our opportunity to implement the commitments we took to the election. As I have been clear, we are implementing the policies that we took—remember those? We've got them. We've got the policies. The October budget is partly to implement our election commitments and the other part of the October budget—sorry, through you, President—is to deal with the waste and rorts that you guys buried in the budget as a payoff to colleagues when you were—

                          I think I've answered the question. You're right, President, I was asked about what will be in the budget. It will be a combination of policies we took to the election. The first stage of the waste and rorts work that I've been doing cleaning up the mess—the billions of dollars in the budget that you buried for political convenience. That's what this budget will be about.

                               I rise on a point of order: relevance. The question was actually about the government, not the opposition, and whether or not Australian families will receive the promised $275. I would ask you to direct the minister to the question.
