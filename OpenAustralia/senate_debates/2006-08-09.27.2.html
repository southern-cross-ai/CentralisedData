        My question is to Senator Ian Campbell, Minister for the Environment and Heritage. Isn’t the sole basis of the minister’s defence of his
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bald_Hills" rel="nofollow">
         Bald Hills
        </a>
        decision a single sentence from the Biosis report, that ‘almost any negative impact on the species could be sufficient to tip the balance’ against the orange-bellied parrot? Did the minister even bother to read the next sentence in the report, which says, in relation to blocking wind farms:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        ... such actions will have extremely limited beneficial value to conservation of the parrot without addressing very much greater adverse effects ... currently operating against it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Doesn’t that sentence completely destroy the minister’s defence of this blatantly political decision? Can the minister tell the chamber why he has failed to tell the whole truth and, instead, has selectively quoted words to justify his political decision to veto Bald Hills?

         I am happy to respond to, I think, a very sensible question from Senator Wong. It goes to two issues. Firstly: did I read the report? In fact, I read the whole report. I read all of the advice and thoroughly understood it. Having listened to what Senator Wong read into the record, it reinforces the case that a whole range of actions need to take place if Australia as a country is going to save this endangered species. In fact, if you go to the Victorian government’s website, there is one thing that you will find and one thing that you will not find. Firstly, you will not find a copy of the report that they had before Minister Hulls—

            saying that the impact on this bird was potentially catastrophic. It was exactly the same advice, but Mr Hulls has refused to make that available to the Australian people. He continues to hide that from the Australian people because he does not want the people to see the scientific advice that was before him. What the Labor Party is saying is that, when a Labor Party minister makes a decision to stop a wind farm in a Labor electorate, it is based on science, but if I make a decision it is political. I refer the senator to someone who did in fact play politics with the

            wind farm, and that is a now retired, or defeated, member of parliament:

               ’s private member’s bill, which I presume, if it had got to the Senate, Senator Evans and Senator Wong would have voted for. This bill would have ensured the very big subsidies that the federal government provides to wind power. I remind the Senate that this is a government that has supplied $3 billion worth of subsidies to produce 600 wind turbines. This government is, in fact, the best friend the wind energy industry has ever had. But Christian Zahra, a member of the Labor Party, made it very clear to his constituents—

                , I rise on a point of order going to relevance. It is very interesting hearing about the minister’s interest in someone who was once in the parliament, but the question was a very specific one, about one sentence in the Biosis report that the minister has conveniently edited from all of his answers in defence. It was a very specific question. The minister has made very little, if any, attempt to address the issue in the question. I ask you to remind him of relevance.

Furthermore, she says that I deleted one aspect from my defence.

                     , I rise on a point of order going to relevance. It goes to the minister answering questions that are directed to him about his responsibilities. While he may be interested in Victoria—he may want to move to Victoria; he may want to have a personal relationship with Mr Hulls—the point is he is here as the responsible minister to answer for his decisions. He is making no attempt to answer and defend those decisions.

                      I hear your points of order. We have had three points of order, which will mean that the opposition gets fewer questions today. Senator Campbell, I would remind you of the question and remind you also that you have a minute and a half to complete your answer.

                       I was talking about the fact that

                        Christian Zahra

                       had reminded his constituents that there were very big subsidies paid by the federal government—and I am quoting from his brochure—to wind power generators and his bill would ensure that those subsidies would only go to those wind developments built in areas where the local community supports them. Without the federal government subsidies, these developments would not be economically viable. Christian Zahra was quite right on that.

The minister was asked a question about the Biosis report and he is answering in relation to something completely different—a petition. How on earth can that possibly be relevant? I understand the minister does not want to answer the question because he has no answer.

                                    On the point of order, I think everybody would have heard, if they could hear over the noise in the chamber, that the minister did answer the second part of the question. He has 24 seconds left to complete his answer to that supplementary question. I remind all senators that interjections across the chamber are disorderly. Today has been rather noisy and I hope that you will cease making these interjections across the chamber.
