         by leave—The government does not support this motion, because what it represents is outsourcing to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          Productivity Commission
         </a>
         the development of a range of completely different policies. The government was elected to implement a cap-and-trade emissions trading scheme. I would note that the members of the opposition were also elected to implement a cap-and-trade emissions scheme. It has taken us over a decade of debate and analysis to get to this point. We have already done the work to know that this is the best way for Australia to tackle climate change. To do what Senator Xenophon is proposing would be to go right back to the drawing board and junk all the work that has already been done and the commitments we were elected to implement. On those bases, the government cannot support the motion.

          by leave—In the interests of gaining information, we are not going to stand in the way of this motion. However, I note that, if given effect, it would call on the government to make a reference to the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
           Productivity Commission
          </a>
          requiring modelling of alternative emissions on a big range of things. We do not have before us information which would indicate that the Productivity Commission can do that modelling, let alone whether it should do it. We had that reservation about the matter. It would have been helpful to have the Senate informed as to the wherewithal of the Productivity Commission (a) to do this modelling and whether it is the best place to do it and (b) whether it could do it within the time that is being allocated.
