        This week in parliament is likely to go down as an historic one, as a great leap forward for housing in our country, if we pass the HAFF bills. The Albanese government will deliver the single-biggest investment in social and affordable housing in more than a decade. We hope to have the support in this chamber to pass the bills this week, and it will make a fundamental difference. One of the critical points here is not just the significant investment from the federal government; it is also the consultation and collaboration with the states in looking at what is needed on the ground in each and every state to see how we can genuinely deliver relief from the housing crisis, a housing crisis created in significant part by those opposite doing nothing for nine whole years.

        There's one project that I'm particularly delighted to see come on board in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        —that is, the Prospect Corner development. It will include 55 per cent affordable housing. Fifty-five per cent is going to make a fundamental difference in South Australia. More than half of the 180 new homes are going to be built on 2.36 hectares in a master plan site. This site won't just have housing; it will have playgrounds, transport—you name it. It's going to be spectacular and it's going to make a fundamental difference. It is a priority project and it's going to help young families, single parents and key workers to enter the market and ease the pressure that we have on supply. We are creating more homes for those who need them when they need them and where they need them.
