         </a>
         's (ADF) contribution to the international coalition against terrorism and covers Afghanistan and the Middle East Area of Operation (MEAO). In addition to Operation Slipper the Government has approved a range of Force Protection measures to provide direct protection for Australian Defence Force members from small-arms, improvised explosive devices and indirect fire. The table below
         <i>
          (available from the Senate Table Office)

         (2)
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
          The Government
         </a>
         has agreed funding for Operation Slipper (Afghanistan and the Middle East Area of Operation) of $1,221.8 million in 2011-12 Budget, and in the forward estimates $299.6 million in 2012-13 and $139.2 million in 2013-14 (as published in Table 13 of the
         <i>
          Portfolio Budget Statements 2011-12
         </i>
         ). This covers an Australian Defence Force personnel commitment to 30 June 2012 with funding provided in the forward estimates for costs associated with return of equipment to Australian and its remediation and a contribution to the Afghan National Army Trust Fund. Any ADF personnel commitment beyond 30 June 2012 will be considered by Government in its consideration of the 2012-13 Defence Budget Submission.
