        My question is to Senator Ronaldson, the Minister representing the Minister for Industry. The Prime Minister has said he wants to protect and create jobs, yet some 200,000 Australians who rely on the automotive industry are still waiting to see if he will save their jobs. Given that the rise in the value of the Australian dollar has increased costs by 30 per cent and given the fact that the timetable for investment decisions by

         Ultimately, the decision about who asked questions about what probably lies with the Manager of Opposition Business. I find it quite remarkable that a former industry minister has used his first opportunity to ask a question which at best is crocodile tears dripping with insincerity: 'This minister should be acutely aware of the state of the automotive industry in this country. Under his watch, we have seen quite dramatic declines in automotive workers in this country.'
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to place on record the Minister for Industry's comments in relation to this issue, and then I will talk about some other matters. As the minister has quite clearly said, the industry is facing significant short- and medium-term challenges as it adjusts to the high value of the Australian dollar, a highly competitive market and the policies and regulations introduced by the former government. The minister has also made it quite clear that—and again I will repeat the minister's comments—'Australia needs a sustainable car manufacturing industry as it produces $5.4 billion of industry value-added, invests nearly $695 million in research and development and generates $3.7 billion in export income a year.' Just for the interest of the Senate—and again I am utterly amazed with the tone of the question asked by the former industry minister—in 2012 the three local vehicle manufacturers—

          , I ask a supplementary question. I note the minister's answer. I simply ask: how can this government be prepared to spend $5.5 billion on a rolled gold paid parental leave scheme, yet is ripping $500 million from the automotive industry, which attracts direct foreign investment at a rate of $9 for every $1 of government co-investment?

           Sensibly, the senator got off the crocodile tears and tried another tack. I note with some interest that automotive industry employment averaged 45,007 in the four quarters up to August 2013 down from 50,376 in the same period in 2012. I also note with some interest the appalling MPI—another example of crocodile tears dripping with insincerity—that the former minister will be speaking to this afternoon. He refers to the urgency of the crisis. I just wonder what the former industry minister can say about his decision to change fringe benefits arrangements for the automotive—
