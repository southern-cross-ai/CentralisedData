         The government will be opposing these amendments. They are still before a Senate committee, and we look forward to dealing with them under the closing loopholes legislation that we'll be dealing with later this year or early next year.

          The opposition will also be opposing these amendments. Whilst we understand the intent of Senator Tyrrell in putting forward these particular amendments, we haven't had the opportunity to look at them. As the government has put in its comments, they are still before a committee.
