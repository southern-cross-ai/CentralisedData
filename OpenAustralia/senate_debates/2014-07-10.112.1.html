        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Abetz. I refer to his statement following the Senate's rejection of the carbon price repeal bills today in which he confirmed the government was, 'willing to support amendments circulated by the Senate Leader of the Palmer United Party'. Can the minister please advise the Senate which of the three sets of amendments circulated by the Palmer United Party represent Abbott government policy and will the carbon price reduction obligation apply to all businesses in the domestic economy or not?

         Let us get one thing very clear: this is Palmer United policy which they submitted to the Senate. As I understand it, the Palmer United Party are proposing that ultimately their third version of amendments should be the amendments they would seek to put to the Senate. They were unable to do so because of a technical situation as a result—

           The Leader of the Palmer United Party in the Senate told the Senate that it was on the advice of the Clerk that he had withdrawn his amendments. So let us be very clear, there is no concern here. The amendments need to be introduced in the House of Representatives before they can come to this place and, as a result, that is what the government will be seeking to facilitate next week, to ensure the repeal of the carbon tax. The Labor Party interjectors told the Australian people we would never have a carbon tax, then went to the last election with this brochure here, saying that the carbon tax had already been removed, and they are still voting to keep the carbon tax on life support. We had a technical issue today. We look forward to working with the crossbenchers next week to achieve our common goal of removing the carbon tax.
