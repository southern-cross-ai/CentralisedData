        <p>
         The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         During the period 1 July to 31 December 2010 Navy met its obligations to designated operations and other short term directed tasking. Navy is not required to and does not prepare all fleet units to the same operational level of readiness. To do so would be unnecessary, inefficient and costly. The preparedness of fleet units is maintained at an appropriate level to meet strategic guidance and ensure effective training throughput.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Those fleet units held at higher readiness for short notice operational roles are appropriately manned, equipped and trained for the tasks that they might have to perform. Fleet units at other stages of the continuum will also be crewed in a manner that is best suited to their assigned tasking. This might mean the reduction in certain trained/skilled positions filled in order to make way for additional trainees. Fleet units invariably go to sea with all available accommodation filled.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         To meet and sustain operational, exercise, preparedness and training requirements, fleet units are operated in a cycle of scheduled maintenance, training and operational availability. Planned major maintenance activity periods are a routine element of the operational cycle.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Major Surface Combatants and Amphibious Ships:
