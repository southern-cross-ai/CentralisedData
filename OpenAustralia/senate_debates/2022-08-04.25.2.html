          I'm all over it! Thank you, Senator McKim—always got my back! I need to amend the amendment that I have circulated. Apologies for this. It's just a last-minute request from the opposition. I move the amendment as amended:

           Whilst I thank the government for the small extension of time for reporting on the inquiry on the cashless debit card bill, I want to put on the record how disappointed the opposition is in relation to the amount of time that has been made available to review and consider these bills in committee. I think it disrespects the important work of the Senate.
          </p>
          <p>
           I also think the disrespect that the Labor Party has shown by not consulting with the very people that this measure is going to impact is extraordinarily insulting to them. Communities in the trial sites of the Goldfields, the Kimberley,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hervey_Bay" rel="nofollow">
            Hervey Bay
           </a>
           , Bundaberg and Ceduna actually asked for this particular measure to be put in place. The government are seeking to remove this measure without even bothering to consult with them, and now they want to rush this legislation through this place. I think this is absolutely unbelievable; that this appalling decision does not even go to back to the communities that have asked for it. I would draw the attention of the chamber to the fact that in my home state of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            South Australia
           </a>
           , in Ceduna, the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDC" rel="nofollow">
            CDC
           </a>
           was actually put in place in response to a coronial inquest into the tragic deaths of a number of people on the west coast. It was a recommendation of the coroner's report into those deaths, and it was something that that community asked for.
          </p>
          <p>
           In other sites that previously had the clunky, outdated BasicsCard, the government is now going to deny participants in those communities the ability to access the new technology the cashless debit card offers them. They do not intend to remove income management. In answer to a question asked of him last week, Minister Farrell said that income management was not going to be taken out of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
            Northern Territory
           </a>
           . They want to send those people back to having the clunky old BasicsCard instead of providing them with the advanced technology of the cashless debit card. In doing so, they will also deny the Traditional Credit Union in the Northern Territory the opportunity to support many of their members in using this particular new form of technology.

What was the research that underpinned this decision, and where is the research to show what impact the withdrawal of this particular mechanism is going to have on those communities? We don't know what advice has been taken to underpin this decision. We have all these unanswered questions, and this Senate wants to give us four weeks to go and ask those people at the coalface—those people who are impacted by this card, those communities who are impacted by this card, the communities who asked for this card in the first place.

                   At the same time, those opposite intend to keep income management in place in some communities but not in others. We do not understand the rationale behind keeping people in the Northern Territory on income management when people in other communities are not going to be kept on income management. We do not understand the difference. This is a really important piece of inquiry that I think Australians need to understand. In particular, we need to respect the views and ideas of people in the communities where this card is currently in place. We need to understand what they want and how they want it to be implemented. We need to understand the impact of removing this card without any thought whatsoever, without any consultation. There was no consultation with these communities before the announcement that the card was going to be removed. I think we owe respect to this chamber for review, and we owe respect to those communities to consult with them.

                    We are not going to be lectured about consultation by the former government. They provided zero consultation to the people of Bundaberg and
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hervey_Bay" rel="nofollow">
                     Hervey Bay
                    </a>
                    . I know that because I've been there multiple times. They imposed this from on high through their local member, Mr Pitt. No consultation was taken with that community before this was imposed on them. I went there and did forums in Hervey Bay and Bundaberg. I took the then shadow minister,
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Burney" rel="nofollow">
                     Linda Burney
                    </a>
                    . We consulted with those people on the ground whom this government ignored. The local member, the member for Hinkler, Mr Pitt, wouldn't even meet with constituents who raised issues about this; that's how arrogant he was. For this opposition to come in here and try to lecture us about consulting is completely outrageous.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    This is something on which we consulted in opposition over many years. The shadow minister travelled to many communities so that we could listen to evidence on the ground. That's what a good opposition does to actually learn the lessons and hear from people directly. We formed our view about this policy over that period of opposition—before we said that we would actually go to the election and say that we would end the cashless debit card. We consulted widely. We were productive in how we used our time in opposition, and we took a policy to the election that the Australian people voted for. So we're not going to get lectured by the opposition about how we do it.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    We know that the committee has enough time to provide a report so that this legislation, which has already passed the House of Representatives, can get debated in this place and, ultimately, I hope, lead to the removal of the cashless debit card and the impact it has had on communities. The trauma and the stigma that this has caused people who have been forced onto this card, and the way that they have been treated in these communities, is not acceptable. It's not something that this current government stands for. We absolutely urge the Senate, when the vote comes, to remove the cashless debit card.

                     That report has been circulated in my name in the chamber. For the benefit of colleagues in the chamber, this amendment, if it were accepted by the chamber, would refer the Australian Human Rights Commission Legislation Amendment (Selection and Appointment) Bill 2022 to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for an inquiry and report by 31 August 2022. I know that my colleague Senator Shoebridge would like to make a contribution to the debate. I just offer that to senators as perhaps some courtesy in terms of taking up the time of this chamber. I won't be taking my full five minutes, because I would like the chamber to be able to hear from Senator Shoebridge on that matter and also, briefly, Senator Rice on the matter of the cashless debit card.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     But, briefly, the Human Rights Commission legislation amendment bill is really critical legislation. I note that Senator Shoebridge has articulated very well, publicly, the need for an
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBTIQ" rel="nofollow">
                      LGBTIQ
                     </a>
                     + commissioner on the Human Rights Commission. This is a gaping hole in the structures of the commission, and it should be filled. Senator Shoebridge has quite rightly identified an opportunity to make that happen. I think it's really critical that we hear from the LGBTIQ+ community through the mechanism of a Senate inquiry so their concerns can be heard and their deeply held and genuine wishes for an LGBTIQ+ commissioner on the Human Rights Commission can be understood by the government, by the Senate and, ultimately, by the whole parliament. I repeat the Greens' request for these questions to be put separately, and I move my amendment to the minister's amendment.

                       I rise to express my utmost, absolute disappointment at this government's ham-fisted approach to attempt to smash the cashless debit card—income management that, I will remind the government, was an initiative of the Gillard government, to begin with. To attempt to now call this racist is utterly ridiculous, because
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_Macklin" rel="nofollow">
                        Jenny Macklin
                       </a>
                       as the previous minister defended it and did not call it racist at all but a measure that needed to be put in place.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Talk about consulting at the grassroots level! As a Warlpiri women who is engaged with people from remote communities—out of sight, out of mind—with people who don't speak English as a first language—not that this government seems to care at all for these individuals, because they are out of sight and out of mind and don't have access to media, don't have the ability to articulate, so they can be easily ignored—I find it very distressing.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       As part of a research group in 2001 when it all began, income management, I was part of investigating, speaking to, income management recipients in the first trial of income management—rolled out, again, by the Labor Gillard government. The purpose of the investigation was to seek the views of the recipients on the program. And, I can tell you, speaking directly to Indigenous women, they said that this was very helpful for their lives. I spoke to one woman who stated that she was able to stop drinking and stop gambling and feed her children, and she could say no to family members who were demanding access to her income, as a result. I spoke to a non-Indigenous woman who said she was able to halt her addiction to methamphetamines and to, then, regain custody of her child and ensure that her child could go to school.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       These are the people I speak to every single day. I've been fielding calls in my office every day, since this is what the Labor government proposed, who are deeply concerned. I had an Indigenous man call me from

I think it's disgusting. This government is going to ensure that addicts have complete access, can take away the income, that they can smash the human rights of these vulnerable people in those communities. You have absolutely no idea. Not only this, but you're changing your minds on this particular issue.

                       —yourself, President—called the basics card racist. Again, it was when your own minister defended it and did not call it racist. Now this government is trying to say that only Territorians will be subject to income management. So it's alright for blackfellas in the Territory but for nobody else in the country! This is creating two classes of people in this nation. We as the coalition decided that it would be for all Australians, equally. Let's not forget, income management and social security is a temporary measure for people to get back on their own two feet. Ultimately, we want people to have jobs so they can stand on their own two feet and use their income as they wish.

                       it's fifty-fifty. You have 50 per cent cash. So those who are addicts, yes, they can go ahead and buy alcohol, if that's what they want to use it for. They can deny their children a feed. They can do that. The other 50 per cent is quarantined, so maybe they can cover their bills.

                       I suggest that you get out to some of these remote communities, where people—who are out of sight, out of mind to you—can't clearly articulate to you, because English is not their first language, and stop toeing the ideological line. I will bring to these chambers, over and over again, the messages from those who are continually calling my office, absolutely distressed, about their loved ones whose welfare payments are being stripped from them as we speak. You are leaving them vulnerable and open.

                        I rise to speak in support of the amendment moved by my colleague Senator McKim to refer the

                        and Appointment) Bill 2022 to committee for inquiry over the short recess between the end of this sitting week and when we return. It looks very much like a stitch-up has happened between the opposition and the Labor government to prevent stakeholders having the ability to engage with an inquiry over the next fortnight to improve the government's bill. Let's be clear: the government's bill does little more than suggest there needs to be a newspaper advertisement when there's a new appointment proposed for the Australian Human Rights Commission. You don't need legislation, last time I checked, to put an ad in the paper, but it is useful. We don't oppose the bill; indeed, we support the bill. It's useful to have an ad in the paper, at least! We know that the previous government did; they just appointed their mates quietly without any due process. So, yes, we support legislation that requires an ad to go into the paper.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        But this government has said in moving this legislation that it's implementing the Paris principles. That is so far from the truth that it is close to embarrassing. Australia's human rights commission is at risk of being downgraded from class A to class B, going below the human rights framework of Iraq. That is because of the action of the previous government but also because of the structural inadequacies in our human rights framework.

                        has made about the way in which appointments happen and the nature of appointments to the Australian Human Rights Commission. And all this government does in response is say, 'We're going to have a newspaper ad, going forward.' We've heard from a series of stakeholders that they want this legislation to go further. They want to implement the Paris principles.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        One of the key lacks in our human rights framework is the absence of a commissioner representing the
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBTIQ" rel="nofollow">
                         LGBTIQ
                        </a>
                        A+ community. We can't understand why the government is resisting the amendment we circulated to lift the protections for the LGBTIQA+ community and give them what they deserve: someone in their corner, a commissioner who can respond to what have been some quite hateful attacks—some of them driven by the previous government. Those hateful attacks won't necessarily end. The Greens, on behalf of that community, want to see a human rights commissioner who's in their corner, who can hear their concerns, who can respond to their concerns and who can give this government and this parliament direction in how to improve the law and ensure their status is fully protected in our society.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        It looks like one of the first actions the Labor government, with the coalition, will take on human rights is to do a stitch-up and prevent an inquiry from even asking the question and from hearing from stakeholders about the need for that commissioner. That's a pretty poor act from the government in one of its first actions on human rights. We'd ask the government to reconsider voting with the opposition on this and opposing an inquiry, opposing letting stakeholders have their views heard about the establishment of an LGBTIQA+ commissioner, and reconsider, as one of the first actions they'll take in this parliament on human rights, voting with the coalition, given their appalling track record. That's likely what's going to happen here. That's a tragedy for the community, but it's also a really poor indicator for where this government is intending to go over the next three years. I'd urge the Labor government to look closely at Senator McKim's amendment. Don't vote with that mob and shut down the discussion as your first step on human rights.

I appreciate, Senator Shoebridge, you are new; I was giving you some leniency. But, sadly, Senator O'Sullivan, you are not new. So I remind all senators that it is about why these amendments are necessary or not necessary, depending on your point of view.

                          On the matter that is before the Senate, which is the time that we will have to scrutinise and allow public input into the legislation regarding the abolition of the cashless debit card, I think it is absolutely appalling that proper time is not being given to allow the community and, in particular, the communities that are involved in the cashless debit card to give input into this decision that we all need to make in this place. It is an absolute travesty.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          We saw, through the election campaign, many comments from those opposite and from around the country, calling for greater levels of transparency and accountability. Here is the first opportunity for that to be enacted and on display. Yet, sadly, what we're seeing from this government is a ramming-through of this legislation. Granted, they took this decision to the election. The Australian people, of course, did make their decision. But let's look at the particular communities where the cashless debit card is in operation.

                          , Mr Wilson, was very much out there with his support of the cashless debit card. He was re-elected. You look at the member for Grey. He's also someone who's very supportive of the cashless debit card, and Ceduna, in the western part of

                          , is one of the cashless debit card areas. He was re-elected. You look at the north-west of

                          , right up the very top in the East Kimberley, part of the seat of Durack, where Ms Price is the member. She is also someone who is very much on the record in support of the cashless debit card. She was re-elected. So it's really important that we actually hear from these communities where the cashless debit card is in operation.

                            . This is about the amount of time that these communities will have to consider this bill. These are busy people. To just rush this bill through and not allow for proper consideration of this bill is disrespectful to those people, particularly the people that this bill is going to impact the most. We hear a lot about consultation; we hear a lot about the need for it. Well, I know that, since the election—unless something has changed in the last five days since I spoke to people up in the northern Goldfields—no-one from the government, Senator Chisholm, has been in the Goldfields to discuss the cashless debit card and its abolition. Now, this is a real shame. They should be given the full opportunity to put in thorough submissions that will detail very clearly, very accurately, what their views are on the abolition of the cashless debit card.

                            There does seem to be a very ideologically driven approach to this from the government. We know that members of the government, when they were in opposition, called this policy racist. They called this policy racist. So there is an ideologically driven approach to this policy, rather than a focus on what is necessary.
