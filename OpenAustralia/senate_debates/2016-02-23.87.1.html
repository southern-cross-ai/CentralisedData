         I thank Senator Carr for that question. As Senator Carr would be aware, the white paper on the reform of the

          Australian Federation
         </a>
         is a longstanding process that commenced a couple of years ago. At the leaders retreat that was held last July, a number of discussions were held around potential clarification of responsibilities. Following that, in good faith, the Commonwealth and the states—governments of both persuasions—undertook work around potential changes to various constitutional and responsibility arrangements. Following that, papers were prepared by officials and circulated, as in the normal course of events. Those discussions will continue at the coming

           Thank you, Senator Carr. Without getting into the pejorative phrasing you used in the question—because it is simply based on a false premise—I, as you understand, having been sworn in last week am not confidently saying what work might have been undertaken. But, if it was to be a secret, I can tell you this: I would not circulate it via officials to state governments where certain state governments tend to make it land in certain newspapers very quickly. So I am not going to respond to your pejorative language. This is a well-known, public process, where officials have been working on serious matters of reforming the Australian federation that will actually give the electorate and give people a more direct sense of responsibility over who is responsible for what functions and what policy areas.

We will stand up for the Australian taxpayer and for the role of the Commonwealth in the vocational education sector, and, as I have spent the last four days doing, I will spend the next six months cleaning up a lot of the messes you left.
