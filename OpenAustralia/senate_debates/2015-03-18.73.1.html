        My question is to the Acting Leader of the Government in the Senate and the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, Senator Brandis. The cruise industry is the fastest-growing sector of the tourism industry and is currently worth $1 billion a year to the economy. During the summer cruising season, there are severe limitations on berths on the eastern side of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbour_Bridge" rel="nofollow">
         Harbour Bridge
        </a>
        in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Harbour" rel="nofollow">
         Sydney Harbour
        </a>
        , Australia's most popular port and my home town. As a consequence, some cruise lines have stopped sending cruise ships to Australia. My understanding is that the Navy has berths at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Garden Island
        </a>
        that are not always fully utilised. I also understand the tourism industry has been seeking access to Garden Island for cruise liners for five years. Given that the berthing of each cruise ship means an average one million dollars a day for the Sydney economy, does the minister agree it would be in Australia's interests for the tourism industry's needs to be accommodated?

         Thank you very much, Senator Leyonhjelm, for your question, and thank you for the courtesy of the advance notice you gave my office of the question. I do have some information for you.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government is a great supporter of the tourism industry. Cruise ships use a number of berths in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Harbour" rel="nofollow">
          Sydney Harbour
         </a>
         . During the peak season in Sydney, both cruise ships and the Navy increase the demand for berth space at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_Island" rel="nofollow">
          Garden Island
         </a>
         . Access is open to the whole cruise industry, but access is obviously subject to operational support and security requirements, which may change at short notice.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commonwealth" rel="nofollow">
          The Commonwealth
         </a>
         has to ensure that maintenance and operational support assets at Garden Island are funded and utilised as best as possible to deliver the naval capability required by Defence—a proposition with which, Senator Leyonhjelm, I am sure you would agree.
        </p>
        <p>
         The security of Defence facilities is also of significance, and the security situation—as you would well understand, Senator—can change rapidly. The government has agreed to continue the offer of up to three cruise ship visits to Garden Island each season, subject to operational support and security requirements. Seven cruise ship visits to Garden Island were sought by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Authority" rel="nofollow">
          Port Authority
         </a>
         of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         in the January to March 2015 time frame. Of those, only two could not be accommodated for operational reasons; four were withdrawn by the Port Authority; and one was accommodated at a naval buoy.

          <p>
           Yes, Senator. It is, of course, primarily a matter for the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
            New South Wales
           </a>
           government to consider what measures can be taken to ensure that the rapidly-growing cruise industry continues to benefit Sydney. Nevertheless, in the answer I have given to your primary question, I have outlined the way in which Defence accommodates the cruise industry at
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_Island" rel="nofollow">
            Garden Island
           </a>
           .
          </p>
          <p>
           Garden Island is a purpose-built naval base, with the required infrastructure and security built to accommodate the Navy's needs. When all berths are fully operational, they will meet the Navy's requirements for cycling ships between berths dedicated to heavy maintenance and those berths best assigned to operational ships. That constitutes the constraint, which I indicated in my answer to your primary question, on the capacity of the Navy to accommodate the cruise ship industry.

              Garden Island

             by the Navy are to ensure that the berths that are available will meet future fleet infrastructure and security needs. The government will be publishing, later in the year, the Defence white paper. An element of the Defence white paper will deal with the future shape of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Navy" rel="nofollow">
              Australian Navy
             </a>
             in the years and, indeed, the decades to come; and, consequential upon those needs, the facilities at Garden Island—and other naval bases as well—will be appropriately configured. When the Defence white paper is published and, in particular, when its indication of future naval needs is indicated, I will offer you a briefing in relation to the last question.
