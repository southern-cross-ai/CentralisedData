        In June this year the 60th anniversary of the Australian Local Government Women's Association was held with a particularly wonderful celebration at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Old Parliament House
        </a>
        . We had a cocktail party with the Governor-General followed by a dinner. A couple of days before the event I received a phone call from Kaele Way, a woman I had met several times previously in her role as an activist for women in local government and an activist for women generally. I had met her a number of times through the Australian women's secretariat and also the National Rural Women's Coalition. Kaele had rung me to say that she was not very well, that the battle with cancer that she had been raging very strongly for a particularly long time was coming to an end. She was concerned that I would be upset if I saw how ill she was when she came to this event. I think that shows the kind of woman that Kaele Way was. She cared more for others than she did for herself. Tonight I particularly want to pay my respect to this genuinely inspirational woman.
       </p>
       <p>
        I only knew Ms Kaele Way in her role in the local government area and I found out that she was elected to local government in 1997. She spent six years as a councillor in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Whitehorse" rel="nofollow">
         City of Whitehorse
        </a>
        , where she became active in the Australian Local Government Women's Association. She was a founding member of the Women's Participation in Local Government Coalition and a member of their steering committee. She produced a 'gender agenda', a guide for women seeking election in local government in Victoria, a candidate information pack. Kaele believed that it was important for women to have options in their careers and options in moving into local government.
       </p>
       <p>
        She was a passionate advocate for strong, representative local government and she wanted to ensure that many more women had the experience that she had had in that form of government. She understood the need for mentoring. In fact, on a number of the times I met her she talked so effectively about the way that women who had had success would then be able to share so that they could bring other women greater options and greater opportunities.
       </p>
       <p>
        She enjoyed her work representing her community so much, and then she took on a greater role in the various groups that support local government and our com­munity. She served as the Victorian state president of the Australian Local Govern­ment Women's Association from 2002 to 2005. I think largely due to her own passionate advocacy, the branch increased its membership from 13 members to 110 members. In that period she also felt that there was a need to review the national board's constitution. She was vice-president of the national board from 2002 to 2004 and the National President of the Australian Local Government Women's Association from 2004 to 2009. As I have said, she actually understood the importance of effective mentoring and was particularly passionate in this aspect of her support for women's participation. Under her steward­ship as the national president, the importance and the growth of the Australian Local Government Women's Association spread throughout the country. I think one of her proudest moments was when she was made a life member of the ALGWA just before she died.
       </p>
       <p>
        During the 2005 local government election campaign, she conducted her own campaign, which is always very stressful. Naturally she won that clearly. But at the same time she mentored three other women candidates to successful election to office in local government. They understood the work that Kaele had done and they respected the passion that she had for the organisation and the personal support that she gave to each of them.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2007, she was inducted into the Victorian Honour Roll of Women—one of only 20 women to have that honour. In 2008, which was a really important year for Victorian women, she won a Victorian Centenary of Suffrage grant to produce and co-author the article 'Taking up the challenge' in the 2008 candidates' hand­book—again, sharing experience and knowledge and opening the door for other women.
       </p>
       <p>
        She was the chair of the Australian Local Government Women's Association national steering committee for the implementation of the national framework for women in local government and in 2009 was appointed deputy chair of the Victorian regional development Australia committee for the east metro region. This woman just did not know how to say no when there were requests for more help. She saw that by working effectively together there could be better local government, better representation and more clarity for women in these roles. I think one of the proudest moments for Kaele, her family and so many of the women she helped was in 2009 when she was granted an Australian AM for her work for women in local government.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many people were able to talk with Kaele because she made herself available personally and by phone and email to women across our country and, I believe, inter­nationally on the issues of local government mentorship and leadership. When she was asked at one stage to give her opinion on what was the greatest challenge for women that she had encountered in her lifetime, she said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Working environment—acceptance of dual roles of motherhood and career path. Equal opportunity—although it remains an issue in regard to equal pay, career paths, decision making especially on boards.
       </p>
       <p>
        She understood the need for work-life balance, but she knew that women could support other women in their roles and the best possible support was for that sharing to occur.
       </p>
       <p>
        She further advocated in the same interview for work-life balance and said that there was a genuine commitment needed across all organisations. She desperately wanted to see a greater recognition of younger women in their career achievements as well as an acknowledgement of older women's skills and experience and their right to continue in the workplace. She wanted to ensure that women were in decision-making positions, particularly in corporate and political organisations, and that they were able to be represented on all boards and committees across all levels of government—local, state and federal.
       </p>
       <p>
        Kaele was a gracious, passionate advocate for women in local government. Her work in the Australian Local Government Women's Association is legendary and inspirational. When we lost her in early July 2011, my friend Darriea Turley, who is the current national ALGWA president, paid tribute to Kaele and her family and said that all members of the organisation were saddened by Kaele's passing. She went on to say:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Kaele had such a strong work ethic and set a bench mark that we can all only aspire to reach. Kaele was a catalyst for the Australian Local Government Women's Association and her efforts ensured that ALGWA as a national body did have a '
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Way_Forward" rel="nofollow">
         Way Forward
        </a>
        '.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was a great evening when we gathered together at Old Parliament House to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Australian Local Government Women's Association. I think I will always have a memory of Kaele, beautifully dressed and groomed as always, with her partner, Alan. Kaele at that stage was in a wheelchair. She was proudly wearing the AM medal that she got for her work with local government and talking with the Governor-General about why it is important that women have oppor­tunities. I was truly inspired by this gracious lady. I know that her words and work will continue to inspire other women as they make their own choices about levels of representation. I think it is so important that we remember the work of women such as Kaele Way. We acknowledge her work and we acknowledge her family. I particularly want to pay my respects to her family, to Alan and her children, and say thank you to all of them for allowing us to share Kaele Way in as many ways as we possibly can. I know that her words and work will continue to inspire many into the future. Vale Kaele.
