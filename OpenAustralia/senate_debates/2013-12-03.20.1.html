         I thank Senator Ludlam for his question. I know this is an area of great interest to Senator Ludlam, so Senator Ludlam will be aware that the Australian intelligence agencies operate under a regime of parliamentary oversight comprising the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence and Security and the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. They operate under strict statutory obligations under the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
          ASIO
         </a>
         Act and the Intelligence Services Act, and they act under strict executive government oversight—both ministerial oversight and oversight by the independent agency of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government is confident that the Australian national security agencies discharge their statutory obligations and that they act in the interests of Australia and of Australians. The senator will understand that it is not the practice of Australian governments, and this has been the case from time immemorial, to comment on particular security matters.

            Mr President

           —Senator Ludlam, I am no longer a member of that committee. However, you were right in saying that throughout the last parliament I was a member of that committee and, as you would be aware, that committee conducted very extensive hearings on the powers of the national security agencies and one of the issues that was the subject of those hearings was the telecommunications interception and access regime. As the honourable senator would be aware, that report is currently before the government for consideration, as indeed is the ALRC report to which he refers. The government is considering those recommendations and, in the event that the government chooses to adopt some, any or all of them, then that will be a decision indicated in due course.

            , I ask a final supplementary question and we will see if we do any better with this one. Will the Attorney-General assist the Prime Minister to understand what metadata actually is, given he stated yesterday it was simply billing data when in fact metadata reveals mobile and landline phone records, a person's precise location, the source and destination of electronic mail, their entire social network and their web history? Could the Attorney please give an undertaking to remind the Prime Minister of what this term actually means?

            <p>
             I think the honourable senator, if I may say so, assumes too much, because the term 'metadata' is not a term of art; it is a term that means different things to different people. I can tell the honourable senator that, during the parliamentary inquiry to which I referred in my answer to his first supplementary question, a number of witnesses gave different definitions of what they understood to be metadata. I myself, on the basis of having been informed by the evidence of those several witnesses during the last parliament, thought that the Prime Minister's description of metadata as essentially billing details was a perfectly accurate, shorthand description of what is a contestable concept.

               I thank Senator Fawcett for his question. This morning, members of the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
                Australian Federal Police
               </a>
               and the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales_Police_Force" rel="nofollow">
                New South Wales Police Force
               </a>
               arrested two men in Sydney after investigations carried out by the joint counter-terrorism team. The Australian Federal Police indicated this morning that the men will be charged with offences under the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act. That act makes it an offence for an Australian citizen to travel to a foreign state or to assist somebody else to engage in such travel with the intention of engaging in hostile activity or to train another person to engage in hostile activity.
              </p>
              <p>
               As this case will shortly be before the courts, I will not comment on it other than to acquaint the Senate with the fact that it will be alleged that one of the two men arrested, a 39-year-old man, was actively involved in recruiting people to travel to Syria to engage in hostile activities—that is, politically motivated violence—while the other man arrested, a 23-year-old man, was preparing to travel to Sydney to engage in politically motivated violence in the course of the Syrian civil war. Those offences carry a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment.
              </p>
              <p>
               In recent months there has been evidence of a growing number of Australians travelling to Syria to fight in or to assist others to fight in the Syrian civil war. This is a matter of grave concern to the Australian government. Those who consider doing so should be conscious that travelling to Syria to fight in the Syrian civil war puts them at risk of arrest and prosecution under the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act. The government condemns politically motivated violence in all of its forms and that includes war fighting in Syria.

                 Senator Fawcett, the number of Australians travelling to Syria and surrounding countries to engage in that civil war is unprecedentedly high by comparison with other violent civil conflicts abroad. Of concern to the government is not only the engagement by those persons in politically motivated violence but evidence that Australians travelling to Syria to participate in that conflict are radicalised or further radicalised by violent jihadist ideology. The return of such radicalised persons to Australia, with the capabilities acquired through fighting or training with extremist groups, is of serious concern to the national security agencies. As the Director-General of
