        My question is to the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis. Yesterday a group of 'rainbow families' came to parliament from around the country to talk to the parliament about the impact the plebiscite on marriage equality would have on them. One child told

        that they were worried it would encourage posters saying, 'Children deserve a mother and a father' or 'Two mums are weird.'

            I think I heard the gravamen. Senator Rice, yes, I have and, yes, I can. I have had very lengthy discussions with members of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBTI" rel="nofollow">
             LGBTI
            </a>
            community and I have had lengthy discussions as well with people who take a conservative, traditional view of marriage. Among the discussions I have had with members of the LGBTI community are discussions with
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Marriage_Equality" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Marriage Equality
            </a>
            and discussions with Australians for Equality, the two principal bodies promoting the marriage equality cause. I have had several discussions with those people, as recently as yesterday, and they are not the only ones of the LGBTI community I have spoken to, but I mention them in particular because, as you would be aware, Senator Rice, as somebody who follows this issue closely, they are the two peak bodies campaigning for marriage equality.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now, Senator Rice, we have discussed the issue to which you have referred. We have discussed all the issues relating to marriage equality and the plebiscite. One of the things I said to those spokespeople, as I say to you, is that there is now a clear and immediate path to marriage equality in Australia, and that is to submit to the judgement of the Australian people on 11 February next year a plebiscite so that they can have their say. You read the opinion polls just as closely as I do, Senator Rice, and you know—

                I am sorry, Senator Rice; I forgot that last bit, and the answer to that question is yes, too. I have in particular had several discussions with Mr Tiernan Brady, who ran the 'yes' campaign during the Irish referendum. It is not my practice to detail confidential conversations, because people are entitled to speak to ministers, and indeed shadow ministers, in confidence. I hope I might be able to elaborate a little in answer to your—

                  Attorney-General, you mention the Irish example. I refer to a letter from the co-director of the 'yes' campaign for the Irish referendum, Dr Grainne Healy, which was sent to every member and senator, that urges us not to have a plebiscite if we can avoid it, describing it as a 'brutal affair'. The letter reports that posters which declared that every child needs a mother and a father were deeply hurtful and upsetting for

                   I am not familiar with the particular material to which that letter refers. However, the short answer to your question, Senator, is no, I do not, because, unlike you, evidently, I have a much more optimistic view of the Australian people than you seem to have or that Mr Bill Shorten or Senator Wong seem to have. I believe that this is a country of decent and tolerant people. I believe this is a country in which we can have a civilized and respectful debate about a vexed social issue. I believe this is a country in which we do not merely accept dictation from the political class; that on certain core issues about the nature and structure of our society, of which marriage is one, there is no greater wisdom in this chamber than there is on the streets of any city or town in this country; and that every Australian, every single Australian, has a right to have their say.

                     The government wants to give $7½ million to fund the 'no' campaign, most of which, one expects, will be spent on advertising of one sort or another, including the type similar to what we saw in the Irish referendum, described as a 'brutal affair'. Can the Attorney-General confirm that messages from the 'no' campaign will be classed as political advertising and therefore will not be monitored by the Advertising Standards Bureau and not be required to be factually correct?

In relation to the subject of the supplementary question, as the Prime Minister, Senator Ryan and I outlined yesterday, the plebiscite will be conducted as closely as possible under the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act, which governs issues including the authorisation of advertising.
