       <p class="italic">
        Given that the Government's 'Kalimantan Forests and Climate Partnership' fact sheet states 'Initial work will aim to avoid deforestation of 50,000 hectares of peat swamp forest and rehabilitate an additional 50,000 hectares of degraded peatland to create a buffer around the existing forest and reduce further degradation. These activities may be extended as other funding becomes available. The location and types of activities under the KFCP have been endorsed by Indonesia and Australia. Based on the original funding target of $100 million, the KFCP aims to preserve up to 70,000 hectares of Kalimantan's peat swamp forests and to re-flood, rehabilitate and reforest 200,000 hectares of degraded peatland':

       <p class="italic">
        (1) When was the Kalimantan Forests and Climate Partnership (KFCP) agreed to.

        (3) How many hectares of deforestation have been: (a) avoided; and (b) rehabilitated.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) Does the Government still aim to achieve the goals described in the KFCP factsheet.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (5) Can an update be provided outlining the progress with the Sumatra Forest Carbon Partnership (SFCP) announced in March 2010.

         has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) The declaration of intent to establish the Kalimantan Forests and Climate Partnership (KFCP) was signed on 9 September 2007 by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon Alexander Downer and his Indonesian counterpart, Dr Hassan Wirajuda, in the presence of Indonesia's President,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susilo_Bambang_Yudhoyono" rel="nofollow">
          Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) Actual and planned expenditure for the KFCP to the end of financial year 2012-13 is set out below. Expenditure beyond this period is currently being considered by the two governments.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) The primary intent of the KFCP is to demonstrate new techniques to drive REDD+ action â€“ the KFCP is not purely an avoided deforestation project. Demonstration activities, all under Village Agreements, to reforest the degraded section of the site are underway. By April 2012, local communities (as a part of the rehabilitation process) will have replanted about 1,050 hectares and produced over 1.4 million seedlings. Some pilot activities to rewet the peat, which will rehabilitate degraded peatland and prevent further deforestation, have also commenced, also under Village Agreements.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) The latest factsheet on the KFCP is from April 2011.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
          The Government
         </a>
         remains committed to the objectives laid out in the factsheet of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and demonstrating an equitable and effective approach to REDD+ by developing:

        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <p class="italic">
         (5) The Sumatra Forest Carbon Partnership is currently under active negotiation and design by the governments of Australia and Indonesia. Decisions on possible expenditure under the SFCP will be determined in coming months in consultation with the
