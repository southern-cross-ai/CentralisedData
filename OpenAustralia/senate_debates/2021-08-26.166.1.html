         I thank Senator Van for his question. A few weeks ago, I think, Australia felt the Olympic spirit as we watched the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games" rel="nofollow">
          Olympic Games
         </a>
         , and once again this week we feel the Olympic spirit as we watch our Paralympians compete in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralympic_Games" rel="nofollow">
          Paralympic Games
         </a>
         . It's another opportunity for us all to celebrate and unite around our incredible sporting achievements. It is so good to see the Australian team leading the medal tally already after an amazing 10 medals yesterday. Resilience, determination and strength underpin our Olympic team, and we have to understand that so many of our athletes have overcome extraordinary adversity to be in Tokyo. This, importantly, reminds us how much more can be achieved when we focus on what people's ability is instead of focusing on their disability. This year, our team in Tokyo is the largest team that we've ever sent overseas. It is second only to the Sydney 2000 team, with 178 athletes performing across 18 sports. The Aussies have always finished in the top five, and I can see no reason why that won't happen again this time.
        </p>
        <p>
         To the whole team: we are watching you. We're cheering you on. You are an inspiration to us all, but you are a special inspiration to Australians who live with disability. So big congratulations to Paige Greco and Emily Petricola, for winning gold on the cycling track, and to Rowan Crothers, Ben Popham,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Martin" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         and Lakeisha Patterson, for winning gold in the pool. Just getting to the Paralympic Games has been an extraordinary challenge given the circumstances we find ourselves in and the challenges of COVID to compete on the world stage. I hope everybody in Tokyo reaches whatever goal they sought to go there for, whether it's a personal best, winning a gold or, in the case of my mate

            We know that a lack of information and support can be an extraordinary barrier to participation and independence. Throughout this pandemic, especially as we move through the national plan, we want to make sure that we support people to get access to the supports that they need to look after themselves during the lockdown and to know what's on the other side. That's why we've invested in the national Disability Gateway, to assist people with disability, their families and their carers to access information and a range of supports in a range of different areas, from health and employment services to support to keep them connected to their communities during this really difficult time. In particular, the 'leisure' function on the Disability Gateway website can connect budding athletes with sporting centres near them so that they can, hopefully, find a sporting club that is right for them. That's why we've partnered with Get Skilled Access to develop an online platform, so that they can do exactly that.

               We know how sport can be a powerful tool in breaking down barriers and eliminating stigmas, but unfortunately it's something that not everyone is able to do right now, given the current COVID restrictions. But we know that sport can play an incredibly important role in helping people feel both included and valued. The Sport4All program is designed to help. It works through 500 schools and local clubs to provide accessibility to sport for people with disability in remote communities and for our culturally and linguistically diverse people. It might be passing a basketball or having a rally at tennis. It's all about providing every Australian with the opportunity to participate in sport. This program has been developed by our world-class Olympian

               through his organisation Get Skilled Access, which has got years of experience. But, most particularly, these are programs that are designed by people with disability for people with disability.
