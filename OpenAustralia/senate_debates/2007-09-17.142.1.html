        We, the undersigned legal practitioners formerly on the Bench, currently at the Bar or in legal practice, seek to re-affirm our sworn duty to uphold the rule of law throughout the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Commonwealth of Australia
        </a>
        and to indicate our deep concern about its undermining as the unresolved
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heiner" rel="nofollow">
         Heiner
        </a>
        affair reveals.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We believe that it is the democratic right of every Australian to expect that the criminal law shall be applied consistently, predictably and equally by law-enforcement authorities throughout the Commonwealth of Australia in materially similar circumstances. We believe that any action by Executive Government which may have breached the law ought not be immune from criminal prosecution where and when the evidence satisfies the relevant provision.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To do otherwise. we suggest would undermine the rule of law and confidence in government. It would tend to place Executive Government above the law.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        At issue is the order by the Queensland Cabinet of 5 March 1990 to destroy the Heiner Inquiry documents to prevent their use as evidence in an anticipated judicial proceeding, made worse because the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Queensland Government
        </a>
        knew the evidence concerned abuse of children in a State youth detention centre, including the alleged unresolved pack rape of an indigenous female child by other male inmates.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The affair exposes an unacceptable application of the criminal law by
        <i>
         prima facie
        </i>
        double standards by Queensland law-enforcement authorities in initiating a successful proceedings against an Australian citizen, namely Mr. Douglas Ensbey, but not against members of the Executive Government and certain civil servants for similar destruction-of-evidence conduct. Compelling evidence suggests that the erroneous interpretation of section 129 of the
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Code" rel="nofollow">
          Criminal Code
         </a>
        </i>
        (Qld) used by those authorities to justify the shredding of the Heiner Inquiry documents may have knowingly advantaged Executive Government and certain civil servants.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This serious inconsistency in the administration of Queensland’s
        <i>
         Criminal Code
        </i>
        touching on the fundamental principle of respect for the administration of justice by proper preservation of evidence concerns us because this principle is found in all jurisdictions within in the Commonwealth as it sustains the rule of law generally.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Queensland Court of Appeal’s binding September 2004 interpretation of section 129 in
        <i>
         R v Ensbey; ex parte A-G (Qld)
        </i>

         QCA

        335 exposed the erroneous interpretation that the (anticipated/imminent) judicial proceeding had to be on foot before section 129 could be triggered.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We are acquainted with the affair* and specifically note, and concur with, (the late) the Right Honourable Sir Harry Gibbs

        , as President of
        <i>
         The Samuel Griffith Society,
        </i>
        who advised that the reported facts represent, at least, a
        <i>
         prima facie
        </i>
        offence under section 129 of the
        <i>
         Criminal Code
        </i>
        (Qld) concerning destruction of evidence.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In respect of the erroneous interpretation of section 129 adopted by Queensland authorities, we also concur with the earlier 2003 opinion of former Queensland Supreme and Appeal Court Justice, the Hon James Thomas AM, that while many laws are indeed arguable, section 129 was never open to that interpretation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Section 129 of the
        <i>
         Criminal Code
        </i>
        (Qld)—destruction of evidence—provides that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        “Any person who, knowing that any book, document, or other thing of any kind, is or may be required in evidence in a judicial proceeding, wilfully destroys it or renders it illegible or undecipherable or incapable of identification, with intent thereby to prevent it from being used in evidence, is guilty of a misdemeanour, and is liable to imprisonment with hard labour for three years.” (Underlining added).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It concerns us that such an erroneous view of section 129 was persisted with for well over a decade despite the complainant, supported by eminent lawyers, pointing out the gravity of their error consistently since 1990 when knowing its wording and intent were so unambiguous, with authoritative case law available for citing dating back as far as 1891 in
        <i>
         R v Vreones
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Evidence adduced also reveals that the Queensland Government and Office of Crown Law
        <b>
         <i>
          knew
         </i>
        </b>
        , at the time, that the records would be discoverable under the Rules of the Supreme Court of Queensland once the expected writ/plaint was filed or served. With this knowledge, the Queensland Government ordered the destruction of these public records before the expected writ/plaint was filed or served to prevent their use as evidence.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Such scandalizing of these disclosure/discovery Rules by the Executive also concerns us. So fundamentally important is respect for these Rules that the Judiciary’s independent constitutional functionality depends on it.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Under the circumstances, we suggest that any claim of “staleness” or “lack of public interest” which may be mounted now by Queensland authorities not to revisit this matter ought to fail. Neither the facts, the law nor the public interest offer support in that regard.

           This affair encompasses all the essential democratic ideals. The right to a fair trial without interference by government and the right to impartial law-enforcement, to say nothing of respecting the rule of law itself rest at its core.

           I note that you are on record in the Parliament stating that if politicians and/or public servants are reasonably suspected of being involved in possible breaches of the criminal laws of this State, whether they be of your political persuasion or otherwise, you would do nothing to stand in the way of ensuring that they are bought to account before our Courts.

           Mr Rofe believes that there is
           <i>
            prima facie
           </i>
           evidence that members of the Goss Cabinet, certain of their staff and certain public officials in March 1990 illegally authorised, and/or were complicit in, causing the destruction of the Heiner documents knowing that they were evidence realistically required for a judicial proceeding (
           <i>
            inter alia
           </i>
           litigation involving Mr Coyne and the physical and sexual abuse of children held in care and custody of the State of Queensland at the JOYC).

          <p class="italic">
           It is Mr Lindeberg’s view, and that view is shared by this office and Mr Rofe, that neither the former

           The purported “

            exoneration
           </i>
           ” of relevant persons by the CJC in January of 1993 has clearly been discredited by the material collated by Mr Lindeberg and the review conducted by Mr Rofe. We note it is on the public record, at an earlier time when considering the same facts, that other eminent jurists such as Mr Ian D F Callinan QC (as he was then) in 1995, and former

          <p class="italic">
           On the material available, combined with the relevant law, it is our opinion that the conduct of these arms of Government in the handling of this matter over the years demands a full and open investigation by an independent examiner for justice to be afforded not only to our client but to the citizens of the State of Queensland. It is clearly in the broad public interest for such an inquiry to occur due to the conduct having involved so many persons in senior positions in various arms of Government over many years in this State.
