              The last time I looked, the clean energy future package, including the carbon price mechanism, had passed the Senate. If Senator Cormann is aware of a way that we could retrospectively amend a bill after it has passed the Senate—I am not aware of such a way—I am sure he could tell me about that. But the legislation has already passed and the government has made its position very clear.
             </p>

             <p>
              I will take the interjection. I know there are a range of things that need to be dealt with through policy and regulation, and the government are proceeding with a number of those. We have the Clean Energy Finance Corporation legislation, which will be dealt with in this Senate, hopefully in the near future, and we have the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
               Climate Change
              </a>
              Authority appointments to be made. There is a range of such matters. I am not sure what the senator is referring to, but I can say to him very clearly that we have put out a great deal of detail in relation to the clean energy future package. It is an economically cogent package which puts a price on pollution and is the most efficient way we know to reduce pollution in the Australian economy—in fact in any economy. That point has been made by economists worldwide and also by the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMF" rel="nofollow">
               IMF
              </a>
              . I would hope that those opposite would be aware of that and would read those comments, because they continue to persist with a policy that will cost Australia more.

                    I suspect that Senator Cormann may be a little more robust than Senator Brandis at the moment, for whatever reason that might be. He seemed quite fine.

                       , a point of order in relation to the requirement for the minister to be directly relevant to the question. She has now used more than half the time allotted to her and she has not gone anywhere near the question, which was: at what point in time will the government assess whether its carbon tax has been a success or failure? That is a very serious question and I urge you to direct the minister to be directly relevant to the question, as she is required to be.

                         ; I am responding to a proposition in the question. In response to that, I would make the point that Britain is expected to have a carbon price of $24 to $30 a tonne, this is over the next few years; Sweden, $130 a tonne; Switzerland, $30 to $60; Norway, $53; and Ireland $24 to $37 a tonne. Of course, the scheme that is most expensive is the one that is proposed by those opposite.

                          , I ask a further supplementary question. Is there any circumstance at all in which the government would water down its carbon tax—the world's biggest carbon tax—which will push up the cost of electricity, push up the cost of living, push up the cost of doing business and reduce our international competitiveness while doing nothing to help reduce global greenhouse gas emissions?

                           That was not really a question, if I may say. It was yet another iteration of a set of inaccurate propositions—if they get worried about the word 'lies', I will say 'falsehoods' or 'untruths'—that the opposition continue to put in relation to pricing carbon. What they do not tell Australians is that they are signed up to the same reduction by the end of the decade that the government is, but what they want to do is get taxpayers to fund it and make the economy bear a greater cost. That is what the opposition want to do. But they do not want to talk about that; all they want to talk about are a set of propositions which are wrong. What we are seeing is the opposition, even Senator Cormann, backing away from some of the more ridiculous propositions which are being made, including the tax being death to industries and towns being wiped off the map, all of which are simply untrue.
