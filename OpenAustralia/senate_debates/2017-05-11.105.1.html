        My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Cormann. On 23 April the Assistant Treasurer said: 'The housing package will be extraordinarily large. It will be far reaching. It will deal with all the groups on the spectrum of housing. It will be an impressive package. It will be a well-received package.' On last night's
        <i>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Daley" rel="nofollow">

         Grattan Institute
        </a>
        , said, of the budget's housing affordability measures, 'You'll need a scanning electron microscope to see an impact on prices.' Isn't it clear that, after months of promising the world that the budget would deliver on housing affordability, the budget's housing affordability package is a dud?

            I am not aware of the personal circumstances of the lady you have mentioned and I am not aware of what first home she may aspire to purchase. Obviously that is all relevant information. What I can say is that the government, in the budget, has put forward the most comprehensive package to improve housing affordability for first home buyers ever delivered by any government at a federal level. Of course, in the next few weeks and months, we will have the opportunity in the Senate to legislate many components of it.

               I fundamentally disagree with the assertions made by Senator Cameron. To the extent that there is a housing affordability challenge in some parts of Australia, of course that is a function of demand and supply. To the extent that demand exceeds supply, prices go up. Once supply exceeds demand, prices come down. In this budget, the Treasurer and his team have been able to put forward a very comprehensive package of measures to boost supply, including through the release of Commonwealth land that is no longer required, which will lead to significant additional housing developments, and through a $1 billion infrastructure package targeting local councils, in particular, helping them to remove barriers towards the development of further land release. And there are a whole range of other measures, which, all taken together—

                   I thank the senator for his question and acknowledge that he is one of the most hardworking senators in this place. I am absolutely delighted to outline some of the significant and truly nation-building initiatives the coalition is delivering through this year's budget. The government is delivering a record $75 billion in infrastructure funding and financing, including a $20 billion commitment to passenger and freight rail. The investments we are making will unlock the potential of our cities and our regions. The $8.4 billion for the inland rail will be nation changing. Others have been talking about it for years, but it is this coalition government that is delivering the inland rail. We will also invest $10 billion to establish a national rail program which will transform our cities and our regions by better connecting our cities, suburbs and surrounding regional areas right across Australia. Our commitment to rail as part of this year's budget also includes a $500 million regional Victorian rail package which will improve the regional rail network, including the

                      recently and saw firsthand the improvements and how the investments this government is making in Western Australia are making the lives of the people living there better. This year's budget builds on those investments and delivers another $1.6 billion in a $2.3 billion road and rail infrastructure package for Western Australia. To ease congestion and improve connectivity across Perth, we are investing $792 million for the Perth Metronet, which is a massive investment in that city's urban rail infrastructure, and will include projects such as the Thornlie to Yanchep line. We are also investing up to $490 million in the Forrestfield-

                          I will take the senator's interjection, 'Not very well!' She is indeed misleading the Senate. It is being very, very well received. There has been widespread support. Pricewaterhouse says bringing forward spending on close to $50 billion worth of infrastructure, including Sydney's second airport, the Brisbane to Melbourne inland rail, WA's Metronet and a widening of the City Deals program is a bold, positive move that will turbocharge productivity.

                          say that $8.4 billion for the Melbourne to Brisbane inland rail is the real crown jewel in tonight's budget, for the farm sector. This is a significant investment in the efficiency of our industry, better connecting our farms with new markets here and overseas. The

                            I can tell you—and I am, in fact, advised by my colleague Senator Cormann, the Minister for Finance—that the 10-year costs from 2016-17 are $24 billion already legislated and $26 billion to come. The 10-year costs from 2017-18 are $29.8 billion legislated and $35 billion yet to come, a total of $65 billion.

                               I am delighted to, Senator Wong. It is fair that Australians have more jobs and better paid jobs, and that is what our Enterprise Tax Plan will deliver. Senator Wong, I should not have to explain this to you, because you were a minister of a government at a time when Mr Bill Shorten, as a minister, made the very same point: company tax cuts would enable businesses to employ more people and offer the people they employ better wages. For my money, Senator Wong, that is fair. And not only I believe it is fair; you used to believe it was fair and Mr Shorten used to believe it was fair. In fact, Mr Shorten used to advocate it, but he no longer does. I will tell you what else is fair, Senator Wong: Australians should pay for their fellow Australians who suffer from a disability. And that is what we have secured with this budget as well.
