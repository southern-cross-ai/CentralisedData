This will support timely monitoring by the INSLM to ensure the Assistance and Access Act is operating as intended. Further, timely passage is required in order to extend to the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity and State anti-corruption bodies the industry assistance measures enacted as part of the Assistance and Act. This will enable the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity and State anti-corruption bodies to identify and investigate serious crime, and serious misconduct and corruption across the public sector.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Purpose of the Bill
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill will amend the
        <i>
         Wine Australia Act 2013
        </i>
        to enable continued facilitation of trade in wine between Australia and the United Kingdom (UK) if the UK begins transitional arrangements to withdraw from the European Union (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU" rel="nofollow">
         EU
        </a>
        ) on 29 March 2019. Trade in wine between Australia and the UK is currently facilitated by the
        <i>
         Agreement between Australia and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Community" rel="nofollow">
          European Community
         </a>
         on Trade in Wine
        </i>
        (EC-AU Wine Agreement). The EC-AU Wine Agreement:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        This agreement will no longer apply to the UK following the withdrawal from the EU. In the event of a transition period, provided for under the draft UK-EU Withdrawal Agreement, the UK would remain bound by obligations 'stemming from' EU-third country agreements from 29 March 2019 until the end of 2020. To ensure the UK continues to be recognised as a member of the EU for the purposes of the EC-AU Wine Agreement, during any transition period, amendment to the
        <i>
         Wine Australia Act 2013
        </i>
        is required.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Amendment to the definition of an EC country under the
        <i>
         Wine Australia Act 2013
        </i>
        is required to clarify that the UK is taken to be an EU country for the purposes of the agreement during the transition period. The amendment will enable the EC-AU Wine Agreement to continue to facilitate wine trade between Australia and the UK.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Reasons for Urgency
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Passage is required in Autumn 2019 to ensure the legislative amendments commence before 29 March 2019 to enable the continued trade in wine with the UK on 29 March 2019 and beyond. Failing to enact the legislative amendments in time could have a significant impact on Australia's wine trade with the UK. Without the amendments, Australia's wine-making practices may no longer be recognised by the UK, limiting access to the UK market or requiring winemakers to re-label their products. Australia's GIs would also no longer be protected in the UK.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UK" rel="nofollow">
         The UK
        </a>
        is a key export market for Australian winemakers as it is the sixth largest wine market in the world and the second largest wine importer. The UK is Australia's top wine export market by volume and third largest market by value. In the 12 months to
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        September 2018, Australia exported 238.6 million litres of wine to the UK, with a value of $380 million. The UK also represents a significant market for Australian bulk wine. Approximately 80 per cent of wine shipped to the UK is unpacked (bulk), which is bottled in market and distributed across the EU. The value of bulk wine exports to the UK grew by 20 per cent to $200 million in the 12 months to September 2018.
