        My question is to the Minister for Defence, Senator Johnston. Will the minister outline to the Senate details of the defence equipment and technology agreement signed today between the prime ministers of Australia and Japan as it relates to greater cooperation between our two nations and the sharing of defence science, technology and materiel?

         May I thank Senator Fawcett for the question and may I congratulate you,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
          Mr President

         , on your election as

         . During the recent 2+2 defence and foreign ministers meeting in Japan, foreign minister Bishop and I discussed proposals to enhance our bilateral defence cooperation with our Japanese counterparts. I also discussed this with Minister Onodera at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore in May of this year. I am very pleased to inform the Senate that today, as a result of those discussions, Prime Minister Abbott and Japanese Prime Minister Abe will sign an agreement between the government of Australia and the government of Japan concerning the transfer of defence equipment and technology. This is an important milestone in the Australia-Japan defence relationship and an integral part of broader efforts to strengthen our strategic relationship. It has its foundations in the 2007 joint declaration on security cooperation and the 2012 joint statement on cooperating for peace and stability: a common vision and objectives.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Australian Defence Force has worked well with Japan in difficult environments overseas during recent years. We have been together in Cambodia,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
          East Timor
         </a>
         and Iraq, and of course we are currently both engaged in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sudan" rel="nofollow">
          South Sudan
         </a>
         . This agreement will pave the way for our two nations to work more closely to identify potential areas of future research interest and mutual benefit in the fields of defence science, technology and equipment. Japan has been an important contributor to peace and stability in our region for many decades. His Excellency Shinzo Abe's address to a joint sitting of parliament today is a historic moment for both of our nations. The Australian government warmly welcomes this further strengthening of our very important defence relationship with Japan.

           This agreement will facilitate deeper bilateral defence science, technology and equipment cooperation, allowing Australia and Japan to work more closely to identify potential areas of future research interest and mutual benefit. Japan is world renowned for its defence science and technology experience and capability. By increasing our cooperation, it is expected both nations will be able to reduce the costs of developing defence capability. Our first cooperative defence project with Japan is a marine hydrodynamics project, which will be conducted by our

           and Technology Organisation,

            DSTO
           </a>
           , and Japan's Technical Research and Development Institute, TRDI. As the foreign minister said recently, no nation has been more important to Australia finding its place in Asia than has Japan. For decades, Japan was our largest trading partner and today Japan remains our second largest trading partner, with $71 billion traded between us in 2012. The signing of this agreement is yet another natural progression in our very strong relationship.

             Strengthening the Australia-Japan-United States trilateral defence cooperation is a significant and major priority for Australia. The Australian government seeks positive and proactive defence relations with the United States and Japan based on a common set of democratic values and similar strategic perspectives. Practical cooperation through exercises is a central part of our trilateral defence relationship, the benefits of which were demonstrated in the response to the great east Japan earthquake in 2011. Strong practical cooperation prior to the disaster made this cooperation possible and we were able to work together to provide rapid humanitarian and disaster relief assistance at very short notice. Australia is seeking to conduct more advanced trilateral exercises with a focus on improving each country's ability to enhance maritime security through air, land and maritime cooperation. This trilateral relationship offers a stabilising regional presence that builds confidence and promotes freedom of navigation and maritime security in the regions and sea lanes.
