         Recommendation 1
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that the Australian government increase its efforts through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTO" rel="nofollow">
         WTO
        </a>
        , Asia–Pacific Economic Cooperation (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APEC" rel="nofollow">
         APEC
        </a>
        ) and bilaterally to encourage China to promulgate laws that comply with the WTO and to ensure that they are interpreted and applied consistently and without discrimination throughout the country. In particular the committee cites the contract and intellectual property laws and local government intervention as areas of most concern to Australian businesses.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia uses a range of multilateral and bilateral mechanisms to press China to implement WTO-consistent laws which are applied consistently and without discrimination. Under the terms of its WTO Accession Protocol, China’s implementation of its WTO commitments is subject to a Transitional Review Mechanism. This review will be conducted annually for eight years following China’s full accession (December 2001), with a final review in the tenth year after accession. The annual review of China’s implementation is undertaken in the relevant WTO councils and committees. Australia has participated in each annual review so far and will continue to use the review mechanism to monitor China’s compliance with its WTO commitments. Australia also uses the regular WTO committee processes to raise issues of compliance.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        When necessary, we use the WTO’s dispute settlement mechanisms to press China to enforce fair and WTO-consistent laws. For example, Australia is currently participating as a third party in dispute settlement proceedings on Chinese measures affecting imports of automobile parts. The measures have been challenged by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         European Commission
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_and_Canada" rel="nofollow">
         United States and Canada
        </a>
        . Other third parties are Japan and Mexico. Australia has substantial trade interests at stake. Our bilateral trade in automobiles and automotive parts has developed considerably with China over a relatively short period. Automotive exports to China increased more than four-fold in 2005 to $284 million—$170 million in vehicles and $114 million in components. The dispute is still at the consultations stage. Initial consultations, which relate to discriminatory Chinese import tariffs and local content requirements, were held in Geneva on 11-12 May 2006.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia has also been working hard to ensure that the WTO
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha_Round" rel="nofollow">
         Doha Round
        </a>
        negotiations deliver commercially meaningful outcomes. A successful outcome to the Doha Round will be crucial to providing Australian exporters with improved access to international markets. Both Australia and China’s industries have much to gain from further liberalisation of goods and services.

        The Government employs various bilateral mechanisms to press China to implement WTO-consistent laws in a fair and consistent manner. A program of regular high-level visits and meetings has established a relationship based on trust in which we can raise issues with China frankly and constructively. This level of communication would not have been possible without the frequent high-level exchanges we have maintained over the past 15 years. During several recent visits, Australian ministers have urged China to implement an effective and fair commercial arbitration system, emphasising that the failure to implement arbitral and court rulings undermines the confidence of foreign companies.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Established in 1986, the Joint Ministerial Economic Commission (JMEC) has been the main institutional mechanism for advancing Australia’s economic interests with China. Chaired by the two trade ministers, JMEC allows both countries to address specific problems, including in relation to intellectual property protection and commercial law, and identify opportunities to liberalise trade in a wide range of sectors such as energy and minerals, agriculture, manufacturing and services. The Government is committed to reinvigorating JMEC, ensuring that it remains relevant to the needs of Australian business. At a JMEC intersessional senior officials meeting in Canberra in January 2006, Australia raised several issues concerning the business environment in China. The 11th ministerial meeting of JMEC was held in Sydney on 3 October 2006, marking the 20th anniversary of the foundation of the process.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition to re-energising JMEC, the Government has ensured that our engagement with China on economic issues is as effective as possible by establishing a new High-level Economic Cooperation Dialogue (HECD) with China’s principal economic planning and reform agency, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Development_and_Reform_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         National Development and Reform Commission
        </a>
        (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDRC" rel="nofollow">
         NDRC
        </a>
        ). Chaired by the Australian Trade Minister and the NDRC Chairman, HECD complements JMEC, allowing the Government to advance core Australian economic interests in areas such as resources, investment, intellectual property and local government intervention. Australia used the first HECD meeting in Canberra on 3 April 2006 during
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_Wen_Jiabao" rel="nofollow">
         Premier Wen Jiabao

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government is also seeking to use the Australia-China Free Trade Agreement, currently under negotiation, to strengthen and supplement China’s existing international obligations concerning transparency and the administration of regulatory measures. In responding to industry concerns about intellectual property protection and the transparent administration of laws and regulations in China, Australia and China have been discussing disciplines on transparency during the FTA negotiations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government will continue to encourage China, through bilateral and multilateral forums, to implement laws that comply with WTO rules and to ensure that they are interpreted and applied consistently and without discrimination throughout the country.

         Recommendation 2
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that the Australian government place a higher priority on developing and implementing practical measures to assist China manage its transition from a planned economy to a market economy, especially to improve its corporate governance regime. For example, by facilitating exchange programs between Chinese and Australian departments or agencies or offering special training and education programs for Chinese officials in the area of corporate governance.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government recognises the importance of developing and implementing practical measures to assist China to improve its corporate governance regime. The Government’s development cooperation program with China, as articulated in the China Australia Country Program Strategy 2006-2010, aims to ‘build capacity in selected sectors in China, in particular governance, environment and health’ through ‘targeted assistance in areas where Australia has relevant and valued expertise.’ The China Australia Governance Program (CAGP), which runs from 2004-2010 with a total Australian contribution of $20 million, supports China’s governance reform and development agenda. Priorities include helping China with its fiscal reforms, social security reforms, and trade-related reforms.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The CAGP is flexible program and has the capacity to address a range of issues. Areas of future work currently under consideration include:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         defining targets and strategies to improve the Chinese banking sector’s capacity for risk management;
        </li>
        <li>
         helping China to address the implications of economic restructuring and productivity improvement; and
        </li>
        <li>
         assisting China build WTO-related regulatory frameworks such as food and drugs regulation, quarantine, and banking supervision.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australia China Environment Development Program aims to support China’s policy of balancing sustainable economic development with the needs of the environment. Australia has responded to a request by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Government" rel="nofollow">

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Through the aid program, the Government also provides Australian Development Scholarships for Chinese officials to undertake masters-level courses in Australia. Approximately half of these scholarships are awarded to officials who undertake governance-related courses. Twenty-four officials commenced scholarships in 2006, of whom 13 are studying courses which relate to China’s economic transition, including public policy, public administration, economics, accounting and finance.

        on the Australian Government’s overseas aid program, Australian Aid: Promoting Growth and Stability, Australia will expand its scholarships program from 1 July 2006. Chinese nationals (including those who wish to undertake governance-related studies) will be eligible to apply for scholarships under the expanded program. It will include Australian Development Scholarships; new Australian Leadership Awards, aimed at future leaders, administered by AusAID; and Endeavour Program scholarships administered by the Department of Education, Science and Training (

         Recommendation 3 (see also recommendation 16)
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that Austrade establish a system for handling complaints on China’s provincial regulations. This system would:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         encourage Australian companies to register such complaints;
        </li>
        <li>
         record the complaints in a central register and monitor their management;
        </li>
        <li>
         disseminate information about these complaints among the Australian business community; and
        </li>
        <li>
         report the complaints to the Australian government.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government adopts a systematic approach to handling Australian business complaints about China’s legal system, including complaints about inconsistent or discriminatory regulations at the provincial and central government levels. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) and Austrade in particular encourage business to bring these issues to the Australian Government’s attention, both in Australia and through their offices in China. As part of its consultation process for the FTA negotiations with China, DFAT has also urged Australian businesses to raise concerns about Chinese regulations and the lack of transparency in the legal system in general. The Government also networks closely with the Australia-China Business Council to this end.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        DFAT and Austrade in turn investigate and assess complaints business brings to us, bearing in mind that the Australian Government can only intervene in those cases where Chinese regulations are inconsistent with China’s international, including its WTO, obligations, or where we believe that Chinese provincial or central authorities have disregarded or violated China’s own laws, for example, by failing to enforce a judgment by a Chinese court. If a complainant has exhausted all legal avenues in China, the Australian Government then raises these issues with provincial and central Chinese authorities, including, on occasion, at ministerial level. (For example, in March this year in response to concerns by Australian iron ore suppliers, DFAT made representations to the Chinese Ministry of Commerce about regulations which imposed a price cap on imported iron ore. Chinese authorities subsequently withdrew the relevant regulations.) In addition to bilateral representations, the Australian Government also uses international forums to raise concerns about Chinese regulations which constitute trade barriers: WTO committees and the WTO Trade Policy Review provide regular opportunities to do so.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        DFAT and Austrade keep systematic records of business concerns and Chinese responses through standard filing and record-keeping procedures. But, given the commercial sensitivity of the details of many complaints, it would not be appropriate to open our records to scrutiny by other businesses (or the public in general). We will continue to urge business to contact us about their experiences in dealing with China’s provincial regulations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

         Recommendation 4
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that Australia’s agricultural exporters—in cooperation with key government agencies such as the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAFF" rel="nofollow">
         DAFF
        </a>
        ) and Austrade—put particular effort into researching the China market. There will be significant export opportunities for Australian primary producers as China’s incomes rise and the restrictions on trade are removed (see recommendation 14). For these opportunities to be recognised, it is imperative that Australian exporters have up to date information about consumer tastes and producer requirements as they vary from region to region.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government supports further research by Australia’s agricultural exporters into the China market.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government recognises that China presents important market opportunities for Australian agricultural, food, seafood and forestry products. Both the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF) and Austrade work closely with industry stakeholders to identify and target market access priorities across a range of agricultural markets, including identifying areas where the Government can help to remove technical and other barriers to trade with China.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A key resource developed by DAFF to help industry explore the opportunities presented by the emerging Chinese market is the recent report—
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture_in_China" rel="nofollow">
         Agriculture in China
        </a>
        : Developments and significance for Australia—released by the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABARE" rel="nofollow">
         ABARE
        </a>
        ) in 2006. Other mechanisms for exploring market opportunities in China include the Australia-China Agricultural Cooperation Agreement (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACACA" rel="nofollow">
         ACACA
        </a>
        ), and a range of consultative mechanisms with industry.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The ABARE report confirms that Chinese economic growth is likely to lead to significant market opportunities for Australian agricultural exporters. This publicly available report provides a comprehensive examination of agricultural supply and demand in China. It provides information that will enable primary producers to gain an understanding of the changes in China’s production and consumption patterns, which in turn will help them gain an appreciation of future market opportunities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The ACACA is a long-standing, treaty-level bilateral agreement that provides funding through the International Agricultural Cooperation component of the Government’s Agriculture Advancing Australia program for agriculture-oriented exchange missions between Australia and China. The ACACA covers all activities relating to agriculture, fisheries and forestry, from inputs and technology through to food processing and distribution. It helps Australian industry to capitalise on China’s market expansion by facilitating the development of commercial linkages between Australian and Chinese agriculture, fisheries and forestry sectors and associated agribusiness enterprises.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Since ACACA’s inception in 1984, over 180 exchange projects have been undertaken across a range of sectors. Exchange missions focus on specific areas of agribusiness, with the overall objective of promoting bilateral cooperation in the agriculture, fisheries and forestry sectors. Farmers, small, medium or large agri-businesses, industry groups, rural and regional associations and educational and research academic institutions are encouraged to develop proposals for short-term projects in China to pursue commercial cooperation in agriculture, fisheries/aquaculture and forestry. The ACACA program facilitates trade by allowing missions to visit China to observe first-hand consumer tastes and producer requirements as they vary from region to region and by providing the opportunity to explore supply chains.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government recognises that China will present valuable opportunities to Australian exporters of a wide-range of agricultural products. However, establishing market access for new products continues to be a key challenge. In recognition of the importance of China as an emerging market for Australian agricultural production, DAFF, through the International Food and Agriculture Service, recently established a Counsellor (Agriculture Policy) position in Beijing in addition to the pre-existing Counsellor (Agriculture Technical) position.

       <p class="italic">
        To further advance Australia’s market access interests in China, DAFF has established a range of consultative mechanisms with Chinese agencies. These mechanisms, such as the Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation in Sanitary and Phytosanitary Matters, provide an opportunity to discuss both Australia’s and China’s market access priorities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Industry market access priorities are identified through bodies such as the Horticultural Market Access Committee (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC" rel="nofollow">
         HMAC
        </a>
        ). The HMAC is an industry committee with government representation which considers, prioritises, promotes and communicates all market access issues that are of significance to the Australian horticulture industry. The committee works in consultation with DAFF, individual industry associations and their members, and the research community to advance market access priorities.

         Recommendation 5
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that as part of a national strategy to promote innovation and value-adding in manufacturing, the Australian government must develop a wider range of incentives for CSIRO, the universities, private sector research centres and manufacturing companies to collaborate and invest in research and development (R&amp;D).

        The Government recognises that innovation is a driver of productivity and economic growth. The Government’s 2001 Backing Australia’s Ability and 2004 Backing Australia’s Ability: Building Our Future through Science and Innovation packages constitute a ten-year, $8.3 billion funding commitment to science and innovation. This is in addition to ongoing support for agencies such as the Australian Research Council, the

        and

        </a>
        and CSIRO. The Government’s support for science and innovation totalled over $5.9 billion in 2005-06 (2006-07 Science and Innovation Budget Tables).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Backing Australia’s Ability packages have three major themes:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         strengthening Australia’s ability to generate ideas and undertake research;
        </li>
        <li>
         accelerating the commercialisation of ideas; and
        </li>
        <li>
         developing and retaining skills.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        A fundamental objective of the second Backing Australia’s Ability package is to boost collaboration between business, tertiary institutions and publicly funded research agencies. There are now a variety of specific programs already in place that directly support a range of public-private sector and business-business collaboration.

        The Government has also funded pilot work on collaboration—the Innovation Exchange Intermediaries network was supported through the Innovation Access Program. It is a network of intermediaries who work with companies and universities and other public sector organisations to identify and establish links and alliances for the benefit of both partners. The TechFast program was supported to pilot university- small and medium sized company collaboration over an 18 month period through the transfer of intellectual property. The program is due for evaluation in the second half of 2006.

        Specific initiatives, such as the Pre-Seed Fund, are aimed at assisting the commercialisation of public sector research. This fund is designed to encourage private sector venture capitalists to take an active role in funding
