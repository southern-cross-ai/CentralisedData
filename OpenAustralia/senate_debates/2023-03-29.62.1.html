        Over the weekend, my friend Jonathan Sriranganathan announced he would step down as councillor for Brisbane's Gabba ward. Jono was elected in 2016 as Queensland's first Greens councillor, and the first of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Tamil" rel="nofollow">
         Sri Lankan Tamil
        </a>
        heritage. He's a musician, rapper, writer and former youth worker. But I've known Jono first and foremost as an activist—shaking up the system, telling it like it is, asking questions that no-one else would dare ask and challenging you to think really deep and hard about so many issues. He is a radical, unwavering voice for the community he serves and for the social, environmental and racial injustices we face—one that refuses to back down, no matter what the hurdles are. I am in awe of Jono's courage to put his security and his body on the line to protect others and for what he believes in. Politics needs more people like that.
       </p>
       <p>
        He achieved so much positive change for a more sustainable and equitable city. But Jono's influence has been much wider than Brisbane. He set an example for what meaningful grassroots engagement is and played a pivotal role in transforming the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Greens" rel="nofollow">

        into a powerful movement for change. The 2022 'Greenslide' owes so much to him.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jono's departure is a big loss, but thankfully the amazing Trina Massey is stepping in. She will be the first openly queer woman of colour ever to hold public office at any level of government in Queensland. Representation is important, and I can't wait to see Trina in action.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm looking forward to your next adventures, Jono. Thank you for your extraordinary work. Thank you for being such a good friend and such a staunch ally for people of colour. Please keep asking the hard questions. You truly are one of a kind.
