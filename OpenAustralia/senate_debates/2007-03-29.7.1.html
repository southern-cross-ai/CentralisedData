         I seek leave to make a very short statement on that vote on behalf of the

          Australian Democrats

         , the Australian Democrats have a longstanding opposition to torture. We have often called for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Civil_and_Political_Rights" rel="nofollow">
          International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
         </a>
         to be incorporated in legislation, for example. Further, our serious concerns about some of the methods that the United States and its allies have used in the war on terror are well known. Our concerns about those techniques are well known. We have abstained and not supported the motion before us today because we consider that the quote by the former
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
          US
         </a>
         Secretary of Defense
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Rumsfeld" rel="nofollow">
          Donald Rumsfeld
         </a>
         is quite broad. What is likely is that Mr Rumsfeld’s intention was to justify techniques that we might consider torture in the interest of keeping the debate balanced. We cannot accept that the words as written are so extreme as to call them ‘tantamount to endorsing torture’ when other interrogation techniques that do not constitute torture could be included in them. I reiterate our shared opposition with Senator Brown and, I am sure, many others in this place on the issue of torture itself.

          Similarly to the

          </a>
          continues to have a strong opposition to torture and the use of torture. There are a range of human rights and international conventions that oppose torture. In this instance, Senator Brown deferred his motion from yesterday. He then moved an amendment to it on the floor. It was not circulated on the floor; it was not provided to the opposition beforehand. I assume Senator Brown’s interest is in opposing torture more broadly, but in those instances where Senator Brown does not want to take the usual process of providing the opposition with those types of issues, I can assume that he does not want the support of the Labor Party on those matters.

           The pertinent point here is that

            Donald Rumsfeld
           </a>
           was the architect of the rules which permitted egregious torture in

            Guantanamo Bay
           </a>
           and elsewhere under the rubric of statements such as that quoted in the motion. If we do not stand up to that sort of philosophy, if we do not make a stand against it, then we cross the line to breach international rules, international laws and domestic laws, and to torture itself.
