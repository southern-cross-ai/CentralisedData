         Social Services
        </a>
        , Senator Ruston. It follows very much on the same theme. Can the minister outline how the Liberals and Nationals in government are continuing to support pensioners, families and jobseekers in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic?

         I thank Senator Davey for her question. This government is absolutely committed to continuing to provide unprecedented levels of economic support to Australians who are finding it tough, as we work our way through this coronavirus pandemic. As part of the government's response, in the budget a couple of weeks ago we made an announcement around the provision of two additional payments of $250 as economic support payments to eligible Australians. That will mean 5.1 million Australians will receive these two paymentsâ€”that's people on the age pension and the disability pension, carers, people in veterans' affairs and some concession card holders. The payments will be made starting on 30 November for the first payment and 1 March 2021 for the second payment. When you combine this with the two $750 payments that have already been made to this group of people, you will see that, by 1 October, more than $12 billion has been paid out to Australians to assist them through this pandemic. That's $2,000 per recipient.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have extended the coronavirus supplement at enhanced support levels through to 31 December, as Australians' confidence and economic confidence continue to build momentum. From the start of the pandemic to 1 October the government spent approximately $14 billion on the coronavirus supplement. But we also want to make sure we help Australians gain meaningful employment; that remains an absolute priority of this government. To do so we have introduced a $300 income-free area, which means if a person earns up to $300 they will continue to receive the maximum amount of their payment. We want to give people the confidence to get back into the workforce, even if it is only for a day or so a week, without affecting their payment. Early data so far has shown that the changes made in September are already starting to work, with almost one in five jobseekers reporting earning income.

           Can the minister also provide an update to the Senate as to how the government is providing additional incentives to young people to encourage them to take up work in our agricultural and horticultural industries, who so desperately need workers?

            Thank you, Senator Davey, for that really important question. This government absolutely recognises that there is a need for Australia's agricultural sector to find workers, particularly for the upcoming harvest in the horticultural area. In the recent budget, we announced a range of temporary measures to incentivise and boost participation in these vital industries, but we particularly focused on young people. We want young Australians to take up the opportunity to get out into our regions and take on seasonal work. In doing so, we have provided added incentive for them to gain independence from the payment of youth allowance, which will subsequently allow them to receive payment when, hopefully, they start further study or go to university next year. From 30 November this year to 31 December next year, young people who earn $15,000 working in the agricultural sector will be considered to be independent for the purposes of youth allowance. We believe this is a significant pathway that shortens the time for people to get independence and helps our horticultural sector.

               I'm pleased to inform the Senate that, as part of the budget, we have provided support to new parents whose employment was interrupted as a result of the coronavirus pandemic by introducing some additional concessional paid parental leave work tests. Under the normal rules, parents are required to have worked 10 of the 13 months prior to the birth or adoption of their child to qualify for paid parental leave. What we have done is extend that period so that it's 10 of the last 20 months for births and adoptions, and this will be in effect from 22 March 2020 until 31 March 2021. This temporary change increases access to paid parental leave for approximately 12,800 families who were previously connected to the workforce but have lost their jobs as a result of the COVID pandemic and would otherwise have been able to qualify. We understand many people made the decision about family planning prior to COVID, and we want to make sure those families don't miss out.
