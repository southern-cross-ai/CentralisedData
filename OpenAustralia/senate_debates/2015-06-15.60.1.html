        As I mentioned in my speech on the second reading of this bill, concerns have been raised that, because the merger means that ComSuper will cease to exist and its staff will be compulsorily transferred out of the Australian Public Service, APS, to the CSC, this forced change could affect their careers and make it more difficult to move to an APS agency. In the event that the new CSC downsizes, staff are also concerned about losing their redundancy rights that would allow them to be redeployed in the APS if their positions are cut. Labor's amendment will address these concerns by providing transferred ComSuper employees with broadly equivalent mobility rights to those they would have had if they had remained employed in the APS. Labor's amendment enables transferred ComSuper employees to move from the CSC to APS agencies as if they were still an APS employee. These measures in Labor's amendment will ensure that ComSuper employees who transfer to CSC will be able to transfer at any level or win promotion to APS roles at other agencies. Labor's amendment ensures ComSuper employees who transfer to CSC are not disadvantaged in terms of seeking and applying for a future role within the APS. Labor's amendment will apply for a period of three years. Our amendment is a simple and sensible change that addresses the concerns of ComSuper staff. I would like to thank the Minister for Finance, Senator Cormann, for working constructively with the opposition on addressing our concerns.

         As I have indicated, the government appreciates that the opposition have taken a constructive approach in relation to this bill, recognising that it makes sense to put the administration staff into the same structure as the trustee rather than have an artificial single client service arrangement. The main substantive issue that the opposition have raised is the question of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APS" rel="nofollow">
          APS
         </a>
         mobility. The opposition amendment to this bill will provide transferring ComSuper staff with mobility rights broadly equivalent to those they would have had if they remain in the APS for a three-year period. I might just pause here to advise the chamber that this is a very unusual circumstance, and, arguably, it is quite a unique circumstance as result of a merger between government entities with APS staff moving to a non-APS agency. As such, the government has been quite comfortable in working with the opposition in relation to this particular matter. It does not, in our view, set a precedent for what may or may not happen down the track in relation to other mergers between APS agencies in particular.
        </p>
        <p>
         It should also be noted that the current arrangements restricting non-APS employees from applying for most APS jobs were also only temporary. As of 1 July 2015, new arrangements, as indicated in the budget, will afford agency heads the flexibility to manage recruitment, including by considering candidates not already employed within the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Public_Service" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Public Service
         </a>
         , without the need for external approval. As a result, ComSuper staff that are transferred to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSC" rel="nofollow">
          CSC
         </a>
         employment at the commencement of the merger will, regardless of the opposition amendment, have opportunities to seek to return to APS employment if they wish to do so. If mobility arrangements are agreed by the Senate, as proposed in this amendment initiated and moved by the opposition, it is proper that they should be subject to a specified time frame. This amendment proposes a period of three years from commencement. While the government would ideally have preferred a shorter defined period as more appropriate, we do appreciate that these amendments still have temporary effect only and cease to apply after three years.

         The CHAIRMAN: The question is that opposition amendment (1) on sheet 7713 be agreed to.

         Question agreed to.
        </p>
        <p>
         I might just advise the chamber that, given that this amendment has just passed the Senate, it is the government's intention to support the passage of this bill as amended in the House of Representatives.
