           I indicate that the opposition will not be pursuing the amendment that we had proposed to move. Despite that, the coalition won't be opposing this motion. We don't think a Senate inquiry is in any way going to make up for the 18 months of inaction by the Labor government that have created this home-grown inflation and made this cost-of-living crisis a lot worse than it ever had to be. Rather than empower the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
            ACCC
           </a>
           to monitor these issues, Labor have let the inflation problem get much worse. Australia has the most entrenched inflation amongst advanced economies according to the magazine the
           <i>
            Economist
           </i>
           , and the best thing Labor can do to support the cost of living is to rein in spending to bring down inflation. Instead, Labor have spent more than $20,000 per household—that's taxpayers' money, not the government's money—on coming into government. We'll support this because we want to make sure we get to the bottom of these problems. It's a pity we couldn't move our amendment, but we'll talk about that another time.
