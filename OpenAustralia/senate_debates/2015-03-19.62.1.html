        The Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Miscellaneous Matters) Bill 2015 and the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Regulatory Levies) Amendment (Miscellaneous Matters) Bill 2015 are supported by Labor, as they make further amendments to the role of the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority, or NOPSEMA, and also respond to the boundary changes caused by

        parliament passed the Petroleum Titles (Browse Basin) Bill 2014 last year to provide security of tenure by overcoming the risk of creating any vacant areas and thus uncertainty in the Scott Reef or Seringapatam Reef areas. These bills we are debating are in effect a mirroring of the Western Australian legislation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Miscellaneous Matters) Bill 2015 will automatically extend the coverage of the titles under the act to ensure security of tenure over blocks moving from state or

        coastal waters into Commonwealth jurisdiction as a result of boundary changes. It will also provide arrangements for the granting of renewals of Commonwealth titles over blocks remaining in Commonwealth waters, where part of that title has moved into state or Territory waters as a result of boundary changes.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage (Regulatory Levies) Amendment (Miscellaneous Matters) Bill 2015 provides the ability for the National Offshore Petroleum Titles Administrator to collect an annual titles administration levy with respect to a boundary-change petroleum exploration permit.
       </p>
       <p>
        Labor supports these amendments and recognises the importance of providing certainty over tenure. We also recognise the important role of NOPSEMA in reducing the regulatory burden on industry and the potential to deliver improved regulatory outcomes.
