        My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Stephen Conroy. Will the government release the Treasury modelling on Dr Terry Cutler’s proposed redesign of the research and development tax concession?

         Firstly, I congratulate Senator Joyce on his recent elevation. I understand you are now the Leader of the National Party in the Senate. I am hoping that means it comes with portfolio, as opposed to Senator Boswell’s term. I look forward to that.
        </p>

         Dr Cutler’s report has only just been handed to the government. I am sure we will be considering all of the points raised when we go to releasing a white paper, which my colleague the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator Carr, has carriage of. I am sure, had you asked Senator Carr the question about Dr Cutler’s report, that you would have received a far more comprehensive answer than I am able to give. I am quite happy to take on notice the rest of that question and to get you information. As I said, I am sure had you asked Senator Carr that question, you would have received a far more fulsome answer.

          , I ask a supplementary question. As the question pertains to Treasury modelling, it seems to make sense that I have asked it of the person who is representing the Treasurer. Since we are not prepared to—

             As I have indicated, the government will be releasing a white paper. Senator Carr and Mr Swan will be bringing that forward. It is envisaged that the white paper will be released by the end of 2008. My understanding is that Treasury modelling on this sort of information was never released in the 11½ years that you were in government—or semi-opposition or whatever you used to be in, Senator Joyce—but I will take that question on notice. If there is any further information I can get for you, I will get it for you.
