        I know that senators have over the years heard me rise in this chamber to speak of the Sutherland shire, an area that I am privileged to have lived in all my life and that I am very proud of. As many people know, it is known colloquially as ‘the shire’. It is said that when you google ‘
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutherland_Shire" rel="nofollow">
         Sutherland Shire
        </a>
        ’, it comes up as ‘God’s own country’. It is one of the most significant local government areas in Australia. It is the second largest local government area in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        in terms of population, with around 220,000 residents.
       </p>
       <p>
        It also contains some of the most significant historical and environmental locations in this country. I refer to such areas as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurnell_Peninsula" rel="nofollow">
         Kurnell Peninsula
        </a>
        , where
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Cook" rel="nofollow">
         Captain Cook
        </a>
        first landed, and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_National_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Royal National Park
        </a>
        , which, it is argued—with a great deal of historical basis—is the oldest national park in the world. There is a debate going on at the moment as to whether the oldest is the Royal National Park or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone_National_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Yellowstone National Park
        </a>
        . In any event, the Royal National Park is a significant national park in this country and internationally.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Towra_Point" rel="nofollow">
         Towra Point
        </a>
        is recognised as a significant wetlands area for its unique flora and fauna, particularly the migratory birds. The Port Hacking River is a beautiful river between Cronulla and the national park, first navigated by Bass and Flinders in 1796. The beaches of Cronulla and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bate_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Bate Bay
        </a>
        are some of the most famous, and regarded as some of the best, beaches not just in Australia but internationally. They are the home of some of our greatest surf clubs. The area also has other significant facilities: Australia’s only nuclear reactor and the significant oil refineries at Kurnell—and I could go on. It is a beautiful natural area with a thriving community, particularly for small business. It is also a very sensitive environmental area.
       </p>
       <p>
        Why do I speak of the Sutherland shire tonight, and particularly
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutherland_Shire_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Sutherland Shire Council
        </a>
        ? Firstly, because—it may be seen as a bit of a cliche but it is true—local government is closest to the people. We federal and state politicians may think that we are much maligned in the public arena; I can tell you that councillors—and I know this because my wife is on the council—receive very little praise and lots of complaints, everything from, ‘The garbage hasn’t been picked up,’ to more significant issues such as antisocial behaviour, graffiti and so on. We need to recognise just how important local government is in this country. This government, I am proud to say, has done that. It has picked up the tradition and the work that was done under the Whitlam government on giving local government a real place at the table. I congratulate Minister Albanese on his initiative in establishing the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Council
        </a>
        of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Local Government
        </a>
        . The Rudd and Gillard government have provided substantial additional funds to local government, particularly through the stimulus package.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tonight, I particularly want to congratulate the Sutherland Shire Council because it has achieved substantial recognition through a number of awards over the past 12 months. The most significant award that is granted to any local government area in this country is known as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AR" rel="nofollow">
         AR
        </a>
        Bluett Memorial Award. It is presented to councils, members of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government_Association" rel="nofollow">
         Local Government Association
        </a>
        . It really is the greatest accolade that a council can receive. The award is named after Albert Robert Bluett, who lived from 1879 to 1944. He was an outstanding figure in local government. He was appointed secretary and solicitor to the Local Government Association in 1910 and to the Shires Association in 1922 in New South Wales.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Sutherland Shire Council won that award this year and in the citation the judges stated that the council:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        ... has demonstrated with this submission that it has delivered to the Shire a very wide range of services and facilities while providing strong local leadership in community development. The Trustees were impressed with the Council’s Community Strategic Plan and its focus on people, place, nature and governance.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Council" rel="nofollow">
         The Council
        </a>
        completed a number of significant capital works projects, finalised an important regional environmental project, embarked on an emerging leaders program for managers, implemented its comprehensive Anti-Social Behaviour Strategy, strengthened its role in economic development and implemented its innovative Ageing Well Strategy. These and many other activities, including its successful community events program, demonstrated that the Council has achieved a very high level of relative progress in 2009/2010.
       </p>
       <p>
        The judges went on to list a number of specific projects. I will refer briefly to them. There was a project in Cronulla Central of $20 million, incorporating a new library, community hall, CBD offices, car park and commercial offices; the completion of the $10 million Engadine Community Centre, stage 1; the rehabilitation of the large waste disposal area at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Heights" rel="nofollow">
         Lucas Heights
        </a>
        , which has now become a regional sports facility and golf course development. The council finalised a voluntary planning agreement in an area of the Kurnell Peninsula where sand had been extracted for many years, which will see 91.3 hectares of open space transferred to the council and the development of 10 playing fields. This is a major achievement in an area that has needed remedial action for many years. The council has reconstructed the seawall on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Street" rel="nofollow">
         Prince Street
        </a>
        , Cronulla. The beaches of Sydney and other coastal places are battered every 10 years or so, on average, by substantial seas and this results in major damage to the seawalls. It is an expensive undertaking to repair them. The council was also recognised for the construction of its new rural fire service stations at Engadine and Woronora and also for expanding services at what is know as the SSHED, the Sutherland Shire Hub for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Development" rel="nofollow">
         Economic Development
        </a>
        —a business incubator which is now recognised around the country as a leader in that type of enterprise.
       </p>
       <p>
        The council has won further awards. I mentioned earlier the new facilities at Engadine—a senior citizens centre and a community hall where local theatre groups, musical groups and others can put on performances. This is truly a magnificent facility. I know, because I drive past it most days when I am not down here. That facility was short-listed as a finalist in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BEM" rel="nofollow">
         BEM
        </a>
        Property Consultants Local Government Award, along with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         City of Sydney
        </a>
        .
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_City" rel="nofollow">
         The City
        </a>
        of Sydney was nominated and short-listed as a finalist for its major renovations to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Town_Hall" rel="nofollow">
         Sydney Town Hall
        </a>
        . I do not mean any offence to the Sydney Town Hall, one of the most magnificent town halls in this country, but I am pleased to say that the winner of the award was Engadine Community Facilities. Another project that was recognised was the Sutherland Shire Hub for Economic Development, which I mentioned earlier. It was commended very highly by the New South Wales government for its program of dynamic support for entrepreneurs to increase their expertise and build better businesses. Time does not permit me to go through in detail some of the other achievements that the council was recognised for during the year.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have read and heard speeches by other members of parliament, particularly in the New South Wales parliament—including some from my own party—that have been critical of local government. They have tried to transfer all of the blame from themselves to local government. It is important that we recognise the great achievements of local councils such as Sutherland Shire Council.
