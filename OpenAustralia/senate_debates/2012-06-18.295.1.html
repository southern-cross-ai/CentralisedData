       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As at 31 December 2011:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) From which areas of expenditure will the enhanced force protection measures be made.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) What specific programs will be cut or deferred to meet this cost.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) Why did the Government cease disclosing deferrals in expenditure in the 2008 09 Budget which has continued through to the 2011 12 Budget.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) (a) What are the specific deferrals in expenditure since 2008 09; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) Why have these deferrals been made.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (5) What percentage increase, if any, will be made to enable future capital equipment initiatives over the forward estimates period.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (6) As it is not clear in the 2011 12 Budget, what specific projects are planned for approval in 2011 12.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (7) (a) What programs in 2011 12 will now have to be resourced through absorbed costs; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) What programs have been cancelled or deferred to enable these costs to be absorbed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (8) Of the $20.6 billion worth of savings under the Strategic Reform Program (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRP" rel="nofollow">
         SRP
        </a>
        ) it would appear that $4.6 billion of this involves the re allocation of funds and is not a savings item at all – how can this claim of savings be made when it is in fact a reallocation of funds.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (9) Under the SRP: (a) Why has the number of civilian employees to be cut been reduced from the forecast 3 125; and (b) What is the new figure.

         The Minister has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1)
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defence" rel="nofollow">
          The Defence
         </a>
         funded component of the Force Protection Review, $912 million, has been funded as follows:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         - reprogramming of the Defence Capability Program (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DCP" rel="nofollow">
          DCP
         </a>
         ), reprioritisation of lower priority initiatives and reprogramming of facilities program (primarily Single Leap 2) to better align its cash provision to the revised construction timetable ($436.1 million);
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         - existing capability projects ($402.3 million); and
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         - an amount of $73.5 million reallocated within Defence by rebalancing a very small number of DCP projects.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) Defence has either delayed or revised the expenditure spread for a total of 11 Defence Capability Plan Projects to fund the Force Protection Review.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) There was no reprogramming in the 2009-10 budget.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Appropriation reprogramming was undertaken in the 2010-11 budget as shown in the
         <i>
          Portfolio Budget Statements 2010-11
         </i>
         (Page 22, Table 10: Budget Measures and Other Budget Adjustments).
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Capital Investment reprogramming was undertaken in the 2011-12 budget as shown in the

         </i>
         (Page 28, Table 11: Defence 2011-12 Budget Measures and Other Budget Adjustments).

         <i>
          Portfolio Budget Statements 2011-12

         (6) Significant Defence Capability Plan (DCP) projects in development for consideration by Government were provided on pages 90 to 92, tables 44 and 45 of the
         <i>

         (8) The Strategic Reform Program (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRP" rel="nofollow">
          SRP
         </a>
         ) is a comprehensive program that features many aspects of reform that are not directly focused on efficiency. The reallocation of funds in the "Other Cost Reductions" component reflects an increase in the efficiency with which Defence allocated resources. It also reflects improved Defence planning and understanding of the Defence Budget. These are all key outcomes of the Strategic Reform Program.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (9) (a) and (b) As recommended by the Defence Budget Audit (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBA" rel="nofollow">
          DBA
         </a>
         ), Defence undertook a detailed diagnostic to validate the DBA findings to ensure reform is sustainable and achievable. This meant that Defence's approach to specific reform initiatives diverged from the initial analysis provided in the DBA. While workforce implications have changed following the diagnostics, the overall cost reduction target of $20 billion by 2018-19 will still be achieved.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_Parliament" rel="nofollow">
          Members of Parliament
         </a>
         and other interested parties have combined workforce reductions from efficiency savings and the 0.7 per cent productivity to give DBA workforce reduction totals of 3125 civilians and 1713 military compared to SRP reductions of 1708 civilians and 859 military.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The difference is attributed to adjustments to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMO" rel="nofollow">
          DMO

        <p class="italic">
         Within SRP, there is growth within civilian positions under the Workforce and Shared Services Reform (

          WSSR

         ) and Non Equipment Procurement Streams. The total workforce growth is 1,416 (Civilianisation 535 and Contractor Conversions 881) across the decade realizing approximately $1 billion in savings due to the reduced cost of employing civilians into these support roles.
