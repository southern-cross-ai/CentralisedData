         (Australian Labor Party, Minister for Foreign Affairs) |
         <a href="http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;adv=yes;orderBy=_fragment_number,doc_date-rev;page=0;query=Dataset%3Ahansards,hansards80%20Date%3A5%2F2%2F2013;rec=0;resCount=Default" title="The source of this piece of text">

        <p>
         The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1)   The slowing of the growth in the aid program to 0.5 per cent of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNI" rel="nofollow">
          GNI
         </a>
         from 2015-16 to 2016-17 has not resulted in a cut to current aid levels or in reduced Australian aid to any region. Assistance to all regions will increase by 2015-16, with the exception of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America" rel="nofollow">
          Latin America
         </a>
         and the Caribbean which will be maintained around its current level. The deferral has been achieved through a more graduated increase in aid to most regions than originally planned, and a more graduated increase in our support for multilaterals.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Growth adjustments were informed by consideration of targets set in the Comprehensive Aid Policy Framework and existing commitments to particular countries, regions, or initiatives.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2)   Membership of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Development_Bank" rel="nofollow">
          African Development Bank
         </a>
         (AfDB) will demonstrate Australia's commitment as a long-term development partner to Africa. To join the AfDB, a full treaty process, the passage of legislation through the Parliament, and agreement from AfDB members is required. These membership processes are not expected to be concluded before 2014.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Australian membership of the AfDB offers the opportunity to extend our reach and impact in Africa and to work more effectively in more development areas than are possible when working alone or through bilateral mechanisms.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_AfDB" rel="nofollow">
          The AfDB
         </a>
         works in areas that are critical to spurring sustainable growth and reducing poverty in Africa.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bank" rel="nofollow">
          The Bank
         </a>
         received a favourable review in the Australian Multilateral Assessment, which found that funding to the Bank would deliver tangible development benefits in line with Australia's aid objectives and represent value for money.
