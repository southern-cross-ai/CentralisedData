We want to give them an opportunity. There are already nearly 200 people in Townsville at the moment who rely on the Adani project for their job. Just over 100 rely on Adani directly for their job. There are about 80 contractors as well. We've learnt this week that the Labor Party are teaming up to put these 200 people in Townsville out of a job. We've got the former

                I can. One of the reasons I and the government are so supportive of this project is that it is supported by the traditional owners of the land. It's supported by the traditional owners of the land, the Wangan and Jagalingou people, who are the owners of where the mine is. Those peoples met in Maryborough last year and voted 293 to one in favour of the project, but those over there, the Labor Party over there, want to ignore a 293 to one result and deny those people the jobs.

                     ; it will also provide thousands of jobs right across Rockhampton and Townsville and the wider region. As I said, there are already 200 people who have a job on this project right now. They risk losing that job if the Labor Party continue to have their position, which is opposed to the project. Over another 120 jobs will be created at a company called Austrak in Rockhampton, building concrete sleepers. More jobs will be sustained in Whyalla, where the steel will come from to build the railway line. This project is a nation-building project.

He says, 'My ambition is to have a deep-caved abdomen defined by deep-cut obliques'. Well, that's very good for Mr Carr. He wants to have a six-pack while denying people in
