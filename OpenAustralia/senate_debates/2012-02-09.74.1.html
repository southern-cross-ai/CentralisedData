        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
         Climate Change
        </a>
        and Energy Efficiency, Senator Wong. I refer the minister to the evaluation by the firm Hall and Partners Open Mind, relied upon in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANAO" rel="nofollow">
         ANAO
        </a>
        audit of the multimillion-dollar carbon tax advertising campaign, which found that the effectiveness of the campaign was 'disappointing' and that: 'There was limited acceptance of key messages related to carbon pricing and household assistance.' Does the minister accept the findings of the independent evaluation upon which the ANAO report relied, that the $31½ million campaign is a disappointing failure?

         I am asked about the Audit Office report into the Clean Energy Future campa­ign. I am very pleased to respond on that report because that was a report that was invited by the Leader of the Opposition, who claimed the advertising was misleading, and the

            Order! The minister has one minute 22 remaining. I believe the minister is addressing the question. I am listening to the minister's answer closely, and the minister needs to come to the matter.

             </a>
             confirmed that a number of other statements that the opposition were complai­ning of were correct, including that the gove­rnment will use more than half the carbon price revenue to assist households and that nine out of 10 households will receive assist­ance through tax cuts, increased family bene­fits or higher pensions or other payments.

             In relation to the effectiveness or other­wise of the campaign, I do not have any briefing on the specific quote in a consult­ant's report to the ANAO to which Senator Brandis is referring, but I would say this: the opposition made a range of claims that were inaccurate, asserting that the facts in the campaign were false, and Mr Abbott's allegations have been found to be untrue, have been found to not be correct.

               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                … did not demonstrate consistent adherence to internal guidance, the

                <p>
                 First, it is the case that the report identifies some concerns with processes adopted by the Department of
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
                  Climate Change
                 </a>
                 and Energy Efficiency. This should not be confused with a conclusion that the campaign contained statements that were inaccurate. In fact, the report explicitly states:
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 While issues were identified with the sources cited by DCCEE for campaign statements, this did not mean that the statements themselves were wrong or could not be supported by other sources of information.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Isn't it interesting—the selective quoting of the opposition! I would remind those opposite: if you really care about transpar­ency and you really care about making sure campaigns are accurate, one would not have ever got that impression from the way Senator Abetz and Howard government ministers used to run government advertising when they were in government.
