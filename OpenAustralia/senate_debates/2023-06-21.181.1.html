        Over the winter break, we will be marking the 115th birthday of the Hon. Dame
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annabelle_Rankin" rel="nofollow">
         Annabelle Rankin
        </a>
        . Annabelle Rankin was the first woman in Queensland to be elected to federal parliament, and the first woman to serve as a minister for a federal department. She was a remarkable woman who dedicated a lifetime of service to Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dame Annabelle's story within the Liberal Party—my party—is characterised by her tireless advocacy for women's empowerment. Through her actions, she demonstrated that being a woman in politics did not require conforming to preconceived notions or compromising one's values. Instead, she remained steadfast in championing the principles of the individual, of fairness and of equal opportunity for all, regardless of background. With 24 years of service in the Senate and over five years as a minister for housing, Dame Annabelle Rankin became the first mother of the Senate due to her continuous long-standing service.
       </p>
       <p>
        Annabelle was a proud lifelong Liberal. Her father, Colin, had been a state MP in the Queensland parliament. Dame Annabelle's story is a story of our party. Her parents, Colin, a Scottish immigrant, and her mother, also Annabelle, married in Maryborough in 1906. Dame Annabelle grew up near Childers and completed her education as a border at the Glennie School in Toowoomba. Indeed, I looked at buying her house, at one point, in the small township of Howard. It was a beautiful Queenslander. It was her childhood home, but sadly it was well above my price range.
       </p>
       <p>
        As an unmarried woman with fortunate parents, the stereotypes at the time would have had it that Dame Annabelle would never enter the workforce, but this did not deter her. She taught at her local school and travelled the world, supporting the less fortunate in impoverished parts of London and refugees fleeing the

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Annabelle returned to work in 1940. In 1946, she was offered a position with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations
        </a>
        . However, she declined this position so that she could enter politics in Australia. Dame Annabelle also became the first person to be appointed head of a foreign mission following her appointment as

        </a>
        . Dame Annabelle's journey in the Liberal Party stands as a testament to her resilience and her unwavering commitment to advancing the representation of women.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dame Annabelle's dedication to gender equality within the Liberal Party was not limited to rhetoric. She actively worked to increase women's representation and involvement in politics. She was backed by Prime Minister Harold Holt to become the first departmental minister, despite opposition from some backward fringes. Annabelle paved the way for more women to enter the political arena, fostering a stronger, more inclusive Liberal Party. I want to pay tribute to some young women in my party, the

        , who are doing that today.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to pay tribute to Kate Samios, the newly elected president of the Young

        and broader LNP movement in Queensland. I'm proud to call all of those five friends of mine.
       </p>
       <p>
        As we commemorate Dame Annabelle Rankin's 115th birthday, let us continue to draw inspiration from her example. Let all of us strive to create a political landscape where our party promotes more Dame Annabelle Rankins at all levels and to leadership roles within our party. A country where all voices are amplified, regardless of gender and ethnicity, and where those diverse contributions are celebrated is a good country. It is a country that was built by the Liberal Party. It is a country that was built by the coalition. So long we may remember the contribution of Dame Annabelle Rankin.
