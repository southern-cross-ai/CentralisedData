            Pursuant to contingent notice, I move:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            That so much of standing orders be suspended as would prevent me from moving a motion to provide for the consideration of general business notice of motion No. 1231.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is a particularly important motion. It's an order for the production of documents. I'm absolutely shocked that Senator
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Sullivan" rel="nofollow">
             O'Sullivan
            </a>
            would think it's acceptable to come into this place and yet again deny formality to a motion and disrupt, quite frankly, the orderly business of this chamber. This is a perfectly legitimate approach that Senator Hanson-Young has asked this chamber to consider. If he wants to vote no, he's got an opportunity to vote no. Senator Hanson-Young is seeking an order for the production of documents on a very important issue to do with water, to do with the Murray-Darling Basin, which has been so comprehensively mismanaged in this country. She has a perfect right to ask for these documents under an order for the production of documents, which is what she did.
           </p>
           <p>
            The management of these lakes, as I understand it and recall from when I had this portfolio over a decade ago, is a very important part of the way that we manage water in the Murray-Darling Basin. I urge this chamber to support the suspension of standing orders so that Senator Hanson-Young can move this motion so as to ensure that the order for the production of documents is dealt with and voted on. Senator O'Sullivan and that side of the chamber can make their opinion well known to this place at that time, but at least allow us to put this motion in order to debate it.

               When you are finished I'll continue. So, it was co-sponsored, a reference was put up, and we travelled all over the country to investigate these very issues. Senator Hanson-Young turned up at one committee meeting, disrupted it and made allegations that she couldn't substantiate. Notwithstanding that she's been confronted by both the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
                Australian Labor Party
               </a>
               and our side of politics to withdraw the allegations in this place, at the committee meeting and at private meetings of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee, she has failed to do that. So her opportunity to be able to get every one of these documents at some prior time through the power of a references committee of this Senate has been and passed. So you can only draw one conclusion: again, there is a pure political motive behind this particular motion here today.
              </p>
              <p>
               That aside, I love the indignation of the Greens. It is very well refined. They've been denying formality on motions in this place regularly. But, of course, when the time comes and formality is denied to their motions—and I heard Senator Anning made a contribution before that they better get used to it, and I would agree with his contribution—all we get is this false indignation from them about interfering in the course of them being able to put a question to the floor of the Senate to be voted on.
              </p>
              <p>
               We all know how this all started. I put a question to the floor of the Senate to have it voted on, and I had formality denied—and that has been done on a number of occasions, including yesterday. So this will go on and on. It is a denial of free speech—although, in this case, of course, Senator Hanson-Young can't make that case.

               Simply because she had a complete references committee where she could have asked every one of these questions and asked for every one of these documents, but she didn't turn up. She didn't turn up. She didn't front. It was her inquiry, co-sponsored with the Australian Labor Party, and she didn't turn up. There's a bit of

                                       The question is that Senator Di Natale be suspended from the sitting of the Senate. If this motion is passed, Senator Di Natale will be suspended from now until the end of the sitting day today. At any time, Senator Di Natale is able to come to the Senate and withdraw his comments and if the Senate allows the suspension will be waived. If Senator Di Natale doesn't wish to take that opportunity, I will put the motion.

                                          was asked to withdraw, and he did. As a party of government, we have always made clear, often in difficult circumstances such as today, that in opposition and in government we support the procedures of the Senate and have always supported rulings of the President of the day. It is clear from the advice that I was provided that Senator Di Natale was given an opportunity to withdraw by the Senate and refused to do so. In those circumstances—and we would apply this across the chamber—the opposition is left with no option but to support the chair in their reasonable exercise of standing orders. I do make clear again that nothing in the opposition's actions today in any way endorses the statement that was made by Senator O'Sullivan in this chamber, which I and the opposition regard as reprehensible.

Real men don't insult and threaten women, they don't slut-shame them and they don't attack them and make them feel bullied in their workplace. I have sat in this chamber for weeks and weeks—months—and heard the disgusting slurs and attacks coming from a particular group in this place, and I for one am sick of it, and I know many of my female colleagues on all sides of politics are sick of it, too. I will name you because you are not fit to be in this chamber, you're not fit to represent your constituents and you're not fit to call yourselves men: Senator O'Sullivan, Senator Anning, Senator Bernardi and Senator Leyonhjelm. You day after day come into this place, hurl insults across this chamber and play the gender card, and, the moment anyone stands up to you, you have the most fragile glass jaws of all. You are cowards. Every time you get called out, you refuse to stand by it.

                                             No, I'm actually trying to defend her against being yelled at. So I would ask those opposite—I know that this is a difficult debate, but perhaps we can let Senator Hanson-Young finish and, if government senators wish to respond, they can. So could we try and maintain some dignity in a very difficult time. I have not, in the time I have been here, seen the motion passed that we have just passed, so perhaps we can all reflect soberly on the fact that we've just had to do that.

                                              was a pig. He was asked to withdraw, and he has refused. I back him in that. However, I do reflect on what Senator Wong has just called for, and that is a little more decorum in this place. But let me say: decorum does not mean sitting by and staying silent while people bully and intimidate. A particular group of men come into this place and hurl insults across the chamber. Expect to be called out and expect to be named and shamed from here on in, or lift the standards.

                                              The Australian people are sick of seeing politics degenerate to such a disgusting, low level. If we actually treated each other a bit better in this place, the voters would be better off, the parliament would be better off and perhaps we could all get on with our damned jobs!

This is the place where we transact the people's business. I would note that, over the course of this week and recent weeks, that section of the day known as 'housekeeping', where motions are moved—where they're meant to be moved without debate—has, increasingly, become fraught, and has, increasingly, become a part of the sitting day that does not reflect well on this chamber.

All of us should seek to be our best selves and to present this chamber in its best light as we all seek to do that which we are elected to do, which is to undertake business on behalf of the people who elected us here. It is appropriate that we do pause and reflect.

                                                  She came in late. Basically, Senator Hanson-Young is a great actress—a really great actress. So she will get up and she will make her comments here. Talking about making sexist statements in this chamber or accusing others in this chamber of constantly having a go at Sarah Hanson-Young, the senator, or at the Greens is hypocritical, because, constantly, over the last 2½ years, I have had comments thrown at me, constantly, all the time, on how I am a racist. And other comments have been made towards me. I just see this as crocodile tears, as theatrical and to get sympathy. And using the 'sexist' tag because she's a female doesn't wash, with me or a lot of other people.

                                                  that were very much uncalled for and shouldn't have been said. So, I'd say to the Greens: it's a two-way street in here. You can't keep dishing it out to everyone else and not expect to get the same back. We all have a place in this parliament. We've all been voted in by the Australian people, and we all should have respect for each other. We may not agree on political views or issues, but the fact is that we all have the right to have a say in this chamber—

What I'm saying is that we need to respect each other, who have been elected here to this parliament. Respect has not been shown to some of us on the crossbench by the Greens, and their comments across this chamber are unacceptable. Don't start crying wolf when the fact is that sometimes the finger needs to be pointed at the Greens and at their behaviour in this chamber. I don't believe Senator

                                                       was Prime Minister. That was actually before my time in parliament—more than 15 years ago. I made a statement when parliament resumed here in August about behaviour in this chamber, about the language, about the example we set and about how this chamber needs to operate. I ask every senator to reflect not just on what they think they're saying but on how it may be received or interpreted by another with a different life experience or perspective than yourself. That applies to a statement that may seem innocuous. It applies to a pejorative label that someone else may take deep offence to. There are very few people in politics who have a halo and who can't reflect on something they might have said that could have been expressed better. But if we cannot debate and act civilly in this chamber—which is the most representative chamber in this country and is the prime legislative chamber of this parliament—then how can we expect people outside the chamber to debate and argue and disagree respectfully?

It is regrettable that I had to ask the Senate to enforce a ruling with respect to the privilege of the chair. I hope I don't have to do that again.

                                                          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Sullivan" rel="nofollow">
                                                           O'Sullivan
                                                          </a>
                                                          was making his statements.

                                                         <p>
                                                          I know that Senator Di Natale did not make his decision to not withdraw very lightly. No senator in this place, I would think, wants to get suspended. But that is how strongly Senator Di Natale feels about what has been happening in this chamber, about what we have been enduring in this part of the chamber. It is not just the usual banter—and we all engage in that usual banter. It is not the usual banter. As a woman, I can say that I was extremely offended by what I heard Senator O'Sullivan say—which I will never repeat. It was an awful thing for him to say. But the senator gets to withdraw an awful, disgusting statement that we've all heard, and that's it.
                                                         </p>

                                                          That is not good enough, and that's the point that Senator Di Natale was making. To utter those statements—and it's not the first type of awful statement that we have heard at this end of the chamber, which I acknowledge,
                                                          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">

It is not acceptable. But somebody gets to say that and then withdraw it. That is the point that Senator Di Natale is trying to make. That is not acceptable behaviour. We have been enduring it for a long time. I agree with you that things have to change. It needs some leadership for it to change. But I hope never to hear somebody say that type of thing again in this Senate.

I'm not required to name a senator who denies leave. I've asked that previously. Leave has been denied by a member of the Senate, so at this point, unless someone else is seeking leave, we resume the suspension of standing orders debate. You were in the middle of your speech, Senator O'Sullivan. It was two minutes remaining on the motion to suspend standing orders to allow the motion that Senator Siewert moved to be considered as a formal motion.
