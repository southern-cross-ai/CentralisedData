        My question is directed to Senator Evans, representing the Prime Minister. Has the government sought legal advice on the Attorney-General’s remarks and, in particular, on the possibility that the remarks may provide a ground for appeal against the convictions of Benbrika and his co-accused?

         I have no advice to that effect. I am happy to take the question on notice. Certainly I have not been briefed to the effect that there was any need for us to be seeking such advice, but I will take the question on notice and if there is any information I can get that might assist then I will report it to the chamber as soon as possible.

          , I ask a supplementary question. How can the parliament have confidence in the Attorney-General as first law officer of the Crown when by his conduct he has, in the words of the trial judge in the Benbrika case, potentially caused difficulties in what the Attorney-General himself has described as Australia’s most important terrorism prosecution to date?

           I am happy to respond even though I am not sure it is a supplementary question given that I took the first on notice. As I said to the senator’s earlier question, the Attorney-General was commenting on the decisions taken—the outcomes of the trial that were made public on Monday. I think it is appropriate that he do so. He has provided public information and support for the agencies who led that successful investigation—which I think we are all supportive of. I have complete confidence in the Attorney-General, as do all other members of the government.
