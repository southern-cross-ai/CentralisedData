        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
         Climate Change
        </a>
        and Energy, Senator Wong. The

        <i>

        report. Unsurprisingly, it finds that the climate systems that touch on every aspect of our lives and our environment are changing before our very eyes. Our country has already warmed by 1.47 degrees. Fires, floods and cyclones are more intense. Extracting and burning coal and gas is the biggest cause of the climate crisis. Minister, do you support Australia's coal and gas export industry expanding?

         I will first respond to the
         <i>
          State of the climate
         </i>
         <i>
          2022
         </i>
         report and say, like Senator Waters and, I hope, most people who look at this issue rationally—and I'm afraid that doesn't necessarily include many opposite—that it is a deeply concerning report. It is a report that's released every two years. It shows an increase in extreme heat events and heavy rainfall, longer fire seasons and sea level rises. It shows, as Senator Waters said, Australia's land climate has warmed by an average of 1.47 degrees since national records began in 1910.

             But I'm actually quite pleased with the interjections because it reminds us yet again why the frame that Senator Waters has put to me is not the answer to what we have to deal with. It is not a single industry's fault. It is not a single employer's fault. It is not a single place's fault. We have to engineer a transition of the Australian economy and the global economy, and we have to do that together and we have to do it from government.
            </p>
            <p>
             For years, we have been arguing for this. And I am pleased that we finally have a parliament, in both chambers, which does want to act on climate. I also understand why it is that the Greens political party seeks to make this entirely about one issue.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is about transitioning the whole of the economy, it is about reducing the emissions that we produce and it is part of doing what Minister Bowen did at the Conference of the Parties, which is: being part of a global solution to what is a global problem. And no amount of finger-pointing, domestically, for political purposes, will yield the outcome that we want.

               Minister, I note that you conveniently didn't answer the aspect of the question about whether you support expanding the coal and gas export industry. However, I'll press on.
              </p>
              <p>
               Yesterday on Sky News, I'm informed, the

                Managing Director

                Okay. Well, that's good to know—genuinely! We do agree on something.
               </p>
               <p>
                The position the government has been very clear about is that we will reduce our emissions by 43 per cent by 2030 and we will aim to get to 82 per cent renewables by 2030. I would also make this point: the market is moving. It is moving domestically and it is moving internationally—and I know those opposite want to howl at the moon over this, but it is. And what that does show is that the reliance in the global energy markets on fossil fuels, over time, to 2050, will reduce. So whatever individual companies might say, that is the reality.

                  , in response to a question about Pacific island concern on Australia's push for more coal and gas, that coal is an important industry for Australia. Is this still your view?

                   I think that anybody who has looked at the history of Australia and at Australia's current export profile would know the monetary value that coal has provided to all of us. It has funded a lot of the public infrastructure, including those things that you wish for—Medicare and so forth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   But the point is: as the world moves to 2050, it is inevitable that we will have to ensure that we export goods and services into a global market that is a net zero market. So that means we have to transition our economy to do much more for the new economies and the clean energy economy than we have in the past. So, rather than just trying to make it about one industry and those who work in it—and vilifying those who work in it, which is what the Greens political party do—what I want to do and what we want to do is to transition our economy, so our children get the chance to have the prosperity we have had, but on the basis of clean energy and a net zero economy.

                                It is sad that even when we have a government that is serious about doing something about climate change and is in here talking about it, the Greens want to just carry on with their usual stunts. This report does show that we are experiencing changes to weather and climate extremes, which are happening at an increased pace across Australia. Australia's climate has warmed by 1.47 degrees on average since national records began in 1910, and the impacts are being experienced across the country. While Australia has always been known as a land of drought and flooding rain, the past five years have been beyond anything we have seen in our history. This report shows an increase in extreme heat events, intense heavy rains, longer fire seasons and sea level rises. We've lurched from prolonged drought into the

                                The report found that continued increasing temperatures are leading to more heat extremes and fewer cold extremes. What this means is that there is an increase in the number of dangerous fire weather days and longer fire danger seasons across southern and eastern Australia. We can also expect to see more heatwaves; heat is already our most dangerous natural hazard, killing more people than all other hazards combined. I want to acknowledge the work between the

                                   Thank you, Senator Smith. This government is always going to be standing shoulder to shoulder with communities when disasters hit by providing the necessary support to help them respond and recover. But by better preparing for natural disasters, we can protect lives and livelihoods, and lower damage bills from floods, fires and cyclones.

                                   Last night in this place the legislation to create the Disaster Ready Fund was passed. That was an election commitment of the Albanese government, and now we've delivered. This fund was also confirmed in last month's budget, with up to $1 billion to be made available over the next five years for important disaster mitigation projects. We also know that the most effective way to assist Australians struggling with insurance costs is to better safeguard properties from the impacts of natural disasters. This fund will provide up to $200 million per year to invest in mitigation projects like flood levees, cyclone shelters, firebreaks and evacuation centres around Australia—funds that were previously locked away by the coalition in their failed Emergency Response Fund. In the meantime, we're also helping Australians recover from the current floods, having spent—

                                      Thank you, Senator Smith. Before addressing that, I might just mention that since January some 2.9 million people in Australia have accessed more than $3 billion in Australian government disaster recovery payments and $195 million provided through the Disaster Recovery Allowance program.
                                     </p>
                                     <p>
                                      But you asked what previous governments could have done differently. Firstly, the coalition could have, at any point over the past decade, acknowledged that climate change is real. Instead, we saw 10 years of government led climate wars—we're into the eleventh year now, it would appear—that held our country back, exposed Australians to risk and made us an international disgrace. With Senator Rennick and Senator Canavan still in the party room today showing that they have learnt absolutely nothing and that they still don't believe the science, we know that the coalition will never come around on the basic science.

                                          As I was saying, what we've heard even today from Senator Rennick and Senator Canavan, among their colleagues, shows that nothing has changed. There are so many things the former government could have done. It could have spent a single cent from its Emergency Response Fund on just one disaster mitigation project. Instead it just earned interest.
