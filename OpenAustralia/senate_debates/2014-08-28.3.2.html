       <p>
        The opposition indicated earlier this morning that they were prepared to offer the private senators' business time this morning, to facilitate completion of the Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill 2014, and that, if that was concluded, they proposed, and we accepted, that the Senate would return to the private senators' bills as listed. I think that was a sensible proposition, which we were happy to accept, and between that offer and 9.30, I understand, the whips have been contacting the Greens and the crossbenchers to indicate this change in plan.

         The opposition was very keen to work to ensure that this important legislation came to the chamber and could be concluded as quickly as possible. We knew that there was a great deal of interest in this bill because of the importance of the money flowing through to the local governments. They have expressed their interest in that. We also know that there were many speakers who wanted to be part of this debate, so it is important that we go through that.
        </p>
        <p>
         We want to put on record very clearly, though, that, in terms of private senators' business, we are committed to ensuring that private senators' business does get the consideration it should have in our program. So this is not going to be a regular offer, as the government should understand; this was for a particular purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
         We were concerned that there was not enough work being done by the government to ensure that this was being brought forward for debate, so we are putting on record that we think this is important. We acknowledge the pressure that has been put on by community members to ensure that we consider this bill and put it through quickly so that the House can consider it and we can look at what we can do with the process.
        </p>
        <p>
         We acknowledge that it is the role of the government to determine the schedule of business. We will work cooperatively with the government when we can. But we think it was important that we actually offer this up at this time to allow the process to continue.

          are not going to stand in the way of this change that is being proposed, but I want to put it very firmly on the record that I think it is a disgraceful effort from the Labor Party and the Palmer United Party that they got themselves into such a mess that we have ended up giving up private members' time—which we have so little of in this place—to the government when in fact that bill could have been debated and finished next week. There is no reason why that could not have happened. As to giving up private members' time, we have fought so hard in this Senate to have private members' time, for the opposition parties and the crossbench, for years. And to see a debacle like this shows exactly what this Senate is going to be subjected to if people do not get their act together.
         </p>
         <p>
          So we will allow this debate to proceed, but I want it on the record that we do not agree with giving up private members' time for government business.
