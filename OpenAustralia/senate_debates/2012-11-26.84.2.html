        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Lundy. I refer to the detention statistics published by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Immigration_and_Citizenship" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Immigration and Citizenship
        </a>
        five years ago on 23 November 2007, the day before Labor was elected, that noted that there were just four people in all forms of detention who had arrived illegally by boat in Australia. How many people who have arrived illegally by boat are today in detention or on a bridging visa?

         At the moment we are, of course, in the process of implementing the recommendations of the expert working panel. It is unfortunate to see how much glee the coalition get out of the number of boats that have arrived when they have for so long held up reinstating offshore processing due to their cheap and nasty political calculations. It is the same hypocritical calculation the coalition have made to prevent the implementation of the Malaysia arrangement. They just do not want the government's border protection policies to proceed.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are of course committed to implementing the recommendations of the expert panel, of which reopening Nauru and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manus_Island" rel="nofollow">
          Manus Island
         </a>
         were priority recommendations to stop the flow of boats and prevent the loss of life on dangerous journeys to Australia. As the minister and the members of the expert panel have said many times, the real results will begin to show as more of the recommendations can be implemented. They work as a suite of measures, and no-one in this government has ever said Nauru, Manus Island or any of them would work on their own.

          , I rise on a point of order in relation to relevance. My question was actually quite a simple one today to enable the minister to be directly relevant. It is merely a comparison of the figures that I gave the Senate in relation to the number of people who were in detention—all four of them—the day before the Rudd government was elected to office. My question is merely: how many people are today in detention, whether or not they are in detention or on a bridging visa?

           On the point of order: Senator Lundy has been giving a comprehensive answer to the question asked of her. She is allowed two minutes to respond to the question. She has been going only half of that time. I suggest that she is being absolutely relevant to the question asked of her and has provided context about detention and bridging visa policy.

             As I was saying, we are in the process of implementing. In terms of the direct comparison, the numbers I have before me relate to the number of boats and irregular maritime arrivals, not 'illegals', as they are incorrectly called by the coalition. The number of
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMA" rel="nofollow">
              IMA
             </a>
             s in 2012 was 15,667, with the number of boats totalling 252. I do have the accumulated numbers across the previous years, but, I think, for the purposes of this question, the coalition are making yet another cheap point. They failed to support our Malaysia arrangement and the full suite of operations and recommendations—

                  Senator Cash asked this question and knows full well that, under the arrangements between the Grants Commission and the way in which the states are compensated across that system, there is an allowance for the net overall migration. I am not able to provide the exact figures that Senator Cash requires but make the point that it is all well and good for Senator Cash to stand up and ask these comparative questions when this opposition have continually stymied and blocked our efforts to manage our borders and to stop the flow of boats.

                   They have done that deliberately and cynically because they want to see the policy fail. They have failed to support the recommendations of the independent expert panel and they continue to do so, as you can see by the disruption across the chamber.

                    , I ask a further supplementary question. Can the minister guarantee that state and territory services and taxpayers will not be worse off by the government's decision to release into the community on welfare thousands of asylum seekers who have arrived on illegal boats?

                     Again, as Senator Cash well knows, we have a comprehensive program with regard to the releases into the community. For many people who find themselves embarking on the settlement process when they are found to be owed protection, our settlement service provision provides for not only English language training for those people but also a range of quite specific settlement services.

                      My question was not in relation to the types of programs that are accessible under the humanitarian services program. My question was a very, very specific one: can the government guarantee that the state and territory services and taxpayers will not be worse off as a result of the government's decision?

                        I reject the premise of the question, because contained within it is an implication that there is a burden. There is not. We are providing the Asylum Seeker Assistance Scheme and, where necessary, the community assistance scheme, and those programs have been well in place for some time. So the implication is designed to cause division and to—
