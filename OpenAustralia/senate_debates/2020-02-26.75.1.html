         I thank Senator Fawcett for the question. I am advised that the number of diagnosed cases of coronavirus has now exceeded 80,000. Just over 2,750 people have now lost their lives due to the coronavirus. In terms of the 80,000, the majority have been reported from mainland China, with 2,752 cases reported from 39 countries and regions outside of mainland China. The situation globally has seen significant jumps in Japan,

          South Korea
         </a>
         , Iran and parts of northern Italy, with Austria, Switzerland and Croatia reporting their first confirmed cases. Twenty-five per cent of all reported cases outside of mainland China are associated with the

         cruise ship, while 36 per cent are from South Korea.
        </p>
        <p>
         As the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health have stated, Australia is not immune to the coronavirus and its impacts, but we are as best prepared as any country can be in the world today. The government's decisions from the outset have been to exercise an abundance of caution. That continues, and we are not complacent going forward. The government is working constantly to keep Australians safe. That is our No. 1 priority.

         On 21 January the

          Chief Medical Officer
         </a>
         made the decision to declare coronavirus a disease of pandemic potential. This triggered a series of actions in Australia: the standing up of the national incident centre, the standing up of the National Medical Stockpile, the readiness and activation of the national trauma centre, daily meetings of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee and meetings of state, territory and Commonwealth health ministers to discuss pandemic readiness.

            Twenty-three cases of what is now being referred to as COVID-19 have been confirmed in Australia. Fifteen cases have been identified in the general population. All 15 of those cases have now been cleared and discharged from hospital. This is a positive step and a positive reflection on the Australian health and medical services system. Eight cases have been diagnosed associated with the

               Again, as the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health state, our priority is to keep Australians safe. The Prime Minister said:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               There's a global virus and we are seeking to contain the virus.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               Unfortunately there will be instances where there will be inconveniences for those who would have been in transit and travelling.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               That's regrettable but you have to put Australia’s national interests first.
              </p>
              <p>
               We will continue implementing border measures to screen passengers on flights and vessels from mainland China and for people who have been in or transited through mainland China in the past 14 days. These measures are all kept under regular review. We will also continue to work in close cooperation with state and territory government authorities and our international partners. The government can reassure Australians that our nation is well-equipped and prepared for this global health challenge.
