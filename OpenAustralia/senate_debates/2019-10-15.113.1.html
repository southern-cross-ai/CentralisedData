        (ii) there are an estimated 100 living survivors in Australia who are experiencing rapid deterioration of their health and quality of life,

       <p class="italic">
        (iii) the Community Affairs References Committee conducted an inquiry on support for Australia's thalidomide survivors, and the committee reported on 22 March 2019 and found the current supports available to thalidomide survivors are inadequate; the committee made 11 recommendations, including that the Government should issue a formal apology, as well as provide compensation to enable survivors to live with their disability—the findings received unanimous support from the committee,

           The Morrison government recognises the plight of victims of thalidomide and understands that they have suffered from circumstances outside of their control. The experience of thalidomide has been a national tragedy. The government is working on finalising its response as a matter of priority. A response to the recommendations of the Senate inquiry is complex and requires cross-portfolio consideration. Therefore, we will not be dictated to on timing by those who have never been in a position to enact change nor those who failed to enact change when they were in a position to do so.
