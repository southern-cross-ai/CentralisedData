         Thank you, very much, Senator Williams. Our government knows that a strong national economy doesn't just happen by accident; it takes discipline, careful planning and a willingness to back small, medium and large businesses to create jobs. And, because we believe in these things, we can take decisions as a government when and where we can and after careful consideration to help stimulate local regional economies. That's why the Liberal-National government has been investing a record $75 billion in infrastructure and delivering essential services, such as telecommunications, health and education to support growth across regional Australia, and that is why we've also developed a strategic and targeted decentralisation agenda.
        </p>
        <p>
         Over the past five years, our government has been able to shift over 1,100 public servant jobs out of Canberra, out of capital cities and into other areas of our nation. Last week, on Friday, in beautiful

           Senator Cameron, it's funny you say that. I find it interesting that the party of Whitlam, the party of the Prime Minister who backed decentralisation in the 70s in a way that the minister responsible in your opposition won't do, seek to actually critique moving jobs into regional communities where it makes sense to do so. Not only will it stimulate local economies but, as the acting

           said, 'I'm an ex-mariner. There aren't many ships and there aren't many boats in Canberra. It makes sense for us as an authority to be located on the ground, serving those communities which we seek to as public servants, and it makes absolutely policy sense.' It was an absolute privilege to announce that last week.

              Decentralisation is core business for our government. We know it's supported by people living in our congested cities and it's also, importantly, supported by those who live out in regional Australia. It brings new ideas and new faces into our communities and, importantly, brings new wages to stimulate local economies, more kids to our schools and more local volunteers to our
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFA" rel="nofollow">
               CFA
              </a>
              s, because we know that the public servants who head to our regional capitals and beyond are welcomed by those communities. But, importantly, part of our decentralisation agenda as a government isn't just about shifting public servant jobs out to the regions; it's about actually ensuring that the private sector avails itself of the advantages of operating out in the regions. It makes policy sense to place those public servants where the impact of their decisions will be most keenly felt. It makes economic sense and policy sense and it's core business for our government.

                 Yes, there is a risk. Unfortunately, it would seem that Gough Whitlam's party, the former party for decentralisation, is absolutely turning its back on advocating for moving public sector jobs out into the regions—even out to Albury-Wodonga. We as a government want the benefit of a strong national economy. It shouldn't be restricted to just those in our major cities; it should be felt right across our nation. Under our government, we've been able to grow that, with over 1,100 jobs delivered into the regions. The announcement last week of the jobs from
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMSA" rel="nofollow">
                  AMSA

                 out to

                  Coffs Harbour
                 </a>
                 , down to Hobart, up into Darwin and to Geraldton and beyond is just the start. We have a plan to grow our regions. Someone mentioned earlier the APVMA. The APVMA received nearly 300 job applications for up to 50 positions. That is in demand. They are spoilt for choice for scientists who want to shift to Armidale.
