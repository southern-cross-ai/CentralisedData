         Australia led the world in letting women vote, and now our country should lead the world in letting young people aged 16 and 17 vote.
        </p>
        <p>
         Last week the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
          New Zealand
         </a>
         Supreme Court found that it was discriminatory and a breach of human rights to deny 16- and 17-year-olds the right and the opportunity to vote. Now, Australia doesn't have a national bill of rights, something that the Greens would like us to have, but the argument is the same: people should have a say in decisions that affect them.
        </p>
        <p>
         Young people are more politically aware than ever before, and they will be directly disadvantaged by—amongst other things—climate change, cost-of-living pressures, the cost of getting an education, responses to sexual assault, gender inequality and growing housing unaffordability. Sixteen- and 17-year-olds make a significant contribution to Australian society. They can work. They can drive. They can pay taxes. They are carers. They are students. They are renters. At 17 they can fight in wars. Yet currently they are denied a say in who represents them and how their tax dollars are spent. Young people inherit a planet and an economy impacted by decisions that they have no say in.
        </p>
        <p>
         Detractors often say, 'Kids don't even understand politics.' But young people have found ways to work outside the electoral system to call for the changes needed to protect their futures: from the schools' strikes for climate; legal action on whether the environment minister owes kids a duty of care; young women signing petitions and meeting with politicians, crying out for decent consent education to drive down the rates of sexual assault amongst their peers; to the young man I met last weekend, Ned Heaton, who at age 11 started a campaign to end plastic toothbrushes and replace them with bamboo toothbrushes—he's now 15 and has written a book, a great Christmas gift for kids who love oceans and nature—and, globally, young women of colour leading the debate about climate action. Young people are already shaping the future in so many ways, and they deserve the right to vote from age 16.
        </p>
        <p>
         Young people deserve more of a say in politics. It's going to take more than just lowering the voting age. We need more young people elected to parliament to directly represent their interests and concerns. Until that happens, we here have a lot of work to do to meaningfully listen to and represent the voices of young people. We need to ensure that there's meaningful consultation with young people—and we welcome future contributions from the new Youth Steering Committee. We need to make parliament a safe and respectful place in which young people actually aspire to work. Earlier this year, Plan International Australia found that 72 per cent of young women do not feel that politics is an equal or inclusive space for them.
        </p>
        <p>
         We know from experiences in other countries that lowering the voting age increases political engagement amongst young people, and that increased commitment stays with them throughout their life. It is good for democracy. Other countries allow people under the age of 18 to vote—Brazil, Cuba, Austria, Malta and Scotland. And, in the wake of last week's court decision, New Zealand will introduce laws to lower the voting age. Australia should follow their lead. Young people get it. They just don't get a say. Let's change that.

         </small>
         <p>
          To begin with, I want to pay tribute to the many members of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Liberals" rel="nofollow">
           Young Liberals
          </a>
          , the Young Nationals and, in my home state, the Young Liberal Nationals for the work they do across Australia and across Queensland in standing up for freedom and standing up against some of the errant nonsense that you hear on the Left side of politics. I commend those young people from the centre-right who, in the recent student union elections, went down in a ball of flames but took the fight to the broad Left on campuses across Queensland and had to put up with buckets of bile and nastiness from those supporting the Greens, those supporting the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Alliance" rel="nofollow">
           Socialist Alliance
          </a>
          and those supporting the left-wing tickets across Queensland. What they put up with on a daily basis is to be commended, and I speak as someone who reached the dizzying heights of chairman of the Sunshine Coast Young Liberals and president of the Griffith University Liberal Club.
         </p>
         <p>
          Notwithstanding the strong advocacy for issues impacting across Queensland, it is the view of the youth movements of political parties across Australia who are on the centre-right of politics, on the freedom side of politics, that the voting age should stay as it is, at 18. That is the position of the coalition and the opposition in this chamber. We believe 18 is the appropriate age at which the line should be drawn as to whether people can or should vote. That has been long-accepted practice and we don't see the need to change that.
         </p>
         <p>
          But, if we are talking about how we can enhance and protect our democracy, there are certain things we should be looking at and we should draw attention to—like Labor's plans to introduce a financial gerrymander at a federal level. Labor plans to bring in a financial gerrymander to try and lock themselves into power. What Labor are up to is they want to bring in the Queensland model. For those who are listening at home and don't know what the Queensland model is, it's very simple: it's limiting the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_National_Party" rel="nofollow">
           Liberal National Party
          </a>
          , under a spending cap, to $15 million and the Labor Party to $15 million. You would think, 'That's pretty fair.' But, under Labor's model, every union in Queensland can also spend up to $10 million. So, on one side of the ledger, on the centre-right, the Liberal National Party, led by David Crisafulli—the next
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
           Premier of Queensland
          </a>
          , not withstanding the financial gerrymander!—is capped at $15 million, but on the left side you've got the Labor Party on $15 million and, I think, 26 registered trade unions in Queensland—I'm happy to be corrected on that number—that can spend up to $260 million on a state election. So, effectively, you've got $15 million against $275 million. So there is no spending cap in Queensland. It is a financial gerrymander designed to keep the Liberal National Party out of power.
         </p>
         <p>
          What Labor are proposing at the federal level is to bring in a similar cap on expenditure. So the political parties will all be capped, but the unions won't be. The unions are the campaign wing of the Labor Party; we know the Labor Party is defunct at an organisation level on the ground and is run by the unions. There's nothing wrong with that; the Labor Party was formed out of the union movement. But if we're talking about fairness in politics and ensuring that we have a democracy that allows all voices to be heard, then we should ensure that all voices have the same means and the same ability in which to prosecute arguments before the voters at each election. Unfortunately, that is not the case in Queensland. Unfortunately, that is not what Labor are proposing at a federal level. They are proposing to bring in this financial gerrymander that will lock out so many people from participating in the democratic process so they can entrench themselves into power. Part of this plan—we can see this—is the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IR" rel="nofollow">
           IR
          </a>
          bills that are before parliament, this week and last week. It is the Labor Party ensuring that their union bosses are paid back, and they will make sure that the union bosses will put money into the Labor Party re-election when it comes. But we will win, because we are on the right side of politics.

           The Labor government supports the inclusion of young people in government decision-making, and we support the enfranchisement of all Australians, but we're not here today to rush into changing the fundamentals of our voting system without proper consultation.
          </p>
          <p>
           I have to say that just last week we saw the first advisory council of some 15 young Australians and invited them to Canberra to engage with government to have a say on issues that matter to them. That was via the Youth Steering Committee, and I saw much defunding and neglect of that inclusion under the last government.
          </p>
          <p>
           Last week and this week, Dr Anne Aly has been working with these young people to drive the development of our government's new youth engagement model. This is about creating meaningful opportunities for young Australians to have a say on government policies and programs. This is a model being developed by young people for young people. It brings together a diverse range of life experiences to this role. It brings together young people from a really diverse variety of backgrounds to have a say on a very wide variety of issues.
          </p>
          <p>
           When it comes to the issues confronting young people in Australia today, we know that young Australians are uniquely placed to tell us about the problems they face and to shape the solutions that actually work for them. Young people in Australia are more than 15 per cent of our population, and we're not here to paint them with one brush of being young or being disengaged or only caring about one issue. Labor is committed to engaging with young people and learning about their issues and stories and their ideas for our nation. As a government, we want to not only work for Australia's young people but also work with them. This is a far more effective model from our point of view.
          </p>
          <p>
           The committee sees some 15 young people, including from regional, rural and remote areas. We had a massive commitment from young people around Australia expressing their interest in participating. We now have participating young people from
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBTQI" rel="nofollow">
            LGBTQI
           </a>
           + communities,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
            First Nations
           </a>
           , culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, diverse religious backgrounds along with young Australians with lived experience of disability, caring responsibilities and/or mental health issues. They all have a place on this advisory committee. From this you can see our commitment to Australia's young people. We had more than 1,200 applications from people aged 12 to 25 years old. So we know that young Australians are interested in our nation's political affairs and are interested in engaging in the decisions that impact them.
          </p>
          <p>
           In this context, I certainly recognise that for many it includes a desire to pursue electoral enfranchisement. So, via this committee, we do hope that we will be able to engage with young people about their expectations for electoral enfranchisement. The Labor Party has led key electoral reforms in Australia, consulting with Australians very widely about how we gain better inclusion and participation from across our political spectrum. Electoral reform needs to be carefully considered and it needs to be addressed through multipartisan forums, such as parliament's Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. I am also committed to seeing the youth advisory committee as well as young people from right around Australia participating in these processes.
          </p>
          <p>
           In this context, we can see that the Labor Party is committed to meaningful electoral reforms. We were, for example, the first party to introduce funding and disclosure schemes in early 1980s. Labor is absolutely committed to supporting young people in our political system—

            This is my message to our 16- and 17-year-old Australians. You can okay boomer me as much as you want. I'll happily cop it. Yet, as someone who is 67 and grey haired, I want to let you in on a little life secret.

             The Greens
            </a>
            over here want you to think voting makes you an adult. It's a trap. It's something that no one here has really mentioned, but I remember that when I was your age you really don't want to be an adult yet. Trust me, it kind of sucks and it's hard.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Greens are adults. Listening to their speeches, do they seem like happy people? Adults have lots of bills: car rego bills, electricity bills, water bills, gas bills, car insurance bills, private health bills, dental bills, phone bills and more. You might even have to start paying for your own Netflix. Then you have to go to work everyday, on repeat, daily, for 40 years until you retire or die. It's 9 am to 5 pm—at least!—in an office. It's up early before the sun rises if you're a tradie. Don't forget to do all your laundry in between as well. Then, if you work really hard and get a good job, the government will start stealing 33 cents out of every dollar you earn and waste it on something. These are just some of the responsibilities that come with being an adult.
           </p>
           <p>
            As fun as I'm sure all this sounds, there's much more. These are just some of the responsibilities that come with voting. They will all come more quickly than you think, and you will be voting sooner than you realise. Until then, just focus on finishing school or choosing a trade. Don't listen to the people saying that you need to protest or the world will end. It won't. For decades we've been told the lie that the world will end in five years or maybe 10 years. Hang out with your friends. Just have fun and practise to get your P-plates. You'll soon have plenty of time to protest and vote and do all the boring stuff that comes with being an adult. It will be sooner than you think—much sooner than you think.

             That's one way to look at it, Senator Roberts, but thank you for your contribution. As a 27-year-old and as the youngest member of the 47th parliament, my commitment to empowering the voices of young Australians is unquestionable. It is important that young people understand the power of their democratic right to vote in a country like Australia, when there are so many examples around the world where this right has been diminished. The assurance that the value of one person's vote is no different to that of another is something we cannot take for granted.

             , I am always inspired by their passion for a better world. At the election in May this year, they knew there had to be a change to safeguard their future, and a change is what they got. Their voices are being heard by this government. Since being elected, we took immediate action on climate change, something young people are so passionate about and have been calling for for years. This restored our reputation on the world stage.

             more accessible and we've campaigned for wage increases and job security, so young people in our country can confidently support themselves whilst they're studying or saving for their first home or to travel the globe. These are real changes that young people need, and we are delivering. The Albanese Labor government is a government young people can be certain has their back, now and always, unlike what they have known for most of their lives under those on the other side. We have an incredible Minister for Youth in Dr Anne Aly, who is working tirelessly to engage with young people, for young people.

             I will always work in this place to increase enfranchisement, education and information about electoral matters so that young people understand the importance of our democracy. With this in mind, now is not the time to lower the voting age without the proper consideration of Australia's electoral landscape. But it is time to consider practical ways of engaging with our youth and young people, to educate, empower and promote the democratic rights and freedoms we have as Australians.
            </p>
            <p>
             Some of these ideas are already in place and practiced, while others are less frequent but just as important. I'd like to see more educational school visits, discussing with students their curriculum of humanities and social sciences, and how the theory they learn has practical implications on parliamentary operations, processes and procedures. I'd like to see more young people invited to round tables about matters of importance to them. This will enable us to listen—to truly listen—to the challenges that are unique to our nation's youth and to brainstorm solutions constructively. It would also allow them to contribute towards the decision-making processes of legislation that will impact on their lives in the years to come.
            </p>
            <p>
             I would like to see more invitations extended to young people to visit parliaments across our states and territories, or to shadow their member of parliament for a day or a week to understand and witness the hectic schedules of parliamentarians and to appreciate the behind-the-scenes work that we do. I would also like to see more young people involved in youth organisations, university clubs and

             , for the people in my home state of Western Australia, which welcome young people of all ages and ensure they understand the political system before a ballot paper is shoved in their faces and they're asked to vote.
            </p>
            <p>
             I believe in making informed decisions and being well-versed when casting my vote to elect a government that shares my values and which will implement policies for the greater good of all Australians—a government that is inclusive, progressive, responsible and compassionate. Labor has always been the party of meaningful electoral reform which creates a transparent and accessible electoral system. Future discussions about this issue in the context of Australia's democracy is something we are open to. But as our electoral system exists today, young Australians are being represented in this parliament.

              What we have heard in the debate so far is opposition to 16- and 17-year-olds getting the right to vote from the Liberal Party, and lukewarm noncommitment from the

              . I would ask all members who have contributed to this debate, who have decided to give their view on this issue, to engage in a bit of a thought experiment.
             </p>
             <p>
              Imagine if you were being asked a really important question about your life, and you were not actually allowed to answer. In fact, imagine that you were legally prevented from answering such a question while other people in another place had a say and were encouraged to use that to make a decision for you—in order to make a choice on your behalf. And imagine all of this being done on the assumption that you cannot make a decision for yourself—that you aren't fit to give your view or to speak your opinion. Doesn't this sound awful? Doesn't it sound even discriminatory? I think the people in this room would absolutely hate it.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is the reality, when it comes to government, for every person who has yet to turn 18. Don't we think it's unfair that if a young person is looking at 114 new coal and gas projects when people and communities are facing the destruction of climate events, and they want to protest about it and oppose it but they're not allowed to have a say in whether or not those projects go ahead or whether or not those governments are re-elected? Don't we think it's unfair that 16- and 17-year-olds are planning their futures and choosing universities, with the weight of tens of thousands of dollars in debt on their shoulders in education fees, when they should and could have had the ability to have a say at the last election about whether or not those policies should continue and whether university should once again be made free?
             </p>
             <p>
              Well, the Greens believe in empowering everyone to be involved in decisions that impact them. Decreasing the voting age to 16 will have an enormous impact and be a profound step towards a more inclusive, proactive, working democracy. I'm proud to be part of a team that will push for this and see it done. It is not fair to exclude 16- and 17-year-olds from the democratic system—not at all. It is time to begin fixing the disparities in the system by lowering the voting age to 16.

               I welcome this motion moved by my colleague Senator McKim and support the lowering of the voting age to 16. The law of this land is our law. It's the oldest law on the planet.
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
                First Nations
               </a>
               people in this country are the oldest continuing living culture on Earth. Our society ensured that we have equality—meaning that our young people were just as important as our old people. At the age of 16 we have many responsibilities as First Nations people. We have responsibilities to our siblings. We have responsibilities to our old people. We have responsibilities to our cousins, our brothers and our sisters. And a lot of our people are having babies at 16; I was 17. A lot of our young people are paying taxes. A lot of our young people don't get a say at all.
              </p>
              <p>
               Victoria has already acknowledged the cultural authority of our young people in its treaty process by including all First Nations people over the age of 16 on the roll. This sets a precedent for the inclusion of our young people in the decisions that impact our people. Young First Nations people are the key to our survival. It's not our future; it's their future. And we must do the right thing by giving them a voice on their journey towards their future.

                Citizenship requires rights, identity and participation, and all these have been eroded over time in this country by partisan politicking. We know that membership of the major parties is on the decline, and the trend is evident in many Liberal democracies. Well, here's an opportunity for them. Get onboard with lowering the voting age and start listening to young people and taking them seriously. You never know: they might just join one of your parties.

                have long advocated for lowering the voting age to 16 and have introduced legislation at federal, state and territory levels to make this a reality. The simple act of lowering the voting age would demonstrate a strong commitment to young people of this country, our next generation. It is their future that is at stake, after all. Young people across this country have been taking action for years now, telling politicians that we are in a climate emergency. The least the parliament can do, if it's not going to listen and take swift, meaningful action to transition this country to net zero, is to actually give those young people the right to vote and vote you out of here.
               </p>
               <p>
                The core principle of representative democracy is that, through democratic participation, representatives can draw on the expertise, knowledge and opinions of their constituents when forming policy and making decisions. Young constituents have very valuable knowledge, interests and experience that should actually be recognised. Those who argue against lowering the voting age claim that 16- and 17-year-olds are closer to children than to adults in their ability to reason and make sound decisions—and I've certainly seen that in my time here! Young people do not lack the political knowledge, cognitive capacity, good judgement and maturity that's needed to engage in their democracy. In fact, they have all those things. Many of our young people need the right to vote, and we should be giving it to them.

                 More countries around the world are recognising the importance of providing young people with the right to vote. A few days ago, the Supreme Court of
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
                  New Zealand
                 </a>
                 ruled that the voting age being set to 18 was discriminatory. I hope that the conversations that are now happening in New Zealand will also renew debate in this country regarding our voting rules.

                <p>
                 Young people are informed, thoughtful and, increasingly, politically engaged. Our national curriculum includes comprehensive civics and citizenship education, which all of our young people have completed by year 10. They should also have the right to participate actively in our electoral process. Instead, they are being actively excluded from participating in decisions about their own futures, the outcome of which may not even be seen by some older Australians—only by those young Australians who didn't make them.

                 have supported lowering the voting age for many years, with my Senate colleague Jordon Steele-John introducing a bill in 2018. At 16, young people can work, pay taxes, have children and make medical decisions about their bodies. The ability for young people to be charged as adults and be subject to imprisonment in adult facilities demonstrates the disconnect between their responsibilities and the lack of opportunities to vote. Ignoring this suite of responsibilities whilst refusing to allow young people the opportunity to contribute and to participate in the electoral process, actively undermines the rights of young people in this country.

                 Young people are currently facing a cost-of-living crisis and a rental market that's unaffordable, and they're going to be the ones who are most impacted by the climate crisis. Young people are more than capable of voting on issues that matter to them. They care deeply about these issues and need to be involved in decisions relating to their futures.
