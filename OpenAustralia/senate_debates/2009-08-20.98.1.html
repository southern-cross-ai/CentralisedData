        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Minister Wong. Does the government agree that there is a window of opportunity to prevent foxes from becoming established in Tasmania, a window which is rapidly closing given that scats were found as far south as Cygnet just this week? Does the government acknowledge that, if foxes are not eradicated swiftly, as many as 78 native species will be put at risk and, additionally, the primary industry sector will face a potential cost of around $20 million a year through impacts such as loss of lands, the cost of protecting lands and so on?

             Senator Milne, I assume that you may be referring to some Caring for our Country funding decisions in relation to this issue. I do have some information about funding through Caring for our Country, including expressions of interest under the Australian Pest Animal Management Program, which are due to close Friday, 28 August 2009. It is also the case that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts has, from memory, issued a report in relation to vertebrate pests. The senator may be referring to that. I have some information about the costs in relation to that. If there is further information that I can obtain from the minister for the environment, Senator, I will provide it to you.

              , I ask a supplementary question. I am assuming, from what the minister is saying, that the government does accept that there is a window of opportunity to prevent foxes from becoming established. Given that the Tasmanian government sought $11.3 million over four years from the federal government to support fox eradication operations in Tasmania, how can the government justify the risk to Tasmania’s native species and primary industries arising from providing only $1 million for one year, the 2009-10 year, with no commitment to ongoing funding other than the promise of a review?

               As I said, Senator Milne, I do not have the detailed information in relation to the subject matter of your question. I will see if I can obtain some advice on that issue. As I said, I am unclear as to whether or not this is a Caring for Our Country program to which you are referring; if it is, obviously I can provide that information, because that is administered by the ministers for the environment and agriculture. As I said, I think everybody in Australia understands we have a range of invasive species and pests which have had an impact on our environment and our economy over the last couple of hundred years, so this is an ongoing issue that governments have sought to manage through different parties being in government.

                , I ask a further supplementary question. Why does the minister not have an up-to-date brief on this matter, since it has been an issue raging in Tasmania for the last week? I particularly want to hear from the federal government an undertaking to guarantee funding beyond one year—a promise of guaranteed funding beyond one year—and to immediately top up this program so that it does not threaten the viability of the fox eradication program. I ask the minister to at least give that undertaking: a guarantee of ongoing federal funding.
