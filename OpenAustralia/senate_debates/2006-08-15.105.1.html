       <p>
        I stand tonight to speak about the first Australian Christian Heritage Forum, held in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        , Canberra on Sunday, 6 August, and Monday, 7 August, this year. Nearly 400 Christian leaders, pastors, teachers, historians and others spent the two days listening to a series of plenary sessions and seminar addresses on the Christian contribution to the development of Australia, its culture, its professions and its institutions. It was about the importance of Australia’s Christian heritage to our past and its relevance to our future. I had the honour of being one of the parliamentary hosts, and I will refer to that again shortly. I was invited to make some opening remarks and to provide the forum summary on the Monday evening. I would like to share some of those remarks and then pay tribute to the organisers of the forum—in particular, Professor Stuart Piggin and Graham
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald" rel="nofollow">
         McDonald
        </a>
        and his team.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was at an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Friday" rel="nofollow">
         Easter Friday
        </a>
        church service last year that I received confirmation of a vision. The vision involved the Australian Christian community being more proactive in discussing and promoting the benefits and contribution to our community of upholding the values of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Christ" rel="nofollow">
         Jesus Christ
        </a>
        —a vision of people boldly saying the Christian community has contributed and is contributing positively to our nation, and of me playing my part in making this happen in the federal parliamentary arena.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my opening remarks to the forum, I also said that it was stimulated in part by the consistent attack on and denigration of Australia’s Christian heritage, whether it be with regard to the institution of marriage, the push for a valueless education system or the removal of Christmas carols and the nativity scene from schools and public places. It seems that, at every juncture, the Christian community and its leaders are on the defence. Of course, the grassroots response in defence of marriage being between a man and woman received overwhelming community support and, ultimately, bipartisan parliamentary support—an excellent result.
       </p>
       <p>
        Strategically, it is important—indeed, vital—to defend our core values and beliefs when they are threatened, but it is difficult to advance the cause and progress without a more proactive, forward-looking approach—hence the forum and the espousing of the belief that Australia’s Christian heritage has helped shape the character of this nation in a most positive way. Yes, it is true that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Church" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Church
        </a>
        , the institution of the Church and the people within it, have made mistakes, including in recent times child sex abuse matters. But these acts of indecency and other injustices should not diminish the overwhelmingly positive contributions to the lives of our fellow Australians, most notably in the areas of social welfare and community service, health and education. For example, the brilliant Australian spirit of volunteerism is underpinned by the value of caring for one another, along with compassion and giving and the biblical principle of ‘do unto others as you would have them do unto you’. The Anzac spirit, I believe, espouses the values of mateship, bravery and sacrifice—all values espoused by Jesus.

        . Each played their part in advance of and during the forum. I said that I stood in solidarity with them to declare that I was proud of Australia’s Christian heritage; that the values and views of Jesus, his faith and belief have positively contributed to the character of our nation and offered hope to the lives of our people; and that, indeed, they remain as relevant today and to our future as they have been in the history of our great nation, Australia.

        appeared towards the afternoon session with Shayne Blackman and the Hon. John Anderson, and I summed up the forum. It was a tremendous couple of days and it was very much a proud moment to have been part of such a great event.
       </p>
       <p>
        Professor Stuart Piggin summarised some of the outcomes when he said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Representatives of many denominations were present with none dominating. Denominationalism was not an issue. Christianity needs to say goodbye to its sectarian past if it is to maximise its contribution to any society. At the Forum, unity was more easily attained than delegates could have envisaged by the simple decision to focus on Jesus rather than the church. Jesus is the one thing all Christians have in common, and indeed, as numerous stories about the role of Jesus in Australian history reveals, Jesus is not the preserve of Christians, but has been as constantly revered by most Australians as the churches have been criticised.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Clergy were outnumbered twenty to one by the laity, and only three clergymen had any role in the program, and none of them was a minister of a congregation. This was not about Church, theology and doctrine. This was about the world of work, the marketplace of ideas, the role of the human family, and the civic responsibilities of citizens to the polis. Delegates as well as speakers were drawn from a wide range of professions: parliamentarians, academics, lawyers, teachers, social researchers, business men and women, architects, and entertainers. Among those not well represented were medical doctors, sportspeople or the young. ‘Next time,’ was the refrain of the organisers.
       </p>
       <p>
        …         …         …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Indigenous leaders were well represented at the Forum, their stories commending interest and respect on the Forum website ...
       </p>
       <p>
        That website is: australianchristianheritageforum.com.au.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will conclude by saying that one of the related outcomes is the tremendous contribution in social welfare. Nearly three-quarters of the social welfare services provided in Australia are provided by Christian based and faith based organisations. That is a tremendous contribution to the Australian way of life. The success of the forum is a great tribute to the organisers, and I believe it is a wonderful foundation for the future.
