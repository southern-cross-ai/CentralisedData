        I have further information to add to an answer I gave to a question Senator Parry asked me during question time today, concerning the school chaplaincy program. Minister Gillard’s office advises that there is no review either underway or planned for the School Chaplaincy Program. Under the National School Chaplaincy Program, up to $165 billion over three years was made available to Australian school communities to assist in the provision of chaplaincy services. School communities were eligible to apply for up to $20,000 per annum to establish school chaplaincy services or to expand existing chaplaincy services.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian government has confirmed that it will honour all funding commitments previously made under this program. Around 2,700 schools were granted funding under the two funding rounds of the program conducted in 2007. The previous government made it clear that no further rounds were planned beyond the two conducted in 2007. The current government may consider funding in the context of future budget processes.

         by leave—In response to Senator Carr, he did write to me on 24 June this year indicating that ‘while no further funding rounds are planned at this stage, the government may consider future budget expenses’. The problem with this, Senator Carr, through you, Mr Deputy President, is that there is uncertainty within the chaplaincy movement. I understand that Minister Gillard has written to them, indicating that their contracts would not be renewed. We want to know and to give certainty to chaplains in schools around Australia. I understand that Queensland will be the first state in which there will be no continuation of funding for chaplaincy services.
