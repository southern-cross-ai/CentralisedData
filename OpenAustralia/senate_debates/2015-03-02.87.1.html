          My question is to the Assistant Minister for Health, Senator Nash. I refer to the fact that, tragically, there are over 250 drowning deaths in Australia every year. Indeed, the 10-year average is 292 drowning deaths per year. Would the minister please update the Senate on the vital topic of water safety and the most recent findings on drowning deaths in Australia?

           I thank Senator O'Sullivan for his question and for his interest in this critical issue. Every year the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Life_Saving_Society" rel="nofollow">

           of Australia's national drowning report examines unintentional drowning deaths in Australia. The recent 2014 report shows that 266 people drowned in Australian waterways during the 2013-14 financial year. This is the lowest number of drowning deaths recorded in the past 12 years, but it needs to be lower.
          </p>
          <p>
           Inland waterways continue to claim the largest number of lives with 105 people tragically drowning in rivers, creeks, lakes and dams around the country. Swimming pools have overtaken beaches as the second highest number of drowning deaths with 39 deaths compared to 34. Sadly, children under five continue to account for a large proportion of fatalities in swimming pools.
          </p>
          <p>
           The report states that preventing drowning deaths is a collective responsibility. Government can and will do its part but families and communities can take simple steps to reduce drowning risk factors. First and foremost, 47 per cent of people who drowned in 2013-14 had positive readings for alcohol at the time. The consumption of alcohol dramatically increases the risk of drowning because it impairs judgement. The Australian government and the RLSSA strongly encourage Australians not to swim under the influence of alcohol.
          </p>
          <p>
           The report reiterates that home swimming pools must have a complaint pool fence with a self-closing and self latching gate. Children need basic swimming and water safety skills. Australians should swim at patrolled beaches during patrol times and swim between the flags.
          </p>
          <p>
           I want to thank the RLSSA for delivering this crucial report which provides evidence on how Australia is tracking in relation to drowning prevention and where we need to focus our efforts.

             In the 2014-15 budget, the Australian government committed $15 million over five years for the water safety reduce drownings program. This program provides $8 million for surf-lifesaving clubs to purchase water safety equipment, $2 million for
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surf_Life_Saving_Australia" rel="nofollow">
              Surf Life Saving Australia
             </a>
             to address beach drowning black spots, and $1 million for AUSTSWIM for the promotion of access to quality and accredited swimming and water safety. This is on top of the $8Â½ million a year already invested by the Commonwealth government to support water safety in Australia. This funding is used to support the ongoing operations of Surf Life Saving Australia, the RLSSA and AUSTSWIM as well as supporting Laurie Lawrence Swimming Enterprises to develop, promote and distribute water safety materials that aim to reduce the incidence of accidental drowning deaths of children under five.

               and a representative of rural and regional Australia, as so many of my colleagues are, it is distressing to know that 90 drowning deaths occurred in New South Wales last financial year and that 105 occurred in inland waterways across Australia. I am pleased to say that, as part of the $15 million committed in the budget to water safety, the government is providing $4 million towards the RLSSA's inland waterways drowning fund. The fund will investigate high-risk inland waterways; expand community education and awareness programs targeting alcohol consumption, the use of safe watercraft and practical lifesaving skills in rural and remote areas; and build and expand the River Drowning Black Spot Identification Program. We want Australians of all ages to enjoy themselves in the water and to relish this important part of our lifestyle. The government is playing its part, and we encourage parents, carers, teachers and individuals to do the same.
