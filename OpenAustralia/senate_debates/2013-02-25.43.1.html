         I thank Senator Milne for her question. I am aware of the recent changes that have been announced by Channel 10. I believe you have referred the matter—I think, from your press conference; I saw reports—to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACMA" rel="nofollow">
          ACMA
         </a>
         to look at.
        </p>
        <p>
         The reason that the outsourcing is possible is that those opposite, when they last had majority control of the Senate, changed the rules so that a
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">
          TV
         </a>
         station could outsource its news and current affairs. Those opposite introduced an amendment which they had the numbers to pass through. We are in the process of considering the reports from Mr Finkelstein and the convergence review. We are in a situation where the government will finalise its consideration in the not too distant future of a whole range of issues across this portfolio area. I am not going to pre-empt the cabinet and I am not going to pre-empt the caucus by announcing any outcomes of those, but we are considering all of these matters. If the senator is aware of any breaches of existing rules or laws, they should, as they have done, refer them. But at this stage we will not be pre-empting on the floor of the Senate cabinet considerations.

           is in breach of any of the existing laws. If the senator believes otherwise, she should take this matter up very seriously, but I am not aware of any suggestion that that is the case. As to whether or not he is influencing Channel 10, clearly, as chair, he has a role to play. But, in terms of the combined interests, if the senator believes that there is any matter that needs to be looked at, she should refer it to the proper authorities.

            On a further supplementary question: thank you, Minister, but given that you have just pointed out yourself that this is a loophole that was created by the coalition, is the government going to move in this debate on media reform, unequivocally, to close this loophole and make sure that we cannot have a situation where a person—

              Will the minister give the Senate an unequivocal answer in terms of the government moving to deal with this loophole in the cross-media ownership laws such that we prevent people exercising more influence in the two-out-of-three rule, let alone a two-out-of-four rule?

               The convergence review recommended revised media ownership arrangements at the local and national level to ensure that they remain targeted and effective in a converged media environment; a revised minimum number of owners rule to capture all media operators that have an influence in a local market; and a national public interest test that would apply to transactions involving large media enterprises. The committee also recommended that these measures include some major media operators like national newspapers and subscription television providers.
              </p>
              <p>
               The government is giving careful consideration to the review’s recommendations and, as I have previously stated, the government will bring forward a package of further measures to deal with, amongst other things, issues associated with a public interest test. But I am not going to pre-empt the consideration of cabinet and I am not going to pre-empt the consideration of my caucus colleagues by opining on the floor of the Senate.
