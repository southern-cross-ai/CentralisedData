        My question is to the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women, Senator Cash. I refer to Liberal MP Teresa Gambaro's comments today, 'The situation we have now with there being only one woman in cabinet is one that cannot be allowed to continue.' Does the minister agree with Ms Gambaro?

         As the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women, I believe that a government's commitment to women is reflected in the policies and the benefits that a government delivers. Look at those on the other side: when they had a female Prime Minister, she of course was knifed by none other than the now

         , Senator Wong. So much for standing up for the sisterhood, Senator Wong.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have a former government that introduced a paid parental leave scheme. But what did they fail to do? They failed to include superannuation in their paid parental leave scheme. That clearly shows that it was not a government that is dinkum when it comes to delivering policies for women.
        </p>
        <p>
         On top of that, let us look at the level of debt that the former failed finance minister—again, Senator Wong—delivered to the women of Australia. In 2007, when the former government came to office, there was zero debt. What did this government deliver by way of a policy that did not have a benefit—

            I was getting to the Prime Minister, when he was the Leader of the Opposition, telling the Australian people about the shadow cabinet that we would be taking to the election and the fact that at that time it included two women. He said, 'Because of the level of debt that we are going to inherit from the other side, we believe that we require experience.' Our now cabinet has 15 ministers who were in the former Howard government ministry. What do all those ministers have in common? They paid off the former Labor government's debt from 1996 to 2007. At the end of the day—

             , I ask a supplementary question. We still do not know whether the minister agrees with Ms Gambaro. Can the minister confirm that, despite being the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women, the Prime Minister's office did not invite her to the launch of the widely publicised coalition female staffer network last night? Can she further inform our Senate whether the only woman in cabinet, the foreign minister, was also not on that invitation list?

              When the shadow minister for women in this country, who tells the Australian people that she wants to be on this side of the chamber and delivering policies that benefit women in this country, comes up with a question of that nature, I can only say, 'God help all women in this country if you make it to this side of the chamber.' Peta Credlin and the Prime Minister launched the Coalition Women's Staff Network. That is an outstanding initiative. I commend the Prime Minister on this initiative.

It was about a policy position on having more women in cabinet. You did draw the minister's attention to the question. We now have eight seconds left and I would like to hear an answer.

                         In relation to the foreign minister, I think she is now recognised internationally as being one of the best foreign ministers this country has ever seen when it comes to raising gender equality on an international scale.
