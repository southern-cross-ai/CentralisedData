         The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The following tables provide average processing times in days for the skilled, family and refugee/humanitarian programs. Offices which have only processed small numbers of applications (less than 10) are not shown, as the small volumes of cases are not representative for the purposes of calculating an average processing time.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) (a) Migration program—overseas posts.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Processing times for the migration program as a whole are not maintained and are not meaningful, due to the variations in requirements for the different components. Processing times for the migration program are covered by the answers to the subsequent parts of this question - parts (b) skilled, (c) family and (d) refugee/humanitarian.
