        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I ask: in view of the ongoing slaughter of the unarmed champions of democracy in Syria, will the government close the Syrian embassy and have them sent packing?

         I thank Senator Brown for his question. As we watch the seeds of joy in Libya, in another country another regime continues to kill protesters demanding political reform and greater freedom. An estimated 2,000 people have been killed in Syria since civil unrest began in March. Last week, Australia joined other countries in calling on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_President" rel="nofollow">
          Syrian President
         </a>
         to step aside and announced additional sanctions against members of the Syrian regime.
        </p>
        <p>
         Today, the government repeats its call for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Assad" rel="nofollow">
          President Assad
         </a>
         to step down and to reject the path taken by Gaddafi. Today we share the joy of Libyans but we do not forget the people of Syria. On 19 August, Australia joined the international calls for President Assad to step aside. The people of Syria deserve the opportunity to engage in peaceful political activity without fear of official repression. The Syrian regime must cease violence immediately, respect the right of free and peaceful protest, release political detainees and engage in genuine dialogue that will bring about reform.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia continues to urge strong
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNSC" rel="nofollow">
          UNSC
         </a>
         action, including by referring Syria to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court" rel="nofollow">
          International Criminal Court
         </a>
         . We also continue to encourage the Secretary-General to appoint a special envoy to Syria. Australia has been active in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Human_Rights_Council" rel="nofollow">
          United Nations Human Rights Council
         </a>
         , including co-sponsoring a resolution recommending the deployment of a human rights observer mission to Syria. Again on 19 August, we announced further autonomous sanctions to put more pressure on the Assad regime. Our financial sanctions and travel bans now target a total of 34 individuals, including President Assad, and 13 entities. Australia has contributed $3 million to the

          , I ask a supplementary question. In view of that answer, I ask the minister why it is that Australia is taking such a weak and unsatisfactory reaction to the Assad abominations? I ask him again why Australia has not closed the Syrian embassy, which represents what the minister himself has described as a criminal head of state in

           I utterly reject Senator Brown's characterisation of AustÂ­ralia's response. We have taken leading action in a whole range of areas, of which I have just detailed many, and we continue to maintain publicly that the regime should cease shooting and killing its own citizens. So I utterly reject the basis of the question which you put to us, Senator Brown.

            I have a further supplementary question,

             Mr President
            </a>
            . Firstly, how does the government explain the complete inconsistency of on the one hand saying that
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Assad" rel="nofollow">
             President Assad
            </a>
            should go to the international court because of his criminal behaviour and, on the other hand, allowing his representatives to remain free and entertained in this city of Canberra? Secondly, what is to stop the Australian government from directly calling on the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court" rel="nofollow">
             International Court
            </a>
            of Justice to bring President Assad to book?

              UNSC
             </a>

             </a>
             . We are working within international forums, as we did with Libya, to seek to bring an end to the violence and to hold the Syrian government to account. So, Senator Brown, I again reject your assertions that underpin your question.
