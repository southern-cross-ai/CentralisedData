        I seek leave to amend business of the Senate notice of motion No. 4, standing in my name for today, proposing a reference to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee relating to illicit firearms.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        I move the motion as amended:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the following matter be referred to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee for inquiry and report by 2 October 2014:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The ability of Australian law enforcement authorities to eliminate gun-related violence in the community, with reference to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the estimated number, distribution and lethality of illegal guns, including both outlawed and stolen guns, in Australia;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b)    the operation and consequences of the illicit firearms trade, including both outlawed and stolen guns within Australia;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) the adequacy of current laws and resourcing to enable law enforcement authorities to respond to technological advances in gun technology, including firearms made from parts which have been imported separately or covertly to avoid detection, and firearms made with the use of 3D printers;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) the extent to which the number and types of guns stolen each year in Australia increase the risk posed to the safety of police and the community, including the proportion of gun-related crime involving legal firearms which are illegally held;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) the effect banning semi-automatic handguns would have on the number of illegally held firearms in Australia;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (f) stricter storage requirements and the use of electronic alarm systems for guns stored in homes;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (g) the extent to which there exist anomalies in federal, state and territory laws regarding the ownership, sale, storage and transit across state boundaries of legal firearms, and how these laws relate to one another; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (h) any related matters.

           The government does not support this motion.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commonwealth" rel="nofollow">
            The Commonwealth
           </a>
           has in place some of the most stringent firearm laws in the world, particularly around the import and export of firearms. The possession or manufacture of a firearm without a licence, including 3D-printed guns, is illegal in all jurisdictions. The previous government ripped millions of dollars from law enforcement and border protection agencies, and they are now being rebuilt in terms of capability. The previous government was particularly savage in its cuts to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Crime_Commission" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Crime Commission
           </a>
           , the very agency which produces the national illicit firearms report and firearms transaction database, which answers many of the references argued for in the motion.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Commonwealth is working with the states and territories to ensure that Australia has consistent penalties for illegal possession of guns and police have consistent powers to search for illicit firearms. We have already implemented a number of measures since coming to government to deal with the firearm threat, and the Australian government will soon introduce legislation to follow through on our election commitment to introduce minimum mandatory sentences for illegal gun trafficking.
