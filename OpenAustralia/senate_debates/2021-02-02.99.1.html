        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Birmingham.

        … you don't need no vaccine.

        Does the minister agree that this statement is irresponsible and dangerous, and endangers Australian lives?

         I understand that Mr Kelly has equally indicated that he supports the distribution of the vaccine and intends to have a vaccine himself.
        </p>
        <p>
         My message to all Australians, and the message of our government to all Australians, is that whether you are a member of the public or a member of parliament you ought to take your health advice from the health experts. When it comes to the development of our vaccine strategy, our government works alongside

           The point of order is direct relevance: the question is not about whether the Prime Minister is listening to the advice of medical officers. We are asking this minister, who is representing the Prime Minister, whether or not the statement by Mr Kelly that 'you don't need no vaccine' is irresponsible and dangerous.

            Thank you, Senator Wong. The minister, earlier in his answer, did reference statements by the member of the other place and he is specifically talking about communications and information about a vaccine. I have allowed you to restate the question; I can't instruct him how to answer it. But as long as he stays in those bounds I think he is being directly relevant.

             . Let me be very clear: all Australians are encouraged, and should be encouraged, to receive a vaccine. The vaccine is voluntary and the rollout of the vaccination process will be voluntary. However, all members across the parliament—all people across leadership positions—ought to encourage the safe receipt of the vaccines, because we are doing this based upon the best available health advice for the nation.

               The point of order is on direct relevance. The question is about a statement made by Mr Kelly. Will this minister say to the Senate and, through it, to the Australian people, that Mr Kelly's statement is irresponsible and dangerous? That is the question that he has been asked. He is refusing to even respond to Mr Kelly's statement.

                Senator Wong, I have allowed you to restate the question. I have ruled previously, and I believe the minister is narrowly constructing his remarks. You are asking me to instruct the minister on the terms in which he should answer, which is outside my authority. There is a chance to debate answers after question time. I believe the minister is being directly relevant.

                 Again, as I have said very clearly, everyone should be encouraged to have the vaccine and everyone should encourage receipt of the vaccine. In this place and in the other place, everyone should encourage their constituents and others to receive the vaccine. That is a vaccine that, in this country, has gone through more scrutiny and safer processes and will be part of a coordinated vaccination strategy, and all Australians should have confidence in its safety and its efficacy.

                    I don't think I could have been any clearer in relation to the government's position or my position about the receipt of vaccines. We encourage everyone to receive the vaccine. It is voluntary across Australia. It will be voluntary. But, we want to make sure there are high levels of confidence in the vaccine program. We have gone through a process that is thorough and rigorous to ensure those high levels of confidence.

                    Australia, unlike other countries that have had to rush emergency approvals, has been able to go through the comprehensive processes of the

                    </a>
                    . Australia, unlike other countries that have had to rush distribution processes, has been able to develop distribution arrangements that should give people confidence in the efficacy and efficiency of the rollout. Australia is taking this role not only in our country but in leading others in our region to promote the receipt of the vaccine.

                           I don't think I could have been any clearer in the previous answers about the advice to the Australian people. Rely upon the advice of Professor Kelly. Rely upon the advice of Dr Murphy. Rely upon the advice of your medical practitioners. Rely upon the advice that we promote of the health officials across this country. Rely upon the advice of medical officers across the states and territories. Rely upon the advice of the

                           . Do you know whose advice our government are relying upon? That of all of those experts who have kept Australia safe as we have worked hand in glove with them throughout this pandemic. We are not being distracted by other comments. We are not seeking to promote debates about the merits of the vaccine. We are focused on its efficacy and delivery.

I have been listening very closely to the assertions being made by the opposition and, if I understand the assertion correctly, 'You don't need no vaccine,' is in fact a double negative and therefore Mr Kelly is, in fact, promoting the vaccine, and I don't know why the opposition has got any difficulty with the matter.

                                You had a very good grammar teacher, Senator Abetz—congratulations! I have taken Senator Wong's point on the point of order. Senator Wong, I have allowed you to restate the question. I believe you are asking me to instruct the minister on the terms in which to answer. I believe he has been directly relevant, including just then when he was outlining a series of authorities that I believe are directly relevant to the question asked.
