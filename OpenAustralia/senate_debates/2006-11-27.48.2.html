         <dd>
          notes that the undersigned Members of the European Parliament recently returned from a fact finding mission to Israel and Palestine, shocked and appalled by what they saw and experienced in Gaza, saying:
          <dl>
           <dt>
            i.
           </dt>
           <dd>
            Due to economic sanctions, almost all public institutions have shut down. The hospitals are overcrowded and receive neither money nor sufficient medicine. The public employees have not been paid for months. The doctors told us that some deadly injuries are not caused by traditional weapons but most likely by new experimental chemical weapons. More amputations than ever are necessary. They have not had the time to examine the dead bodies yet as they are busy dealing with the wounds of those who have survived.
           </dd>
           <dt>
            ii.
           </dt>
           <dd>
            The closure of Rafah and Karni crossing for people and goods has turned Gaza into an open air prison. Recently, Gaza has seen horrible carnage.

           <dt>
            iii.
           </dt>
           <dd>
            We call upon Israel to stop the violation of human rights and repeated breaches of the Geneva Convention.

            iv.
           </dt>
           <dd>
            We call for a complete ceasefire by Israel, an immediate withdrawal of troops from Gaza and an end to the military incursion in the West Bank.

           <dt>
            v.

            We strongly object to the description by Israel of those it has killed as “terrorists”.

           <dt>
            vi.
           </dt>
           <dd>
            We call and insist that the EU [European Union] should review the association agreement and consider imposition of sanctions on Israel unless it ceases the killing of civilians and the violation of human rights, thus complying with article 2 of the association agreement.

            vii.
           </dt>
           <dd>
            We urge Hamas and Fatah and all the democratic Palestinian forces, even under these circumstances, not to stop their efforts to form a Unity Government as already agreed on the document of national reconciliation which recognizes the 1967 borders of the state of Palestine and Israel and to take every possible measure to halt the firing of Qassam rockets.
           </dd>
           <dt>
            viii.
           </dt>
           <dd>
            We call upon the EU to open dialogue with all the Palestinian national institutions and to put pressure on the Israeli government to release the tax revenues confiscated from the Palestinian government.
           </dd>
           <dt>
            ix.
           </dt>
           <dd>
            We ask the UN and the quartet to send international forces to protect the Palestinian and Israeli civilian populations, while calling for an international conference with all the parties involved reaching a comprehensive and just peace for the area.

            in 2004, Germany passed a new law that guaranteed people who built solar parks a minimum price for each kilowatt of electricity that was two to three times the market price, for example, a German pig farmer struggling with drought took advantage of the scheme and covered his 200 acre farm with 10 050 solar panels, which at full capacity could supply power to all 7 000 residents of the local village resulting in the farmer making more than $600 000 a year from the sale of this electricity, and

        The information regarding consultation that is supplied in the Explanatory Statements to each of these four instruments notes that “parties with relevant expertise were directly consulted regarding their views”.

        Dear Senator Watson
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Thank you for your letter of 7 September 2006, regarding instruments made under section 184(1) of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC" rel="nofollow">
         EPBC

        Act) and the explanatory statements accompanying the instruments.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In order to amend the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC_Act" rel="nofollow">
         EPBC Act
        </a>
        ’s lists of threatened species, ecological communities and key threatening processes, I must sign an instrument which is then registered on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Register" rel="nofollow">
         Federal Register
        </a>
        of Legislative Instruments, and tabled in the Parliament with an accompanying explanatory statement.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        You note in your letter that the explanatory statements advise that “parties with relevant expertise were directly consulted regarding their views”. You also requested information about the nature of the consultation undertaken with regard to the instruments.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As part of the process for assessing nominations to amend the lists of threatened species, ecological communities and key threatening processes, I must consider advice on the nomination provided to me by the Threatened Species Scientific Committee (the Committee). In preparing its advice to me, the Committee routinely identifies and approaches people or organisations with relevant expertise – for example, on the biological characteristics of, or the threats impacting on, a species nominated for listing. The Committee asks specific questions of these experts in order to fill any information gaps that may exist in the nomination, to ensure that its advice to me is based on the most thorough and up-to-date knowledge available.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Additionally, my Department places each nomination on its website for a period of two months to allow for members of the public to submit comments on the proposed amendment to the list. Any relevant scientific information that is provided as part of this process is considered by the Committee when it prepares its advice to me.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To ensure the integrity of the scientific information provided by experts, all personal details are kept confidential.
