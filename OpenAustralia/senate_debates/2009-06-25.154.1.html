        </dl>
        Car Dealership Financing Guarantee Appropriation Bill 2009
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security" rel="nofollow">
         Social Security
        </a>
        and Other Legislation Amendment (Pension Reform and Other 2009 Budget Measures) Bill 2009Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2009-2010 and 2 related billsExcise Tariff Amendment (2009 Measures No. 1) Bill 2009 [No. 2] and a related bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just for those who may have a range of pieces of paper relating to hours on their desk today, I will outline the routine of business. From not later than 3.45 pm it shall be government business only. The three bills will be the Car Dealership Financing Guarantee Appropriation Bill 2009, which we are part of the way through debating, the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Pension Reform and Other 2009 Budget Measures) Bill 2009, and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2009-2010 and two related bills.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition, divisions may take place after 4.30 pm. I will also seek leave to withdraw government business notice of motion No. 6 when this is agreed to. What that effectively means for the remaining part of the afternoon is that we will go through and deal with those bills. There will come a point at about 6 pm when we will return to government documents, by which time we should have finished dealing with those bills. We will continue to monitor the chamber to ensure that happens.

         I would like to clarify with the minister that the Migration Amendment (Abolishing Detention Debt) Bill is no longer on the proposed list and express the Greens’ view that it should be. We are prepared to debate and consider that bill until it is dealt with. I do think it is a matter of urgency. I have spoken with numerous people, even just today, about how this is impacting on their daily lives. A further deferral of this issue would have an impact on many people’s lives and I do not think there is any reason why we should not deal with it tonight.
