        My question is to Senator Fifield, representing the Minister for Communications. Before last September's election, the then opposition, now government, guaranteed there would be no cuts to the ABC or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SBS" rel="nofollow">
         SBS
        </a>
        . Then came the cancellation of the $220 million
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Network" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Network
        </a>
        contract and the so-called $43 million down-payment cuts to the two broadcasters. All along the government has maintained there will be no programming cuts and that cutting back-office and admin functions would be sufficient. Does the government seriously expect us to believe that the cuts that now cumulatively amount to around nine per cent of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC's" rel="nofollow">
         ABC's
        </a>
        overall annual budget will not lead to cuts to programming?

        Senator Bernardi says it is a good thing. If so, will the minister give the Senate a guarantee to this effect?

             As I was saying, the government, in cooperation with the two public broadcasters, conducted an efficiency study of the national broadcasters' back-of-house operations, and the purpose of the efficiency study I think is well known. It was to assist both the ABC and
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SBS" rel="nofollow">
              SBS
             </a>
             to manage their businesses more efficiently, to examine their costs of operations and to identify savings through increased efficiencies and reduced expenses without impacting on the quality and extent of program content. The government's position was not that the ABC and SBS should be immune to savings but that those savings should be achieved and effected in an informed manner, hence the purpose of the efficiency review.

                  , I ask a supplementary question. Minister, the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, in draft, allegedly contains clauses relevant to the operation of state owned enterprises which are seen as a barrier to unregulated trade and competition. We also understand that states' parties can submit a list of exempted enterprises. Has the government placed the ABC and

                  on its exemption list or is the government intending to use the Trans-Pacific Partnership as a lever to privatise or part-privatise the operations of the ABC and SBS?

                   As colleagues would appreciate, negotiation of the Trans-Pacific Partnership is a matter for Minister Robb in the Trade portfolio. To the extent that I may have anything to offer or that Minister Turnbull may have anything to offer in his capacity as the Minister for Communications then I will happily take that on notice.

                    You could have ruled it out, but not to worry.

                    , I ask a further supplementary question. Finally, the government is also reportedly considering forcing a doubling of the quantity of advertising that

                    </a>
                    has to run. Could the coalition provide an estimate of the amount by which this will dilute the amount of money that SBS can charge for its advertising and by how much this dilution of ad revenues will also hit other commercial broadcasters?
