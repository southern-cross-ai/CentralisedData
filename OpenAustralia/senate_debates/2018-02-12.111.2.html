        (now known as Naval Group), Mr Sean Costello, stated to the media that "over 90 per cent" of the $50 billion submarine build would take place in Australia;

       <p class="italic">
        (d) in October 2017, it was reported by Fairfax media that the Minister made public comments at the Pacific 2017 Naval Conference clarifying the definition of a local build to be 60 per cent, and confirming that at least 60 per cent of the work on the submarines would be done by Australian firms;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) in February 2018, Mr Costello confirmed that the 90 per cent build figure "absolutely" went into the tender response presented to the

         Australian Government
        </a>

           DCNS
          </a>
          , now Naval Group, to Australian industry as to what involvement it will have in the Future Submarine project. It is an important document that former Senator Xenophon requested under
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOI" rel="nofollow">
           FOI
          </a>
          in April 2017. What this means is that the

           Information Commissioner
          </a>
          is about to make a decision about it. So I respectfully suggest to the minister that she needs to respond to the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPD" rel="nofollow">
           OPD
          </a>
          in a very considered manner. I don't want to see the minister ordered to make another explanation as to why she got her OPD response wrong, because I can assure you I will not hesitate to protect the integrity of the Senate oversight processes in circumstances where the minister makes another bogus claim.

             The plan contains Naval Group's proprietary information regarding submarine design, the manner in which it transfers technology to customers, and supply chain proposals for particular suppliers. If released, this information could disadvantage Naval Group and advantage its competitors in future tender processes. This could occur by revealing to competitors Naval Group's intellectual property regarding design and build of submarines and the methods it has developed to transfer its technology to other countries, which is of particular value to Naval Group as it competes for international programs. Disclosure could be expected to also damage Australia's international relations with France.
