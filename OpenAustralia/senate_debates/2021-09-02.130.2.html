In February 2020 we began preparing to support the Australian health system. We will continue to develop that program.

         We have worked to increase

         capacity nationally from 2,000 to 7,500 ventilated beds nationwide. We've invested over $30 billion in COVID health measures. We continue to work with the New South Wales government in support of the system. We've invested over $6 billion in direct COVID support to state hospitals. One of the reasons we put in place the private hospital guarantee was to support the public health system to ensure that there was capacity across the country in the case of COVID. We continue to work with the states cooperatively in ensuring the capacity of the public health system.

            As I've already acknowledged, the COVID-19 global pandemic is having an impact on the health system here in Australia. It did that in Victoria last year, and we invoked the private hospital guarantee so that private hospitals could support the public health system in Victoria. We will take the appropriate measures in conjunction with the

               I take that point. You've restated the last part of that question. There was a substantial quotation from someone before that that talked about the stress on the hospital system—and I summarise it that way. I'm listening carefully to the minister, but I think he is addressing that part of the question. I've let you remind him of that part of the question.

                I again acknowledge that there is stress on the system and that COVID-19 will continue to put stress on the system, but what we're doing is working with the states to ensure that there is capacity to support people with COVID to the extent that the private hospital guarantee ensures over 30,000 hospital beds additionally nationally, and the sector's 105,000 strong workforce is available to support the public health system to manage COVID.

                   The national plan, based on modelling done by the Doherty institute, is not just about opening the economy at 70 per cent or at 80 per cent. It is about a careful, safe opening of the economy so that we can ensure that the hospital system doesn't get overwhelmed. That's the—

                     Again, on relevance: this is a really important question about whether the government can guarantee that our hospitals will cope. That's the question.

                      Senator Watt, there was an extensive quotation again, and by describing the national plan the minister is actually being directly relevant to the question. Senator Colbeck.

                       Senator Watt's ears must be painted on! I directly addressed the question when I said the Doherty modelling is based on safely and progressively opening the economy to ensure there isn't undue pressure on the hospital system. That's the point of the process. I will go to the AMA for health advice. I will go to Doherty for modelling advice.
