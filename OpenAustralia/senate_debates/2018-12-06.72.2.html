        I seek leave to amend general business notice of motion No. 1208 standing in my name and that of Senator Pratt, to replace 9 December with 7 December—noting that 7 December was the date that legislation for marriage equality actually passed through the parliament.

           The coalition government would have supported this motion; however, we refuse to accept the suggestion that the plebiscite was anything other than a critical and successful component of the process which led to the amendments to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_Act" rel="nofollow">
            Marriage Act
           </a>
           to legislate same-sex marriage. The government therefore cannot agree with a motion with such a negative and historically inaccurate suggestion about the plebiscite. It was ultimately the coalition government, through the successful postal plebiscite process, which facilitated the legislation of this reform.

              The passing of marriage equality through this parliament was an historic moment of ending discrimination against
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBTIQ" rel="nofollow">
               LGBTIQ
              </a>
              Australians. It is absolutely to be acknowledged, recognised and celebrated. The plebiscite was not the way to do it; we got through that and we achieved marriage equality. It was a moment when the parliament came together, reflecting the huge support of the Australian community. I must note that I had hoped that, in celebrating its one-year anniversary this week, we might have also taken a step forward on ending discrimination in another significant area, in schools. But, sadly, the support and unanimity and coming together that we achieved with marriage equality last year has not been shown this year in ending discrimination in schools. In fact, we've had a total shemozzle over the issue of ending discrimination in schools against students and teachers. I call, as we're looking forward, for everyone to come together in the same way they did for marriage equality to protect and support LBGTIQ students and teachers in schools.
