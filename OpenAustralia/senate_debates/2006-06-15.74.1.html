          White Paper

        for issue during 2005-06. From the introduction of this
        <i>
         White Paper
        </i>
        , a new Defence White Paper should be developed every four years through a rolling four year program. The proposed new
        <i>
         White Paper
        </i>
        should re-emphasise the point that Australia’s defence policy is ultimately defensive. The committee would envisage that ‘power projection ashore’ would relate to instances where Australian forces, as part of coalitions, have been requested to assist with the affairs in other nations. The Government, in developing the new
        <i>
         White Paper
        </i>
        , should take into account the conclusions made by the committee including:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Australia’s strategic objectives be the defence of Australia and its direct approaches together with greater focus on, and acquisition of, capabilities to operate in the region and globally in defence of our non-territorial interests;
        </li>
        <li>
         clear articulation of why Australia’s security is interrelated with regional and global security;
        </li>
        <li>
         the continuation of the commitment to ‘self-reliance’ in those situations where Australia has least discretion to act;
        </li>
        <li>
         focusing on measures that will enhance interoperability with Australia’s allies such as the US; and
        </li>
        <li>
         developing and implementing a maritime strategy which includes the elements of sea denial, sea control and power projection ashore. (paragraph 4.124)

        <i>

In response to the attacks of September 2001 and October 2002, a review of Defence strategy, in the form of
        <i>
         Australia’s National Security: A Defence Update 2003

        was undertaken. This review, and the subsequent one undertaken in 2005, confirmed that the principles set out in the 2000 White Paper remain sound.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government does not agree with the recommendation that White Papers be developed every four years. The Government will continue to implement Defence 2000 and will maintain an up-to-date strategic assessment to inform changes in our capability priorities, defence planning and wider national security requirements. It will, from time to time, continue to provide public updates of its strategic assessment of our security environment and the policy priorities that flow from this.

        In recent years, the Government has clearly articulated its support for the three Service Reserves in policy documents such as
        <i>
         Defence 2000
        </i>
        and in a range of new and amended Defence legislation to strengthen the reserve components of the ADF and increase the circumstances in which they can be employed. This has included a plan to deploy Reserves on Australian Navy Ships as Transit Security Elements, the introduction of workplace guidelines enabling Defence reservists to be released for training and operations, the establishment of the ADF Reserves Employer Support Payment Scheme and the establishment of the Reserve Response Force. The

Approximately 2,800 high readiness Reservists will be made available to support the Army’s front line deployable units. Additionally, in the
        <i>

If the F-35 will not be available by 2012 then the Government should give cost details of prolonging the lifespan of the F/A-18A, and provide details on the range of options to maintain air superiority in the region.

        As part of its responsibilities for national security, the Government is continuing to examine regional combat capabilities, including air combat capabilities. The Defence Capability Plan includes funding to maintain the F/A-18A and F-111 capability as required.

         Government Response:
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government has set out the key elements of its approach to shipping policy, in 2004 at the Natship conference in Melbourne. While this policy speech touched on many of the issues raised by the Independent Review of Australian Shipping (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRAS" rel="nofollow">
         IRAS
        </a>
        ), a review commissioned by the shipping industry for the industry, the Government will not be responding to it formally.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government believes that the best way it can support any industry is to maintain Australia’s strong domestic economy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia’s international trade must continue to have access to internationally competitive shipping. IRAS has acknowledged that shipping arrangements that would make our exports uncompetitive would be against the wider national interest. While it is essential for Australia’s economic future, it does create challenges for Australian shipping operators.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government will continue to supplement coastal shipping for Australian industries by issuing permits for foreign ships in accordance with the established regulatory provisions. However, this will only be done in those cases where no Australian licensed ship is available.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In summary, the Government’s shipping policy continues to be a blend of providing shippers with access to competitive shipping and a level of preference for the local industry in the coastal trades.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government is committed to enforcing the highest standards of maritime safety, security and environmental protection. It has emphasised that it will never reduce Australia’s strict safety, security and environmental standards. Australia’s port state control system is world class and will continue that way and Australia has met the 1 July 2004 international deadline for security plans to be approved and in place.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government has also made it clear that if there are any security concerns about any ship, its crew or cargo, we will place additional security measures on that ship or require it to leave Australian waters.

        Australia’s strategic circumstances and current and proposed force structures do not rely on the existence of a merchant marine fleet. Our experience in recent operations has been to contract for these services, and there are a large number of providers ready and able to undertake this role. Our access to such capabilities meets our current needs and is expected to meet operational needs in the foreseeable future.
