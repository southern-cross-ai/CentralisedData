       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill ensures the Government can continue to purchase COVID-19 vaccines, including boosters. These vaccines will provide protection to Australians, reducing the risk of severe disease and hospitalisation from COVID-19.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill also ensures the Government can invest in viable treatments for COVID-19, providing further protection for Australians against COVID-19.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Finally, this Bill allows for the purchase of consumables necessary for the delivery of these vital vaccines and treatments.

       <p class="italic">
        Following a Cabinet decision to purchase a relevant item, the Minister for Health will exercise the spending power under the new provision.

       <p class="italic">
        The Scheme was established in response to the recommendations of the

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Scheme commenced on 1 July 2018 and will run for 10 years. The Scheme was established by the National Redress Scheme for Institutional
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_Sexual_Abuse" rel="nofollow">
         Child Sexual Abuse
        </a>
        Act 2018 (the Act), which is underpinned by an Intergovernmental Agreement with all Australian states and territories.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The implementation of the Scheme was an acknowledgement by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Government
        </a>
        and state and territory governments that sexual abuse suffered by children in institutional settings was a blight on Australia's history, and a betrayal of trust for some of our most vulnerable people.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Scheme recognises the suffering survivors have experienced and accepts that these events occurred and that institutions must take responsibility for this abuse.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Scheme is one important step towards healing and provides a monetary payment as a tangible means of recognising the wrong survivors have suffered; access to counselling or psychological services; and a direct personal response from the institutions responsible where a survivor wants that to occur.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Over the past three years, the Scheme has secured the participation of all states and territories, and as of 13 August 2021, 508 non-government institutions are participating in the Scheme. This means the Scheme now covers approximately 66,400 sites across Australia. In addition, over 6,100 payments totalling approximately $519 million have been paid to survivors to date.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Morrison Government remains committed to having all institutions who are named in applications to fulfil their moral obligation to join the Scheme.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        While I am pleased most institutions are doing the right thing, we have introduced financial consequences for institutions that refuse to join the scheme including restricting access to future Commonwealth grant funding and possible loss of their charitable status and associated tax concessions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is completely unacceptable that institutions that know they have been named in applications would choose to shirk their responsibility to finally do the right thing by these survivors.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Morrison Government has already made a range of improvements to the Scheme, and will continue to do everything possible to make survivors experience with the Scheme as smooth as possible.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Earlier this year we passed legislation to change minor and technical issues with the operation of the Act and addressed unintended consequences or oversights in the initial drafting of the primary legislation underpinning the Scheme.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These changes did not change how survivors or institutions deal with the Scheme. The intention was that substantial changes to the Scheme would be best pursued following the second anniversary review of the Scheme. This would ensure that any major changes to the Scheme would reflect survivor and other key stakeholder voices.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is essential that the needs of survivors are being met; that the Scheme is operating effectively; and that the unique and evolving challenges in administering such a measure are being addressed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We know that a monetary payment does not heal everything that survivors have had to endure, which is why the Morrison Government has also committed $6.7 million to establish the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Memorial" rel="nofollow">

         Second Year Review of the National Redress Scheme,

        presented byMs Robyn Kruk AO, makes 38 recommendations to increase access to redress and improve the Scheme's operation, making it more trauma-informed, efficient and ultimately more survivor-focussed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In undertaking the Review, survivor voices were front and centre and Ms Kruk consulted extensively with survivors, advocacy groups, support services, institutions and Commonwealth and state and territory governments.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I want to thank Ms Kruk, on behalf of the Government, for the significant work that went into the report. Thank you as well to all survivors and stakeholders who generously gave their time to share their experiences as part of the Review.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Morrison Government values the views of survivors and other stakeholders, and has listened to the concerns raised and recommendations for improvement.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That is why we are prioritising initial action on 25 of the 38 Review recommendations in full or in part and investing over $80 million over four years in the 2021-22 Budget to support implementation of these recommendations.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill makes the first tranche of legislative changes giving effect to a number of Review recommendations. The measures in this Bill are relatively straightforward, however will make genuine improvements to the operation of the Scheme, will ensure the Scheme is more survivor focussed and enable fairer outcomes for survivors.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In line with the Scheme's governance arrangements, all state and territory governments have agreed to the amendments in the Bill.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill will achieve its intended outcomes and improvements to the Scheme through progressing the following amendments to the Act.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Advance payments
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill introduces an advance payment of $10,000 for priority redress applicants while they are waiting for their redress outcome.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The advance payment will be available for elderly applicants, who are aged 70 years and over, or 55 years and over for Indigenous and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
         Torres Strait Islander
        </a>
        applicants, or applicants who are terminally ill.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This measure reflects recommendation 4.2 of the Review. Given the nature of institutional child sexual abuse, the Government is aware that survivors may not come forward to seek redress for some time and may be elderly or ill when they apply to the Scheme. There is a risk that survivors may pass away before receiving their redress outcome and any acknowledgement of the abuse they experienced as children.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The purpose of the advance payment is to provide these applicants with a form of recognition of their abuse early on in the redress application process.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To assist survivors, they will not need to apply for the payment. Rather, the Scheme will identify eligible applicants for the payment after receiving a valid redress application, or at any time during the application process, and will then offer the advance payment to the survivor.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The amount of the advance payment will be deducted from the survivor's final redress payment amount. Whilst the Commonwealth will initially fund the advance payment when it is paid to the survivor, the amount will be recouped from the institution or institutions found responsible for the abuse of the survivor. There is no net change to institutions, and no changes to current processes for institutions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        While a person's application will not be assessed by an Independent Decision Maker at this point, the Scheme will look at general Scheme eligibility factors. Should it later be determined that a survivor who received the advance payment was not in fact entitled to redress, the Commonwealth will not seek to recover the payment from the survivor.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In these cases, survivors will be permitted to keep the advance payment and it will be funded by the Commonwealth. This acknowledges that a person may have applied in good faith, is elderly or terminally ill, and there would be additional trauma placed on the survivor in recouping the payment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        However, where an applicant receives the advance payment as a result of providing false or misleading information to the Scheme, funding would be recouped and there are existing provisions to enable this to occur. Similarly, if a person later chooses to withdraw their application or decline their final redress offer, they will be required to repay the amount of the advance payment. The advance payment is a component of a final redress payment, and is not in addition to, or a separate part of redress. This expectation will be made clear to applicants before they accept an advance payment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Indexation of relevant prior payments
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill amends the date used for the calculation of indexation for prior payments from the date the determination on an application is made, to the date the application is submitted to the Scheme.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In line with recommendations of the Royal Commission, relevant prior payments an applicant has previously received from a responsible institution are taken into account in determining the final redress payment. This may be a state ex gratia payment for example. The payment is indexed to account for inflation, with the indexed prior payment amount deducted from the applicant's final redress payment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Currently, a person can be disadvantaged due to the time it takes to process their application, including where an institution has not yet joined the Scheme.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        By changing the date at which indexation is calculated to be the date an application is submitted, it will ensure that the time taken to process an application does not negatively affect the amount of their final redress payment. This change reflects recommendation 4.5 of the Review, which suggested removing indexation or if that was not supported, applying it at the date of application.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Importantly, these changes will not impact the liability for institutions, with the Commonwealth funding the increase to the redress payment, for the life of the Scheme.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The change to the calculation date for indexation will apply to all applications made to the Scheme. This includes all applications that have been finalised before the commencement of this measure.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Extending review and acceptance periods
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill introduces flexibility to extend the period a survivor has to consider and accept an offer of redress and the period to seek a review of a redress offer. This measure makes technical amendments to the Act and addresses known anomalies in the initial drafting.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Currently, if an applicant has not accepted an offer of redress or requested an extension within the six month acceptance period, the offer is taken to be declined. This restriction results in survivors being unable to access redress, given that they can only apply once for redress. The Bill introduces the ability for the Scheme Operator to extend the acceptance period after their six month acceptance period has expired, where needed to ensure the Scheme is survivor focused.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Further, there is currently no ability to extend the period a person has to seek a review of their offer of redress. A review must be requested within six months of receiving their redress offer. This is problematic, particularly where a survivor has requested their acceptance period be extended prior to it expiring. In these circumstances whilst the survivor has additional time to consider and accept their offer, they are unable to seek a review of the offer in this period. This is not trauma informed or fair for survivors.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Aligning the review and acceptance period will provide administrative flexibility to ensure no applicant inadvertently loses the ability to access redress or to procedural fairness due to the unintended restricted drafting of current provisions. It will apply to all future and past applications.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Remove statutory declaration requirement for applications
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill will remove the current requirement for redress applications to include a statutory declaration. Removing the requirement aligns with recommendation 3.6(c) of the Review and will make the Scheme more trauma-informed and efficient and may mean more survivors access redress.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Currently, redress applications are required to be accompanied by a signed and witnessed statutory declaration in order to be considered valid. This requirement has proven to be onerous for survivors, particularly vulnerable survivors. Many survivors consider the requirement questions the integrity of their application and they have concerns for their confidentiality. The requirement risks survivors not coming forward to access the redress they deserve.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The requirement to comply with the statutory declaration requirement was temporarily removed during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic as it become particularly difficult for survivors to comply with, particularly elderly and ill survivors. However, this was time limited and did not address the wider problems with the requirement. Social distancing restrictions continue to continue to be felt be felt as a result of COVID.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Removing the requirement will not lessen the requirement for applicants to be honest when applying for redress. In addition, institutions will continue to have the opportunity to comment and provide information on redress applications via the request for information process.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Scheme will still be able to appropriately deal with fraudulent applications. Section 28 of the Act states that civil penalties apply where a person gives false or misleading information, documents or statements to the Scheme. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Code" rel="nofollow">
         Criminal Code
        </a>
        also contains provisions to address fraudulent applications and false or misleading information or documents provided to the Scheme, which are punishable by imprisonment of 12 months.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Payment by instalments
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This measure will enable the ability to pay the redress payment and counselling and psychological care payment in instalments, if requested by the applicant. This would not change the amount of redress a person is entitled to, it would merely provide options for an applicant to determine how they wish to receive their payment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Currently redress is paid as a lump sum, with the average payment amount of around $85,100. The Royal Commission suggested that some survivors might experience difficulty receiving lump sum payments that are much larger than the amount of money they are used to handling. Recommendation 4.4 of the Review also recommended that payment by instalments be considered as an option for paying redress.

        Summary
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In summary, this Bill makes legislative changes in order to implement initial action in response to the Review. This reflects the Morrison Government's commitment for continuous improvement of the Scheme and shows we have listened to survivors and other stakeholders.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Morrison Government has been very clear about its support for other measures recommended by the two year review, as outlined in the interim response.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

        is working to have administrative arrangements in place to support the implementation of advance payments and payments in instalments as soon as possible.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Extending the review and acceptance period will commence on

        , and all other measures will commence on proclamation to ensure appropriate arrangements are in place to support their implementation, noting all measures will be treated with urgency.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition to the measures in the Bill, some actions do not require changes to legislation. For instance, the Government is working to respond to recommendation 3.9(c) of the Review which recommended that the Australian Government strengthen consistency and integrity in decision making. The Government is progressing a range of action in respect of this recommendation, including simplifications to the application form and letters; increased support will be provided to survivors to engage in a direct personal response; and more personalised and meaningful engagement with survivors will be introduced in the early stages of application and throughout the process.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Importantly, this Bill reflects initial action, and does not mean other recommendations will not be considered. Rather, the remaining recommendations, many of which constitute major changes to the Scheme, require further detailed development work and consultation with stakeholders. The Government will continue to progress consideration and consultation on these issues over the coming months, and plans to release a final response to the Review in early 2022.

        recommended expanding Funder of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Resort" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        arrangements. As previously announced, the Government supports expanding Funder of Last Resort provisions to cover defunct institutions where there is no government responsibility for abuse and existing institutions that do not have the financial capacity to join the Scheme. This change requires agreement from state and territory governments and I am working closely with my state and territory colleagues to progress this measure.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am aware that some stakeholders suggest the maximum redress payment be increased from $150,000 to $200,000, consistent with the Royal Commission's recommendation. The maximum payment of $150,000 was the amount supported by states and territories in the establishment of the Scheme. It balances the need to recognise the wrongs suffered by survivors while encouraging institutions to participate, and continue participating in the Scheme. The current average payment amount of around $85,100 is actually higher than the average payment of $65,000 that was suggested by the Royal Commission.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is important to note that the independent Review did not make a recommendation to increase the current maximum redress payment to $200,000. Ms Kruk concluded that increasing the maximum payment could have significant negative impacts on survivors, institutions and the Scheme. This includes risks to institutions, that have predicated their participation in the Scheme based on the $150,000 cap, leaving the Scheme or refusing to join the Scheme which would be detrimental to survivors.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government is pleased to outline the important measures in this Bill and will continue to work hard to implement the Review recommendations and improve the Scheme for the benefit of survivors.

        </a>
        ) BILL 2021
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill amends the Paid Parental Leave Act 2010, to assist people who have been affected by the economic impacts of the Coronavirus pandemic to be eligible under the Paid Parental Leave (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPL" rel="nofollow">
         PPL
        </a>
        ) scheme.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The PPL scheme is intended to support working parents, and as such, to be eligible for Parental Leave Pay or Dad and Partner Pay, a person must meet certain work test requirements, including having worked for 10 months out of a 13 month work test period and having worked a minimum of 330 hours in that 10 month period.

        State-imposed lockdowns and restrictions are affecting the ability of some people to work.

        , people are being stood down or experiencing a significant reduction in work hours. This may in turn have an inconsequent effect on the ability of these people to meet the work test requirements and qualify for payment under the PPL scheme.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Amendments to this legislation are proposed to allow periods a person is in receipt of the COVID-19 Disaster Payment (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDP" rel="nofollow">
         CDP
        </a>
        ) to count towards meeting the Paid Parental Leave work test.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The CDP is a lump sum payment for those who have lost work or income as a result of a COVID-19 lockdown. Allowing periods in receipt of CDP to count as qualifying work for the PPL work test, is consistent with the objectives of the PPL scheme and would align with the Government's response of being temporary, targeted and proportionate.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Qualification for the CDP is dependent on losing income and work as a result of living or working in a Commonwealth-declared COVID-19 hotspot. Aligning this proposal with CDP will ensure that the proposal is targeted and can be accurately applied to those whose workforce participation has been affected by COVID-19 lockdown restrictions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These changes will ensure that parents with a genuine connection to work are able to access the Government's PPL scheme.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Without this amendment, parents who work part-time, or have been in lockdown close to or longer than the permissible 12-week period, may lose entitlement to the payments under the PPL scheme, due to failing the work test.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill will support working parents to access the PPL scheme in areas affected by the recent COVID-19 lockdowns and mimics the amendments that were made to the Paid Parental Leave Act during the peak of the pandemic last year.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To remind the chamber, the amendments made under that Act allowed for time spent on the JobKeeper Payment to count towards the PPL work test, in recognition that meeting the work test during the pandemic was more difficult.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These important changes to the PPL scheme are about ensuring that the Government continues provide support to working parents to spend time with their new children.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The amendment will further allow the Secretary of the Department of Social Services the discretion to grant a parent access to Paid Parental Leave, in special circumstances, where the parent (typically the birth mother) does not meet the eligibility requirements under the work test. The nature of special circumstances that the Secretary will be able to take into consideration, includes cases where a parent is escaping family and/or domestic violence, has been affected by a natural disaster or impacted by severe illness.
