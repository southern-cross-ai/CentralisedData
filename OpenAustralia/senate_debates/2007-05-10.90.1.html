        My question is to Senator Johnston, the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Is the minister aware of the comment by the member for Kalgoorlie, Mr Barry Haase, on the budget that ‘there is nothing specific’ in it for his vast regional electorate? Is the minister also aware that the Treasurer did not mention the resources sector once in his budget speech? Isn’t it the case that infrastructure deficiencies continue to prevent regional
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        , particularly the north-west, from developing to its potential? Isn’t it also true that, over the last four years, the mining boom has pumped $300 billion above original estimates into the budget, allowing the government to spend up big in an election year? In the light of that, why has the government failed to make any new infrastructure investment in the budget to help resolve capacity constraints that are hindering development in regional Western Australia?

         Some people must have been celebrating very hard whilst the budget was being delivered on Tuesday night, because they are oblivious to the fact of the Australian government’s greatest ever investment in regional infrastructure in terms of roads and rail. For senators from

Where has the learned senator been for the last two days? It must have been a good celebration. There is $997.2 million for 20 projects and maintenance on the

               I am just telling you the facts! You have asked the question; I will answer it. Obviously, it is not something that you like to hear. There is $265.2 million for 142 local government councils to spend on local roads—$48.5 million in 2007-08. There is $22.5 million for nine strategic regional programs—$6.5 million in 2007-08. There is $23.9 million for an estimated 202 black spot projects—$5 million in 2007-08—and $395.7 million for untied local road grants to local authorities, $82 million of which is payable in 2007-08. Funding in 2007-08 for projects includes—and I have not even got to
