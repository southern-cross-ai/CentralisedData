        I'm meeting this week with Attorney-General Dreyfus to review the planned national anticorruption commission. I'll be taking One Nation's position to the Attorney-General—that checks and balances must be in place to preclude witch-hunts. The terms of reference must allow for all outside influence on our decision-making to be identified and removed. Outside influences are driving lucrative subsidies for unreliable solar and wind energy. These subsidies are lining the pockets of donors and sponsors of members of parliament in both chambers—cronyism worth tens of billions of dollars.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my speech entitled 'This parliament is a crime scene', I detailed the cronyism that infected the previous Liberal-National government. Crikey has now detailed similar cronyism and conflicts of interest in the Labor Party and their affiliated fundraising entities. Running government for the benefit of oneself or one's party's finances is a betrayal of the trust the Australian people have placed in us. It is corruption and it destroys confidence in government and governance. A government without the confidence of the people must rely on authoritarian measures to maintain control.

        This is the path the state and federal governments chose to take during COVID, and those powers have now become permanent. Freedoms stolen are never willingly surrendered. A federal
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAC" rel="nofollow">

        must investigate the many conflicts of interest and tainted decision-making in governments' COVID responses—questions of complicity, cover-ups and cronyism. A royal commission, though, is the only way to deal with the wider illegal issues that arose during COVID. Constitutional questions about federal and state roles, the legal standing of the National Cabinet, vaccine mandates in the public and private sectors, the use of troops against law-abiding citizens, criminal harm from medical procedures conducted under duress and police use of excessive force must all be reviewed before we can move on, or we will be there again. We have one flag, we are one community, we are one nation founded on freedom and personal responsibility.
