        My question is to the Minister for Education and Training, Senator Birmingham. I refer to the minister who, in 2015, said that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        was:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … guaranteed of getting the vast bulk of sustainment work …

       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOI" rel="nofollow">
         FOI
        </a>
        documents released last week show that the minister's guarantee is worthless, revealing that the government began work on a plan to relocate sustainment work away from Osborne immediately after the 2016 election. When did the minister first become aware of the government's plan to shift sustainment work away from Osborne?

         I thank Senator Farrell for his question. Senator Farrell is, indeed, an

           They are the only ones, thank you, Senator Abetz. I realise that the Labor Party is very eager to try to, it seems, talk down the scale of investment that is being made in relation to naval shipbuilding and the naval shipbuilding industry at Osborne, but the Turnbull government is absolutely keeping our commitments. Indeed, I would say in many ways we're exceeding the commitments that we've made over the years. It stands in stark contrast—as Senator Payne has outlined in this chamber time and time again—that the previous Labor government commissioned not one new Australian ship for the

                   The Future Submarine program is expected to generate an annual average of around 2,800 jobs in Australia. That's before we consider the sustainment needs, and, indeed, before we consider the activities in relation to future frigates and offshore patrol vessels as well. This is significant growth in jobs. As my colleague Senator Payne has made very clear, if you didn't have all of that additional investment and activity—

                       As I was saying, if we didn't have the scale of additional investment across the range of shipbuilding and submarine construction activities, there would be no need to consider how it is we ensure that sustainment can also be accommodated rationally, sensibly and effectively into the future. But, as a government, we are absolutely determined to ensure that there is enormous additional activity, as there will be at Osborne in

We are proud of the fact that our naval industry investment program is going to support thousands upon thousands of additional jobs. Our work and investment is going to support jobs, defence force capability and opportunities for new business with investment and job opportunities well into the future, something that the Labor Party was never capable of delivering when in government.
