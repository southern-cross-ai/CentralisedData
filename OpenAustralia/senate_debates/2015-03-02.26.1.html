         Yes, I can. Thank you, Senator Bushby. In the Prime Minister's national security statement last Monday, he announced that the government was considering listing the Mosul district of Nineveh province in Iraq as a declared area under section 119.3 of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Code" rel="nofollow">
          Criminal Code
         </a>
         . That follows the foreign minister's declaration of Al-Raqqa province on 4 December last. Today the foreign minister has declared the area of Mosul district, making it an offence under section 119.2 of the Criminal Code to enter or remain in the Mosul district without a legitimate purpose. The offence carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment.
        </p>
        <p>
         ISIL seized control of Mosul on 10 June 2014, at the beginning of its offensive through northern and western Iraq. Since that time, Mosul has served as ISIL's primary stronghold in northern Iraq, from which they have undertaken all manner of barbaric and hostile activities against the Iraqi people and their government, including beheadings and sexual slavery. Foreign fighters and supporters of foreign conflicts pose a significant threat to Australia and our way of life. This government is committed to doing all it can to prevent Australians from providing any support to ISIL and other terrorist organisations. That includes making it an offence to travel to strongholds of ISIL such as Mosul.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government will continue to monitor the actions of ISIL and other terrorist groups in Syria and Iraq and will give consideration to declaring additional areas where there are groups engaging in hostile activities and where the grounds set out in the legislation warrant it.

           Thank you, Senator Bushby. As I said in answer to the principal question, primarily because Mosul is one of the headquarters of ISIL from which many of these barbaric acts are based. Today's listing sends a strong message that the government is determined to stop Australians from travelling to that centre of terrorist activity. It will assist our law enforcement agencies bring to justice those who have committed serious offences, including associating with and fighting for terrorist organisations overseas, putting at risk not only their own lives but the lives of Syrians and Iraqis and potentially risking the lives of Australians as well.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is important to note that the listing does not prevent people travelling to the area for legitimate purposes such as providing humanitarian aid, or bona fide visits to family members, but we are determined to use this, as all the weapons in the legal armoury, to prevent assistance to foreign fighters.

            <p>
             Yes, Senator Bushby, I can. As you know, there is a process which the legislation provides for. Prior to listing the Mosul district, the government actively engaged with Australia's Muslim community and our international counterparts. The foreign minister discussed the declaration of Mosul with our Iraqi counterparts, including during the Iraqi foreign minister's recent visit to Australia. We must show our support to the Iraqi government in our common fight against ISIL. We also consulted with local community groups to ensure they know we are here to protect them from those predators who seek to recruit their young men and women to fight in foreign wars.
            </p>
            <p>
             Finally—and Senator Bushby would be aware of this—the legislation sets out various other procedural steps that are necessary for the foreign minister to arrive at the view that she must hold before making a declaration. One of those steps is to consult the opposition, and that has been done as well.
