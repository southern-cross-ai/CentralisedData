        My question is to the minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. After 18 months of the Albanese Labor government, and as Australians end 2023, Australians are being forced to live with a worsening per capita recession. With historic collapses in productivity, which Labor's industrial relations laws are only going to make worse, and amongst the most entrenched inflation across advanced economies, life for Australians isn't easy under Mr Albanese, and it keeps getting harder. Why is Australia's economy struggling, so much more than so many counterparts right around the world, under this Labor government?

         I thank the senator for the question and for the opportunity to remind him—because it appears he has forgotten—what it is that this government has achieved in its first 18 months. We've seen cheaper child care for Australians. I know that that is a problem for you. Cheaper medicines—I know that is a problem for you. Fifty-eight Medicare—

               There are 624,000 new jobs, and I could go on. But one of the ones I want to focus on is the fact that we are seeing wages rising at the fastest rate in a decade, including for minimum-wage workers and aged-care workers. Don't those opposite hate that? Don't they hate that? Even Senator Hume, just the other day, this week again, was telling us what she and the coalition really think—'We can't have higher wages; it might lead to higher inflation.
              </p>
              <p>
               You have always been against higher wages for working people, and you are today. This side stands absolutely committed to providing better wages and working conditions for Australians. That is a contribution to the cost of living for Australians, something you will never understand because you hate backing wage increases, don't you, Senator Hume?

                   After 18 months of this Albanese Labor government, Australians are paying 27 per cent more tax, the interest they are paying on their mortgages has tripled, prices have risen by more than nine per cent and, contrary to what Senator Wong says, their real wages have gone backwards. They've gone backwards under Labor. Labor have broken promise after promise, including their promise for electricity prices to be cut by $275. Why are Australians paying so much more under Labor?

                       No amount of shouting at me will erase the fact that they voted against electricity price relief. So every time they come in here and talk about the cost of living, everyone will remember the party that put their hands up for higher electricity prices is sitting opposite me. So don't have the hide to come in here and talk about cost of living. You have always been for lower wages. Australians know that, and you showed that again today.

                         Australians are really going to love hearing how good they've got it under the Albanese government when, in fact, they've seen their real household income fall by 8.6 per cent on a per capita basis! Indeed, incomes have fallen more than in any other advanced economy, forcing Australians to cut back this Christmas and to feel real economic pain going into 2024. Rather than telling people how good they've got it, why don't you take responsibility and accept so many Australians are so much worse off under the Albanese Labor government?

                           (—) (): No amount of Senator Birmingham shouting will cause people to forget that this is the party that voted against electricity price relief. This is the party that wants medicines not cheaper but more expensive. This is the party that actually wants more expensive medicine. This is the party that doesn't back increasing the bulk-billing incentives. We want to make it easier and cheaper to see a doctor; they're happy for it to be more expensive and harder. On this side, we want cheaper child care and expanded paid parental leave, and we want more affordable housing. What do they want? To oppose more affordable housing. At the end of it all, the thing that really demonstrates their hypocrisy is that they have always been about low wages and they will always be about low wages, as they were today.
