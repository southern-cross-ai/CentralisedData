        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Senator Colbeck. This morning, speaking about COVID vaccines, Senator Canavan called for the Morrison government to 'suspend the rollout here in Australia'. Does Senator Canavan's position represent the government's position?

         I thank the senator for his question. Senator Canavan's position does not represent the government's position. I acknowledge the comments from Senator Canavan, and I acknowledge his right to have a perspective, to have a view on these things. I acknowledge his perspective. But, as we have done all the way through this pandemic, we are taking the health advice with respect to the vaccine rollout.
        </p>
        <p>
         Over recent days, with respect to the concerns that have been raised and the suspension of the vaccination rollout in a number of countries in Europe, our health agencies, particularly the TGA, have been in close contact with those agencies in Europe to understand what is occurring, and also to assure ourselves that the vaccination rollout is safe to continue with. The TGA has issued a statement to that effect, to indicate that the vaccination rollout is safe to continue with. ATAGI has issued a statement, with respect to the rollout, that it is safe to continue with, as has the

          Chief Medical Officer

         , who has issued a statement in relation to the safety of the rollout. So we will continue to the act on the health adviceâ€”

           This morning the Treasurer rejected Senator Canavan's calls to suspend the rollout, saying:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           They have not found any causal link between the vaccine itself and blood clots.
          </p>
          <p>
           Yet 10 minutes ago Senator Canavan doubled down on his comments in a tweet. Who are the Australian people supposed to believe: Treasurer Frydenberg or Senator Canavan?

            I would urge the Australian people to follow the advice that has been given to us by our world-leading health agencies and the TGA, one of the best agencies of its kind in the world. I would urge the Australian people to follow that advice. I would urge the Australian people to follow the advice of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Medical_Officer" rel="nofollow">
             Chief Medical Officer
            </a>
            , Professor Kelly. And I would urge the Australian people to follow the advice of ATAGI. All of these agencies, including the Chief Medical Officer, have issued a statement saying no causal link has been found between blood clotting and the vaccine, and that it is safe to continue with the rollout. All of those agencies are in close contact with their sister agencies in Europe.

               I am aware of a conversation between the Prime Minister and the health minister and Senator Canavan during a forum this morning where this matter was debated. So the views of the Prime Minister and the health minister are well known to Senator Canavan. I would urge the Australian people to take the world-leading advice of the TGA, ATAGI and the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMO" rel="nofollow">
                CMO
               </a>
               . I would urge the Australian people to follow that advice. In fact, I would urge all my colleagues to follow that advice because that is the thing that will retain confidence in the rollout of the vaccine in this country, which is so important to us from a health perspective and is so important to us from an economic perspectiveâ€”that we continue to safely roll out the vaccine in this country, in the support of all Australians.
