        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Cormann. When asked whether the government would work with Labor to deliver a National Energy Guarantee, the minister said: 'We have moved on. We have further refined our policy approach.' Exactly what is the government's energy approach, and how has it been refined?

         Of course, I'm very happy to talk about our policy approach to energy and compare it to the alternative. Our approach to energy policy is to ensure we deliver reliable energy and lower electricity prices, and, of course, Labor's approach is to whack Australian families with higher electricity prices on the back of the return of the carbon tax and also on the back of a completely irresponsible and unsustainable 50 per cent Renewable Energy Target. What has happened since the National Energy Guarantee was first proposed and, incidentally, opposed by

         —or, if he supported it, he was very much in hiding—is that we had an

         report that made a whole series of very sensible recommendations which the government has adopted. They are all a matter of public record. I'm quite happy to send all of the paperwork to Senator Pratt. If the Labor Party wants to engage with us, support our plan for lower electricity prices and walk away from their carbon tax—which would harm the economy, put jobs at risk and also harm the opportunity for Australian families to get ahead—I'm all ears.

              I can see that Senator Pratt is very interested in coming on board with our plan to bring down electricity prices, so I'm very hopeful that she will persuade the Labor Party to drop its plans for a carbon tax. I remember Senator Pratt when she was running in the 2013 campaign. By then we had Prime Minister Rudd. She was campaigning in

                The point of order is direct relevance. I understand he's reluctant to talk about government policy, but that is what the question is about: which of these proposals reflects the government's refined policy approach—

                    Direct relevance. It's a question about government policy. Surely the Leader of the Government in the Senate can actually respond on government policy.

                      Our policies lower electricity prices, and I know that in 2013 Senator Pratt also campaigned for lower electricity prices, because she said that they had abolished the carbon tax. I call on Senator Pratt to join us in making a commitment that there will be no carbon tax under a government that she is part of.

                        Does the government's refined policy approach include the government's so-called big stick? Can the minister now explain to the Senate and to Australians how the government would break up private power companies? What exactly is the big stick, and exactly when will it be used?

                         I know, of course, that the Labor Party is, as always, just playing politics, but I'm quite happy to explain to Senator Pratt that we will deliver lower electricity prices through a combination of measures. There are four key parts of our plan. The first is a price safety net to stop big power companies ripping off loyal customers who don't have time to shop around for a better deal. We know that some households are paying over $800 more per year and some small businesses nearly $3,500 more per year. We'll also be stopping price gouging and dodgy practices by the big energy companies, including banning sneaky late payment penalties and making energy retailers pass on savings in wholesale prices to customers. We'll be backing investment in reliable power by underwriting new electricity generation to improve competition, increase supply and reduce wholesale electricity prices. We'll be supporting 24/7 reliable power by requiring energy companies to sign contracts guaranteeing enough energy to meet demand.
