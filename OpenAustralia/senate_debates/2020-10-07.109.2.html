          John Fahey
         </a>
         since his sad passing earlier, in September. He was all of that and more: a man whose common decency shone through, making him someone admired and liked on both sides of politics. John leaves behind a profound legacy. He gave almost two decades of dedicated public service to the people of Australia, first as a member of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>

          Premier of New South Wales
         </a>
         . He then came to Canberra, where he served as Australia's Minister for Finance. As Premier, he helped to deliver major reforms for New South Wales and he helped to secure the 2000
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Olympics" rel="nofollow">
          Sydney Olympics
         </a>
         . Then, in the federal parliament, as Minister for Finance, he helped to repair Australia's finances in the mid to late 1990s.
        </p>
        <p>
         John was born on 10 January 1945 in Wellington,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
          New Zealand
         </a>
         , to Irish immigrants, Stephen and Annie Fahey, who left Ireland in the late 1930s to create a better life for themselves and their children—or the children that they hoped to have at that point. At age 10, John's family emigrated to Australia and settled in Picton, New South Wales. He completed his high school education at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevalier_College" rel="nofollow">
          Chevalier College
         </a>
         in Bowral and then went on to complete a Diploma of Law at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_University" rel="nofollow">
          The University
         </a>
         of Sydney. At 23, John married Colleen McGurren and they had three children: Melanie, Matthew and Tiffany.
        </p>
        <p>
         John was an avid lover of sport and was very passionate about rugby league. He was a Canterbury-Bankstown man through and through, who played reserve grade for the Bulldogs and held a number of administrative positions at the grassroots level. Upon graduating from university, John practised as a solicitor and eventually as a senior partner in his own firm. His first exposure to politics was during the 1972 federal election, where John found himself a supporter of the member for Macarthur,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bates" rel="nofollow">
          Jeff Bates
         </a>
         , who was running as an Independent.
        </p>
        <p>
         John came from a family of strong Labor supporters. His father and sister even handed out Labor how-to-vote cards at that 1972 federal election. But it was what he referred to as the 'extravagances' of the Whitlam government, because of those, that he decided to jump off the fence and join the Liberal Party. In his first speech to the federal parliament, John attributed his parents' teachings and his upbringing as to why he chose to join the Liberal Party. I'm quoting from his first speech now:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         They also taught me to think for myself and that is why I am a member of the Liberal Party. I have never voted Labor, as some scribes have written.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Liberal_Party" rel="nofollow">
          The Liberal Party
         </a>
         stands for all Australians, not any vested interest group such as the unions, and it supports reward for effort. Nothing is more Australian.
        </p>
        <p>
         Almost a decade later, John decided to run in the 1984 New South Wales state election, contesting and winning the seat of Camden. Four years later he ran as the Liberal candidate for the newly created seat of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Highlands" rel="nofollow">
          Southern Highlands
         </a>
         , winning it in the same year that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Greiner" rel="nofollow">
          Nick Greiner
         </a>
         led the New South Wales Liberals back into power. Under Nick Greiner as Premier, John served as Minister for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Relations" rel="nofollow">
          Industrial Relations
         </a>
         and later as Minister for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Further_Education" rel="nofollow">
          Further Education
         </a>
         , Training and Employment. However, four years later Greiner would step down as Premier and John was elected as the new New South Wales party leader. John was loyal to Greiner until the end, and it is a measure of his character that he would go on to describe the day Greiner resigned and he became Premier as the saddest day of his life.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although his time as Premier was short lived, he led a major overhaul of the industrial relations system, introduced the Disability Services Act, the New South Wales Seniors Card and appointed the state's first Minister for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_of_Women" rel="nofollow">
          Status of Women

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marise_Payne" rel="nofollow">
          Marise Payne
         </a>
         , who had a very close and warm relationship with John Fahey, and who is overseas on official ministerial business, has asked me to mention her deep regard and association with the remarks that I'm making on behalf of the government.
        </p>
        <p>
         John played a key role in Sydney's successful bid to host the 2000
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games" rel="nofollow">
          Olympic Games
         </a>
         , a huge victory for the state and our nation. John had the privilege of being in Monaco in September 1993, when Sydney was announced as the winning bid by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee" rel="nofollow">
          International Olympic Committee
         </a>
         president at the time,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Antonio_Samaranch" rel="nofollow">
          Juan Antonio Samaranch
         </a>
         . The vision of him leaping to his feet and joyously embracing the bid boss Rod McGeoch is one of the famous moments in our nation's history and one John will always be remembered for.
        </p>
        <p>
         John will also be remembered for his brave actions on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
          Australia Day
         </a>
         1994, when he helped tackle a student who fired two rounds from a starting pistol in the direction of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Charles" rel="nofollow">
          Prince Charles
         </a>
         , who was about to deliver a speech. Vision of the then Premier jumping to the defence of the visiting
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          Prince of Wales
         </a>
         was shown all around the world. He, like others there that day, had no idea if a real gun was involved when he made the instant decision to act. It was pointed out at the time that some of his old rugby league skills had been on display. I believe the biggest thing on display that day was his character and his courage. A year later, the Fahey government would lose the 1995 state election despite winning 51.2 per cent of the two-party preferred statewide vote.
        </p>
        <p>
         While this was a hard time for the party, John was looking ahead, and in 1996 he resigned from the New South Wales parliament to contest the federal election as the Liberal candidate for Macarthur. John was successful, winning the seat from Labor, as were the Liberals, with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
          John Howard
         </a>
         leading the party to victory. He was appointed as Minister for Finance in the first Howard ministry, a position he would hold until his retirement in 2001. At John's state funeral last month, Mr Howard said he had no hesitation in appointing John Minister for Finance. As Mr Howard said, 'How could you pass over somebody who had been the premier of the largest state in the Commonwealth for a senior portfolio?' And John relished the task. Mr Howard said that, as finance minister, John fixed a steady gaze on any minister that had big spending pretensions.
        </p>
        <p>
         John is Australia's third-longest-serving finance minister and in that role accomplished a number of significant reforms and achievements in that portfolio. He initiated and pursued a number of asset sales, big and small, including the initial partial sale of Telstra and the sale of Sydney and Canberra airports. Considered the greatest sale in Australian history, the sale of the first third of Telstra raised $14 billion. John also presided over the sale of the second third of Telstra, which raised over $6 billion. Australians benefited tremendously from the improved services those sales facilitated and from the proceeds of those sales, which were reinvested for future generations.
        </p>
        <p>
         In 2000, John played an important role in the federal government's acquisition of the remaining 51.55 per cent equity in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Submarine_Corporation" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Submarine Corporation
         </a>
         . Today the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASC" rel="nofollow">
          ASC
         </a>
         plays a crucial role as part of our naval shipbuilding, repair and maintenance industry. ASC's turnaround in performance in relation to submarine sustainment demonstrates the significant progress this business has made in both experience and capability. In partnership with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Costello" rel="nofollow">
          Peter Costello
         </a>
         as Treasurer, they introduced the Charter of Budget Honesty, a key recommendation that arose from the 1996
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          National Commission
         </a>
         of Audit. The charter introduced a number of innovations to fiscal reporting and strategy, creating more transparency in the Commonwealth budget process.
        </p>
        <p>
         They also delivered the first accrual based budget in May 1999, which represented a major development in public sector financial management and reporting. The adoption of accrual reporting facilitated better planning and decision-making as well as providing a means with which to assess financial resilience.
        </p>
        <p>
         One of the things John was most proud of during his time as Minister for Finance was the fiscal discipline of the Howard government. Fahey and Costello, a formidable team, set out to reset and rebuild the federal budget, setting the foundations for what would be a run of four consecutive budget surpluses. The forward trajectory of the budget settings secured under his stewardship as Minister for Finance ultimately led to paying off all government net debt and building a positive net asset position for the Commonwealth within five years. Budget repair is never easy, and John was central to returning sound, disciplined economic and fiscal management to Australia for the benefit of all Australians.
        </p>
        <p>
         In announcing his retirement, John said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The simple fact of the matter is that the fiscal responsibility of recent times has without the slightest doubt given Australia a far better future than it could ever have hoped to have had.
        </p>
        <p>
         He was correct. When the Howard government left office in 2007, the strong fiscal management undertaken by John and his successor in the portfolio, our good friend and valued former colleague
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Minchin" rel="nofollow">
          Nick Minchin
         </a>
         , stood Australia in very good stead when it faced the global economic headwinds in the context of the global financial crisis.
        </p>
        <p>
         In 2001, after battling ill health, John made the decision to retire from politics. His battle with lung cancer and near miss with death didn't halt his work ethic and his commitment to the people of Australia. During his valedictory speech he acknowledged that there were still many things that he wanted to do. He wanted to continue giving to the community and he intended to continue working. He reflected that few have the opportunity to choose when they leave parliament. More often than not, it is decided by the public or our own parties. He was lucky to have that choice. Upon his retirement from political life, he served as chairman of the Bradman Foundation, director of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Flying_Doctor_Service" rel="nofollow">
          Royal Flying Doctor Service
         </a>
         , chairman of the Rugby League Development Board, chancellor of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Catholic_University" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Catholic University
         </a>
         and, fittingly, given his history, chairman of the Sydney Olympic Park Authority and chairman of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
        </p>
        <p>
         John was a devout Catholic and a man of strong faith. He originally wanted to be a bishop, but a year at a seminary in Springwood in his youth was enough to persuade him that priesthood was perhaps not his future—a decision that many of us are grateful he made. In late 2019 John was awarded the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_Grand_Cross" rel="nofollow">
          Knight Grand Cross
         </a>
         of the Order of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Gregory" rel="nofollow">

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church" rel="nofollow">
          Catholic Church
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Since the news of his passing, tributes have flooded in for John and his family. Many have reflected on his life and on his achievements. He was a mentor to many, including many of my colleagues. On assuming responsibilities for the Finance portfolio back in 2013 I was very grateful to John for his generous and wise counsel. He was a kind and generous individual. He gave more than he received. He was authentic and someone you could always rely on. In his final speech to parliament, he made sure to thank everyone in this place from his personal staff and colleagues to the House attendants, caterers and gardeners, who he thanked for creating a place of joy and comfort. That summed up the kind of man John was.
        </p>
        <p>
         As the Prime Minister has stated, John was not your typical Liberal: a Catholic, a rugby league player and a smoker from south-west Sydney. But the Liberal Party is a broad church—something we pride ourselves on. And John broadened our outlook and made our party all the better for it. To John's wife, Colleen; his surviving children, Melanie and Matthew; and his grandchildren, Amber and Campbell: on behalf of the Australian government and the Senate, I offer our deepest condolences.

           John Fahey
          </a>
          served his state and his country. He served this parliament and the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
           Parliament of New South Wales
          </a>
          . Like many good people who have graced this place, John's life started across the ditch. He was born in Wellington,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
           New Zealand
          </a>
          , on 10 January 1945, before migrating to Picton, New South Wales, in 1956. He married his wife, Colleen Maree McGurren, in 1968. They had two daughters and one son. Importantly, John became an Australian citizen in 1973.
         </p>
         <p>
          If public life hadn't ended up calling John's name, he had the beginnings of another career: in rugby league. It was an
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Catholic" rel="nofollow">
           Irish Catholic
          </a>
          nun, of all people, who introduced John to rugby league. Don't worry; John himself described that situation as bizarre. When he was 11, John was coached by Sister Kevin at St Anthony's convent in Picton. She was in charge of selecting the team to play against
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's" rel="nofollow">
           St Paul's
          </a>
          convent, Camden. In 2010, John reflected: 'Here was an Irish nun in full religious habit, trying to teach a group of boys the fundamentals of league, such as playing the ball and six-man scrums, on the concrete playground between the church and the school. It was a blessed relief when one of the team's fathers agreed to take over as coach.'
         </p>
         <p>
          He reverted to rugby union—the national religion of his native New Zealand— at the age of 13, during his five years boarding at
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevalier_College" rel="nofollow">
           Chevalier College
          </a>
          at Bowral. Despite this dalliance with rugby union, he said he learned more about league than union at this time thanks to his portable radio. The winter months at home from boarding school were spent with 'nothing but football talk in the house and drying football gear hanging on the verandas.' I think John knew in his early years the toll that football would take on his body. He said: 'Football grounds were not watered as they are today. Most grounds had a concrete cricket pitch with a shallow covering of soil that became rock hard. To keep the skin on our knees we coated them with petroleum jelly. We would slip foam pads into the sides of our shorts to protect our hips. Is it any wonder my generation turned orthopaedic surgeons into wealthy men?'
         </p>
         <p>
          After years of playing junior league, in 1964 John played senior rugby league as a centre with the Camden Rams in the New South Wales country rugby league Group 6, first grade competition. He had just begun work as a law clerk in Bankstown for the wage of six pounds a week, but winning a game of footy paid five pounds. The next year he was graded for Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs and played 37 lower-grade matches.
         </p>
         <p>
          It took a failed law exam in 1966 for John to realise he was likely to be a lawyer for longer than a footballer. Although he might have stopped playing league, it didn't stop his love or passion for the game. He still coached, and became the joint patron of the Bulldogs from 1993 until his passing.
         </p>
         <p>
          As Premier, John cancelled the Newcastle Knights's $3 million debt over the development of their stadium. As he pointed out, Parramatta and the eastern suburbs got their stadiums for nothing; why did Newcastle have to pay for theirs? I might add John wasn't the last premier of New South Wales to provide funding for a New South Wales rugby league team. As Premier, and much to the dismay of his Liberal colleagues at the time, he helped develop
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WIN" rel="nofollow">
           WIN
          </a>
          Stadium in the Labor stronghold of Wollongong before helping to fund Gosford stadium once he became federal Minister for Finance. John's justification was simple. He said, 'Communities revolve around common interests and pride in their achievements. They need to believe they are as good as any other part of our country. Communities, not governments of any particular persuasion, make Australia the great nation that it is.'
         </p>
         <p>
          John was first elected in 1984. He became the New South Wales Minister for
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Relations" rel="nofollow">

          </a>
          . John managed the devastating 1993-94 bushfire season, which saw Sydney surrounded and over 70,000 hectares burnt. He might have lost the 1995 election to
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Carr" rel="nofollow">
           Bob Carr

         </p>
         <p>
          John was a small-l liberal, a true liberal, some might say. After his state election defeat he went on to win the federal seat of Macarthur in 1996 and became Minister for Finance under
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard" rel="nofollow">

          until 2001.
         </p>
         <p>
          John Fahey was a larger-than-life personality with equally large achievements. There were also successes that Australians got to share. Monumental in securing the Sydney 2000

          , it's bittersweet that John passed away just before its 20th anniversary. After Sydney won the bid on 24 September 1993, he said:

           Australia Day

           Darling Harbour

          stage on Australia Day 1994, John demonstrated not only characteristic selflessness and valour but also the hallmark athleticism of a former rugby league player. I was as fortunate to have him on my side that day as the people of New South Wales were to have him on theirs.' Those are lovely words from Prince Charles.
         </p>
         <p>
          However, in fact, this particular event and the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Cross_College" rel="nofollow">
           Holy Cross College

          , Ryde link John Fahey and me in an odd way that most would not know; that is, through two individuals who were enrolled in Holy Cross College, Ryde in the class of 1988. One of those is Ben Keneally, my husband, and the very next person to him on the official college enrolment book is the person famously tackled by John Fahey that day, in January 1994. Of course, it's not just John and me who are former New South Wales premiers with ties to Holy Cross College, Ryde. The school also helped produce another

         </p>
         <p>
          But back to John Fahey. He was one of the first senior Liberals to support an Australian republic, a cause that has now united so many across this chamber, as well as in the other place. After having a lung removed due to cancer in 2001, John announced he was retiring from politics, but that didn't stop his life of service. He went on to be the second president of the World Anti-Doping Agency, from 2007 to 2013. He was Chancellor of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Catholic_University" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Catholic University
          </a>
          from 2014 until his death last month. John's Catholic faith sustained him. He carried his soldier's rosary beads with him, reaching into his right pocket during difficult conversations or trying situations. I'm sure his faith gave him solace following the tragic loss of his daughter, Tiffany, on
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_Day" rel="nofollow">
           Boxing Day
          </a>
          2006, when she was killed in a road accident. He and Colleen took on the unimaginably sad but nonetheless, I'm sure, rewarding duty to raise his daughter's children as their own.
         </p>
         <p>
          Last year, Pope Francis made John a
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_Grand_Cross" rel="nofollow">

           Saint Gregory
          </a>
          the Great, not a bad title for a smoking, drinking, rugby league-playing politician, a title which John accepted humbly, saying it made him feel terribly unworthy. While John might have felt unworthy, he was worthy of the title and the fitting tributes that he has received in here and in the other place, in the media and from the public. No-one can say how John might have reacted to such tributes, but we know how he felt about his life of service. Last year he said: 'To have been given the opportunities that I have been given, I count myself extraordinarily blessed.' I will say that New South Wales, our parliament and our country have been blessed to have been served by John Fahey.
         </p>
         <p>
          My heartfelt condolences go to John's wife, Colleen, to his son, Matthew, and to his grandchildren. In expressing these words of condolence, I add the condolences of the former New South Wales premiers Bob Carr and

           . He was a good man and a great authentic Australian. John was a selfless servant to the people of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
            New South Wales
           </a>
           and to Australia over his two decades in the New South Wales and the federal parliaments. Rightfully, there has been much focus on John Fahey's many achievements, both as Premier and as federal finance minister but also as the man he was. John reluctantly took the reins of the Liberal leadership in New South Wales, describing the moment as one of his saddest days because of the circumstances under which he took over the leadership. Despite this, true to form and true to his nature, he rolled up his sleeves and he got on with the job of leading and reforming not only his party but his beloved state.
          </p>
          <p>
           He delivered major policy initiatives, such as the introduction of the Disability Services Act, the introduction of the New South Wales seniors card, the appointment of the first New South Wales Minister for the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_of_Women" rel="nofollow">

           , and the overhaul of the New South Wales industrial relations system. And, as has been said by previous speakers, he famously leapt for joy when it was announced that his tireless advocacy, and that of his team, for Sydney to host the 2000
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympics" rel="nofollow">

           was successful. For those of us old enough to remember, we will never forget his spontaneous and unbridled joy.
          </p>
          <p>
           John Fahey courageously and selflessly put himself in harm's way to protect

           in 1994. He helped the people of New South Wales rebuild after the devastating 1994 bushfires that went straight into the heart of Sydney. After the closest of electoral defeats in New South Wales in 1995, he rolled up his sleeves, shook himself up and entered the federal parliament as the member for Macarthur at the 1996 federal election, which was when I first met him. As the federal Minister for Finance, John was instrumental in rebuilding the federal budget to a position of strength, for which all of us in this nation still owe him a great debt of gratitude.
          </p>
          <p>
           I would also like to mention one of John's many unsung achievements: his advocacy and mentorship of young men and women—in particular, women—in the Liberal Party. My friend and very good colleague Senator
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marise_Payne" rel="nofollow">
            Marise Payne
           </a>
           , who unfortunately is not able to be here today because of official overseas business, has very fondly recounted to me the support John so generously extended to her throughout her career in the party. John supported Marise throughout her political career, all the way back to when she was a young staffer in the Greiner-Fahey government of the late 1980s and the early 1990s in New South Wales. In her poignant and heartfelt eulogy at John's funeral, Marise remarked that, as part of John's team, you worked with him not for him. She described John as always available and always supportive.
          </p>
          <p>
           This says so much about his leadership style and his contributions. He valued individuals and also their contributions, and he didn't harbour prejudices. That is what made him such a wonderful role model for several generations of Liberals. And I know that he played a role in mentoring many other Liberal women, including Senator Fierravanti-Wells and the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales_Premier" rel="nofollow">

           </a>
           . While I didn't personally have the opportunity to get to know him well, I am thankful for all that he did to chart the path for strong female representation in this party at all levels. He did this not in the pursuit of tokenism but in recognition of the need for our parliamentary chambers right across our nation to be more representative of all Australians and in recognition of the need for the best representatives, be they male or female. In the words of the Prime Minister today, he was a tremendous Liberal.

           We honour John Fahey's leadership, his service and, indeed, his entire life. To John's wife, Colleen, and his two children and grandchildren, I offer my heartfelt condolences. We give our thanks to John for a life well lived and authentically lived.

            and his service to our nation, which is on the public record. I want to add a few brief comments and observe that it was my privilege to be John Fahey's junior minister for about 10 months when he was finance minister and I first became a junior minister as the then

            . John's politics were motivated by a genuine desire to serve his community, which he did exceptionally well. He was willing to mentor, advise and share his expertise and wealth of anecdotes; and that was indicative of his generosity of spirit, which he kindly extended towards me as a minister seeking to find his feet. Minister Fahey was personable, genuine and humble. You couldn't help but like him. I did.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also recall the day he gave me the shocking news that he was taking leave for 'exploratory surgery' and gave me that meaningful look indicating that things were pretty tough. On his return, he was very matter of fact about the statistical challenge that he was up against, having such extensive lung cancer. Suffice it to say that, in his typical spirit, he overcame it beyond his own belief and his own predictions to me, and he continued to serve the Australian people, and indeed the world community in the sporting arena, in a manner that was indicative of the way he served the people of

              Jim Carlton
             </a>
             . When we lost the election, I received a phone call from Robert Maher, who was the chief of staff to John Fahey. He asked me if I would consider taking on the position of senior private secretary. I knew John Fahey's former senior private secretary, David Pigott, who had worked for
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard" rel="nofollow">

             in the past. It was a wonderful opportunity, and I certainly accepted the job.
            </p>
            <p>
             My role as senior private secretary was to look after the administration of the office, including the extensive paper flow as well as the diaries of both John Fahey and his wife, Colleen. Working with me, I had a team of people which included Barb Williams, who had formerly been John Howard's private secretary, and two
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
              New South Wales
             </a>
             party stalwarts, Liz Storey and Robyn Kerr. John loved to talk to people. He liked to have a drink. He liked to smoke. Of course, that meant that often the diary, notwithstanding best intentions, ended up being somewhat chaotic because appointments inevitably ran over and things had to be changed and rescheduled. Nevertheless, people who needed to see him always got the opportunity to have a chat with him.
            </p>
            <p>
             John can be well described as a consistent smoker. Health wise, ultimately, he paid a heavy price for that, although he did very well after his lung operation. At that time, the Premier's office was located on level 8 of the old State Office Block on the corner of Macquarie and Bent Streets. Now, of course, it doesn't exist anymore, but at that time we had old-fashioned air conditioners which ran along the walls between the rooms. The heavy smoking from the Premier's office meant that everyone shared in the effects! Given my office was directly next to the Premier's office, I inevitably had more than my share of the smoking experience, such that I had to often resort to opening my window to
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macquarie_Street" rel="nofollow">
              Macquarie Street
             </a>
             . Yes, those were the days when you could actually open the windows in offices!
            </p>
            <p>
             Much has been said of John's actions at

              Prince Charles
             </a>
             . My husband, John, and I were sitting in one of the front rows when this incident happened. It came as no surprise that John Fahey just didn't think twice. He reacted quickly and, in true rugby style, tackled the fellow to the floor of the stage. It all happened so quickly, but it was so typical of John to put the safety of others above his own safety and to take the actions that he did on that day. It was really good to see Prince Charles sending his message at the funeral service.
            </p>
            <p>
             John was not a man to indulge in spin. He was quietly spoken, measured and honest in his responses. John's natural exuberance when Sydney was named to host the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games" rel="nofollow">
              Olympic Games
             </a>
             for 2000 was just typical of him. I know that at the time he worked very closely with others on the bid. It was tough going up against Beijing. On merit we knew we should win, but Beijing's aggressive campaign exerted heavy pressure in many different ways. I remember the morning of the announcement: about three or four of us were sitting in the office at 4.15 am, watching the television and fully expecting that we weren't going to win. Then, of course, we did win and the rest is history.
            </p>
            <p>
             As his senior private secretary, my job was to control the paper flow—and, believe me, there was a lot of paper! When I started the job, the thing I found most frustrating was when John would go out and people would speak to him and say, 'Look, I wrote to you X months ago and I haven't received a reply.' This called for drastic action. I instigated the establishment of a document-tracing system, much to the chagrin of the bureaucrats in the Premier's Department!
            </p>
            <p>
             John and I were very similar in a number of ways—both from poor, working-class backgrounds; both having started as articled clerks; and both having worked very hard to become lawyers. John's attention to detail was something that he and I very much shared. Part of my job was to read all the files and the correspondence before they went in to the Premier for consideration. I made sure that prominent details were flagged and omissions or problems highlighted, knowing that John would also read the entire file, sharing those concerns and taking the appropriate action. Clearly, this didn't endear me to the public servants, but then that wasn't something that I was worried about too much.
            </p>
            <p>
             John had a strong work ethic which I saw and experienced firsthand. John and Colleen had an apartment on level 9 of the State Office Block. John would regularly go upstairs at the end of the day, have something to eat and then come back to the office and work late into the night to ensure that the paperwork and the briefs were done. I sometimes worked alongside him in the evenings. Let's not forget that this was a difficult time in New South Wales politics. It was a minority government, relying on three Independents to support or reject the government's plans. John kept on top of so many issues. He needed to, given the complexities of minority existence. Yes, there were always cigarettes and, yes, there was always a cup of coffee. Occasionally, there was a whiskey! But he certainly ploughed through the paperwork.
            </p>
            <p>
             Being of the Catholic faith, I was disappointed that I was not afforded the opportunity to farewell John in person. Nevertheless, I would like to place on record my farewells and my admiration for John as a decent, hardworking man of family and faith. I was grateful to John for having afforded me the opportunity to work in his office. It was a very good experience. I valued both his friendship and his guidance.

             conclude by once again offering my condolences to his wife, Colleen, his children, Matthew and Melanie, and his grandchildren, Amber and Campbell, who, along with many people—ordinary Australians—will remember John Fahey as an honest and decent man who so admirably served his state and his country. John was a decent, hardworking human being. He lived his life true to his faith, true to his family and true to his values. Vale, John Fahey.

               John Fahey

              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Wales" rel="nofollow">

              </a>
              from apparent assassination attempts, as a football player, as a community man, as a husband and as a father, he was a special character.
             </p>
             <p>
              John and I didn't know each other well, other than to say that I was a teenager when he was my local member. So, in many ways, as I was coming to understand politics he was the local example I had of how to do it. He set that example pretty well, I thought. To begin with, I didn't know much about him other than that he was elected to federal parliament as a part of the Howard government in 1996, a government that I was observing with interest despite being aged just 14 at the time. He'd moved into federal politics, of course, after his substantial contribution to the state parliament.
             </p>
             <p>
              My most memorable brush with John was when, as a senior high school student, I was one of the kids selected to attend the school's constitutional convention, an opportunity that sparked an interest in our Constitution that, no doubt, has played a part in me being a rather embarrassing law nerd to this day. We all travelled to Canberra and there was a reception function where every attendee was matched up with their local member. As best as I can recall, there were relatively few people—about 20 kids from across the state and certainly no more than one per electorate. So every student had their local member attend to chat about what we were learning about our country and its institutions and our Constitution. It was a lovely opportunity. Everyone's local MP showed up except mine. I didn't understand why. Was there something urgent that had come up? He had a pretty big responsibility, so that would be understandable. Had I done something wrong? It was odd being the only kid on her own. I left a little bewildered about that, but was nevertheless thrilled to have been part of this experience. I left with a passion for constitutional law that, I confess, still hasn't gone away.
             </p>
             <p>
              The mystery of my local member's nonattendance wasn't solved until many, many years later. My dad spilled the beans to me about a decade ago. With his usual courtesy and beautiful manners, John had called my home, presumably to give me a pat on the back for being selected and to let me know that we would see one another at the reception in Canberra. My dad, who ran his plumbing business from home and was under a lot of stress between managing apprentices and tradesmen and builders, wasn't coping that well at the time. He answered the phone with what I will say was a colourful bunch of expletives. It was rough as guts. On reflection, though, as an accomplished footy player perhaps John was well placed to handle that! It wasn't uncommon in the construction industry at the time. When John introduced himself with, again, his usual politeness, my father's reaction didn't improve. Shortly after, with another mouthful of swearwords, my dad hung up on poor John. When I found out this story, I learned why my dad hadn't told me about it at the time. I would have been absolutely mortified. When I think about it now, though, given the constituency he served, the jobs they did, the interests they had and, let's face it, the shared love of footy and a drink that both my dad and John had, I suspect that, had they met in different circumstances, they might have got along rather well.
             </p>
             <p>
              No-one has sympathy for politicians, of course, but it should be said that no pollie deserves to be treated that way. It's little wonder he didn't show up to say hello. You can only imagine what he thought he was going to meet when he arrived. At times, when an irate constituent doesn't answer the phone with the courtesy that I extend to others, my mind flicks back to that story. It's a reminder we never know the challenges that the person on the other end of the line is dealing with—how hard they are or how much the person is struggling to cope. It's a reminder that some people—dare I say it, particularly some of the toughest-looking blokes—still struggle to ask for help, and the bad behaviour, as unacceptable as it is, can be a cry for help. But I've digressed somewhat.
             </p>
             <p>
              John will be remembered for his love of sport and the sheer joy he radiated as he jumped at the news that Sydney had been selected to host the 2000
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games" rel="nofollow">
               Olympic Games
              </a>
              . I think that's the image that will always be publicly associated with him, burned into our national memory. He'll be remembered for his love of his country and for the important work he did to put this country on a stable financial footing. But I hope he will be remembered for even more than that. He was a devout Christian and, in contrast to so many politicians whose convictions wilt in roles like this, he remained firmly but respectfully pro life. The measure of the man is how he rose to life's difficulties. After the loss of his daughter Tiffany when she was just 27, he and his wife, Colleen, became guardians to and raised her children, Campbell and Amber. He battled cancer more than once, but he continued to serve his community well after his parliamentary service was over. He made the community in which I grew up better—a place where a plumber like my dad could prosper despite his occasional potty-mouth and where a girl like me could aspire to make a contribution beyond herself, and for that I'm grateful. I hope he'll be remembered as a faithful servant, a good husband and a caring father. May God rest his soul and comfort his family.

               to those sentiments already echoed by so many colleagues. John Fahey was indeed a great Australian, a great contributor and a man who left an enormous imprint on the public life and on the public psyche. It is a testament to his style, character and authenticity that Australians, particularly

It's also the case that Liberals across the country remembered him as a man of conviction and of values but also very much of a common touch. I acknowledge his many accomplishments, many of which have been reflected in this chamber today.
              </p>
              <p>
               I wish only to say a few words, but I also want to add some remarks of others. I reached out to some of John's former parliamentary colleagues in this place to seek their reflections on the man they served alongside in the parliament and in the cabinet. Former Leader of the Government in this place

               , as well as humility and insight that endeared him to colleagues. He also acknowledged that John was someone who you could rely on in a political contest and that he didn't run from a fight but nor was he someone who initiated them. He never abandoned his friends.

She recorded, in true Amanda Vanstone style, the story after John's first lung surgery, where the doctors told him that they hadn't taken much out because it looked so grim. He asked, according to Amanda, if they were 'effing joking'. He said that he hadn't come to surgery to not take every chance possible to give him the best chance of success and that he wanted to go back into surgery as soon as possible and for them to take as much as was necessary for him to be able to live a long life ahead. Indeed, that is what happened—he had further surgery. They went back in and took the rest of that lung, but that gave him the chance to go on and serve many good years to make an enormous contribution, as we've heard, as chair of

She did have the chance to speak at John's funeral, and the Prime Minister has reflected on just how beautifully

Marise wanted me to remind the chamber that John Fahey was, like Marise, a great republican.

                I rise to make some brief remarks in addition to the very generous words that have already been offered this afternoon about
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fahey" rel="nofollow">
                 John Fahey
                </a>
                . Like many people who have come to
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
                 New South Wales
                </a>
                and to Sydney, John Fahey did not come from Sydney or from New South Wales, which again shows that this is a fantastic part of the world where anyone can make it. Ultimately, John Fahey went on to lead the state and serve with distinction here in Canberra. I spoke to close personal friends like
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Brogden" rel="nofollow">
                 John Brogden
                </a>
                and
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peta_Seaton" rel="nofollow">
                 Peta Seaton
                </a>
                in preparation for these remarks. The summary really was that John Fahey was a believer in hard work but that he had a very big heart and a very soft heart. Everyone has remarked very eloquently about his contribution to the state of New South Wales. Certainly securing the Olympics was a great thing for our country, and anyone who attended the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Olympics" rel="nofollow">
                 Sydney Olympics
                </a>
                would recall that. I attended as a young man from Shepparton, and that was like going to Hollywood. The Sydney Olympics were a great and enduring contribution to the state of New South Wales.
               </p>
               <p>
                People who knew John Fahey well, like John Brogden, would often say that he had a photographic memory. He would remember exactly what was in every page of every brief and he would pull people up for not actually knowing all the detail of the brief that they had had some role in pulling together, which is a remarkable thing to be able to do. But it was necessary in the role that John Fahey performed with
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Costello" rel="nofollow">
                 Peter Costello
                </a>
                and
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
                 John Howard
                </a>
                in delivering a very important passage of fiscal consolidation in the 1990s, where every single line item in every single budget needed to be known. As Senator Cormann has said in our own time, the detail is where you win these arguments and the detail is where you can make some really important fiscal improvements.
               </p>
               <p>
                I want to briefly read this great quote from John Brogden and some other New South Wales colleagues that was published recently in
                <i>
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sydney_Morning_Herald" rel="nofollow">
                  The Sydney Morning Herald
                 </a>
                </i>
                . I thought that this was the nicest thing I had ever read about anyone in politics. This is about Mr Fahey:
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                He inspired loyalty and his patience, kindness and above all, his willingness to chat with everyone created an army of people willing to go the extra mile. More than one staff member despaired of his schedule as he genially derailed meetings with questions about rugby, family and life in general. It was a mark of the man that his interest was as deep and genuine in the humblest worker as the most senior person in the room.
               </p>
               <p>
                That is a very generous quote.
               </p>
               <p>
                Post politics, John Fahey went on not only to play a very important role in his own family but also to lead the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Catholic_University" rel="nofollow">
                 Australian Catholic University
                </a>
                . I can see that, as a man of deep faith, he was also very committed to pluralism. The
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC" rel="nofollow">

                U's work, especially in Indigenous affairs, has gone well beyond its direct mandate. He was a great contributor and a very good and warm man. May he rest in peace.
