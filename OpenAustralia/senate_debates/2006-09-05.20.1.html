        . Minister, Australia has massively reduced road deaths through black spot roadworks and ongoing national public education campaigns. Will the government now consider taking equivalent action to reduce the 4,900 work related deaths a year in workplaces, which is double that of road deaths, and the 9,000 deaths a year from preventable hospital mistakes, which is four times that of road deaths? What is the government doing to replicate road safety type activity in workplace deaths and preventable hospital deaths, such as regular totals by state publicised on the nightly

        news, publicity on black spots, more funded public campaigns to reduce these totals and concerted coordinated national campaigns? If we as a community are rightly appalled by road deaths and injuries, and if governments have tried so hard to attack the road deaths problem across Australia, when will we see the same sort of energy and commitment on workplace deaths and preventable hospital deaths?

         I thank Senator Murray for his question because it provides me with an opportunity to say on behalf of the government that the matters that he raises are indeed very serious and this is not a dorothy dixer. I will try to tackle each of the three points made by Senator Murray. In terms of deaths in hospitals, Senator Murray would appreciate, perhaps more than most in this place, that the administration of hospital systems falls very much under state jurisdiction. I could take this opportunity to launch another attack on the Beattie Labor government and undoubtedly other Labor governments who, in my view and in the view of the government, as expressed by the Prime Minister on Sunday, are derelict in fulfilling their responsibilities towards the public they should be looking after, particularly those who are in hospital.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senators opposite—and I am sure Senator Murray would agree with me—just do not take these matters seriously. They are representatives of parties that are responsible, in government, for fixing problems which Senator Murray quite rightly highlights in this chamber, and they are not being fixed. All I can say to senators opposite is that until they take their responsibilities seriously—and one of those responsibilities is to make their colleagues act responsibly as they administer the health system—they will never be taken seriously. One of their responsibilities is to ensure that they continually represent their constituents. All of those opposite—including, in particular, Queensland senators—are responsible to their constituents. I have not seen one Queensland senator get up in this place and condemn the atrocious performance of the Beattie Labor government.

            , I am sorry if Senator Murray believes I am not treating his question with respect. I am sorry that is your attitude, Senator Murray. You cannot deny—no-one in this place can seriously deny—that state governments are not responsible for what happens in their public hospitals. I will stop there, Senator, and move on to occupational health and safety.

            As Senator Murray would know, this government does not have overwhelming responsibility, or major responsibility, for occupational health and safety. Again, Senator Murray would be aware—

             I hear those opposite object violently to the truth, but it happens to be the truth. We will again seek to make state governments accountable and responsible. In terms of programs and federal government funding for workplace initiatives, I will get some specific information for you, Senator Murray, because I do not have the figures available. But I again stress that occupational health and safety systems are administered by state governments. I will seek to get further information on funding.

                  , I ask a supplementary question. Mr President, you would know that I do not agree that members opposite do not take these matters seriously, as I do not agree that the government do not take these matters seriously. But the fact is that we have 13,900 deaths in work related injuries and preventable hospital mistakes which are just not being addressed with the same energy that road deaths have been addressed, and I think the government can take national leadership in the area. So my supplementary question is this: is the minister aware that it was reported in at least one hospital in Geelong that the rate of adverse medical events which lead to preventable deaths has been massively reduced by more effective reporting, communication and management systems? Why is this not being replicated elsewhere? If the minister is not aware, perhaps he could take that back to the Minister for

                   I am not aware of the incident that Senator Murray has brought to the attention of the Senate. I will acquaint myself with that example, but I reiterate for the benefit of senators that, if a good example of best practice within a state-run hospital has been identified, it is up to the state governments to replicate that good practice and that good experience.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   In response to Senator Murray’s statement that he does not believe that those opposite do not take their responsibilities as seriously as they should, as I claim they should, I will have to disagree, because I again say to you, Senator Murray, that I have not heard one of the senators opposite representing any state government get up and criticise the atrocious performance of state governments in relation to the administration of the public health system.

                     The interjection by Senator McLucas is a very relevant one.
