        My question is to the Assistant Minister for Health, Senator Nash. I refer to the government's proposed
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        tax and comments from the president of the Rural Doctors Association of Australia, Dr Ian Kamerman, who said:

       <p class="italic">
        The proposed Medicare co-payment model is going to hit rural patients hard and will cause significant problems to country medical practices and their communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Isn't the Rural Doctors Association right?

         The best thing that this coalition government can do for people living in rural areas is fix the economic mess that was left to us by the previous Labor government. It is very obvious that this government has had to make some tough decisions when it comes to the budget.

          Check the record, Senators. In terms of the process I ask you to draw the minister's attention to the question. It is about the Rural Doctors Association statement. She has begun and probably will try to continue not mentioning that at all in her response.

            Quite extraordinary from those opposite, before I am even 30 seconds into the answer, to go to the question of relevance. I can indicate to those opposite that, unlike the previous government, it is the coalition government that is focused on delivery for rural and regional health. Whether it is the $238 million to double the Practice Incentive Payment so that we can improve teaching outcomes in regional areas, the $52 million for infrastructure grants for rural and regional areas or the $13.4 million extra for additional scholarships—

                   To assert that I do not care about rural communities is so far from the mark it is extraordinary. As those opposite would also know, it is for cabinet ministers to determine budget arrangements. Those opposite may not know that I continually consult with those in the rural medical sector and, on an ongoing basis, I convey their views to the health minister. The economic mess Labor left us is the reason we had to make such tough decisions in this budget. When we came into government we inherited a situation of potentially a $667 billion debt. This government is responsible and it is prepared to make the decisions to fix that situation to ensure the future prosperity of the nation.
