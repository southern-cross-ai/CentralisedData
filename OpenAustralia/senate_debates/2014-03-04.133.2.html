        I am pleased to rise tonight to commemorate the 90th anniversary of Canberra's oldest social club, the Canberra
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burns_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Burns Club
        </a>
        . The Burns Club began in 1924, when only 3,000 people called Canberra home. A significant number of construction workers who were building the new capital city were of Scottish origin and they decided to form a society where they could support each other, socialise and maintain their Scottish cultural interests. The club was named after Scottish poet
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Burns" rel="nofollow">
         Robert Burns
        </a>
        and quickly established itself in Canberra's life. Within its first year, the Burns Club was already an important and active influence in the Canberra community. The first highland gathering of 1925 raised money for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telopea_Park_School" rel="nofollow">
         Telopea Park School
        </a>
        , a soccer team was formed and a series of concerts were organised to help raise funds for the Queanbeyan Hospital.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since that first year, the Burns Club has continued to contribute to Canberra's life. Last year was Canberra's Centenary and for 90 of those 100 years the Burns Club has been a staple of Canberra's culture and community. The club's famous pipe band and highland dancing group have enriched the artistic character of Canberra, and the variety of sports groups have promoted healthy and active living while fostering community engagement.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1927, the Burns Club undertook a project to build a Robert Burns statue in Canberra. After raising funds across Australia, the statue was built in Forrest in 1935 and was unveiled by the then Prime Minister Joseph Lyons. It was not the first or the last encounter with politics the Burns Club would have. In 1931, the then Prime Minister James Scullin was guest of honour at the Burns Club night. In 1939,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Menzies" rel="nofollow">
         Robert Menzies
        </a>
        became the club patron.
       </p>
       <p>
        The club funded and built its own club facility in Forrest and it was opened in 1957. The club then moved to its current location in Kambah in 1991, where it has grown to over 14,000 members. I was privileged to be a part of the club's 90th anniversary celebration dinner last month and I was able to hear some of the great stories that are part of the club's heritage—as well as enjoy some haggis! It is an extraordinary achievement for a small, independent club like the Burns Club to have survived these nine decades—decades that saw the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression" rel="nofollow">
         Great Depression
        </a>
        , war, recession and social change.
       </p>
       <p>
        But the Burns Club have not only survived; they have flourished and continue to live out their original charter to preserve and promote Scottish culture and to contribute positively to the community. There are many challenges that face small clubs in Canberra, but their success is an important part of maintaining and promoting the diversity of cultures and creeds here in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        . I encourage Canberrans and visitors to the ACT to use and support these clubs.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to commend and congratulate the current president, Mr Athol Chalmers, who is also the leader of the pipe band, as well as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">

        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Weir" rel="nofollow">

        , for the great work that they have done. I acknowledge all the current and former members of the Canberra Burns Club who have made it such a success. I hope that this anniversary will be just one of many celebrations in the years to come.
