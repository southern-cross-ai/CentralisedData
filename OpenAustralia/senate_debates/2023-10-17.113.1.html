        Today is one of the days in National Bird Week. If you've got 20 minutes to spend in your backyard or your favourite place, BirdLife Australia would be delighted to hear a list of the birds you see in your yard. This is a really important and vibrant community science project, so I would challenge anyone to go and spend those 20 minutes finding out what birds are in their favourite place.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's also a good opportunity for me to give a shout-out to the Adelaide community group of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Conservation_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Conservation Foundation
        </a>
        , who came to see me a couple of weeks ago to talk in a not insignificant proportion about birds. They walked me through the birds that are having a hard time in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        , those that are at risk and those that are in serious trouble, and some of the work they're doing to address that—again, through some pretty important community science projects.
       </p>
       <p>
        While we were there, we also spent some time working through the issues that the Adelaide community group of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACF" rel="nofollow">
         ACF

        have with the

        </a>
        , and the reforms that the Albanese Labor government are working hard on because we know that the laws we have in this country are broken. I was delighted to spend that time working through what their issues are and what their potential solutions are, and it was great to be able to tell them that while the climate is changing—and it has changed—the Albanese Labor government is taking action. We've legislated emissions reductions. We've doubled the rate of renewable energy approvals. We've put $2 billion into green hydrogen. We've committed to net zero new extinctions and the protection of 30 per cent of Australian land—
