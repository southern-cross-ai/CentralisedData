        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, Senator Watt. A new $20 million cadet facility in Launceston was promised under the 2017 Launceston City Deal, but seven years later there's still nothing to show for it—no dirt turned, no tender put out—just crickets. Years of conversations between the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Defence
        </a>
        , the Tasmanian Liberal government and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTAS" rel="nofollow">
         UTAS
        </a>
        show them chasing their tails to complete the necessary land transfer for the project to get underway. With UTAS being uncooperative and causing delays, the Department of Defence put a deadline of 29 February 2024, which is this Thursday, on the land transfer in a bid to get the project moving at last. Minister, can you confirm that the land transfer will be completed by this Thursday?

         What I can tell you is that Defence absolutely recognises the importance of this project to the community and is seeking to deliver its commitments. As you're probably aware, Senator Tyrrell, under the Launceston City Deal, Defence committed to the divestment of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paterson_Barracks" rel="nofollow">
          Paterson Barracks
         </a>
         , with the intention that a new cadet facility could be established within the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Tasmania" rel="nofollow">
          University of Tasmania
         </a>
         Newnham Campus. Defence could not complete the planned settlement by 22 July owing to land title issues to be resolved between the Tasmanian government and the University of Tasmania. Defence has committed resources in the expectation of land being available for development. Defence plans to tender the works package for the facility following completion of land acquisition activities. As you have indicated, Senator Tyrrell, that process is still under way.
        </p>
        <p>
         Defence recognises the land title issues are a matter for the Tasmanian government and the university to resolve. Defence will continue to work closely with all parties to progress its commitment to the City Deal, including the divestment of Paterson Barracks. Senator Tyrrell, as you would appreciate, not ordinarily being the minister representing, I'm not really across the finer details of this proposal. I'm happy to get some further information for you. From everything I have just said it would suggest that it may be difficult to meet the timeline that you're talking about, but Defence is absolutely committed to this project going ahead and will continue to work closely with all parties to progress its commitment to the City Deal, including the divestment of Paterson Barracks.

           An email from Tasmania's Coordinator-General suggests Launceston could lose the cadet facility entirely if the land transfer isn't completed soon. If the deadline of 29 February isn't met, will the government walk away from the cadet facility project?

            Thanks Senator Tyrrell. As you would have heard in my answer to the previous question, there can be no doubting Defence's commitment to this project going ahead, and a very large amount of work has been put in place to ensure that it can go ahead. I'm certainly not aware from the briefing material I have received that Defence has any intention of walking away from this project. As I indicated in my previous answer, Defence remains fully committed to this project going ahead.
           </p>
           <p>
            Having said that, unfortunately, the land title issues that have bogged down this process are a matter for the Tasmanian government and the university to resolve. They're not entirely within Defence's remit to sort them out and to get this project happening, but Defence is working closely and will continue to work closely with those partners to ensure that the project goes ahead.

              I understand a yes/no answer is tricky. It's clear the

              as the problem child in this land transfer issue, which I sort of agree with. Will UTAS face any consequences from the government for putting their own interests ahead of this important project for the Launceston community?

               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTAS" rel="nofollow">
                UTAS
               </a>
               . I don't have the background to this project to know whether that's the case or not, and I'm certainly not aware of any plan to impose some kind of penalty on UTAS in relation to this project not having yet commenced. All I can say is that the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
                Department of Defence
