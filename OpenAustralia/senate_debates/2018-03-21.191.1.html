        I seek leave to amend general business notice of motion No. 750, standing in my name today. There has been a slight amendment to paragraph (b), section (ii), deleting the words 'they want to raise the rate of indexation' and replacing it with 'they tried to raise its rate of indexation'. I would also like to add Senator Collins's name to the motion.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave is granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        I amend the motion in the terms circulated in the chamber and I, and on behalf of Senator Collins, move:

           This motion is factually inaccurate. The coalition government's reforms do not propose any fee increases nor any form of fee deregulation. The motion does not mention the $55 billion of outstanding student loans nor that a quarter of new loans will never be repaid on current policy settings. It is worth noting the former Labor government's last budget in 2013-14 contained $2.9 billion of higher education savings, including an efficiency dividend.
