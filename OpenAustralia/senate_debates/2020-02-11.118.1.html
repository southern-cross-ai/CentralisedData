           The Australian government recognises that quality, accessible palliative care is a crucial component of the health system.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commonwealth" rel="nofollow">
            The Commonwealth
           </a>
           government is responsible for national leadership and strategy in the palliative care system and has provided $6 million over three years from 2017-18 to 2019-20 to the national peak body, Palliative Care Australia. State and territory governments are responsible for the funding and delivery of palliative care services as part of their hospital in-community service provision responsibilities. The ongoing funding for the Tasmanian state palliative peak body is, therefore, entirely a matter for the Tasmanian government.
