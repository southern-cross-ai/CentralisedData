       <p>
        I rise to note concern around access to health in my home state of Tasmania. This is an issue which is affecting all Tasmanians with people either directly or indirectly being affected. I've spoken many times about the broken health system in Tasmania, because I've heard countless stories from Tasmanians who either cannot afford to go see their doctor or who have been on waiting lists for not months but years for elective surgery.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government's latest health data confirms what most Tasmanians already know—that is, health costs have never been higher than under Mr Morrison and the member for Bass, Bridget Archer. People in the seat of Bass pay an average out-of-pocket fee of $37.82 to see a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        . This is a record high—up $7.77 or a 26 per cent increase—in the Launceston area. These new figures are a shocking and damning indictment on the coalition government's record of cuts to and neglect of health. One thing is for sure: if you have a Liberal government then you will see an attack on and the undermining of Medicare.
       </p>
       <p>
        When I called out Mrs Archer on these health cost increases she said, 'This is Senator Polley politicising the issue with a social media campaign.' What an extraordinary explanation from the member and really quite an interesting criticism! Federal and state governments fund the Tasmanian health system, and this government's countless attacks on Medicare have real consequences. Mrs Archer should be speaking up for the people of Bass. Medicare has been eroded under this government. We know it's in the Liberals'

        to erode Medicare and our public health system. It was the Liberals and Nationals that imposed the Medicare freeze, a GP tax-by-stealth which is now hurting our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I promise Mrs Archer that I will continue to talk about the issues that are important to my community, and health is their No. 1 concern. They will not be quiet. They expect better from their federal member, and I will do what I can to make sure you are held accountable. Whether or not it is a social media campaign, it will be a campaign right up to the next election and beyond to deliver the best health care for the people of my community.
       </p>
       <p>
        You need to be held accountable. Mr Morrison needs to be held accountable. After all, during the federal campaign, it was Mrs Archer and the Liberals who used lies in their social media campaign to talk about death taxes and retirees' taxes that were blatant lies. You will be held accountable, and I will use every opportunity, whether it's through social media, the media or talking to people one-on-one, to make sure our health system is delivered in the standard of care that all Australians and Tasmanians expect from their Commonwealth and state governments. I will not allow you to get away with telling mistruths during a campaign or not being held accountable for your actions and being a member of this shonky, out-of-touch and arrogant government.
