        My question today is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Senator Wong. Has the minister seen any recent international reports on the performance of the Australian economy, and how does this compare with the performance of other major advanced economies?

         I thank Senator Stephens for her question. Like other senators on this side, she takes a strong interest in economic management and jobs growths, which puts those on this side, if I may say,

           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAA" rel="nofollow">
            AAA
           </a>
           rating with a stable outlook—something no Liberal government has ever achieved. In fact, the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund" rel="nofollow">
            International Monetary Fund
           </a>
           has confirmed that the Howard government presided over a period of wasteful fiscal profligacy. I would invite those opposite to consider the report of the International Monetary Fund. We on this side do understand, notwithstanding our strong fundamentals, that not everyone is doing it easy. We understand that. That is why we have been focused on ensuring the economy is continuing to grow. We are focused on ensuring that we continue to grow jobs and maintain economic strength at a time of global volatility. Our responsible budget decisions have given the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">
            Reserve Bank
           </a>
           room to move—and lower rates, of course, mean that modern families with a $300,000 mortgage are paying around $5,000 a year less in repayments than they were when the Liberals left office. This shows the government's continued sound economic management.

             We do believe that transparency around policy costings is important, and that is why last week the Deputy Prime Minister announced the government's intention to enhance the Parliamentary Budget Office's capacity to ensure budget transparency from all sides of politics with additional resourcing of the Parliamentary Budget Office to support this role. This will enhance the office's capacity for costings to be prepared in the lead-up to the election and remove the excuse which we have previously heard from those opposite for policies to be released as thought balloons rather than to be properly costed. We will also introduce legislation that would require the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBO" rel="nofollow">
              PBO
             </a>
             to prepare a post-election audit of all parties' commitments. This is an accountability safeguard, a transparency safeguard, which we know the Australian people need because of the form of those opposite who hid an $11 billion black hole through the last election only to be found out.

               Last week the Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister also committed to releasing the 2012-13 preliminary underlying cash balance outcome when the secretaries of both Treasury and Finance inform the government that they have a reliable figure. We have made clear in that announcement that we are willing to make sure that the cash balance is released at the time we have a reliable figure. The officials have indicated that a reliable estimate could be made well before the election, and we commit to releasing it. This really flies in the face of Senator Cormann's scare campaign where he suggests the government does not want this information released. Well, on this side, we are saying we commit to releasing it; and, at that point, those opposite will run out of excuses. They will run out of excuses. They will no longer be able to say, 'Dodge and weave and duck and say, "We can't release our costings, we can't tell you our plans for cuts, because we don't know what the numbers are".' We will make sure you have them, and you will have no more excuses.
