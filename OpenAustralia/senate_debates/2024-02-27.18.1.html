        It's been a particularly tough few months for Aboriginal and

        people. Hearing your life and your community frequently spoken of in terms of deficits and not strengths can take a toll on the mental health of so many

        people. Like many of us who are mob, I have seen firsthand the increase in harassment and hate speech online, especially the rise in racial abuse targeting First Nations people, and conversation in the media frequently speaks about the issues and challenges we face as a community but neglects to mention our community's successes. But First Nations Australians are proud and resilient people. Our people, history and culture have persisted for more than 65,000 years. It is the oldest continuous civilisation on earth.

        In my home state, the Gunditjmara people have developed and used environmental management strategies over thousands of years, working with the natural resources and environment of the Victorian south-west region to establish a permanent place of human society for over 30,000 years. Today, Winda-Mara's land management unit manages over 3,000 hectares of Aboriginal land across 10 sites, all of which are considered culturally significant to the local mob and are now under the Budj Bim National Heritage Landscape.

       <p>
        Last week, I spent some time on Gunditjmara country with the team at Winda-Mara Aboriginal Corporation and the rangers caring for country at the Budj Bim National Heritage Landscape. Two of these rangers, sisters Lashay and Haylee Blurton, come from a line of incredible leaders who have served our nation. They are the great-granddaughters of Uncle Reg Saunders. Now they are serving their community and looking after country. Thank you for your commitment to the work.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is a privilege to be able to meet with outstanding community members such as Lashay and Haylee. I hope every senator in this place can promote the story of a First Nations person or community that deserves recognition for selflessly dedicating their time and effort to go above and beyond for their community and for the nation. Together we can create a culture that celebrates First Nations excellence. When our mobs are thriving, the nation is thriving, and we are all better for it.
