        My question is to Senator Ellison, Minister for Justice and Customs. I refer the minister to comments attributed to his spokesman at the weekend that profits from the sale of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schapelle_Corby" rel="nofollow">
         Schapelle Corby

        ’s book
        <i>
         My Story
        </i>
        could be confiscated by the Commonwealth under the Proceeds of Crime Act. Has the minister sought advice on the confiscating of Ms Corby’s proceeds from the sale of her book? Can the minister confirm that the

        has the power to initiate action on this matter? Can the minister now explain whether he intends to take any action in relation to this matter?

         This is a matter which is being looked at. It is something which is being considered by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPP" rel="nofollow">
          DPP
         </a>
         and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Federal Police
         </a>
         . The legislation that we have put in place does provide for literary proceeds which relate to criminal activity to be seized or an application to be made for the seizure of those proceeds. I think that in the circumstances there is no further comment I can make in relation to that. The Australian Federal Police are looking at the matter and seeking advice from the DPP. Of course, any action that may or may not be taken is not a decision for the government; it is one to be taken by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">

          Mr Deputy President, I ask a supplementary question. Can the minister explain whether he has any role in the matter and, if so, what that role is? Given that the book is already on sale at bookshops around Australia, when will the decision be made on this matter?

           As I said, this is a matter in which the minister is not involved—quite rightly so. It is an application which is made by the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPP" rel="nofollow">
            DPP
           </a>
           for the seizure of proceeds of crime and that is assessed by the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
            AFP
           </a>
           and the DPP—for that matter, Customs and the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Crime_Commission" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Crime Commission
           </a>
           can as well. That is speaking generically. In relation to this matter, the AFP and the DPP are involved. I have no role in the decision in relation to this matter. As to timing, that is a matter for the DPP and the AFP.
