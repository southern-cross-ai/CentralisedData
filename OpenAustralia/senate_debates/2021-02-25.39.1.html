         The speech read as followsâ€”
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Special Recreational Vessel Amendment Bill 2021 will extend the sunset date of the Special Recreational Vessels Act 2019 (the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRV" rel="nofollow">
         SRV
        </a>
        Act). This Act allows foreign special recreational vessels (also known as Superyachts) to apply for a special recreational vessel temporary licence to operate on the Australian coast, if they choose to opt in to the coastal trading regulatory regime. This allows these vessels to be offered for hire or charter.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The proposed amendment means these vessels can continue to operate under temporary licences, bringing overseas dollars into regional communities around Australia. Encouraging special recreational vessels to come to Australia to charter is important, particularly for COVID recovery.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Special reactional vessels bring a range of economic benefits - Australian producers and services industries all stand to benefit from the continuation of superyacht charters. The opportunity to supply food and beverages to the vessels as well as the onshore demand for tourism, accommodation and cafes and restaurants will provide much needed business.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Extending the repeal date of the SRV Act for two years will allow more time to consult stakeholders on a longer-term solution for special recreational vessel regulation. Earlier consultation was paused because of the COVID-19 pandemic and will not be completed prior to the SRV Act sunsetting.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In the interim, the SRV industry needs certainty to continue to operate in Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government is committed to ensuring Australia's regulatory framework for our maritime industries remains fit for purpose, meets community expectations and supports Australian businesses.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The superyacht industry will no doubt make an important contribution to our post COVID-19 recovery as we look to reopen the economy and permit more leisure activities in Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Conclusion
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government recognises the economic opportunities that superyachts afford Australian business, as well as regional and urban communities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill permits special recreational vessels to continue to charter in Australia and have these opportunities realised.

        Debate adjourned.
