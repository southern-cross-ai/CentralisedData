         The government has released a great deal of detail about the Household Assistance Package, which includes a very substantial tax reform package that will increase the tax-free threshold and involve a tax reduction for all Australians earning under $80,000 a year. That is a very sub­stantial and important tax reform package which obviously has good participation consequences as well. The Prime Minister has also indicated that nine out of 10 house­holds will receive some assistance through tax cuts or payment increases and almost six million households will get tax cuts or increased payments that cover their entire average price impact. Over four million Australian households will get an extra buffer with assistance that is at least 20 per cent more than the expected average price impact.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have been clear that there are some people who will not be assisted. We have been clear and upfront about that. The question that is never answered by the other side is just how much tax they will impose on Australian families to pay for their direct action policy which is a complete black hole.

              Their question tries to suggest what that specific answer is. It is not an argument to take a point of order to say the answer is not being directly relevant. The minister in answering the question, while being directly relevant to the question, is entitled to answer the question in the way that is appropriate to provide the information in a directly relevant way, but not to necess­arily give an answer that you have suggested you want. That is completely out of order and there is no point of order.

                I think I answered in the first part of the answer that nine out of 10 households will receive some assistance. That obviously leaves one out of 10 house­holds who will not be receiving assistance. I would like to point out to the opposition and to the chamber this: the opposition is going to have to go the election with a promise to claw back a pension increase and to impose higher income taxes because they opposed this package.

                  , I rise on a point of order: it is becoming increasingly the practice of opposition senators to respond to the first answer they receive by running a commentary, often derogatory, before asking the next question. I draw your attention to the increasing practice that has been employed. If they want to have a debate, we are happy to have a debate, but question time is for the asking of questions and the answering of them. The practice is not in accordance with the standing orders, not a good development for the operation of question time. I would ask you to have a look at whether it is in order for senators to continually run commentary rather than just ask the supplementary question.

                          The way in which the government has structured assistance for self-funded retirees is to link it to eligibility for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card. Self-funded retirees will receive the same dollar amount as those on the aged pension, which would be $338 per annum for singles earning up to $50,000 and $510 per annum for couples combined earning up to $80,000. I would again make the point the assistance I am outlining is the assistance the opposition is going to be clawing back.

                            Senator Abetz, you ask how many will be worse off. They will all be worse off under your policy because you are taking it all back! Increases in pensions, increases in the assistance to self-funded retirees, increases to family tax benefit and lifting the tax free threshold—you are clawing it all back.

                                 , I rise on a point of order on relevance: everyone in the Senate heard Senator Feeney interject, in response to the question, that the answer was none. The supplementary question merely asks the minister whether she agrees with what Senator Feeney said. Nothing she has said in her answer to the supplementary question is relevant to the issue of whether she agrees with Senator Feeney's assertion that the answer is none.

                                  There is no point of order. Not everyone in the Senate heard Senator Feeney's comment. Let me assure you, Senator, I did not hear the comment because of the noise that was coming from my left, so you cannot make the accusation that everyone heard the comment that was made. If silence were maintained in this chamber, then there may well be an opportunity for me to hear everything that goes on. But it is very difficult sometimes, and I can assure you I did not hear any comment. If others did, I certainly did not, and whether it was because of the noise that came from either side of this place, I cannot tell you.

                                      Senator Abetz, this highlights the difficulty—on both sides. You were on your feet, and there were people on your side who were making it very difficult for me to hear you, then there were people who came in from my right who made it equally difficult. You, like any other senator when they are on their feet in this place, are entitled to be heard, and I am going to see that that happens. Senator Abetz, you are entitled to be heard in silence, as is the minister when they are on their feet as well.

                                       . Sessional orders require that a minister be directly relevant to the question that was asked. With great respect, whether or not you or any other senator heard what Senator Feeney clearly interjected—whether it was heard or not—is irrelevant to the question that was asked; namely, whether or not the minister agrees with Senator Feeney, who said that no self-funded retiree would be worse off, and she needs to answer that question.

                                                  the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator Carr. Given the unprecedented rise of the Australian dollar and the fears that it has created for manufacturing, can the minister outline to the Senate what the government is doing to give workers confidence in the future?

                                                   I thank Senator Marshall for his question and his concern, a concern which is matched by the gravity of the situation that we confront today. The Australian economy is experiencing the biggest structural change in a generation, driven largely by the high dollar. The resources boom is creating a net benefit for our economy; however, it is posing serious challenges for other trade exposed sections of the economy, and firms in those sectors are responding through innovation.
                                                  </p>
                                                  <p>
                                                   Through the wailing that we have heard from the other side, their crocodile tears about manufacturing—a recently discovered concern, I might add—you would have thought by now we would have heard some policy statement from them on how they believe we should be able to help manufacturers, tourism or education providers deal with a 45 per cent increase in the movement of the exchange rate.

                                                   We are seeing considerable challenges facing our manufacturers, and we know that this is a reality that is being faced in a very difficult and sometimes painful and unavoidable transition period that is ahead of us. However, there are reasons for optimism about our ability to navigate this difficult period. As a country, we have the opportunity to choose the future we want, and we have to be prepared, as a country, to fight for it. We know there are many, many things in this country that are going well for us. In fact, we have a world-class university system. We have a world-class research system. We have well-educated people. We have advanced technical skills. We have advanced infrastructure. We have a long history of great inventions.

His latest claims are in fact in very, very sharp contrast to the Premier's statements to the Victorian parliament, where he actually supported an emissions trading scheme. It is further evidence of the extraordinary hypocrisy within the Liberal Party on the question of blue-collar jobs, and we all know that that hypocrisy is revealed for anyone who cares to see. That party has only one contribution when it comes to manufacturing workers' jobs—that is, making it easier to sack them. That is what the policy of the Liberal Party is about. We know that the Treasury modelling has predicted that the Victorian economy will grow by 30 per cent by 2020 and by 160 per cent by 2050. We are on the—

That is something that innovative companies have known for a long time. Companies like global aeronautics giant Boeing have come to parliament today to showcase what Australian research can offer.

                                                       in Australia for more than 22 years on a vast array of projects, ranging from sustainable aviation fuels to fire retardants to aircraft mainten­ance and management to the development of new materials. In May this year the company recognised CSIRO as the supplier of the year in its global awards ceremony. That is an award based on an assessment of 17,500 suppliers to Boeing from around the globe. This is a partnership which is vital for Boeing's ongoing development and invest­ment in this country. Boeing is actually putting people on the payroll as a result of the capacity to cash in on these relationships.

                                                        My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig. Given the government's rhetoric on the carbon tax does not mention its impact on the international competitiveness of our primary producers, who have long been productivity leaders and whose businesses will be hit hard by the flow-on effects of the tax, especially in electricity prices, can the minister indicate what modelling if any the government has commissioned to estimate the impact of the carbon tax on farm profit­ability and the export of our primary products?

                                                         Treasury have done modelling and that has been released. I am sure those opposite are aware of that. Agri­cultural industries are beneficiaries under the carbon price. They will be excluded from the carbon price. They will also be able, when the legislation is allowed to pass, to participate in many opportunities to abate carbon. This is an agricultural industry which will be able to partake in co-benefits. Those co-benefits are in reducing salinity and improving the environment while also looking for ways to sequester carbon, to reduce their carbon footprint and also to manage and develop the environment, as they have been doing for many years, and to find an income stream from it.

                                                         The benefits, of course, do not stop there. The benefits do not stay within the agricultural portfolio but go to fisheries and forestry. Within the agricultural portfolio the on-farm use of fuels will have a tax credit, and that applies in both fisheries and forestry. This will allow these industries to develop to ensure that they remain competi­tive in a global sense. In terms of their input prices, which is an issue which always gets raised, if you look at the price setting of fertilisers it is an internationally set price. The farming community understand that—

Given the Australian farmers are price takers in fiercely competitive global food and fibre markets where none of our competitors face the carbon tax that our farmers face, is it not the reality that the government's carbon tax will cut deeply into farm incomes, as has been detailed by the Australian Farm Institute?

The oppor­tunities for the agricultural industry, for the forestry industry and for the fisheries industry are there under a carbon price. The agricultural industry will be able to contribute to a clean energy future. They will be able to continue by participating in sequestering carbon, by participating in the benefits that flow from the Clean Energy Future program. There is also $1.7 billion available to assist the industry. In addition, NRMs, natural resource managers, are working right across Australia as we speak today in workshops, going out into agricultural areas to explain the benefits that will come with a price on carbon.

Given that from 2014 the govern­ment intends to impose a carbon tax on heavy road transport starting at 6c a litre, exacerbating the huge cost increases that will hit Australian farmers as a result of the carbon tax, can the minister confirm whether the government will abandon the changes to the fuel tax credit scheme, which is just another example of an underhanded attempt to bring agriculture into the carbon tax net?
