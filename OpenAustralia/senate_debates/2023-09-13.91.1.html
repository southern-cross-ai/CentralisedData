        I am sure other senators and MPs in this place have been receiving correspondence in recent days from people furious that they have been spammed by Senator Nampijinpa Price, from the Liberal-National coalition, on the Voice, asking: 'Why? How did they get my personal details? How can this happen?' Unfortunately, politicians are exempt from the spam act, just as we are from the truth-in-advertising laws when it comes to political campaigning. I understand the frustration. On behalf of perhaps many politicians here, I apologise to these Australians. But I hope everyone around the country who has received this spam channels their anger and now finally understands that there is nothing the Liberals and Nationals won't stoop to to win this debate and inflict a defeat on the Albanese government for their own base, political purposes. They are prepared to throw the pathway to reconciliation with our

        at the last election but, unlike a billionaire who has too much money and time on his hands, and a very serious 'look at me' complex, this is the opposition in this parliament that are doing this. This is politics and it is the most shameful campaign I have seen in my time. The 'do anything, say anything, whatever cost to win' modus operandi of the conservative side of politics. This vote is not just about the Voice. This vote is about what kind of country we want to be. I ask Australians to channel their anger and make sure they don't support the 'no' campaign.
