        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Brandis. I refer to evidence to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales

        independent investigation against corruption that showed Senator Sinodinos was a participant in at least one meeting that discussed facilitating the making of prohibited donations to the New South Wales Liberal Party through the Free Enterprise Foundation. Did the Prime Minister ask Senator Sinodinos to provide a full account of his conduct before he appointed him to his cabinet?

             I intend to, but I just thought I should begin by pointing out the inappropriateness and, indeed, unfairness of the premise of the question, when the senator well knows that no adverse finding was made. You are referring to evidence, Senator. Evidence is given in courts, tribunals, commissions and hearings all the time.

                All sorts of allegations are made against people all the time, and the fact that the statements are made does not make them true. If they are not supported by a finding by the relevant court, tribunal, commission or board, they amount to nothing. Now, coming directly to your question, Senator Wong, the Prime Minister most certainly was satisfied that, when he invited Senator Sinodinos to be a member of his government, in every respect he satisfied the requirements of the ministerial code of conduct and was a person of integrity, as we all know him to be.

                   Independent Commission Against Corruption inquiry considering his conduct. In contrast, Mr Turnbull gave him a promotion. What does that say about Mr Turnbull's ministerial standards?
