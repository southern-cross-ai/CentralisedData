        <p>
         This amendment is in relation to a review of the operation of the act. What the Democrats would like to see is a review of the impact of the changes brought about as a consequence of this bill within two years of its commencement. This amendment has been motivated by concerns that have been expressed across the board about the potential impact of the changes contained in the legislation. This amendment will implement a comprehensive ambit of review. It will review the impact of the regime of mandatory dispute resolution, the change in exposure to violence and abuse of both children and adults, and the effectiveness of the bill in generating better outcomes for children. It will also look at a range of target groups to identify whether access to services has indeed been equal.
        </p>
        <p>
         The review is proposed to be undertaken by the Australian Institute of Family Studies, who have the mandate under the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Law_Act" rel="nofollow">

         to undertake research associated with the Family Law Act.

         hope this review will help identify areas in which the bill is lacking, with the aim of improving the legislation to create better outcomes for families.
        </p>
        <p>
         I do not think there is any failure to understand that this is a complex, significant and at times very emotional area of the law. Some of us have expressed a number of concerns with this legislation and we hope to rectify or ameliorate those during tonight’s committee stage. Regardless of the outcome of this deliberation tonight and whether amendments are passed or not, there is very good reason to analyse and review the changes made within a period of, say, two years, and that is the effect of the Democrat amendment. I commend it to the chamber and hope that it will receive support from the other parties.

          We are not minded to support the amendment, although not because we do not seek to have reviews in legislation—in fact, we supported one today. However, we do not support one in this area for a couple of reasons. It is a good idea to have reviews. In this area, it is more important to have continuous reviews to, in short, ensure that the family law is not something that is simply shelved after today and then returned to in two years time. People who live with this on a daily basis and others who are interested, including political parties, should be able to have input to ensure that this area of law is not static.
         </p>
         <p>
          We need to ensure that the government’s response cannot be, ‘What we’ll do is put that in the basket, think about it and deal with it when the review is up.’ We would not want them to put it off until the review period so changes which might be required in the short to medium term do not occur. Even after that review period was up, you could end up with the government continuing to review it for a time. By the time you came back, three years might have gone by.
         </p>
         <p>
          You have already indicated that the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Institute_of_Family_Studies" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Institute of Family Studies
          </a>
          is conducting a review. You might expect the government to pick up, have a look at or develop anything that comes out of that. There will be other reviews, I suspect. What I would not want the government to do in response to some of those studies and reviews is to simply say, ‘We’ll look at it when it is up for review.’ I know that does not meet some of the concerns you have, Senator Stott Despoja, but in short we are not going to support the amendment. We think it is something that, as I have said, should be constantly reviewed, and I have outlined the reasons—and in truth I think they are compelling reasons—why in this particular area it is important to have an open mind.

           While I agree that there is a need for constant review, unfortunately I am not that confident that in fact we will have the necessary reviews, because there are already some significant flaws in this bill that the government is letting go through. There should be support for a clause of this nature to ensure that that review happens. Ideally, I would like to see it constantly reviewed—and Senator Ludwig indicated that that would be Labor’s preferred option—but I do not have any confidence that that in fact will occur. I am deeply concerned, as I have expressed in my speech on the second reading, about some of the implications of this legislation. I believe that it is vitally important that a review of this nature is built in to the act, so we will be supporting this amendment.

            The government does not support this Democrat amendment. While the government recognises the value of research and evaluation in providing a sound evidence base on which to build future policy, it does not believe that a review which is locked in by legislation is appropriate. In response to recommendation 55 of the report of the House of Representatives Legal and
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Affairs_Committee" rel="nofollow">
             Constitutional Affairs Committee
            </a>
            on the exposure draft of this bill, the government agreed with a need for appropriate monitoring and evaluation of the effect of the legislation. I agree with Senator Ludwig that continual evaluation is more appropriate.
           </p>
           <p>
            I should also mention the proposed
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_First" rel="nofollow">
             Family First
            </a>
            amendment (1). Senator Boswell is here in the committee today moving amendments on behalf of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_Fielding" rel="nofollow">
             Senator Fielding
            </a>
            from Family First as Senator Fielding is not able to attend the Senate due to ill health. Family First amendment (1) seeks a review as well. In that regard, we would say to both Family First and the Democrats that we will undertake an initial review of the bill in three years. That is an undertaking I can give to Senator Stott Despoja, and to Senator Boswell to convey to Senator Fielding. I appreciate that both those amendments are concerned with keeping this under review and scrutiny, and the government is not averse to that—this is just about the way we do it. We believe in constant evaluation. We also give the undertaking that in three years there will be an initial review of the legislation.
           </p>
           <p>
            We should note that if there was to be a review in two years it would not take into account the full impact of the expansion in the funding of services, including family relationship centres, provided in the 2005-06 budget. We think three years is better, as that gives time for those effects to be felt. For those reasons, we oppose Democrat amendment (1) and we can foreshadow that we will oppose Family First amendment (1) as well.

             I thank the minister for that undertaking. While I think everyone agrees that the notion of continuous review and assessment is a good thing, of course that is not actually enshrined in legislation specifically dealing with these changes. So, nonetheless, I thank the minister for that undertaking in this public forum. I hope that that will be a public and independent review that will, of course, be tabled in the parliament and indeed, the Democrats would have been prepared to support

            </p>
            <p>
             In relation to this schedule dealing with family violence, the Australian Democrats have made clear in our second reading contributions—and, indeed, in our Senate committee report—that we believe that the proposed introduction of a new definition of family violence is problematic. We would go so far as to suggest that the new definition will potentially do more harm than good. We believe that it may actually have an opposite effect: it may actually deter victims from alleging violence if they feel that they are unable to prove it.
            </p>
            <p>
             We also find the proposal of a so-called objective definition a little extraordinary when it is clear from many studies and research into domestic violence that victims are usually in the best position to identify risks to themselves or to children. Mr Temporary Chairman, you may be aware that the Democrats disagreed with the chair’s report in relation to the legislation—the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee’s report—over this provision, as we believed it would definitely be preferable to not implement a definition before examining the issue in depth and coordinating a national and uniform approach so that federal, state and territory laws can achieve consistency.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think you will find that in upcoming amendments we deal with some of these issues but, at this stage, we do not support the proposed new definition of family violence. I think someone made a comment the other day after I had given my second reading speech that perhaps a better definition is ‘criminal assault in the home’. I do not know if we treat even the term ‘family violence’ differently from the way we treat other forms of violence and abuse. Nonetheless, I do not agree with the current provision in the legislation and I would hope that it would be opposed.

              Mr Temporary Chairman, you will see that we have an identical amendment. We are deeply concerned about the impact and the combination of not only this amendment but other amendments within this bill. I agree with Senator Stott Despoja that what will happen is that incidences will not be recorded. It will potentially be harder for people to substantiate incidences of family or domestic violence.
             </p>
             <p>
              There is a substantial body of evidence that indicates the problem with domestic violence. I am extremely distressed, I might say, that not during the debate in here but during the wider public debate there have been a lot of claims made that try to diminish the occurrence and the incidence of domestic violence. I had thought that over recent years we have been making progress, gradually, on domestic violence and I think this has substantially set back the issues of domestic violence and actually exposing it in the family. In the report the Greens disagreed with the majority view of the committee.
             </p>
             <p>
              The committee did express concerns about the issues around domestic violence. We are aware that there is a study ongoing and we believe it is most appropriate that we leave the existing definition of family violence until at least this study is done so that we have some new research that indicates the potential impact on domestic violence. There have been a number of, I think, flawed analyses of the impact of domestic violence that downplay it. As I said, the combination of this definition and a number of other provisions, particularly the issues over false allegations, and we will come to that, will seriously discourage women—and, let us be plain, in this instance we are talking about women—from bringing this issue up. They will be subjected then to compulsory mediation where they will not be able to express themselves adequately. They will be in situations where they are extremely distressed and in fear. I think this definition will significantly add to that provision.
             </p>
             <p>
              There is no evidence that substantiates that women make false allegations nor is there evidence that where claims of domestic violence are substantiated that affects the contact outcome. The evidence does not exist for that, so I am a bit bewildered as to why so much effort has been put into trying to downplay the issue of domestic violence. That is what I believe is happening. We should be actually dealing with it in a full and frank manner and exposing it, and not leading to situations where women are going to be in fear and will feel like they cannot bring up this issue and adequately address it. We believe that the definition of domestic violence at this stage should stand as it currently is. If the studies show that there is a need to further define or redefine it, then that comes back after the studies in progress have been done. We support the Democrat amendment, as it is the same as our amendment.

               In this instance, we support the Democrats’ amendment as an alternative to our own. We have our own amendment later on which seeks to effect what Labor think is a slightly improved outcome. This is further than what the government has proposed. Labor agree that the current subjective definition is preferable to the proposed objective definition for reasons that I will not outline now. I will take the opportunity when we get to Labor’s amendment on this area. We can then explain why our definition is deserving of support. Hopefully, the government may also see the benefit of having a better test than the one that is currently in the bill.

                The government opposes this amendment and the Greens amendment as well. I direct senators’ attention to government amendment (1), which will add a note to the definition of family violence. The note that we will be attaching reads:
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                A person reasonably fears for, or reasonably is apprehensive about, his or her personal wellbeing or safety in particular circumstances if a reasonable person in those circumstances would fear for, or be apprehensive about, his or her personal wellbeing or safety.
               </p>
               <p>
                That is a clarification, if you like, of the definition of family violence. The government is very clear that there should be an element of reasonableness in the situation. This change has been implemented in response to a recommendation of the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on the exposure draft of the bill and was the subject of significant consultation by the Attorney-General’s Department.
               </p>
               <p>
                The government amendment that I have foreshadowed makes the situation even clearer and substantially implements recommendation 5 of the majority report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. This will ensure that, where there is a history of violence, it is intended that this be taken into account in determining what is a reasonable fear or apprehension. To rule it as being completely without accommodation of unique circumstances which might attach to a particular case is unfounded, because we are asking what is reasonable in the particular circumstances of the person. Is it correct to say, if a person is being unreasonable, you accept their version? If a person is being unreasonable about fear of violence, which they may well have overstated, should the definition attach? We do not believe so. We believe there should be this aspect of reasonableness, which was supported by both the House of Representatives committee and the Senate committee.
               </p>
               <p>
                The family violence strategy announced on 26 February 2006 will support changes to the law by focusing on ways to improve the processes by which allegations of violence raised in family law proceedings are handled so that they are dealt with quickly, fairly and properly. I believe that demonstrates further the government’s commitment to dealing with the question of family violence. I would certainly reject any claims that this government have not been mindful of the issue of family violence, which has been of increasing concern in Australia in recent times. For those reasons, the government are opposed to both Democrats amendment (3) and Greens amendment (2). We believe that our note in government amendment (1) will clarify things even further.

                 My concern also extends to the use of the word ‘reasonable’. I cannot quote this directly because I am remembering off the top of my head, but evidence was given at the committee hearing around the issue of reasonableness. One of the examples given was of the situation in which an ex-partner had harmed the family cat in quite a distressing manner which was clearly intended to intimidate. The point that was made later on was that, when the partner was about to go into Family Court, they were sent a card with a kitten on it. Any reasonable person may think, ‘What a nice gesture; they got a card with a kitten on it,’ whereas the person who got the card from their ex-partner knew the message that was being sent and responded in fear. I ask whose version of reasonable we are talking about. If you saw that, on the face of it you might think that was a nice reconciliation gesture, but the person receiving the card knew the message that was intended. The point I am trying to make is that it is not objective; it is subjective, and it is relative to the case. While I do acknowledge that it is an attempt to deal with the issue, I do not believe that the amendment that the government is moving meets those requirements.

                  Now we are debating government amendment (1) with the note that I mentioned where we state whether a reasonable person in those circumstances would fear or be apprehensive about his personal wellbeing or safety. The question of a reasonable person in those circumstances fearing for their safety is not something which is inappropriate, because we are talking in the particular circumstances which would necessarily address the set of facts that Senator Siewert has outlined. It would not be one which is just taken at face value where people would say: ‘You got the card. Isn’t that nice?’ The note that we are adding to our definition requires further inquiry as to the particular circumstances. That means surrounding events and occurrences could be looked at, which is exactly what Senator Siewert has mentioned.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  We do not believe in a totally subjective approach, because that would mean that anybody could make an allegation and be taken as having some substance without even having to go any further. Even at law in crime and civil jurisdictions we talk of a prima facie case in crime and we talk of the average reasonable person—the ‘reasonable man’ test—in terms of what is negligence. I think you have to have a balance between subjectivity and objectivity if the administration of justice is to be accommodated.

                    </a>
                    legislation. They have domestic violence legislation that has been updated and removes the objective assessment that is currently in this legislation, and it includes a range of prohibited behaviours. So the definition includes assault, kidnapping, property damage including the injury or death of an animal that belongs to the victim, intimidating, offensive or emotionally abusive behaviour, or threatening to commit any of these acts.

                    Amendment R(26) is designed to strengthen the operation of section 68N. It removes paragraph (b) to avoid the risk that referring to the objects and principles as they are currently drafted will expose people to family violence.

                    believe this provision is unnecessary. The paragraph requires the provision of new material to a state court before it can change a family law order. The Democrats believe that this may operate to obscure a history of family violence and this, in turn, means that the new incident will not be seen in the context of that history. The Democrats believe that all evidence should be able to be adduced so that a court may understand the very complete nature of the relevant violent relationship. Amendment (28) adds paragraph (ba) to subsection (5) of section 68R. This subsection deals with the relevant considerations that the court must have regard to in exercising the power under this section. The text of paragraph (ba) makes the reason for its inclusion quite obvious. It says that the court must:
                   </p>
                   <p class="italic">
                    have regard to the need to protect all family members from family violence and the threat of family violence and, subject to that, to the child’s right to spend time and communicate with both parents and other people significant to the child’s care, welfare and development, provided it is not contrary to the best interests of the child; ...
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    This paragraph clearly provides a further safeguard for children and I hope that it will be supported by the Senate.

                     We do not support this amendment. This is one of those definition areas where the devil is in the detail. We appreciate the intention of the first of these amendments, to introduce a conduct based definition of family violence. Labor have been advocating for the relevant parties to have a serious look at this type of approach. It is similar to approaches that have been adopted in other state domestic violence legislation. However, on the government’s proposal we have argued that it would have been better if this issue had been left until the

                     The other amendments deal with interaction between federal parenting orders and the state family violence orders. We are not inclined to support changes in this area without more consideration—in other words, we are not prepared to do that on the floor of the parliament without having a more considered look at these issues. We have not had the opportunity of hearing from the states as to whether they share concerns with these amendments or they support them. Of course, this area does involve significant interaction between state and federal law. It is area which should not be settled hurriedly or on the run; it should be given sufficient time for a considered response. After the Institute of Family Studies have had an opportunity to look at this area Labor would be more hopeful that we would end up with a better position than what is being proposed by the government. Until that time we are not prepared to support these amendments.

                     <p>
                      The government opposes this for a number of reasons. Firstly, the definition that we have is rather prescriptive. I can appreciate what Senator Stott Despoja is trying to drive that here, but we believe that you need a compendious definition which is capable of absorbing the varying human circumstances that one comes across in family law. Having practised in family law to some degree, I must say that you are always amazed at the different circumstances you do come across.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      I will give you one example from this definition. It says:
                     </p>
                     <p class="italic">
                      damaging the person’s property, including the injury or death of an animal that is the person’s property;
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      You can instil fear in someone without injuring an animal owned by them. I certainly could imagine circumstances where you could inflict injury or even worse on an animal and display it in such a fashion as to instil fear in someone. I think the film
                      <i>
                       The Godfather
                      </i>
                      did that very well with a horse’s head. That just demonstrates how, when you have such a prescriptive definition, you can distinguish things and say, ‘This is in and that is out.’ By having a prescriptive list you can exclude things. I just think that it is unwise to do so. We have taken on board the recommendations of both the Senate and the House of Representatives committees. I think that it is an appropriate response from the government. For those reasons, albeit I can understand Senator Stott Despoja’s line of argument, we believe that our definition is more appropriate.

                        This amendment deals with the definition of family violence. We would make the case that the position we are putting forward is an improved one. This amendment does two things—firstly, it reverts to the existing definition of family violence and, secondly, it adds an alternative definition that makes it clear that circumstances in which a child witnesses violence are included the definition of family violence.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        This issue, of course, is very important to Labor. We are very concerned that the government is making a change to the definition of family violence without much consideration of its consequences. We are particularly mindful of the impact that this change will have in the context of compulsory mediation. It is unreasonable, Labor believes, to force people into negotiation with someone they are terrified of. It does not matter whether a court would consider that fear to be reasonable or not. If the person feels fear, it would certainly affect the outcome and fairness of the mediation. That is simply plain. To think otherwise, I think, misses the point. Cases such as these would clearly benefit from the structured and formal environment of the courtroom.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        We are concerned that this change to the definition could put some circumstances of family violence beyond the reach of the court to consider.
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Senate" rel="nofollow">
                         The Senate

                        committee heard evidence about the types of cases that could in fact be affected—for example, those which have involved a long pattern of threatening or menacing behaviour in which any one incident might not be considered to reasonably engender fear. We need to be certain that the courts are able to deal with these sorts of cases appropriately.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Labor’s view, therefore, is that this is another issue which should be left until the
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIFS" rel="nofollow">
                         AIFS
                        </a>
                        has had a chance to consider the issue. It is not integral to this bill. There is no excuse for acting too hastily. The government does have the opportunity to not proceed with that and to in fact adopt Labor’s position. In particular, we would like to see some serious consideration of a conduct based test that focuses on the behaviour of the perpetrator of violence, not on the reaction of the victim. Similar approaches are used in the states and should be considered at a federal level.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        The second part of this amendment deals with the circumstances in which children witness physical or psychological harm intentionally committed against family members. It would give due recognition in the law to the harmful effects to children of witnessing family violence. The House committee heard that this is a particular problem with the current law. We see no reason that this simple amendment should not be addressed at this opportunity. We therefore seek the support of the government and minor parties.

I must admit that I was a little confused by Senator Ludwig’s earlier remarks when he opposed the Democrats definition partly on the basis that there should be the inquiry or review and that the institute should be given time to report before we made these changes.

                         legislation, was better. I actually thought it was more of a compendium, to use the minister’s terminology, and not prescriptive in some respects, as the minister claimed. But I will not reflect on a vote of the Senate. Having said that, I do believe that our amendment was preferable. I believe that this amendment is certainly preferable to the legislation as it currently stands.

                         I have already outlined some of the concerns that we have with this. I think we are trying to address this in a very clinical way, but I want to make it very clear that this is not a trifling issue. This is not a mere issue of terminology and semantics. This is where laws change lives. This law and this change will affect lives. It will affect some of the most powerless people in our community—usually women and children. I do not care what gets said about me on the websites tomorrow for saying that. The reality is that these are the people we are talking about. We are addressing this in the most clinical fashion, because that is our job and role.

                         I want to make it very clear that family violence and criminal assault are of great concern to many of us here. I am scared that the impact of this change will be one that is quite devastating. Therefore, I seek to see these changes made. I recognise that my amendments on behalf of the Democrats have failed, but I certainly hope that, in a last-ditch attempt, this Labor amendment will not fail.

                          The government is the first to concede that a child witnessing violence is totally undesirable; it is appalling that a child should be in those circumstances. But, as Senator Stott Despoja said, we should look at this in a dispassionate manner and look at a definition which will serve the interests of justice. That demands that we get definitions right. No-one who goes into the Family Court has a mortgage on right or wrong. We who stand outside and look in are lucky to be in that position, if I can put it that way. Certainly, my experience has been that you can never prejudge matters where you have human affairs involved, being as they are. So I would not seek to prejudge any particular group of people or in any way make an assessment as to where the rights and wrongs lie in relationships between husbands and wives. But I do say that we should have a definition which works.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          We believe that the opposition’s proposal is unnecessary. This was a matter which was considered by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. They did not see any merit in adding this clause to the definition. The government’s existing definition would cover a situation where witnessing violence causes a child to fear or be apprehensive for their own safety. I stress that. The government’s definition allows for a history of violence to be taken into account. We are saying that once you get into a listing of circumstances you do so at your peril to the extent that you become prescriptive in your definition. We have a definition—with a note which hopefully will be passed and attached—which can stand the test of time and the administration of justice.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          I believe that the concern that the opposition has is a legitimate one, and Senator Ludwig put his point clearly. But we have already accommodated for that in the broad definition that we have in the bill and also in the note that I will move at a later stage. I repeat that, in the government’s definition, a situation where witnessing violence causes a child to fear or to be apprehensive for their own safety would be covered. Furthermore, the government’s definition would allow a person’s circumstances, including a history of violence, to be taken into account. It is for that reason that the government does not support the amendment sought by the opposition. I stress that, whilst there is a great deal of concern for women and children and the position they can find themselves in, there are also men who are in the family law system. They should be remembered as well. We as a government have a duty to make sure that our definitions apply to all Australians, be they young, old or of whichever sex, and that they will serve the administration of justice in a manner which works and is fair.

                           I move Democrats amendment (2) on revised sheet 4866:
                          </p>
                          <p class="italic">
                           (2)    Schedule 1, page 4 (line 2) to page 34 (line 7), omit “equal shared parental responsibility” (wherever occurring), substitute “joint parental responsibility”.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           This amendment changes any references in the legislation from ‘equal shared parental responsibility’ to ‘joint parental responsibility’. As has been commented on in the speeches in the second reading debate and in the Senate committee stage, the use of the term ‘equal’ has been of concern. It has been criticised widely. It is quite a divisive term in some respects, in that it focuses more on parents’ rights than on our responsibilities as parents. Parental responsibility should not be quantified. Children need qualitative approaches to parenting.
                          </p>

                           feel that the use of the word ‘joint’ sends a clearer message to parents about a cooperative approach to parenting—where possible of course—instead of dividing them and pitching them against each other in a battle to be the winner in negotiations over their children. The intent of this legislation, as I understood it, was to try and provide a less adversarial approach and so less adversarialism in the system when it came to the issue of parental responsibility. I think that joint parental responsibility encapsulates that less adversarial approach much better than the terminology of equal. One seems to imply a quantitative approach as opposed to a qualitative approach, which is what we should be aiming for if our focus in this legislation is indeed the best interests of the children.

                            support this amendment for very similar reasons—and in fact have an identical amendment. We believe that the content of the legislation is, unfortunately, more about parents’ rights rather than children’s rights. We believe that where parents should be coming from is their joint responsibilities. The children must come first. We do not necessarily believe that the amendment the government is proposing will result in the best outcomes for children in all cases.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            Most kids’ living arrangements are established at the point of separation and finalised without the need to go to court, and those arrangements do not change afterwards. With respect to responsibilities and doing things for children, it is not about control. I am deeply concerned that a lot of the debate happening outside this place has been about control of children and control of the ex-partner rather than about the wellbeing of the child. Certainly a number of emails that I have had have been about control. That is not to dismiss the fact—which I very deeply and freely acknowledge—that most men really want to nurture their children and jointly share responsibility for the children and do not want to control their children.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            I am concerned that this legislation codifies control by either parent and is not about children’s rights or putting the children’s interests first. I am deeply concerned that this is about concentrating power and giving power over decisions rather than about what is in the best interest of the child. It also seems to be a one-way street when it comes to the situation where there is a residential parent and a non-residential parent and to what happens to require that non-residential parents make sure that they fulfil their obligations as well. I believe that the concept of joint parental responsibility more clearly and plainly states what society expects from parents, and it does not put the rights of parents first; it puts the rights of children first and the child’s interests first rather than the parents’ interests first. So I join the Democrats in supporting this amendment.

                             This is an area where sometimes there is a lot to be said about getting the language right. We agree on the issue of renaming ‘equal shared parental responsibility’ to ‘joint shared parental responsibility’ but we do prefer our own amendment on that point. Just so we are in the right area: we are dealing with Democrat amendment (2)—and there is an identical Greens amendment—and there are also Democrat amendments (17), (22) and (23) which deal with all of those matters. Sometimes it helps to outline all of that because they deal with an important area. As I said, I think a lot turns on language, particularly in this area.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             We disagree with removing the presumption of shared parental responsibility. We believe that parents should be encouraged to remain actively involved in their children’s lives post separation. Even if they do not live with the child, there are many responsibilities that can be shared jointly. Of course, the shared responsibilities should not apply when family violence is involved in the case. I do not think that anyone would disagree with that. We believe the protections in the bill, with our amendments, would help prevent this from happening. Having said that, we will keep a close eye on the effect of these changes and reconsider our position if evidence emerges that the protections are not sufficient. We will remain open in this area. We are not going to close our view on this.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             We also disagree with the amendment to remove the provisions of the bill that would require the court to consider equal or substantial and significant time with each parent. Those provisions require the court to go through a step-by-step, clear and transparent process for determining how time should be spent between the parents. It should make it easier for parents to understand how the court will approach the issue, and this in turn will help to build and maintain confidence in our law and courts. I think it is important to keep coming back to that. In this instance, where we are going to have family relationship centres and there is going to be an expected level of mediation, there will also still be the court process. It is important to ensure that that provision is still there and that people understand that the court is there for those cases that require adjudication. The provisions do not remove the court’s power to determine residency arrangement on the best interests of the child test. That clearly remains the paramount principle, as it should be.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             They are the arguments as to why we will not be supporting the Democrat amendments—although I have couched our reasons more in an argument as to why we prefer our amendments. Ultimately, it will not matter, I suspect, as the government does have the numbers. Many hours ago I might have been saying something very similar, unfortunately. They will provide their outcome. What is disappointing in some respects is that the committee report, together with a number of committee reports, dealt with this. This area, as I said earlier, is one where sometimes people come with their own focus. I think it is sometimes helpful to stand back and have a look. You may not be there now but you might get there one day, and it is worth considering how it should, in truth, operate to ensure that there are outcomes that people can live with and outcomes that enable them to get on with their lives.

                              The government opposes Democrat amendment (2), moved by Senator Stott Despoja, the Greens identical amendment and foreshadowed Democrat amendments (17), (22) and (23), which deal with discrete areas but which are nonetheless related to the question of equal shared parental responsibility. Firstly, on that presumption of equal shared parental responsibility, the government is saying here that the risk with joint parental responsibility is that you could have a situation where there is joint parental responsibility but where the non-resident parent only has a token role and it is viewed as such by the resident parent—that is, the joint parental responsibility does not have the effect of involving the non-resident parent as much as an equal shared parental responsibility might.

                              In the Democrat amendments (17) and (23), the Democrats are seeking to remove that presumption and, again, the government opposes this. It has taken on board the recommendation of the

The government is saying that there has been a sound recommendation from that committee in this regard. It is not one which demands equal time, however. I can just clarify that issue. The government does not presume that an equal time arrangement is necessarily in the best interests of the child. Certainly, that is what was considered by the committee at length. In the

                              That does not equate to equal time. It can involve substantial periods of shared parenting time but not necessarily in the proportion of fifty-fifty. The government would of course make an exception where there is an example of abuse of children, violence between the parties or a history or violence; that obviously can involve an exception.

                              We would say that there is or should be a presumption of equal shared parental responsibility, which relates to shared decision making and shared responsibility for the children. The court will only have to consider an equal time arrangement where there is equal shared parental responsibility. I have seen cases of joint custody in the old days where the resident parent saw that as really being total custody and it was just a token effort on the part of the non-resident parent. Every child, subject to the exceptions I have mentioned, does benefit from having as much contact with their mum and dad as they possibly can, and that is what we are talking about.

                               I will address my comments to the Senate, not just the gallery. The amendments that have been referred to, (17), (22) and (23), are to omit the provisions outlining the operation and effect of the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility. They will also omit the consideration of equal time or substantial and significant time arrangements. On the issue of presumption, the notion of joint parenting is of course preferable where it is in the best interests of the child. I do not presume to say what is in the best interests of the child; I just know that that has to be taken into account. But the presumption detracts from the appropriate, open and individual assessment of what is best for each child’s unique circumstances.

                               are supportive of the concept of shared parental responsibility and strongly believe that all parents have a moral and legal responsibility to care for their children to the best of their abilities. However, we do have a number of concerns about the practicalities and possible outcomes of enshrining the presumption in law.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                               The court needs to be free to decide each case on its merits, and where—for whatever reason—shared parental responsibility is not in children’s best interests the court needs to be able to make this decision. So we consider that the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility as a starting point for determining where a child lives after parents separate generates more of a focus on parents’ rights than on what is in the child’s best interests. I am not going to stand here and say what is in the child’s best interests; I am going to let other people make that determination based on the child’s experiences and their unique circumstances. We consider that the current provisions in the bill objectify the child in the discussion, and the issue becomes one of entitlement. Again, it is a parent-centric notion.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                               The Democrats disagree with the inclusion of the provisions directing time to be spent with each parent. The focus on time that children should spend with each parent restricts what should be a lateral approach to deciding options for quality parenting after separation. In addition, it places responsibility for the maintenance of the relationship on the children, who will be forced to divide their time between parents. So the effect of the presumption, when coupled with the court’s requirement to consider whether it is equal or substantial and significant time, is arguably to create a de facto presumption and to compound the divergence from consideration of what is best for the children. The Democrats have serious concerns about this, and therefore we oppose the current provisions. As Senator Ludwig was quite right to point out, I should have put that on record earlier, as we are dealing with a range of amendments and proposals to this particular schedule.

                                The only thing I was really going to add, and having listened to Senator Stott Despoja I think it is worth while adding it, is that when you hear the government’s point, that is the problem with it. They need to clarify it again. If it was that obvious, they would not need to get on their feet and clarify it. Mr Ruddock’s original preference was to leave it the way it was. Unfortunately in this instance I think they try to explain it too much. If it is that plain, they could have left it. Notwithstanding that, we have our own amendment on this, as I indicated earlier. We do not need to explain it; I think it is obvious.

                                  It comes down to the language. This is an area where Mr Ruddock’s preference should have prevailed. I cannot say I have been agreeing with him lately but, in this instance, perhaps the parliamentary counsel got it right originally when trying to work out how this should be expressed in law. This group of amendments will change the use of the words ‘equal shared parental responsibility’ to ‘joint shared parental responsibility’. This is simply a matter of clear and unambiguous drafting. The drafters understood what they had to draft. They had to ensure that the definition relating to parental responsibility was clear but not a quantifiable thing that can be dissected into two equal parts. If that was what they wanted to do they would have used the word ‘equal’. What we mean by shared parental responsibility is that the parents exercise that responsibility together—that is, jointly.

                                 <p>
                                  There are many examples in the law where the word ‘joint’ is used to convey that. The parliamentary counsel would have drawn on their experience, as would Mr Ruddock when he agreed to the use of the word ‘joint’ rather than ‘equal’. You do not want the problems that might arise where definitional issues create the argument so that people argue about the words rather than the true outcomes. In the second reading debate, I talked about the importance of creating realistic expectations in this area. The risk of using the word ‘equal’ is that it creates and has the potential to create a false expectation that we are talking about something that is quantifiable: a quantifiable time.
                                 </p>
                                 <p>
                                  As we know, there is bipartisan agreement against a presumption of equal parenting time. We should not confuse members of the public by using language that sounds like equal time when we mean something completely different. Family law is an area with many self-represented litigants. In fact, at estimates I had the opportunity of talking to the registrar of the Family Court about self-represented litigants and trying to help them work through the issues. It is not always easy for the registrar and the court to deal with this area. We do not want to create even more confusion in this area. I think it is more important to ensure that the wording is clear and that unambiguous language is used. In this case the Attorney-General’s original phrase ‘joint shared parental responsibility’ was the appropriate phrase to use.

                                  committee also recognised this problem, although it suggested dealing with it by adopting a definition of equal shared parental responsibility. In our view, that becomes a very complex solution when a simple one would do and, as I have suggested, the simple one is to go back to the original wording. The word ‘joint’ is sensible—‘joint shared parental responsibility’ does the trick very well. It is clear and unambiguous language. It should be adopted. The government will go through a complex explanation of why they have shifted from the word ‘joint’ to ‘equal’. They will say it creates greater clarity, I suspect. They will then have to say that it is the problem of joint that needed to be clarified. I am sure they will try that one as well but, in truth, I think the government will struggle to explain why they have shifted.

                                     The exposure draft of the bill did have the terms that Senator Ludwig mentioned, but of course an exposure draft is just that—it is out there for comment—and if we were to treat it as a fait accompli the opposition would be the first to complain. This was a process that was comprehensively consultative across the country, with, as I said, 2,000 submissions to the House of Representatives committee and hundreds of witnesses. The committee suggested the presumption that we now have—equal shared parental responsibility. That was endorsed by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. We have taken on board their recommendations and we agree with them.

                                      We have just been having the debate around the difference between equal shared parental responsibility and joint shared parental responsibility. We have been through those arguments before. As I have articulated before, I believe this puts the rights of the parents before the best interests of the child. I think we have been through these arguments fairly thoroughly. I am not convinced by the government’s position. I still believe that the government amendments put the rights of the parents before the best interests of the children, and I believe we should be going for a joint parental responsibility approach rather than presuming an equal shared parental responsibility.

                                       will be supporting amendment (8) from the Greens. The amendment opposes the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility. Democrat amendments (17), (22) and (23), which were not successful, incorporated this amendment but would also have removed the references to equal and substantial and significant time. We will support this amendment, for reasons previously stated.

                                         These amendments seek to make changes to schedule 1 of the bill. Amendments (6) to (9) make changes to the objects in part VII. The changes are aimed at simplifying the bill and the factors the court must take into account when determining the child’s best interests.
                                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Democrats" rel="nofollow">

                                         believe that, with the bill as it currently stands, the construction of proposed section 60B risks misdirecting the court to consider two different sets of considerations as to what is in the child’s best interests. We believe it should be amended to reflect a reference to the best interests of the child. We have attempted to amend the bill accordingly.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                         We also want make sure the objects of the part are not an additional hierarchy of factors to be considered; we already believe the hierarchy in section 60CC is overcomplicated and problematic for a variety of reasons. We believe that amending the objects, as we are seeking to do, will deprioritise the right to contact focused on by the provision. We have qualified the ‘meaningful relationship’ provision so that it does not always conflict with the need to protect children from harm.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                         The Democrats also support the retention of the current structure of 68F because we object to the fact that children’s views have been relegated to ‘additional considerations’. Those senators who were involved in the preparation of the report, or indeed the second reading debate on this bill, will have heard senators, including me, outline our concerns that once again children’s best interests are being diminished or relegated in some way. Certainly we believe ‘additional considerations’ is a relegation. The bill of course is supposed to be about what is best for children, so I would have thought that their opinions should not be relegated to the position of an additional consideration.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                         We object in principle to the inclusion of proposed section 60CC(3)(c), and this group of amendments seeks to remove it. We consider this provision so problematic that we believe it would be best left out of these legislative changes. Proposed section 60CC(4) introduces a requirement for court to consider, when determining the child’s best interests, the extent to which each parent has fulfilled or failed to fulfil their responsibilities as a parent. It is similar, I guess, to the ‘friendly parent’ provision in its emphasis. I know that concerns have been expressed that the provision may encourage parents to focus on earning rights to their children. This is a concern that the Democrats agree with. We consider that the maintenance of stability in a child’s life is undermined by this amendment and it should not be introduced.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                         Amendment (18) of the Democrats seeks to introduce a provision that is based on a belief that parenting plans should not impinge on a child’s right to stability and security and their ability to maintain their own social networks and school, leisure and sporting activities. Finally, amendment (19) seeks to make the explanation of parenting plans and how they are determined much clearer for parents by including a requirement that advisers are to raise the factors for determining a child’s best interests.

One of the difficulties when you do it this way is that you then end up with me having to say this: we have little problem with many of the amendments in this group, especially those that would remove the hierarchy of considerations in the best interests of the child test—we moved similar amendments in the House through our shadow Attorney-General; however, we do oppose other amendments in this group.
                                         </p>
                                         <p>
                                          In particular, we strongly oppose the amendment to omit section 60CC(4). We consider that section to be one of the bill’s strong points. Indeed, it comes from an idea proposed by our shadow Attorney-General that the court should be able to consider how parents have lived up to their responsibilities in the past when making orders for the future. It seems a critical point: if you are going to make orders for the future there is a view that you can look at what the conduct of the parties has been in terms of their responsibilities to live up to their previous orders. There might be circumstances that can be taken into account which might explain why they were not lived up to, for argument’s sake, or arguments as to why the orders were followed. In other words, there is enough flexibility in there for people to say there were reasons. They can provide their reasons and ultimately a court will be able to adjudicate on that area. It ensures that those past issues can be taken into account so that people do not use orders for other purposes. If you do you will have to account for that.
                                         </p>
                                         <p>
                                          Labor’s concern is that without this sort of provision parents could stand on their rights when it suits them and ignore their responsibilities when they choose. Parenting—and I think we have said this a couple of times—is about responsibilities to children. At some point I will have to live up to mine and explain why I am here. At some point I am going to be called to account on that, and rightly so, I suspect. Parenting is about taking the opportunity to be involved in the kids’ lives, to communicate with them, to spend time with them and to ensure they are properly provided for. I am really sorry I have to say all that standing here on a Thursday evening. This section reinforces those responsibilities and Labor strongly supports it.
                                         </p>
                                         <p>
                                          Labor is not in a position to agree to the Democrat amendments—effectively in group 5 as I indicated earlier—but I did want to go through section 60CC(4) again. It is not only an amendment that has been put in the House by our shadow Attorney-General but also a very sensible one that creates and will allow as much fairness as possible in this area so the parties can live up to their responsibilities. If we are going to use the word ‘responsibility’ then the parties should have something to strive for. In other words, be responsible with these sorts of things.
                                         </p>
                                         <p>
                                          It seems to me that a lot of the arguments that surround this are about people being irresponsible or having different views and different issues and not looking at what their responsibilities are to their children. It is always cause for reflection when you have to put that into legislation to ensure people will undertake those responsibilities, but if we have to we are not going to resile from it. These are necessary. Ultimately I will come to our amendments, but at this time we are not going to accede to the Democrat amendments.

                                           As senators are probably aware, we have similar amendments that deal with the best interests of the child, and in another amendment we seek to define ‘meaningful relationship’.

                                           are concerned about the two-tiered approach that is being taken in section 60CC, believing that it is a flawed process because there are two primary considerations. In situations where there is family violence we believe the two primary considerations cancel each other out. We do not believe that you can be fostering a meaningful relationship with the parent as well as protecting a child from harm.
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                           We are also deeply concerned that the views of the child have been taken down as a secondary or additional consideration. We believe the process in the existing act is in fact better. As I said, we will be moving an amendment to define what a meaningful relationship is later.
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                           We also believe that there are flawed assumptions underlying this proposal. It assumes that all children see contact with both parents as in their best interests in every case. We are also concerned that there is a presumption that a violent and abusive parent is better than no parent at all. I challenge that assumption. I know that other people do not necessarily believe that, but I am seriously challenging that assumption.

                                           We are disappointed that the wishes of the child are thought to be a secondary consideration. Already access is granted to violent non-custodial parents against the express wishes of the child. There are a number of studies that document that. A study by

                                           When fathers are subject to allegations of abuse, their chances of being denied contact with children are remote even if these allegations are substantiated, and the numbers of parents falsely accused of child abuse are tiny compared to the numbers of children who are being abused and about whom the Family Court never hears

                                           This paper goes on to describe other circumstances where the child’s wishes have been ignored.

                                           The legislation as it stands effectively puts the parents’ desire for access ahead of the child’s need for safety and protection. We do not believe that is an appropriate approach to be taking in this legislation. We believe that, as has come through in many of our other amendments, the best interests of the child must be put first, and in some instances in areas of domestic violence and abuse the best interest of the child is not necessarily to be with both parents. It is not necessarily in the best interests of a child to be put with an abusive or violent parent. I do not believe that we should be codifying that.

                                           As I said, we have further amendments that deal with meaningful relationship and subsequent amendments that deal with the best interests of the child. We do support the current existing approach in the act. We do not support the two-tiered approach. We believe that the two primary considerations are in conflict where you have situations of family violence and abuse. Therefore, we will be supporting these amendments.

                                            I only want to clarify one matter. I think I talked about 60CC(4) being amended in the House. I always get confused about that. They do not have a process as eloquent as ours, where we actually get to move amendments and argue about them. At least we still have that. I do not yet have any indication from the government that it is going to change. There are three reports that are central to this issue:
                                            <i>
                                             Every picture tells a story
                                            </i>
                                            , which was the first report into this area; the exposure draft committee, where our shadow Attorney-General provided a dissenting report and where the idea emanated from and, if they had had a committee such as ours, I am sure she would have brought forward an amendment there; then of course there was the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which also inquired into the bill, although they confined themselves to certain parts.
                                           </p>
                                           <p>
                                            This is an opportunity for us to look at all of those amendments and move them. I think I have made the point several times that this is a place where we can try to convince the government to pick up an amendment and where the opposition can support it. However, I am concerned that over the last couple of days it seems that the government has simply been going through the motions. I do not think that is quite good enough. Before 1 July there was a certain sense that committee reports and amendments that come here would focus the government on trying to find an outcome where an outcome may not be on its side. Notwithstanding that, we will press on.

                                             There are a number of issues here. I share the concern expressed by Senator Ludwig in relation to clause 60CC, which is headed ‘How a court determines what is in a child’s best interests’. We believe that is essential and we believe that the Democrats and Greens have really missed the point in their approach to this whole question. Perhaps it is best that I deal with the Democrat amendments in turn.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                             Firstly, I will deal with Democrats amendments (6) and (7), which purport to remove the link between the objects and substantive provisions in part VII. The government is of the view that it is very important to link the objects of part VII in section 60B to a range of substantive provisions of that part. An example of that is those provisions dealing with the factors to be considered when determining the best interests of the child. You can see in the objects listed that you even have ‘protecting children from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence’. These are very important objects—no-one would disagree with that—and we want to maintain the appropriate link between the objects provisions and the substantive provisions, to make it clear that the objects provisions have a direct influence on the more substantive provisions of this part. So I think that the Democrat and Greens amendments serve to de-link that and detract from those very important principles.

                                             have said that they are worried about violence and are concerned about protection from harm, yet our objects are linked to the substantive part. Section 60CC(2) states, ‘The primary considerations are’—primary, not secondary—‘the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence’. That is very important.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                             I turn to the other amendments of the Democrats. We are now looking at (11) and (12). Again, they centre on removing this two-tiered approach, which I have just touched on with 60CC. What we have done there is set out, in determining the best interests of the child, those primary considerations that are:
                                            </p>
                                            <p class="italic">
                                             (a) benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents; and
                                            </p>
                                            <p class="italic">
                                             (b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                             They are the primary considerations and they give a clear direction to the court. We then go on to deal with additional considerations, and of course they deal with such things as ‘any views expressed by the child’, ‘the nature of the relationship of the child with each of the child’s parents’, ‘the willingness and ability of each of the child’s parents to facilitate a close relationship’ and ‘the likely effect of any changes in the child’s circumstances’. This is quite important, and it goes on; it is quite extensive. The court needs clear direction as to what is a primary consideration and what are additional factors. That is why a two-tiered approach is very important in ascertaining what is best for the child. The destruction of that by the Greens and the Democrats, I think, would certainly not advance the administration of family law in this country.
                                            </p>

                                             Moving on to Democrat amendments (14) and (15), the Democrats seek amendment (14) to amend the factors that the court must consider in determining the best interests of the child.
                                             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Democrats" rel="nofollow">

                                             </a>
                                             seek to remove the requirement for the court to consider, when making a determination of what is in the child’s best interests, the willingness and ability of each parent to facilitate and encourage the child’s relationship with the other parent. We think this is a very important factor to take into account. The government considers that a child benefits from both parents being involved in the life of that child, and that is of course subject to the primary need of protecting the child from harm. But to remove that as a consideration would be a retrograde step indeed.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                             Democrat amendment (15) seeks to remove the requirement that the court consider whether a person has fulfilled or failed to fulfil their parental responsibilities. Whilst the government believe that a child benefits from both parents being involved in its life—and that is important—we do have a provision which allows the court to consider the extent to which each of the child’s parents has fulfilled or failed to fulfil their responsibilities as a parent and their responsibility to facilitate the other parent’s ability to fulfil their responsibilities as a parent. This includes the extent to which each parent has taken or failed to take the opportunity to spend time with the child, communicate with the child and participate in decision making about major, long-term issues in relation to the child. A factor to consider would be if a parent had been overseas for a long period of time and then came back, arrived on the scene and purported to exercise substantial control over the decision making and care giving in relation to the child.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                             It could also cover a situation where a resident parent has failed to comply with orders about facilitating the other parent spending time with the child—and the court must take that into account when looking at future parenting orders, because you can also have the reverse situation. You may have a non-resident parent disappearing and then coming back on the scene and demanding full time and involvement with the child, or you may have a resident parent denying a non-resident parent the opportunity to become involved with that child’s life and barring them from such access. That has to be taken into account. I had experience of both situations when I practised as a legal practitioner before entering politics. It is a very important factor for the court to take into account. To remove that would be a deleterious move indeed.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                             We are also looking at Democrat amendments (18) and (19). Democrat amendment (18) seeks to prescribe what parenting plans should entail. The government does not believe that that is necessary. The bill already sets out a wide range of issues that a parenting plan can deal with. Parenting plans have to be flexible—of course, one can only begin to imagine the different family scenarios that we have around Australia—and that is very important. The bill already requires advisers to inform parents that decisions made in developing parenting plans should be made in the best interests of the child.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                             Finally, as I understand it Democrat amendment (19) would add obligations that advisers should meet. The bill already contains a range of obligations that advisers have to meet in giving advice or assistance to people in relation to parental responsibility for a child and making parenting plans—and I have touched on that. This is intended to assist parents who are working cooperatively to develop safe and practical arrangements for their children after separation. These factors already reflect the primary considerations of the benefit to a child of having a meaningful relationship with both parents and the need to ensure the child’s safety by requiring advisers to inform parents about the child spending either equal time or substantial and significant time with both parents where this is reasonably practicable and in the best interests of the child. I suggest that that makes eminent common sense.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                             The Democrat amendment does not specify which factors advisers should inform parents about or what constitute the best interests of the child when parents are making a parenting plan. Democrat amendment (19) says:
                                            </p>
                                            <p class="italic">
                                             ... at the end of paragraph 63

                                             (2)(c), add “and of the factors used for determining those best interests”.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                             That is what I have been referring to—the factors used for determining those best interests. So what exactly does that mean? The bill has already set out what the court must consider in determining arrangements for what is in the child’s best interests when it is making a parenting order. The Democrat amendment imposes these factors upon parents who are working cooperatively to develop a parenting plan. It is inappropriate for advisers to tell parents that they have to consider the same matters that a court considers when that relationship has broken down—and this is the nub of the issue. We have factors for the court to consider once the relationship has broken down. When you have parents working together cooperatively, why add that further obligation on the advisers and the parenting plan? The parents are working well together anyway. They are working together cooperatively. Do not treat that in the same way as you do the situation where a relationship has broken down and the court has to make a decision and look at various criteria.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                             When parents are working together cooperatively, they are really in the best position to determine what is in the best interests of their children. The government would say, ‘Leave them well alone.’ Where parents are working together cooperatively, albeit that they are separated, that is perhaps the best result, rather than imposing these unwieldy requirements and criteria on them, which you would have in an adversarial situation where the parents are disagreeing with each other. You have a totally different situation. On one hand, the parents are disagreeing with each other and the court has to determine the situation. On the other hand, the parents are working cooperatively together. Do not cast the same criteria for that adversarial situation onto the situation where the parents are working cooperatively. For those reasons, the government opposes this group of amendments proposed by the Democrats.

                                              I would like to ask a question about the primary considerations and seek some guidance about what happens in the situation that I raised before, where primary considerations (a) and (b) are in direct conflict. I put it to you that it would be exceedingly hard to have the benefit of a child having a meaningful relationship with both its parents if you are also trying to protect that child from the physical or psychological harm of being subjected to or exposed to abuse, neglect or family violence. There are situations where those two primary considerations will be in conflict. No matter how much we would like to see the world through rose-tinted glasses, that is what is going to happen. Those two objects are in direct conflict and I would like to know how the government thinks that that should be dealt with.

                                               I do not quite see the conflict that Senator Siewert has suggested. The primary considerations are there, in (2)(a) and (b) of 60CC, and they are the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents and the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to or exposed to abuse, neglect or family violence.
                                              </p>
                                              <p>
                                               They are different criteria; they are assessed differently because you look for different factors in determining those. Of course they are two primary considerations and where there is a conflict it is then for the court to determine the result of that conflict. That is, after all, why we have a Family Court, and we give it as much guidance as we can with this legislation. But they are two fundamental pillars, if you like. Where they are in conflict with each other that is for the court to decide. But if you can satisfy both of those and the criteria are met then you are well on your way to determining what is in the best interests of the child, and it builds a solid foundation for a finding which is based in the best interests of the child.
                                              </p>

                                               Senator Siewert, as I understand the question, you are saying, ‘How can you have these two fundamental pillars where they could be in conflict with each other?’ Of course with human affairs that is always on the cards and I have seen it happen: where a child has a very good relationship with a parent who has been abusive to them. I have seen that because it is part of the unconditional love that a child can give a parent and it is, I think, quite tragic when you come across that. But the fact remains that both of those are fundamental pillars in the consideration of what is in the child’s best interests. I am not saying that one should be greater than the other—it is a balancing which is required of the court and it is a difficult question. There is no question about it and I would say that I am not being arbitrary in the way I say that one should overtake the other—that is not the case. They are two essential pillars and they should provide guidance to the court and, where they are in conflict, the court determines that.

                                                just clarify: are there circumstances in which the government believes that it would be impossible to meet primary consideration (a) in circumstances where a child has been subject to abuse or violence and it would be impossible to facilitate a meaningful relationship with that parent?

                                                <p>
                                                 It is a hypothetical question. I think that there are certainly circumstances where, if a child has been abused by a parent, one would not allow that contact to occur. I have seen examples where contact has been allowed to occur under supervised circumstances and I have seen certain other limitations placed on contact where there has been violence involved.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                 It is an extremely serious situation where a child has been abused or the subject of violence—there is no question of that. But to give you a ruling to say that in any case where there has been violence you should not allow any contact whatsoever is really a question which has to be found in the facts. You and I cannot sit here in this chamber today and say, in an arbitrary fashion, that a relationship between a child and a parent is destroyed forever because there has been an element of violence, unless we know of the particular circumstances which have occurred. And that is all I am saying. To rule a line over human affairs is always very dangerous and that is what I am saying here: these two fundamental or primary considerations give direction to the court as to what it has to consider. I think that, when you look at the additional considerations, you can see that they definitely are secondary to those two primary considerations that I have been speaking of.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                 Certainly, it is in interests of any child to have a meaningful and loving relationship with a parent. That is a fundamental goal, but the contrast of that—or the opposite to that—is that you should protect a child from abuse and harm. I see no conflict in having those two as primary considerations. They are guiding stars, if you like, to navigate by and, again, it is for the courts to judge. I could well conceive of situations where there was such abuse or violence that you would not allow contact with the parent; I could envisage that. But I think it would be very brave of any one of us to say that because there was an element of violence you would rule out automatically any further contact between a child and a parent—that is all I am saying.

                                                  I am not going to debate this, but I do want to put on record through you,  Madam Temporary Chair, that I am horrified by a couple of your statements tonight, Minister. I understand the point that you are making about children’s unconditional love but I think that, in doing so, perhaps a lack of understanding of the nature of power and abuse has been displayed this evening. Senator Siewert’s questions go to the heart of some aspects of this debate, but I will proceed with the amendments and ask that Democrats amendments (6) to (9), (11), (12) and (19) be considered together and that amendments (14), (15) and (18) be considered separate from them, if that is agreeable to the government and the opposition. My understanding is that the opposition support Democrats amendments (6) to (9), (11), (12) and (19). I therefore ask that these be considered separate from Democrats amendments (14, (15) and (18).

We regret that safeguards that we have all attempted to include in this bill so far have not been supported in relation to this section. We consider that, by adding the qualifying paragraph (1A) to section 60B(1) of meaningful involvement, this particular amendment constitutes an improvement to the legislation. It will operate to restrict meaningful involvement referred to paragraph (1A) so that it does not include a relationship where the child is at risk of exposure to family violence, abuse or neglect. That amendment should be passed.

                                                     This amendment seeks to ensure that a meaningful relationship is limited so that it is one in which the child has not been and is not at risk of being exposed to abuse, family violence and neglect. The provision is self-explanatory. Its obvious intention is to protect children. We have made it clear that we do not believe that there are appropriate safeguards at present to protect children from harm but, obviously, we have a different definition of meaningful relationship, so I can see where this amendment is going and, with great disappointment, read the numbers.

                                                      I am going to give this another go, because I just cannot give up on this one. I think we need to put in a definition of ‘meaningful relationship’, because to expect a child to be able to express a meaningful relationship where that child has been subject to abuse or violence is too much. I think that we need to give some guidance to the court about what this parliament was thinking about when it was thinking about meaningful relationships. As I have already articulated, quite a bit of this bill seems to be focused on the parents’ desires and rights rather than those of the child. Some of the things I have heard tonight, like Senator Stott Despoja’s comments express, deeply concern me because, if you think that a child can form a meaningful relationship with an abusive parent where they have been subject to abuse and family violence, it is a very strange definition of a meaningful relationship and it points out even more clearly to me that we need a definition that goes some way towards defining for the courts what this parliament thought a meaningful relationship means. That is why I am having another go and support the Democrats’ amendment to try to get some meaning around this definition.

                                                       The government, as I mentioned earlier, has elevated as an object of part VII, and a primary consideration for the court in determining the best interests of a child, the need to ensure that the child is protected from harm ‘from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence’. I just want to stress, for fear that my position may be misrepresented or misunderstood, that that is a primary consideration and, as such, it influences what is a ‘meaningful relationship’. What the government has done here is that it has considerations of equal weight: the safety of the child is not intended to be subordinate to the meaningful relationship; both factors are important and will be considered in the light of individual cases. To further define ‘meaningful relationship’ I think really does get us into more strife.
                                                      </p>

                                                       I think by having the meaningful relationship in one primary consideration and the protection of the child in the other, you have the two contrasting basic considerations. Rather than tamper with ‘meaningful relationship’, have the protection of the child as the other primary consideration. They can be competing interests; in happier circumstances they are not. But I make it very clear that the government have promoted, as a primary consideration and as an object of part VII, the protection of the child. We do not believe that it is necessary to therefore incorporate it into the definition of ‘meaningful relationship’. We think that would be fraught with even more danger and could then lead us down a very slippery path where all sorts of convoluted interpretations could take place. Rather, have the two basic pillars, as I have mentioned, rest there; and if they are in competition with each other, then it is for the court to determine.

                                                        One of the issues here, and a point you just made, is that the situations that we hope do not occur very often, the situations where the circumstances are the most tragic and the most difficult, are the ones that end up in court. It is the hard cases that end up in court. Many of those, though not all of them, involve domestic violence, family violence and abuse. And it is in those circumstances where those two objects, (a) and (b), are going to be in direct conflict. I agree, and I hope, that children should have a meaningful relationship with both parents and not be in need of protection. Of course that is what we all want to see for our children. But there are circumstances where difficult cases end up in court, and it will be in the really hard cases where (a) and (b) will be in conflict. I am deeply concerned about the implications. The chamber has already rejected the amendment proposed by both the Democrats and the Greens to restructure this and get rid of the two-tiered system. But at least we can help to give guidance by defining what we mean by a ‘meaningful relationship’ and specifically ruling out a meaningful relationship being one where the child is subject to violence and abuse by the parent in that relationship.

It is one that makes very clear that ‘meaningful relationship’ is restricted and limited to one where a child ‘has not been and is not at risk of being exposed to abuse, neglect or family violence’. That makes it clear that that is a meaningful relationship. I understand the

The Democrats seek to amend the provision to recognise the reluctance to facilitate a close and continuing relationship based on a genuine and well-founded concern about a parent’s capacity to parent or a concern about possible negative impacts on the child as a result of such a relationship. The changes to this provision are intended to take into account the need for parents to make protective decisions about their children. We believe that the provision as it currently stands needs to be redrafted so that what is in fact protective behaviour is not seen as disqualifying the parent who does not comply with the provision.

But it is important to note during this committee stage that the government will expend $397 million on family relationship centres and contact centres, which are aimed at backing up the legislation, which will contain provisions such as the one which the Democrats oppose—that is, the question of parental relationships with children. It is all very well to say that parental responsibilities and the parents’ relationship with the child are factors which should be considered, but you have to back that up. We will do that with contact centres and family relationship centres. In many cases, there are people who, with some guidance and assistance, could well improve their parenting skills and roles, and we could increase the relationship between the parent and child as well as that between the parties themselves. I just put that on the record.

If we had been more successful in amending it, I might not have wanted to move this amendment. However, I do not believe that the proposals by the government are in the best interests of children. As I have said before, I believe that the existing provisions within the legislation that are taken to determine the child’s best interests should stand.

Obviously, we are disappointed that our attempts to move what we believe is an improved version of that section have not been successful. We believe they would have more appropriately determined what was in the interests of children, so we support the Greens in this endeavour. We believe that the current construction of section 60CC will not necessarily provide beneficial outcomes for children, so we do not believe that this section should stand as printed.

                                                               </p>

                                                                As I outlined in my speech in the second reading debate, we have some concerns about the concept of compulsory dispute resolution and some of the requirements in the legislation that go with that. The concern, as I have outlined previously, is that it may create situations in which parents are forced into dispute resolution in inappropriate circumstances. While there are some provisions in the legislation that mean parties can go straight to court, we do not believe that those circumstances are broad enough. This will end up in circumstances in dispute resolution in which people do not feel equal. One of the partners, if they have been subjected to violence or abuse, may feel they are not in equal circumstances in the dispute. If you combine that with the concept of costs for false allegations, which we will get to later on, we believe that we are setting up circumstances in which mediation may not be successful.
                                                               </p>
                                                               <p>
                                                                That is not to say that we do not support the family relationship centres. We think that concept is a good one. We are concerned that, with the way this legislation has been formulated, most of the effort of those relationship centres will be put towards a system where the relationships have already fallen apart, whereas I understood that the concept of the family relationship centres in the first place was to try to help and foster relationships, not to deal with the end of a relationship. There is a substantial body of evidence that indicates that, unless mediation is handled extremely carefully, one of the partners—and I would hazard a guess that it would particularly be women—can feel that they have been in a situation in which they were not an equal in negotiations and their situations of violence or abuse were not acknowledged. During my speech in the second reading debate I read out quotes from people who had been involved in mediation in which they felt that they had not been able to express their concerns, that their concerns had not been heard and that it would have been better to have had a modified mediation process. Experts on domestic violence suggest that, in those circumstances, it may be better if there is a modified mediation process.
                                                               </p>
                                                               <p>
                                                                There has also been concern expressed that there will not be available sufficiently experienced counsellors and mediators to mediate in situations where there has been family abuse or domestic violence. Even to recognise it, in many instances, takes specific skills. The concern was expressed in the committee hearing that there are not enough trained, experienced mediators in the current circumstances where people are required to do compulsory mediation to meet the need that is going to be created by compulsory dispute resolution. Amendment (7) adds the words:
                                                               </p>

                                                                A family dispute resolution practitioner must accept a sworn statement by a parent that violence or abuse has occurred as evidence of that violence or abuse.
                                                               </p>

                                                                This is so we get over the concept of people having to prove that they have been subjected to violence or domestic abuse.
                                                               </p>

                                                                What we are concerned about with the combination of the dispute resolution and the false allegations is that women will not come forward with their concerns about domestic violence and abuse. We believe that, if a person provides a sworn statement, that should be evidence enough that violence or abuse has occurred and they should therefore not have to go through compulsory dispute resolution. This expands the process of enabling exemption from compulsory mediation. The other amendment that we are proposing, amendment (6), inserts:
                                                               </p>
                                                               <p class="italic">
                                                                Despite references in this Act to genuine efforts to resolve a dispute, a family dispute resolution practitioner is authorised to certify that a dispute is not suitable for dispute resolution and no further action may then be taken in relation to the matter in accordance with this subdivision.

                                                                In other words, a practitioner should be able to say that a case is not suitable for mediation. We believe that that would deal with some of the very deep concerns that we have and that have been expressed about compulsory dispute resolution.
                                                               </p>

                                                                As I said, this is not to say that the Greens do not think mediation is a good thing. We do think mediation is a good thing. We want to see the effort put in up front to deal with these problems through a much more conciliatory approach where resources are put in and people are dealing with trained, accredited mediators. Of course we want that, but we have to acknowledge that there are circumstances where that sort of mediation is not appropriate and will not work. Either partner may feel fear, and those cases are not appropriate for dispute resolution. There needs to be a mechanism—which is not contained in the current legislation—that enables them to not have to go to dispute resolution but to go through another process or to go straight to court.

In relation to amendment (7), I guess it is one mechanism of achieving that end. I accept it is a difficult and quite complex area, and I am not sure exactly what the answer is. Obviously, this is one mechanism, and it is an attempt to balance this and make it a little fairer. On those grounds, we will be supporting the amendments.

However, on these amendments, what has prompted me is the Democrats’ support. I am curious about the proposed amendments for two reasons. If you look at the idea expressed in amendment (6)—and perhaps the government could reflect upon this as well—it looks like that has been picked up in the bill at page 14. At (aa) it says:
                                                                 </p>
                                                                 <p class="italic">
                                                                  a certificate to the effect that the person did not attend family dispute resolution ...
                                                                 </p>
                                                                 <p>
                                                                  It seems to pick up the same issue that Senator Siewert and the Australian Greens are trying to encapsulate. It may not do exactly the same thing, but I think the spirit is being caught there and it would certainly meet our concerns. On that basis, we would not support the Greens amendment (6). It seems to have been dealt with sufficiently.
                                                                 </p>

                                                                 </p>

                                                                  A family dispute resolution practitioner must accept a sworn statement by a parent that violence or abuse has occurred as evidence of that violence or abuse.
                                                                 </p>
                                                                 <p>
                                                                  There are a couple of wording problems. I assume when we talk about a ‘sworn statement’ it has to be signed and witnessed. This is not the court process we are talking about. You would expect evidence to be given in a court process, where that evidence would be heard viva voce or would be given under oath and then dealt with. In a family dispute resolution, it is more akin to mediation where the parties turn up and provide their statements or evidence.
                                                                 </p>
                                                                 <p>
                                                                  But the reverse is the thing that really worries. By implication, if a person does not turn up with a sworn statement by a parent that violence or abuse has occurred, is that then not evidence of that violence or abuse? That is what really worries me. Is it the case that it should not be accepted if a person has failed to provide the sworn statement—where one is not really necessary in this environment at this juncture? What would it mean if a person did not come with a sworn statement or they came with a statement but it was not sworn? Does that mean that the matter should not be evidence of that violence or abuse? I think it is narrowly cast in that instance and may lead to an outcome that is not fair to the parties, given that it is supposed to be a quick and reasonably less formal approach to get out of the court system. In this way, you are driving it back into a very court structured process. I will not take up any more time. I would be happy for you to explain it but, for the reasons outlined, we are not prepared to accept amendment (7).

I accept what you are saying about the reverse applying, Senator Ellison, but at the moment we are deeply concerned that people who have been subjected to domestic violence or abuse are going to find mediation very difficult. We believe the legislation at the moment is too narrow for exemptions, and we are attempting to widen the provision for mediation providers to say, ‘This should go straight to court because this person has been subjected to domestic violence or abuse.’
                                                                  </p>

If there are trained mediators and facilitators provided in the family relationship centres then it may be that they pick this up. Then we would expect them to take action to say that the case is not appropriate for mediation. We were not intending that the reverse should apply—that, in circumstances where it is identified that a person might have been subjected to domestic violence or abuse and therefore their case is not appropriate for mediation, that person can then supply a certificate. Let me clarify: we do not want the reverse to apply but we are trying to broaden the provisions that are currently in the bill.

                                                                    <i>

Senator Ludwig has mentioned amendments introduced in the House that talk about the certificate concerned, and we have provided a means by which people can avoid being involved in dispute resolution if violence has occurred. That can be done by way of a certification, by a dispute resolution practitioner or by judicial proceedings where someone takes up the matter in pre-trial proceedings. I think that that is sufficient exception to the requirement for dispute resolution engagement, and I think that Senator Ludwig’s point is a good one—that if you have got a sworn statement then on the face of it you have got to accept that. What we are saying is that you leave it to the dispute resolution practitioner to determine the facts of the case. Again, you really cannot be too prescriptive in human affairs as to what may or may not take place. It is important to give those professional people the ability to assess it, make that determination and provide the certificate. I think that that is the way to go. I think we do provide sufficient exception where there are cases of violence, and we do provide this in a number of ways—not just one. Therefore we oppose the Greens amendments.

That is the point we are trying to make here: people should not have to go into a mediated situation where they are so fearful of their ex-partners that they are not prepared to say anything, where they will just go with the flow and where they feel like their story is not being heard. The issue with mediation is that the mediator is taking a neutral position. That can actually be disempowering for people who have been subjected to domestic violence. The point here is that it is not always appropriate to deal with it that way. That is why we are trying to put this amendment that says that where there is an instance of domestic violence the person should be able to put in a statement that claims that, so they are not put in a situation where they have to be in a room with their ex-partner and the mediator in the first place.

Apart from what has been acknowledged and described as a somewhat paternalistic regime, the Democrats feel it is unnecessary to make this regime compulsory. By all means provide services to parents who would like to resolve things prior to events ending up in court, but do not force parents who feel court is an option—and it is the only option, in some cases, particularly in cases of high conflict—to mediate.

But there has been no consideration for these exceptions in circumstances where people may be, say, part of a marginalised group in a community or cannot attend or access dispute resolution because of their particular situation or circumstances. We do not believe this regime has taken into account the needs of all families so, on the face of it, we are not impressed by it as it is currently composed. We do not believe that this section, 60I, should stand as printed.

Labor opposes this amendment, which removes the provisions of the bill requiring the parties to mediate disputes before applying for parenting orders, with limited exceptions. This is a matter I went through in some detail in my speech in the second reading debate. Labor supports these provisions in cases where separating couples have not been able to reach agreement on their own but are not so entrenched in their attitudes and disagreements as to require final orders from a court.
                                                                      </p>

They then find that court was not the best outcome in truth. Cases involving what could be described as entrenched family conflict, especially cases involving violence, should not be forced into mediation. There is no argument about that. It seems quite clear. All of us agree that a formal, structured court environment is a far better place for those types of cases. Labor believes the critical issue here is in fact how this law is implemented and how it is going to be dealt with. Insofar as that is concerned, the opposition has said this on a number of occasions: we will be watching the government critically to see how they implement these family relationships centres—as well as the parts of this law more generally—to ensure that the outcomes that they promised do materialise.

Parenting plans are simple agreements reached between parents on how they will share parenting responsibilities and parenting time or other issues relating to the care of their children. Under this bill, these plans will have an increased status. They will be able to amend the content of parenting orders, and penalties will flow for breaches of plans. Labor has supported an increased status for parenting plans as part of a package of reforms aimed at encouraging agreements out of court rather than through litigation.
                                                                         </p>

We need to be certain that parenting plans reflect genuine meetings of mind between parents. We have already persuaded the government to insert a provision that would require parenting plans to be made free from coercion, threat and duress—and I must say that was a welcome position to gain from the government. But it was a bare minimum protection. It was not enough. The government could go further.
                                                                         </p>
                                                                         <p>
                                                                          We picked up the idea of a cooling-off period from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. On many issues, the government has made a big deal of accepting the recommendations of that committee but not this one. I am interested to hear from the minister as to why not this one. In our view, a cooling-off period would be a valuable protection against people being bullied, cajoled or rushed into a parenting plan. I have to say that the concept is not new and has been reflected in other places for other reasons, but it is a sensible way for people to be able to draw breath, especially as in this area there is no requirement to receive legal advice before entering a plan.
                                                                         </p>
                                                                         <p>
                                                                          Aside from providing this level of protection, a cooling-off period should also contribute to improved compliance with parenting plans. As you can readily grasp, if there were not a cooling-off period and one parent immediately regretted a plan, the chances of noncompliance would have to be higher. It certainly would make sense, with all the expense, stress and frustration that noncompliance generates, to have a cooling-off period. It is also a secondary way of reinforcing the point. If you have allowed the cooling-off period to expire, then, even if you are not completely satisfied with it, you have allowed your options to lapse and are more likely, I think, to then stick with the plan.
                                                                         </p>
                                                                         <p>

It does not allow them to be voided or amended unilaterally on a whim. It simply allows a cooling-off period of seven days. That is a very short time in the context of dealing with the period of the rest of your life in which you are going to share a loving relationship with your child—or at least the period until your responsibilities as a parent change somewhat, and you develop a different kind of relationship with your child.
                                                                         </p>
                                                                         <p>
                                                                          These are not decisions that should be made lightly. They are serious and they do have profound consequences affecting the most important things in people’s lives—their children. As I have said, this is a straightforward, commonsense amendment that had the support of all the coalition members on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I am surprised, in truth, that the government will not pick this up. This is not even an amendment that detracts from the way they say the bill should operate. It just allows parties to have that short pause as a cooling-off period before the parenting plan commences. I commend the amendment to the chamber.

I want to make very clear the Democrats’ support for this amendment. It is a sensible, logical amendment. It has the support of a number of parties. It has arisen out of committee discussions and indeed recommendations. It is a value-adding amendment—a seven-day cooling-off period for parents entering into a parenting agreement.
                                                                          </p>

Surely the addition of some time to consider the agreement they have made is a beneficial inclusion to this legislation. Protection for parents is important—and I might add that the Democrats’ next amendment on the running sheet is also designed to protect parents when forming agreements outside the courts.

It is true that we have accepted many of the recommendations of the committee, but in this case the government was of a view that the change was unnecessary, given that the agreements concerned are not legally enforceable. The government certainly believes that parents are capable of making their own agreements without regulatory interference, and the bill also provides, as an added safeguard, that parenting plans must be free from threat, duress or coercion.
                                                                           </p>

Exceptional circumstances are stated to include circumstances in which there is substantial evidence that one party is likely to apply duress or coercion against the other parent in seeking to secure a parenting plan. So we cover off on that aspect that was mentioned by Senator Ludwig in relation to bullying or standover tactics. Also, in relation to the fact that these agreements are non-enforceable, I think that we are looking at a situation where really the parents, the parties themselves, are the best people to work out what is best in the circumstances. The government believes that this would just add further regulation, which in the circumstances is not necessary. This does differ from the recommendations made by the parliamentary committee, which in many respects we agreed with—but in this case we did not.

We are attempting to ensure that these agreements are properly checked. We believe that proposed section 64D will effectively terminate prior parenting orders and we think that the risks posed by this are quite significant. We want to prevent parents from being pressured into an arrangement by another parent, especially in a situation where there is no scrutiny by a court. We believe that it is particularly important that parents are fully informed of their legal rights and of course their liabilities under these orders.
                                                                            </p>

As I referred to in my earlier remarks, we are keen to ensure that there are protections built in for parents. We are also removing the words ‘in exceptional circumstances’ from proposed section 64D(2), so that a court will have unfettered discretion to ensure that its order cannot be overridden by a subsequent parenting plan. I commend the amendments to the chamber.

Parenting plans are an important mechanism for parents to come to an agreement on their own, and I have already outlined that. A new provision in the bill inserts a default provision into parenting orders that they will be subject to any subsequent parenting plan. This is to allow a parent to agree to changes in how orders apply to them as the needs of their children change, without having to go back to court. That, we believe, is a very important aspect of this.
                                                                             </p>
                                                                             <p>
                                                                              The Democrat amendment would defeat the purpose of this provision, which is to give people the opportunity to change their arrangements without having to use the court or the legal system. Parenting plans are voluntary agreements and parents can choose to go back to court if they need to. The other aspect dealt with the removal of the words ‘exceptional circumstance’. The bill inserts a default provision into parenting orders so that they will be subject to any subsequent parenting plan. As I said, this is to allow parents to agree to changes in how orders apply to them as the needs of their children change, without having to go back to court.
                                                                             </p>

It ensures that when changes in circumstances lead parents to negotiate an appropriate alteration of arrangements in relation to the child, they are not required to return to court in order to implement that alteration. The court will be able to use this discretion where it has concerns that a later parenting plan would be unlikely to be made in the best interests of the child.

This ensures that it is clear that the term ‘exceptional’ covers circumstances where there is a concern about the risks to the child where there is a risk the parent could seek to avoid parenting orders being enforceable by pressuring the other party to agree to a parenting plan. This of course was a concern that was mentioned by Senator Ludwig. We believe that these two amendments are inappropriate and we believe that what is in the bill is sufficient. The parties, the parents themselves, are the best people to come to an agreement as to what is best.

I would like to acknowledge not simply the lateness of the hour but also the fact that the Senate this week has sat comparatively late every night. I want to make it clear, once again, that this year has a very small number of Senate sitting weeks for a non-election year. Some of the legislation we have dealt with in relative haste this week and in particular today, such as the telecommunications interceptions law and indeed this legislation—fundamental, significant, quite comprehensive complex law—could have been dealt with in a more timely and considered fashion and at a more reasonable hour of the day.

I am not sure whether this is a deliberate process whereby we operate as a sausage factory and ram the legislation through and feel concerned and constrained when it comes to holding divisions and proper debates. I am not sure whether that is the intention or simply that people, understandably sometimes, want more time in their electorate. At times this is farcical and tonight it is very annoying.

This is another important matter. I said earlier that it was pretty much a line in the sand. This is an amendment that a number of us feel very strongly about. This amendment opposes the introduction of section 117AB, the provision allowing for the award of costs where a false allegation or statement in proceedings is proven.
                                                                               </p>

It increases the potential for violence and abuse and we are not convinced that there is a valid reason for the inclusion of this in the bill. I am not sure what arguments the government wants to put forward, but I want to again remind the Senate that the chair’s report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional inquiry was signed off by both major parties. This is a recommendation that, as I understand it, has support from government backbenchers and obviously the

I urge members of the parliament, including those backbenchers who were members of the committee and have, no doubt, felt strongly about this issue and made it clear in the report of the Legal and Constitutional Committee, to consider this position very carefully.
                                                                               </p>

This goes to the very heart of issues such as underreporting and the potential for violence and abuse in the home through this court order for false allegations or the insistence of the award of costs. I urge the Senate to think carefully. I indicate that this will be my only other division—my third division of the day, despite the fact I have put forward a number of amendments on a number of bills this evening and during the day. This is another one on which I ask the Senate to divide if there are other voices.

The amendment would remove the provisions of the bill that would allow costs to be awarded against people who make false allegations. Labor is sympathetic to those people who are falsely accused of violence or abuse against their ex-partners or their children. It must be truly devastating in the extreme to be accused of such a thing. However, we do need to be careful not to erect disincentives to people reporting family violence. The evidence received by both the House and Senate committees was that underreporting of violence is a much bigger problem in Australia than false allegations. If violence is an issue, it is something the Family Court must know about. It is central to the best interests of the child. What we must avoid, though, is a situation in which people do not raise genuine allegations of violence because they are worried that they will face cost penalties if the court does not believe them. That would be dreadful.
                                                                                 </p>

It is difficult to get the right balance between discouraging false allegations and not discouraging genuine allegations. Labor’s view is that the whole issue should be considered after the

It seems to me that that is a theme of this government. However, we are pleased that the government senators on the Senate committee have agreed with our position. Hopefully the government will now see how untenable its position is. Now that Senator Payne and her colleagues have reached the same conclusion as Labor, I look forward to the government’s response. I look forward to the government—for once—moving to agree to a genuine amendment that comes from the crossbenches and Labor.
                                                                                 </p>

They turn around the role of the mediator in this whole affair. If an allegation of violence is brought to a mediator, how does the mediator deal with it? Does the mediator report it? Does the mediator then have to judge it and provide evidence to the court? If a person turns up for a certificate and says that they have been the victim of violence, does the mediator have to determine whether the allegation has truth in it or is false, and then report it as such? If they put it in their certificate and hand it to the court, what does the court then make of that? Does it say, ‘There has been a certificate from the mediator that says that there has been an unsubstantiated allegation from one of the parties,’ and therefore take it into consideration and penalise the party accordingly? Can you then effectively be penalised for what you have said and done in the mediation?
                                                                                 </p>
                                                                                 <p>
                                                                                  That is of great concern to Labor because, if it is so, you are not going to get the parties to go to mediation with all the information that they have. They will be guarded because they will be concerned that they will get there, they will say something and it will not be substantiated or the mediator will not think it is substantiated. The mediator might take an opening statement but then report it. The court looks at it, having received it from the mediator, and says: ‘There has been a false allegation made; costs can follow.’ It would be helpful if the government would clarify how the mediator would deal with those sorts of circumstances.

There is no doubt that there has been a concerted campaign aimed at the problem of the concept that there is a huge number of false allegations of abuse and that this is a bigger problem than the unreported and unrecognised abuse. It is acknowledged that there is a huge issue of unreported and unrecognised abuse and that violence orders are being abused as a legal tactic. There is no doubt that there has been a campaign around this.

We are deeply concerned that it does not seem like there has been much rebuttal of the argument that there is a huge number of false allegations out there that have been put up to deny fathers. Let us name it: that is what the fathers groups are saying. They say that these false allegations are being raised to deny them access when, in fact, the research does not substantiate this at all. As I said, I have seen very little evidence that people have taken the trouble to put paid to these allegations. The research simply does not support that there is a whole range of false claims out there. I will take you to another study, by

It is not true (a) that false allegations are being made all over the place—the number is in fact tiny—or (b) that false allegations are being made to deny fathers contact. The evidence shows that, even when the allegations are substantiated, fathers are not denied contact.

This is of extreme concern for us. It is pandering to the claim of false allegations, which has not been substantiated. Nor, if people do make allegations and they are substantiated, is contact denied. This clause is unnecessary because I do not believe the case for false allegations has been built. The impact it will have is to discourage women from making claims in the first place, which will lead to more unreported and unrecognised abuse and family violence. It is not going to have the impact that the government supposedly requires by supposedly getting rid of this huge number of false allegations, but it will have a deleterious impact on women and children. Combined with some of the other amendments that we have already talked about, this will potentially lead to more children being put in situations where they are exposed to further abuse and family violence.

We believe that this issue was discussed quite well in the committee hearing. A recommendation was made by the committee. It was one of the few recommendations that I felt very strongly that the Greens could support, yet the government have ignored it. I strongly ask them to reconsider and to look at the evidence, because the evidence is not there. I put it to you that there is a pandering going on to be seen to be doing something about this when there is no issue in the first place. There is no issue that needs to be dealt with here—none—yet it will have an impact on women and children. It is not in the best interests of children, and I request that the government reconsider this and withdraw this particular amendment to the act.

It is not an allegation which is made anywhere other than in proceedings brought before a court. So we at least have that clarified. It is not a statement made in the street. It is not a passing comment. It is a statement made in proceedings before a court—and that is what makes this all the more serious. If anyone is trying to play down the act of perjury then they should think again. Senator Siewert says, ‘You know, it doesn’t happen that often.’ I can tell you that one act of perjury is one act too many, because justice in this country and in any decent civilised society is based on truthful evidence. There can be no condoning of any false statement made before a court. We are not just talking about allegations of violence, which everyone is so taken with. I agree that that is important, but we are also talking about false statements. It could be a false denial. It could be a false statement about the other party, which is indeed deleterious in the extreme, but it may not relate to violence. I ask those opposite whether they have really thought about this carefully, because we are talking about a knowingly false statement or allegation—and we inserted ‘knowingly’ deliberately, because we were not just talking about something that was in passing, an error or a faulty recollection; we were talking about someone who sets out to make a false statement and does so deliberately in a court of law.
                                                                                   </p>
                                                                                   <p>
                                                                                    Senator Ludwig asked, ‘How’s this investigated?’ It is in the court. The court is seized of the facts in the hearing before it, and the court deals with it accordingly. There are a number of ways a court could do that. If perjury is made out or the court feels it is made out, it can refer the papers to the police. But courts have been making orders for costs on the basis of proceedings being determined one way or the other for a long time, and in making that determination the courts have relied on the veracity of witnesses. That has been part and parcel of our legal system for a very long time indeed. It is certainly a very important provision.
                                                                                   </p>

                                                                                    This is about a false statement which is knowingly made in a court of law. If you do not think that should attract an order for costs then I really despair. Quite frankly, if someone lies in a court proceeding and perjury cannot be made out but the court is satisfied that a knowingly false statement has been made then costs should follow. Let us not get preoccupied with how many false allegations of violence are made. Let us look at the principle that is involved here, and that is that a knowingly false statement has been made in a court of law in this country. That should attract condign punishment if it can be made out in a criminal jurisdiction, but, if it is made out only to the satisfaction of the court, the court should be entitled to take appropriate action—and in this case an order for costs should follow.

My understanding of the effect of these amendments is that this in no way goes to exempt perjury, let perjurers off the hook or fail in the sense that perjury cannot be established or you cannot have a debate or your day in court in relation to a false allegation. No-one is suggesting that there are not repercussions in that respect and that people do not have the opportunity to challenge in some way or, indeed, deal with through the courts or otherwise the issue of perjury or of false allegation.
                                                                                    </p>
                                                                                    <p>

Now this is not just some fringe group or non-mainstream perspective; this is something that was backed up by a number of submissions and evidence and, indeed, signed off on in a committee report that had cross-party support. Clearly it set alarm bells ringing for a number of members of this parliament—a number of senators, backbenchers, people from all political parties—as well as some of those representative and key groups who understand and deal with on a day-to-day basis not just some of the court and the legal issues but some of the issues in relation to family violence and family break-ups et cetera.
                                                                                    </p>
                                                                                    <p>
                                                                                     This is a serious provision, to which Senator Ludwig has offered one solution, which is to go back to the drawing board, wait for the review. At least have some understanding of the impact of this provision before you pursue it in the chamber tonight, before this is rammed through in a way that has little regard for the potential deterrent in terms of reporting violence that so many people are concerned that it may have. One act of violence is one act too many. We have to ensure that the provisions in this legislation are not preventing people from reporting acts of violence. This is one provision that people are broadly worried about—there is wide concern about this particular provision. The Australian Democrat amendment will remove these provisions and in the meantime will enable review, as Senator Ludwig and others have suggested, and it will prevent any deleterious effect that this provision may have.
                                                                                    </p>

To me it makes sense to wait for the Institute of Family Studies review or to at least investigate this particular clause in some more detail and to listen to the views of the backbenchers—the cross-party backbenchers who, through the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, expressed their concern and came up with the recommendation that this should be removed. Mr Temporary Chairman, I have made clear that this is the second area and the final area I would like to divide on if the voices are there, but I will not comment on this section any further.

Government amendment (1) deals with the definition of family violence. It adds a note to the definition of family violence to clarify that the test to determine reasonableness of a fear or apprehension of violence takes into account the circumstances of the person who is relying on the reasonable fear or apprehension of violence. I canvassed this earlier at some length in general debate on the definition of family violence and I will not go further than that, other than to say that this recommendation implements recommendation 5 of the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee.

These address concerns that the bill would not apply to court applications made prior to the commencement of the bill. Originally we had intended that the bill would only relate to new cases brought after the legislation took effect. This was, of course, an issue because there were people involved in current litigation who said, ‘Why can’t we have the benefit of the new legislation?’ Recommendation 10 of the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee recommended that there be an analysis:
                                                                                         </p>

                                                                                         </p>

                                                                                         </p>

I think these amendments strike the appropriate balance between ensuring uniformity and not unduly disadvantaging existing litigants. The period between passage of the bill and commencement by proclamation will mean that existing litigants will have appropriate notice of the changes to the litigation prior to commencement. I think that is a fairly beneficial amendment to the bill.

The case of Rice v Asplund clearly limits the court’s capacity to rehear matters to cases where there is a significant change in the circumstances of the parties or a significant matter that was not previously considered.
                                                                                         </p>

I think this is a very important amendment. We do not want hundreds of people applying to change orders just because of the change in legislation. It will mean that the change in legislation will not constitute a significant change. That is something which I believe reflects commonsense.

Government amendment (1) is on the definition of family violence. Government amendments (2) to (4) are on the timing of the bill. Government amendment (5) is on the fact that this change in legislation will not be a significant change such as to found a basis for applications to vary orders. I commend the amendments.

Amendment (1) tries but in truth fails to implement one of the recommendations of the Senate legislation committee. The amendment tries to address one of the criticisms of an objective test—namely, that it does not allow the court to consider the subjective circumstances of the victim, such as a history of abuse that might make that person more likely to apprehend fear in circumstances in which the reasonable person might not.
                                                                                          </p>

Firstly, these interpretive notes are not binding on courts. Secondly, and more importantly, there is ambiguity in what it means to take into account particular circumstances—for example, do those circumstances just involve the history of the particular relationship or is the court allowed to consider a history of abuse at the hands of former partners or other family members? It is not hard to appreciate that a person in the latter category might be more disposed to feel afraid than the reasonable person in a similar particular circumstance.
                                                                                          </p>

Judges must find it impossible to empathise with the particular circumstances of each of the many and varied cases they see. This is why, as we have said, we want the whole issue considered by the

We are advised that the use of the phrase ‘particular circumstances’ could draw the court’s attention to only the circumstances existing at that point in time. We are also advised that the phrase ‘reasonable person’ is even more restrictive than ‘reasonable fear’, which is the terminology of the substantive provision. According to that advice, the former allows less and not more consideration of the experiences and feelings of the individual.
                                                                                          </p>

We cannot accept the risk that it could reduce the ability of the court to deal with family violence even more than the current bill. As we argued on the proposed substantive provisions and on the Democrat amendment, we believe that it is inappropriate to be making policy on the run on this important definition. It may seem minor and technical, but it is actually a crucial definition for the operation of the family law system, especially the way it responds to the difficult issues of family violence.
                                                                                          </p>

We say: let us stop tinkering. Let the AIFS study it and let us have a serious look at these recommendations before making any changes to the form of this definition. The government knows that it is tinkering to try to explain its position away. I think it has failed and should just give up.

I do seek some clarification, however. I am hoping that the minister can perhaps put it on record—that is what I am looking for. During the committee hearing it was expressed by witnesses that they were concerned that this would place a new, enormous workload on the Family Court because people would seek to bring past cases. It was very clearly stated by the department that in fact it does not apply to past cases. I think it would be a good idea to send a pretty strong message about that because, judging by the number of emails that I have received, I think there are some people out there labouring under the misconception that they will be able to take past cases back to Family Court under this new legislation.

As I said, we do not want hundreds of people trying to overturn past cases because of the change in the legislation. This amendment will ensure that does not happen. In view of what Senator Ludwig said, Mr Temporary Chairman, perhaps we can put government amendment (1), then amendments (2) and (4) together, followed by (5), as three separate votes.

We acknowledge these amendments are an attempt to clarify the bill with the aim of preventing further litigation based on the changes in the bill. We agree with the clarification that the changes in the bill will not constitute changed circumstances that will justify the making of a new order when one is already in place, so we support that.
                                                                                               </p>

The note that is proposed to be added to the definition of family violence by government amendment (1) will not give effect to the recommendation made in the Senate committee report that the test should be the reasonable person in the shoes of the individual. The reference to the note to being fearful about safety in particular circumstances if a reasonable person in those circumstances would be fearful would tend to draw a court’s attention only to the particular circumstances existing at a point in time. The use of the phrase ‘reasonable person’ is also likely to take attention away from the person’s reasonable fear and lead to the construction of a reasonable person that imports societal misconceptions about family violence. We actually think that the note makes this worse and we believe it would be preferable for the Senate to remove it.
                                                                                               </p>

However, consistent with our opposition to the government’s introduction of those provisions, we oppose the application of those provisions to parenting orders that have not yet been made but have been applied for. We will oppose government amendments (2), (3) and (4) and are happy to for you, Mr Temporary Chairman, to proceed as suggested in terms of how you put those amendments to the vote.

Many groups and individuals invested great time and expertise into that inquiry, and the subsequent inquiries, to see this Bill debated today. They want equal parenting time as the norm. If the Bill does not work, they want some assurance they will not have to wait many more years until there can be another attempt to fix the problem. A review after two years allows enough time to see how the legislation operates, but not so much that we will be waiting an inordinate amount of time for problems to be addressed.

It states that there is a rebuttable presumption in an application for a parenting order that it is in the child’s best interests to maximise parenting time and involvement with children it appears that ‘maximising’ means ensuring as far as possible that each parent has 50% of parenting time.

The first question we must ask is: what is in the best interests of children? It is a sad and unfortunate fact of life that many relationships end. It is crucial that we find the best way of dealing with these situations to minimise the damage, particularly to children, but also to parents.

When a relationship ends, the way to maintain equal access for children is shared parenting.

It is not our purpose to force parents to exercise shared parenting. But Family First would hope that all parents would want to. Just because a relationship ends, does not mean the job of being a parent ends.

But this can be rebutted by demonstrating that equal time is not in the best interests of the child. For example, due to a parent’s work or travel commitments or because one parent could pose a threat to the physical, psychological or emotional wellbeing of the child, that presumption could be overturned.

This goes back to the very beginning of this debate several years ago. People listening to the debate tonight would be familiar with this issue, which we started off with a lot earlier this evening.

The best interest of the children cannot be determined by first reaching for the calculator. Children cannot and should not be treated as if they can be cut down the middle. Labor does support the increasing number of separated couples who are choosing equal time arrangements. We hope that the changes encouraging family dispute resolution and parenting plans will give them the flexibility they need to make those arrangements work. We also support the changes requiring the court to give consideration to equal time or substantial and significant time. This will encourage parties in the courts to consider the issue but not impose it when inappropriate.

We no longer see family relationships in the simple terms of mother as carer and father as breadwinner. Our law does need to change to keep up to date with these changes. We believe consideration of equal time is the right step to take, but we oppose a presumption of equal time, because one size does not fit all. We believe in the paramountcy of the best interests of the child test, not parents fighting over children as the spoils of a marriage break-up.

Whilst the government appreciates the concerns of those supporting these amendments and we strongly believe in both parents having a meaningful involvement in their children’s lives, the government acknowledges that an equal time arrangement may not be appropriate in all circumstances. Accordingly, the government has required that a court consider in cases where the presumption of shared parental responsibility is made out whether an equal time arrangement is in the interests of the child and is reasonably practicable. If equal time is not awarded on this basis, a court must consider substantial time enabling the non-resident parent to be involved in the child’s day-to-day routine.
                                                                                                       </p>

                                                                                                        I would stress again, and it should be noted by the Senate, that the effect of the new provisions will be monitored on an ongoing basis. I think that people should be conscious of that. The government cannot support these amendments for these reasons and others that I outlined earlier in relation to similar arguments.

If we want to ensure shared parenting, we have to be able to share information about a child. There is the opportunity for the court to decide in special cases if providing that information is inappropriate.

The research can be taken into account in future amendments.

We tried to make amendments and suggestions to make it better. We do not believe that this bill, even with the government amendments, deals with our issues of concern. We are deeply concerned about the impacts that these amendments are going to have, particularly on children and women who are exposed to family violence and domestic violence. Those are our particular strong concerns. We therefore feel that we have to oppose schedule 1, given that the amendments to substantially improve it were not accepted.

We believe that these are important amendments because they bring the focus back to where it should be: children. They are designed to reinforce parental responsibilities towards children rather than parents’ rights over children. So I commend the amendments to the chamber and once again record my dismay at the policy and the process with which we have dealt tonight. I think this is a sad day in many respects. We know laws change lives, and I suspect this legislation will change some lives for the worse. That makes me deeply upset, but given that my babysitter has only 10 minutes to go I cannot elaborate on those views in a third reading address. I commend my amendments to the chamber.
