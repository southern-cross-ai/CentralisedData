        My question is to the Minister for Communications, Minister Fifield. The government has confirmed that it has agreed to a deal with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Nation" rel="nofollow">
         One Nation
        </a>
        to establish a competitive neutrality review. Could the minister please give the Senate an understanding of what the terms of reference for this will be? And can the minister rule out before this review commences that digital services of ABC iview and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SBS" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        On Demand will not in any way be affected?

         I thank Senator Hanson-Young for her question. It is part of the discussions and agreement that the government has reached with Pauline Hanson's
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Nation" rel="nofollow">
          One Nation
         </a>
         that there will be a competitive neutrality review. I have publicly indicated a couple of weeks ago that this whole area was one that the government would be taking a closer look at. For colleagues who mightn't be as familiar with the concept of competitive neutrality, it essentially revolves around the idea that government entities by virtue of that status should not use their position in a way that adversely or unfairly affects competition when it comes to commercial organisations. I think a number of colleagues would be aware that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          Productivity Commission
         </a>
         , for instance, has a unit to which organisations can make a complaint, be they government or private sector, in relation to competitive neutrality issues and that those will be examined. A number of commercial media organisations have over recent times raised issues.

             We have announced that there will be an inquiry. We have not as yet outlined what the terms of reference will be. Those will be determined in consultation with both the commercial broadcasters and the public broadcasters. I'm sure a number of colleagues in this place will also have thoughts in relation to that.

The ABC will continue to follow its charter. It will continue to operate independently as is guaranteed by the legislation. The competitive neutrality review is essentially a mechanism so that those who have issues in this area can have them ventilated.
