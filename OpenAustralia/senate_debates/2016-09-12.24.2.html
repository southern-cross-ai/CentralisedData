         Thank you very much, Senator Bushby. It is a very important issue that you raise. As honourable senators would know, yesterday morning a 22-year-old man appeared before Parramatta court charged with the offences of attempted murder and committing a terrorist act under section 101 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code. The charges relate to a horrific knife attack against a 59-year-old man at Minto, in south-western Sydney, on Saturday afternoon. The investigation is ongoing; however, police have confirmed that they will allege the act was an ISIL-inspired attack. Of course, our thoughts are with the victim of this attack and we pray for his quick and complete recovery.
        </p>
        <p>
         I can assure honourable senators that there is no ongoing threat to the community arising from this particular incident, which was disrupted through the brave actions of bystanders in the community who put their own safety, and indeed potentially their lives, at risk to save the life of the victim. Of course, our thanks are also extended to the police, who subdued and arrested the attacker. Nevertheless, the National Terrorism Threat Level remains at 'probable', as it has been for two years, since it was elevated to that level on 12 September 2014. What that means is that a terrorism event of some kind is assessed as likely.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is now the fourth attack in Australia since the National Terrorism Threat Level was raised, but in the same period our law enforcement and security agencies have disrupted and prevented a further 10 planned terror attacks. The Australian government is committed to doing everything it can to tackle the threat posed by terrorism and those who support it, and keeping our community safe.

            Yes, Senator Bushby, I can. Since August 2014, the government has invested an additional $1.3 billion to support Australia's efforts in combating terrorism. It has engaged in a program of significant counterterrorism law reform designed to give our law enforcement and security agencies the tools they need to disrupt and combat terrorism, and, while it is critical that we target the threat of ISIL at its base in Syria and northern Iraq, we are also working closely with our international partners, particularly our regional partners, to deal with radicalisation and violent extremism closer to home. Last year my Indonesian counterpart and I established a new
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministerial_Council" rel="nofollow">
             Ministerial Council
            </a>
            on Law and Security, to focus and coordinate our two nations' efforts to counter terrorism. Last month, the Minister for Justice and I attended an international summit on counterterrorism in Bali, hosted by the Indonesian government, and Australia and Indonesia co-hosted an important international conference on terrorism financing.

               Yes, Senator Bushby, I can tell you that this week the government will introduce into the parliament two further pieces of national security legislation. The Criminal Code Amendment (High Risk Terrorist Offenders) Bill will enable Supreme Courts, on the application of the Attorney-General, to make an order for the ongoing detention of high-risk terrorist offenders serving custodial sentences when the court is persuaded to a high degree of probability that they continue to pose an ongoing risk to the community were they to be released upon the expiry of their sentence. The government will also reintroduce the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment Bill, originally introduced in November last year. The revised version of the bill adopts all of the recommendations made on a bipartisan basis by the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Joint_Committee_on_Intelligence_and_Security" rel="nofollow">
                Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security
               </a>
               . Those bills will be the latest instalment in the architecture of protections for which this government is determined to—
