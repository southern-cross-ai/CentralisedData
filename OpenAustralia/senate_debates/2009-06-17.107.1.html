        Yesterday in question time, Senator Siewert asked me a question as Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts. I have some further information which I will seek leave to incorporate.

       <p>
        Leave granted.

        On 16 June 2009 during question time, Senator Siewert asked me a question as Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts enquiring why phytophthora management is not listed as a priority for funding in the Caring for Country business plan. Senator Siewert also asked whether the government was funding or considering funding any part of a coastal road that the state government has proposed to put through
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitzgerald_River_National_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Fitzgerald River National Park
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable Senator’s question:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For Caring for Country a series of national priorities were established that focus on securing improved strategic outcomes for the management of Australia’s natural environment and productive agricultural lands.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This strategic and very targeted approach ensures that our investment is sharply focused on achieving national priorities and avoids the risk of spreading available funds so thinly that improvements fall short of their potential and cannot be measured or reported.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Whilst there is no specific target addressing phytophthora management in the 2009-10 business plan, stakeholders could consider where other targets (such as those relating to biodiversity conservation) may align with this area of focus. Actions relating to phytophthora management may be considered where a contribution to Caring for our Country targets is clearly identified.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Significant work has been undertaken investigating the extent and management of phytophthora in the past. This work provides a good grounding for local, regional and state-based activities to be developed and implemented.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A Caring for our Country business plan will be released each year. A review is currently being undertaken of the 2009–10 business plan and targets as part of the process in developing this next plan. An important part of the evaluation is through public consultation via the Caring for our Country website, www.nrm.gov.au,

        On the question of funding for a proposed road, there is no proposal before the
