         On behalf of Senator Gallagher, who is unavoidably absent at a press conference in relation to the government's new superannuation package, I move:

         (2) in respect of the provisions of the National Disability Insurance Scheme Savings Fund Special Account Bill 2016 the Community Affairs Legislation Committee report by 7 November 2016; and
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) in respect of the provisions of the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Budget Repair) Bill 2016, the Community Affairs Legislation Committee report by 7 November 2016.".
        </p>
        <p>
         The amendment seeks to refer three different packages of legislation for committee consideration. They are the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Jobs for Families Child Care Package) Bill 2015, the National Disability Insurance Scheme Savings Fund Special Account Bill 2016 and the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Budget Repair) Bill 2015.
        </p>
        <p>
         We do believe that these bills are worthy of consideration. I will make some comments in relation to the child care package. This government has had a number of positions in relation to child care. Senators may recall prior to the election in the last term of government the chopping and changing on child care that was the government's policy and then subsequently we were going to have a talk about it. The government has put forward a bill. We do consider it is important to understand the impact of the bill on children and families but also on childcare providers in order for the Senate to be able to consider the bill in a fully informed way. We also think a Senate committee will allow consultation with the sector on potential improvements to the bill.
        </p>
        <p>
         Similarly, the Labor Party does wish to consider more closely the operations the National Disability Insurance Scheme Savings Fund Special Account Bill 2016. We want to understand better the purpose and operation of the proposed bill. Finally, we believe there is additional consideration required in relation to the impact on those Australians who are affected by the budget repair bill. We commend the amendment circulated in the name of Senator Gallagher to the chamber.

          I move the following amendment to Senator Gallagher's proposed amendment:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Paragraphs (1) and (3) omit the dates, substitute "10 October 2016''
         </p>
         <p>
          We are not seeking to amend the second part of Senator Gallagher's proposed amendment for the National Disability Insurance Scheme Savings Fund Special Account Bill 2016 to report by 7 November 2016. But we are proposing to bring forward the reporting dates for the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Jobs for Families Child Care Package) Bill 2015 and also for the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Budget Repair) Bill 2015. Both of those packages have previously been to inquiry before Senate committee before the last election. We think that this exercise would largely be duplicating that. But given there is a proposition that they be referred for committee, our proposition to the chamber is that the reporting dates for those two inquiries be brought forward in the recognition that there have been significant inquiries recently to both those packages.

           will not be supporting the government's amendments to this amendment. We will be supporting the original amendment because we do think that these bills should be subject to committee inquiry, in the case where there has been one, because of the important issues that have subsequently come up since the last inquiry into these bills. Certainly for (2), we require enough time to look seriously at this issue because it is a significant change to the current arrangements.

            I indicate in relation to the amendment to my amendment moved by Senator Fifield, we are not inclined either to accept it. We would countenance a later October date but we do not think having both of them report by 10 October is a reasonable proposition.

             The question is that the amendment moved by Senator Fifield to the amendment moved by Senator Wong to Senator Bushby's motion be agreed to.
            </p>
            <p>
             The question now is that the amendment, as amended, moved by Senator Wong be agreed to.
            </p>
            <p>
             Question agreed to.
