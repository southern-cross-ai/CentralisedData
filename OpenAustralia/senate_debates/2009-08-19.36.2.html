        My question is to the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Government Service Delivery, Senator Arbib, in relation to the Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan. Could the minister advise the Senate on the progress of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_the_Education_Revolution" rel="nofollow">
         Building the Education Revolution
        </a>
        schools infrastructure program as it is rolled out across the country as part of the economic stimulus plan? Isn’t it the case that this program, the largest school modernisation program in Australia’s history, is already providing work for tradespeople and small businesses in every state and territory? Is the minister aware of any details of the Building the Education Revolution schools infrastructure projects that have been completed?

         I thank Senator Carol Brown for that question. Yesterday, as the Senate might remember, I talked about Yandina, a state school in Queensland, which was the first school to be completed. I am happy to inform the Senate that the second

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouse_District_High_School" rel="nofollow">
          Ouse District High School
         </a>
         in the Derwent Valley K-12, which now has a new multipurpose hall, which will be used by students at the school and also by the local community. It is a great result for that local school and also for the state of Tasmania.
        </p>
        <p>
         As senators would know, these sorts of projects are going on in every primary school across the country. Senators opposite may not want to hear the good news because they voted against it. They voted against the Ouse school getting that funding and getting those facilities.

          Senator Brown also asked about the employment aspect of this construction. I am proud to say that 35 workers have worked on this site, on this high school—and it is not just tradespeople; it is also apprentices—covering apprentice carpenters, joiners, electrical, mechanical services, plumbing, painting, plastering, glazing and concreting.

             . This is good news. We know the Liberal Party hates good news as to the economy, but it is good news for tradespeople. It also builds on the other work we are doing with the stimulus. The Tasmanian senators should listen to this because they voted against it. In Tasmania they voted against the

               I thank the minister for his answer, and that is good news for Ouse. I wish to ask a supplementary question. Is the minister aware of suggestions that the Rudd government’s economic stimulus strategy is no longer necessary and should be rolled back?

                 Can the minister confirm for the Senate that the economic stimulus construction projects are currently underway, and that in about 12 months time there will be around 35,000 individual construction projects around the country? Can the minister explain how these infrastructure construction projects support jobs both directly and indirectly in communities? What would be the consequences of rolling back the economic stimulus?
