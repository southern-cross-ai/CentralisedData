        </a>
        announced "a review of Australian and children's content" to "ensure the ongoing availability of Australian and children's content to domestic and international audiences, regardless of platform", yet over four years later there is still no sign of an Australian content obligation for streaming services;

        (d) on 14 September 2017, the Coalition Government first announced the $50 million Regional and Small Publishers Innovation Fund, yet since then only $17.48 million has been committed under three funding rounds;

        I will now deal with the circulated amendments to the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (2021 Measures No. 1) Bill 2021, starting with the amendments on sheet 1333, circulated by Senator Patrick.
       </p>
       <p>
        I've had a request from the government to recommit the second reading amendment on sheet 1335. With the leave of the Senate, I will recommit the second reading amendment moved by the opposition on sheet 1335. The question is the second reading amendment on sheet 1335, as circulated by the opposition, be agreed to.

         Given that the result of that division changes the question before the Senate for the second reading, out of an abundance of caution I'll put the question of the second reading again. The question is now that the bill be read a second time.
