        (iv) honour our obligations under the convention to ban all forms of both direct and indirect investment in cluster munitions and which echoes calls from the Australian financial industry and the

            I might also seek clarification from the government whip, if that is possible, but first I will speak briefly on this, which was an issue I addressed last night in the adjournment debate. This motion relates to the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_Cluster_Munitions" rel="nofollow">
             Convention on Cluster Munitions
            </a>
            , which Australia is proposing to sign. It is a good convention. It has been negotiated in international forums over many, many years, and Australia is about to make an extraordinary mistake in enacting the provisions of the convention in domestic law in ways we think were carelessly drafted and very badly thought through. It has since been revealed, as I think many people who are close to this issue suspected, that the Australian government was in negotiations with the United States government, which is not a party to the treaty and which does still use these horrific weapons on modern battlefields.
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_United_States" rel="nofollow">
             The United States
            </a>
            was using Australia, effectively, to advance its negotiating position, and the form that the Australian government is proposing to bring this treaty into in Australian law is extremely flawed. It effectively allows Australia to support United States' operations, as we did during
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Desert_Storm" rel="nofollow">
             Operation Desert Storm
            </a>
            in the invasion of Iraq, with the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
             US
            </a>
            military deploying cluster munitions in urban areas—and these horrific weapons are killing a long time after the war has concluded.
           </p>
           <p>
            My plea—and the reason for putting this motion today—to senators is: please think again. Talk to your shadow spokespeople in the area of foreign affairs and defence, if you are interested in disabilities, if you are interested in our defence procurement—talk to your ministers' offices and ask, 'What on earth are you doing?' Because my understanding, and we will see how this vote goes, is that there is bipartisan support among both of the old parties for the government to proceed as it is. This motion is a red flag. Please think again. You have got it wrong and there is still room to improve this before we bring this into domestic law and set a terrible international precedent. I commend this motion.

               Australia has consis­tently been a leading supporter of the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_Cluster_Munitions" rel="nofollow">
                Convention on Cluster Munitions
               </a>
               and was one of its first signatories in December 2008. In March the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee recommended that parliament pass the government's legislation to ban cluster munitions in Australia. The bill ensures that all conduct that is prohibited by the convention is the subject of a criminal offence under Australian law and introduces tough penalties against using, developing, producing, stockpiling or transferring a cluster munition, including a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment for individuals or a $330,000 fine for body corporates. The bill will also allow Australia to continue to undertake military cooperation and operations consistent with the convention with allies and partners that have not signed the convention.

                UN

               mandated missions. This is also the view of Australia's other allies, including the United Kingdom, Canada and France. Once all measures to give effect to the convention are in place, Australia will move as quickly as possible to ratify the convention. Question put:
