          I have not had an opportunity to discuss this with Senator Hinch. We are reluctant to grant leave when we have not been advised of this, as a matter of courtesy, ahead of this leave being sought. We would have considered it, but the Labor Party, as I understand it, has not been advised of this. We would usually request that, if a senator is seeking to obtain leave from the chamber to do so, we be given the courtesy of being advised of it so that we can have a position. So we are disinclined to agree to it.
         </p>
         <p>
          What I do understand is there is an issue with whether or not arrangements could be made for photography for a particular vote which is coming up in that week. Some informal discussions have been held on that, and I have indicated we are quite willing to have that discussion. But in the absence of being advised and having some consultation internally, we are disinclined to give leave to amend a motion which has already been passed.

             My apologies to Senator Wong; it is my newcomer ignorance that I did not follow a formality. It was not meant as any manner of disrespect at all to the

             . What I was trying to do was have the motion accepted this morning amended. That date, 28 November, was picked to help the Clerk of the Senate, because they wanted to have a bit of time to do some drafting. I would like to now move that date forward. I thought I had some agreement that we would move it forward to 7 November, which is the first sitting day of the next session. I just want to stress that the only reason why the 28 November date was ever picked was that I was trying to make things easier for the Clerk of the Senate. That is why we picked Monday, 28 November. I would now like to try to change it, if I get permission to move it, to 7 November.

                I wonder if perhaps the chamber could extend to Senator Hinch the opportunity to lodge a late notice of motion that would then go through the first Monday we are back that would let him change it to 8 November. Perhaps that would be a way forward. If there was a disinclination not to progress this matter now, I wonder whether we could do that in order to facilitate Senator Hinch's objective, which is to get the photography happening sooner than 28 November.

                 I just indicate to the chamber that I had a conversation with Senator Hinch earlier in the day about the date and the proposed change. My understanding was that his office was going to contact all parties, and that obviously has not happened. So there is no appetite for the change. Senator Siewert made a useful suggestion of a permission for lodging, by leave, a notice of motion. He would need leave to lodge a notice of motion as it is beyond the time frame for lodgement. Is the chamber happy for Senator Hinch to seek leave to lodge a notice of motion that will be lodged on Monday, 7 November for photography in the chamber to then take effect post that lodgement?
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_I" rel="nofollow">
                  Do I
                 </a>
                 hear agreeance in the chamber for that course of action? He will lodge the motion today. The motion will then be debated or discovered in formal business on Monday, 7 November. I would assume that photography rules would then change post the passing of that motion, if indeed it passes.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Senator Hinch, I think we have reached a resolution. I am sure you will have some assistance in the drafting of the notice of motion. There will be leave granted probably at the end of this session for you to lodge that notice of motion. I think we have agreement.
