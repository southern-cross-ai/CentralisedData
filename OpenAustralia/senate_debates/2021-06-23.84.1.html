        My question is to Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care Services, Senator Colbeck. How is the Morrison government ensuring more older Australians are receiving the support they need in aged care?

        <p>
         I thank Senator McLachlan for his question. The Australian government is investing $272 million to support senior Australians to access the aged-care services that they need. We will deliver an investment in all Services Australia centres around the country to provide general information in person, face to face, about aged-care services available to them and assist people to use My Aged Care online channels from 31 October.
        </p>
        <p>
         The new face-to-face aged-care specialists will be available in 70 Services Australia centres in all states and territories and include mobile service centres to reach rural and regional areas. This service will help people with the end-to-end process of accessing aged-care services, including financial information support. We will also be linking up Services Australia and My Aged Care call centres so callers can easily be transferred between the two services. These simple but important measures are designed to make it easier for senior Australians to access the information they need to be in control and make their own choices as they age.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are investing $93 million to introduce a network of up to 500 local community care finders to improve engagement with vulnerable senior Australians, including people who are homeless. There will be $65 million to provide greater access to translating and interpreting services for culturally and linguistically diverse Australians. We have allocated $7 million to assist advocacy organisations provide better service. This government remains committed to providing senior Australians with the care they need and deserve as they grow older.

            The Morrison government's investment in aged care includes $94 million for expanded independent advocacy. This funding will more than double the aged-care advocacy workforce to more than 150 advocates nationally, delivering around 15,000 more information and advocacy cases each year. This will improve access to face-to-face and virtual aged-care advocacy for senior Australians in outer metropolitan, rural, regional and remote areas of Australia as well as for home-care recipients and culturally and linguistically diverse Australians. This investment will also add more than 1,000 local network and education sessions to build the capacity for older people, their families and representatives to exercise greater choice and control.

               The Australian government is delivering a once-in-a-generation change through our aged-care reform package, the largest ever investment in aged care and the largest ever response to a royal commission. The government listened to the experiences of Australians who gave evidence to the royal commission and is taking decisive action to implement the recommendations, with reforms to deliver vital services and improve quality care and viability in aged care.
              </p>
              <p>
               New home-care packages have increased from 60,308 under Labor in 2012-13 to more than 275,000 in 2024-25, an increase of 357 per cent. Residential aged-care funding is $15 billion, up from $9.2 billion in 2013. Every year under a coalition government, home-care packages are up, residential care places are up and aged-care funding is up.
