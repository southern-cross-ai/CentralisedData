        My question is to the Attorney-General, Minister representing the Minister for Defence. It is axiomatic that, if Defence wastage is eliminated or significantly reduced, the same defence capability outcomes can be achieved for less money whilst maintaining strong local content and jobs. With that in mind, can the minister advise how much public money has been spent on defence projects in the last decade where a capability never made it into service, including but not limited to the Navy Seasprite helicopter, which in effect never flew; and, more recently, the Army's

           Firstly, I am being egregiously misrepresented and, secondly, the question is about waste—about wastage in Defence—and I gave two specific examples where there is no doubt that these were projects that went off the rails that cost taxpayers a lot of money.
          </p>
          <p>
           The PRESIDENT: Senator Xenophon, in relation to the matter about you being misrepresented, there are other avenues for you to do that, if that is the case. In relation to your point of order, I advise the minister that he has one minute and 13 seconds in which to answer the question.

            Senator Xenophon, in relation to the projects that have not been successful in the past, one of our 2013 election commitments was to conduct the first principles defence review to ensure that Defence is appropriately structured and organised and has the right business practices in place to support the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Defence Force
            </a>
            in the 21st century; and, as I understand the position, Senator Xenophon, the instances you have given predate the first principles defence review. The review set out a comprehensive plan for transformational change throughout the defence organisation to ensure we can deliver on the record investment set out in the defence white paper and to reassure you, Senator, and to reassure all Australians that every dollar will be spent efficiently.

               Senator Xenophon, I am advised that the projects-of-concern process, with its early intervention, aims to combat any major concerns through project remediation, as you acknowledged in your question. The process allows all parties to form a common plan of action and to avoid a blame culture. This is a successful process and one that the government continues to support. What the Senate should actually be concerned about is your proposed $5.8 billion cut to the defence budget.

                     , just to clarify, I understand you are refusing to direct him or ask him to withdraw, but the minister can make a decision as to whether he takes on board the request.

                      Of course the minister can, but I have ruled there is no point of order. If senators think they have been misrepresented, there are other avenues for that to be sorted out. Attorney-General, you have the call.

                          Senator Xenophon, the F-35A is the most capable and affordable aircraft to meet Australia's needs well into the future, and that view has recently been confirmed on a bipartisan basis, I might say, by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. In his Senate confirmation hearing in the United States the now

                          This approach is already reaping benefits. In early February the price for the next lot of Joint Strike Fighters for the first time was set below
