         International Security Assistance Force

          General McChrystal
         </a>
         ’s new strategy, which places paramount importance on protecting the population, reversing the Taliban’s momentum, and creating the space to develop Afghan security and governance capacity. The coalition is working to separate insurgents from the population, support Afghan government plans to improve governance and develop central Helmand so that essential services can be reliably delivered at the local level. Once Afghan and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISAF" rel="nofollow">
          ISAF
         </a>
         troops gain control of the region, the Afghan government will move in quickly to establish civil authority and government support. Shuras, or community meetings, are being held to ensure local needs and concerns are understood and accommodated.
        </p>
        <p>
         A team of Afghan officials, community workers and service providers, along with their equipment—which has been referred to by ISAF, in fact, as government-in-a-box—are ready to commence assistance in the Marjah area as the military phase concludes. This will allow the rapid provision of badly needed reconstruction and development efforts to this area. And I can say to the Senate and to Senator Bishop, who I know has a close interest in this, that this is where our success ultimately lies—that is, with the people of central Helmand feeling the benefit of security, better governance, justice and economic opportunities.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Can the minister outline why Marjah is so significant for the coalition effort? Why will success in Marjah have such a significant impact on the Taliban?

           Let me give three reasons in the brief time available to me. First, Helmand is a focus for insurgents who have obstructed efforts to improve security, governance and development. Second, it has been used by the insurgents as a command and control and logistics hub from which to mount operations elsewhere in the south. Of most concern is its importance to the Taliban as an area for the mass production of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IED" rel="nofollow">
            IED
           </a>
           s. And, third, it is central to the narcotics trade. Helmand province alone is reported to produce more than half of the world’s opium. Marjah is the heroin capital of Helmand, from where much of that illicit opium is trafficked.

            , I have a further supplementary question. Minister, what effect will the crisis in the Dutch government likely have on coalition efforts in Afghanistan, and in particular Australian efforts in Oruzgan? If the Dutch withdraw their forces, who will take on leadership of Oruzgan province?

             , the coalition government in the Netherlands has collapsed, as I am sure senators know, following disagreement between the two major parties about future military commitments in Afghanistan. It will be several months before a new government is in place. Given these developments, we anticipate the Dutch will proceed to relinquish leadership in Oruzgan and draw down their military forces from August this year. As I have previously said, Australia will not assume leadership in Oruzgan.

             are close and valued partners of Australia in Oruzgan province, and we would welcome a continued Dutch commitment in Oruzgan. But I stress: this is a matter for the Dutch themselves. The
