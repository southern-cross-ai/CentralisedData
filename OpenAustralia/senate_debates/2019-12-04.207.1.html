         Joint Committee

        of Public Accounts and Audit, I present the 2018-19 annual report of the committee, together with executive minutes, and I move:

        That the Senate take note of the report.

        Since its establishment in 1913, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit has ensured the accountability and transparency of public administration and expenditure and has become an enduring mechanism of scrutiny in the institution of this parliament. Uniquely, the committee has the authority to determine its own work program and priorities and does so through a bipartisan approach. This report is presented to the parliament pursuant to section 8B of the Public Accounts and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit_Committee" rel="nofollow">

        Act 1951 and showcases the work of its predecessor committee, which ceased with the prorogation of the 45th Parliament on 11 April 2019.
       </p>
       <p>
        The final year of the previous committee was busy and productive with eight reports presented in the parliament, containing 67 recommendations, and a total of 18 public hearings held. While this report outlines the work of the predecessor committee, it also includes a recommendation for the coordination of government responses to the committee's reports to bring this practice in line with common practice across government. Specifically, the committee has recommended that a single consolidated whole-of-government response to each of its reports be coordinated and provided to it within given time frames. This approach would enable the committee to consider government responses in a timely and streamlined way.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the newly appointed chair, along with my colleagues, I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank the chair and members of the previous committee. I'm looking forward to contributing to the important work of this committee. I commend the report to the Senate.
