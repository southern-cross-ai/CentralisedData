        My question is to Senator Brandis, the Minister representing the Prime Minister. Can the minister confirm that on various occasions Prime Minister Turnbull has supported each of the following propositions: an emissions trading scheme, a carbon tax, an emissions intensity scheme, a clean energy target and, last but not least, a stronger renewable energy target? Did Mr Turnbull believe in each of these positions as much as he does in today's?

         No, I can't confirm that. But what I can confirm is that about half an hour ago the Prime Minister and the minister for energy, Mr Frydenberg, announced the Australian government's energy policy, the National Energy Guarantee. This is a game-changing policy. It is implicit in your question, Senator Kitching, that there has been unsettlement and uncertainty in Australian energy policy for a good decade or more. But now, as a result of the announcement that the Turnbull government has made in the last half hour, there no longer is.
        </p>
        <p>
         The choice could not be more stark than it is. The Australian government has adopted the recommendations of the Energy Security Board—a board of specialists who are better informed about the operation of the Australian energy market than any other group of people in Australia—to adopt a suite of policies which collectively are known as the National Energy Guarantee. As a result of this announcement, the uncertainty that has bedevilled this area of public policy for a decade or more now is a thing of the past. As a result of this policy, we will begin to see electricity prices go down. We will guarantee the reliability of supply, something that the

            I can absolutely tell you, Senator Kitching, that that is wrong. The proposition you've asserted is completely wrong. What the government has adopted is a series of recommendations of the Energy Security Board: Kerry Schott, the chair of that board; Clare Savage, the deputy chair;

               I was in the Liberal Party room, and what you assert is not true. What you assert is simply not true. But what I can tell you is that the government has adopted the recommendations of the Energy Security Board. The package of measures announced by Mr Turnbull and Mr Frydenberg come from that review of the Australian energy market by the men and women best placed to provide expert advice in relation to it. We have adopted their recommendations—in particular, their recommendation of a National Energy Guarantee based upon an emissions guarantee and a reliability guarantee.
              </p>
              <p>
               So, Senator Kitching, at the next election that will be the choice: higher electricity prices under a Labor government or lower electricity prices under Mr Turnbull's government.

                 Thank you very much indeed, Senator Bushby, for a timely question. In response to Senator Kitching I did mention the announcement lately made by the Prime Minister and Mr Frydenberg, but let me give you some more details. As I said to Senator Kitching, based on the advice of the Energy Security Board, it is expected that the National Energy Guarantee will lead to a reduction in the typical household bill of between $110 and $115 per year over the 2020-2030 period. The guarantee is made up of two parts that will require energy retailers across the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Electricity_Market" rel="nofollow">
                  National Electricity Market
                 </a>
                 to deliver reliable and lower emissions generations each year.
                </p>
                <p>
                 A reliability guarantee will be set to deliver the right level of dispatchable energy from ready-to-use sources such as coal, gas, pumped hydro and batteries needed in each state. It will be set by the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Energy_Market_Commission" rel="nofollow">
                  Australian Energy Market Commission
                 </a>
                 and the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Energy_Market_Operator" rel="nofollow">
                  Australian Energy Market Operator
                 </a>
                 . An emissions guarantee will be set to contribute to Australia's international commitments. The level of the guarantee will be determined by the Commonwealth and enforced by the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Energy_Regulator" rel="nofollow">
                  Australian Energy Regulator
                 </a>
                 . The National Energy Guarantee will lower electricity prices, make the system more reliable, encourage investment and reduce emissions without subsidies, taxes or trading schemes. The age of subsidies is over.

                   <p>
                    Yes, I can. It's obvious to all of us why it is important that Australia have a reliable, secure and affordable energy supply. It is a fundamental obligation of any government to keep the lights on and to provide its people with power at prices they can afford. And, as a result of the announcements made today by the Prime Minister, that is precisely what we mean to do.

                    , for example, where last year the entire state was blacked out. The entire state of South Australia was blacked out last year as a direct result of the policies of the Weatherill Labor government—because the Weatherill Labor government wasn't committed to economics and to engineering; it was committed to ideology. That's the difference: the Labor Party, driven by ideology, can't even keep the lights on and the Turnbull government has a plan for affordable and reliable supply.

                       Thank you, Senator Bushby; indeed I can. The government understands that households and businesses are doing it tough. We understand that, as the

                       disclosed yesterday, in the last 10 years there has been a 68 per cent increase in power prices, almost all of it attributable to the doubling of power prices in the six years of the Labor government and, in particular, as a result of its carbon tax.

                      <p>
                       The government has tackled power bills from every angle: from network to generation to retail costs. We've worked with the companies—in particular, the gas suppliers—to get better regulated markets, more transparency and more competition. Today's announcement is good news for consumers. Based on the advice of the Energy Security Board, the National Energy Guarantee will lead to a reduction in a typical household bill of $110 to $115 per annum, while the Labor Party only wants to force electricity prices up.

                        My question is also to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Brandis. In the lead-up to the 2013 election, the Liberals promised they would reduce power prices by $500 a year. Can the minister confirm that, instead of delivering Australians a saving, the Turnbull government has delivered the highest power prices on record?

                          —in fact, what we saw with the election of the coalition government in 2013 was the sharpest reduction of electricity prices on record, as a direct result of the repeal of the carbon tax. Do you remember the carbon tax, Senator Dastyari? It was the tax that Ms Julia Gillard promised never to introduce, then—on the footing of a false promise made at the 2010 election—did introduce, that caused power prices to undergo their sharpest increase on record, so that, over the six-year period of the Labor government, power prices—the cost to households of electricity—doubled. It was an increase of 101 per cent, in fact, according to the
                          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Bureau_of_Statistics" rel="nofollow">

                          </a>
                          . Since the election of the coalition government, the power price has stabilised. First it fell—it fell by the sharpest decline in electricity costs in 2014 when we repealed the carbon tax—and then it crept up a little. But, over the four years of the coalition government, the average price has stabilised. As a result of the measures announced today by the Prime Minister and by Mr Frydenberg, based on the advice of the Energy Security Board, we can now expect prices to fall by between $110 and $115 per annum, as a result of those measures alone. That is in addition to, I might say, Senator Dastyari, the other measures, like, for example, the abolition of limited merits review, which the

                            Minister, while attempting to sell the Turnbull government's now abandoned clean energy target, the energy minister argued it would reduce residential power prices by 10 per cent. Given the Turnbull government has delivered the highest power prices on record, why is Mr Turnbull giving up on the clean energy target he's tried so hard to sell?

                             Senator Dastyari, it's not correct that the government has ever advocated a clean energy target. It is the case that Dr Finkel recommended a clean energy target, and the government, as I've told you time beyond number in this chamber, Senator Dastyari, has spent several months now considering that recommendation. We've engaged all of the relevant specialists in the field, but, in particular, we've engaged and sought the advice of the people who actually operate the Australian energy market: the

                             and the Energy Security Board. On the basis of their advice, the government has adopted a better policy, a policy that will lead to greater reductions in the price of electricity to households—that is, the National Energy Guarantee. It is not our view; it is the view of the Energy Security Board.

And it is their advice that we will actually achieve best results in terms of reducing the cost of electricity to households through the National Energy Guarantee, the policy announced by the Prime Minister in the last hour, than we would through a clean energy target. So, Senator Dastyari, that's the way the coalition makes policy: we consult the relevant experts and we make evidence based decisions upon their advice.

                                          , that you're deteriorating. We admired your thespian ambitions yesterday, but I'm afraid they have hit the wall. In fact, every premise in your question is wrong—every single one. As a result of the recommendations of the Energy Security Board—that group of specialists with the most immediate and intimate knowledge of the operation of the energy market, whose advice this government has chosen to follow and to adopt—the share of renewable energy in the energy mix will increase by 2030 to the range of 28 to 36 per cent. It will increase, Senator Di Natale, and the share of carbon-based energy sources, coal and gas, will reduce. So, Senator Di Natale, that premise of your question is wrong.
                                         </p>

                                          And you questioned the Prime Minister's motives. This is what grown-up governments do: they listen to the advice of those best in position to advise them and they consider the options. They consider the options. Through the

                                          process, we commissioned Dr Alan Finkel to prepare a report. He made 50 recommendations, 49 of which the government has accepted. One recommendation in relation to a clean energy target we did consider, but we adopted a different proposal from the Energy Security Board—a group of men and women with even more immediate knowledge of the operation of the Australian energy market than that of Dr Finkel—because their proposal, announced by the Prime Minister in the last hour, will result in even more reductions of price of electricity to Australian households than Dr Finkel's clean energy target.

                                          So, we have consulted the experts. We have considered the options. We have gone about this methodically and carefully and come up with the best choice for the Australian people.

                                               . My point of order is that we have the leader of a political party who is endorsing stunts by his entire team. I think you have to rule this question entirely out of order, and he abrogates his right to have a question, and you should move on to the next questioner. That is a shameful, shameful stunt by the Greens.

                                                 . Well, today's payday. It's payday. The coal and gas industry have come and cashed in their cheque today. They have. While you've been cooking up this policy on the run, which serves your coal industry mates, you need to know that you're cooking the planet and that coal does kill people. Minister, do you accept that coal is a dangerous, harmful product that kills people?

In fact, on any view of the Australian energy market, coal will be a very important component of the Australian energy mix for decades to come, and the presence of coal as an important continuing part of the Australian energy mix is one of the things that will make Australian electricity more affordable to Australian households when the government's National Energy Guarantee policy is put into operation.

You can afford the conceit and the virtue signalling, but they can't. So, Senator Di Natale, take a good look at yourself and the team of undergraduates behind you and get serious about this policy.

                                                     , you have represented yourself as a person with a deep interest in this area of policy for as long as you have been in this place, and I think it is very instructive that not one of the three questions you have asked me has offered a single word of criticism of the policy—not a word. Every one of the three questions you've asked me has not been about the policy; it's been about cheap stunts from the team of undergraduates behind you or it's been about personal attacks on the character and motives of the Prime Minister. If you want to have an argument about policy, we're up for it, because we have adopted a sensible policy on the recommendation of the specialists who operate the Australian energy market. But you, Senator Di Natale, who pretend to be interested, can't rise above stunts.
