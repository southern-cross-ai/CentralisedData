        My question is to the

         Special Minister of State
        </a>
        , Senator Faulkner. On what date did the minister, as the head of the government staffing committee, write to the Auditor-General informing him that the government staffing committee into the CMAX affair was suspended pending his investigation?

        <p>
         I have not written to the Auditor-General in relation to this matter. I can confirm, as I have mentioned to the Senate before, that in May of this year the government staffing committee commenced an examination of matters related to the award of a media services contract to CMAX Communications. I have reported previously to a Senate estimates committee the nature of the communications that I had with the Minister for Defence as a result of a briefing that I received from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_the_Prime_Minister_and_Cabinet" rel="nofollow">
          Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet
         </a>
         . Senator Fierravanti-Wells and other senators would be aware of that background.
        </p>
        <p>
         I can again say to the Senate that the examination by the government staffing committee was close to conclusion. I had also informed the Senate, and had said publicly, that the outcome of the committee’s consideration was expected imminently. It is true that before the committee could conclude its consideration on this matter it was informed that the Auditor-General would undertake a performance audit of the CMAX Communications contract. In fact, he was asked to do this by not one but two opposition senators in this chamber.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would point out that upon receipt of this advice the committee, quite properly, formally suspended its consideration of this matter pending the outcome of the Auditor-General’s performance audit, which I believe—and which I hope all senators in this chamber believe, and which any person who believes in proper and rigorous process would believe—was very much the appropriate approach. The government staffing committee takes the view that I took: that it would not be appropriate for that committee to continue its deliberation in light of that pending performance audit. The Auditor-General, obviously, has statutory auditing functions to fulfil, and the committee believes that it must await any findings from that audit process so that the committee can also properly consider them.
        </p>
        <p>
         As I have indicated to anyone who has cared to ask me about this—and I will say it again—the government staffing committee and I will fully cooperate with the Auditor-General on this matter.

           Of course. I can also say that the

           will take the same approach. I ask the opposition to respect the independence of the Auditor-General. I suggest that the opposition allow the Auditor-General to get on with his job free from any political grandstanding.

             What I can very clearly say to the Senate is that the government staffing committee—and, for that matter, let me say, I, as the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Minister_of_State" rel="nofollow">
              Special Minister of State
             </a>
             —will provide all material that is sought by the Auditor-General. As I have said before, but I will say it again in case Senator Fierravanti-Wells did not hear, he will receive full cooperation from the government staffing committee.
