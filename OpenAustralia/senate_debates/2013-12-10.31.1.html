        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Industry Senator Ronaldson. I note the Holden submission to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Productivity Commission
        </a>
        states:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        From 2001-2012, Holden generated $32.7 billion of economic activity in Australia. During that period, Holden received $1.8 billion in Commonwealth Government assistance, returned $1.4 billion to the Government as

        income tax revenue and paid $21 billion to other businesses in Australia for supplies and services.
       </p>
       <p>
        Can the minister confirm the accuracy of the figures in Holden's submission? Can the minister also confirm that 18 to one is the return on investment in Holden?

         I thank the honourable senator for his question in relation to funding for the Australian automotive sector. I do note that up until 2015, under the Automotive Transformation Scheme, the car industry received about $1 billion of taxpayers' funds, and from 2015 on there will be a further $1 billion of taxpayers' funds. I think what the automotive industry needs—and I think what the automotive workers need—is for Holden to state their intentions. In question time today the Deputy Prime Minister indicated that he had written to Holden today requesting that they state their intentions before Christmas. This government has quite clearly made several significant decisions which will positively impact on the automotive sector and industry generally. The first of those, of course, is to remove Labor's toxic carbon tax, which has not only impacted dramatically on the automotive sector, but has also impacted—

           My point of order is to do with relevance. The minister now has 17 seconds left to go. Senator Carr's question was specifically on clarification of figures, and I would ask that to be the point of the response.

What the automotive industry needs—and what industry needs generally—is some stability in the decision-making process.

                             I have a further supplementary question. I would ask you again, Minister: in view of your statement that

                             should clarify its position, is it not true that Mr Devereux today said no decision had been made by General Motors-Holden about leaving and that the request for support had been with the government for some time?
