         I thank the senator for her ongoing interest in this area. This is an important question that goes to the vision of the Gillard government's strategy, which is for Australia to become one of the world's leading digital economies by 2020. The strategy itself has eight key goals that will ensure that we as a nation take full advantage of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network" rel="nofollow">
          National Broadband Network
         </a>
         to improve health service delivery, create new educational opportunities, assist small businesses to enter new markets and take advantage of increased business oppor­tunities, reduce the imbalance between metropolitan and regional and remote Australia, and support our growing and ageing population.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since its release the strategy has received strong support from industry and community groups. Peter Strong, the

         It is without a doubt ambitious and that ambition is needed when it comes to the digital world which is changing constantly and at times dramatically.
        </p>
        <p>
         Jonathan Nicholas, CEO of the Inspire Foundation, which supports youth mental health services, said the government's plan 'outlines a comprehensive strategy for leveraging the

         chief, Mr Ian Birks, said the strategy reflected 'bold and visionary leadership by Minister Conroy and the Gillard government'. I have to say Mr Birks went on to say—and I do not think anyone in the chamber could disagree with this—that it would be nice to see an intelligent response from the opposition. He stated:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I suspect its response will be around implementation and cost. But it would be nice to see an intelligent conversation about the NBN as we go forward.

Digital hubs will enable local residents to experience the NBN for a period of time and to receive training to develop the digital skills necessary to participate with confidence in the digital economy. $12.4 million is to establish a digital enterprise program that will help small- to medium-enterprises and not-for-profit organisations in the 40 communities to understand the opportunities to benefit from the NBN. $27.2 million is to fund a four-year—

             We heard from two small businesses: Moisturecure, a business specialising in dehumidifiers, rising damp and mould problems; and Hardware2u, a small business selling home improvement products such as sheds, pergolas and decks. Both are located in regional Australia, but through their online presence they now have national markets and are open for business 24 hours a day. The blue PayPal bus is quite literally taking to the road with this important online message, delivering it in person to business owners and employees.
