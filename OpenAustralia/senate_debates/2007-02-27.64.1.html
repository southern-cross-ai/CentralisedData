        Act 1991 and the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 to ensure there is integrity in the application of the law and to ensure that the Welfare to Work measures which commenced on 1 July 2006 continue to be fairly and consistently applied.

        -funded Vocational Rehabilitation Services. To enable people with disability or injuries to have greater choice of rehabilitation providers to assist them to re-enter the workforce, the Government is introducing contestability in the provision of vocational rehabilitation services. The first stage introduces partial contestability for the two year period from 1 July 2007.

       <p class="italic">
        The Welfare to Work changes commenced on 1 July 2006. They are the most significant changes to the Australian social security system since the middle of the twentieth century. The smooth implementation across policy agencies and service providers is a commendable achievement. While it is still early days since implementation, the most recent labour force data indicate extremely encouraging trends towards the reforms key goals: increased workforce participation and strong employment rates.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The amendments will enhance the smooth operation of the legislation so that job seekers among the targeted disadvantage groups of the Welfare to Work reforms —long term unemployed people, parents of school age children, mature age Australians and people with disabilities —can continue to be supported and assisted to build their capacity and find work through employment and related services.

        There are minimal financial implications for the measures contained in this Bill.
