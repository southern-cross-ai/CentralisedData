         Those down there in the far corner of the chamber used to believe in that. They used to believe in wanting to deliver universal health care, particularly to people in rural and regional Australia. So it continues to be an embarrassment to many National Party members like Mayor Bruce Scott, who today was calling for his small community in Queensland—

          . He was continuing to call for fibre to the smallest of communities, completing rejecting those opposite. An Access Economics study found that the steady-state benefits to Australia from wide-scale implementation of telehealth may be in the vicinity of $2 billion to $4 billion per annum. The use of telehealth to keep the elderly and people with chronic illnesses out of hospital and in their homes longer not only has an economic benefit but also improves the quality of life and the speed of convalescence. Remote diagnosis and follow-up care means quality health care is accessible to all Australians regardless of where they live. Those in that corner of the chamber used to believe in that. They will be able to consult specialists from the city—

            The government is committed to fundamental reform of Australia’s health system. And a large part of this is taking our use of technology into the 21st century. We will invest $392 million so that from 1 July 2011 patients can get an online consultation with their specialist if they live in rural, remote or outer-metropolitan areas. This will provide around 495,000 services over four years—495,000 services that those opposite should be supporting. Those from the National Party, from regional and rural Australia should be ashamed of yourselves. There will be 495,000 consultations for people who live in your electorates and you want to block it.
