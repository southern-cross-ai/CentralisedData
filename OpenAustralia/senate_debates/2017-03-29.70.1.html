        My question is to the Minister for Employment, Senator Cash. Can the minister inform the Senate of the benefits of the Turnbull government's Youth Jobs PaTH Prepare Trial Hire program and how does this program seek to expand successful initiatives that have supported voluntary work experience?

          I thank Senator Duniam for the question and, yes, Senator Bilyk, it was yesterday's question. The reason that we have again brought up the topic today is that this government is absolutely committed to doing everything that we can to get our youth who are currently on welfare out of that system and into a job. We on this side of the—it is in our

            I can assure you, Senator Bilyk, through you,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
             Mr President
            </a>
            , we make no apologies for senators on this side of the chamber showing an interest in what government is doing to implement good policy to get our youth the training they need, to get them that foot in the door and, ultimately, to ensure that they get into sustainable employment.
           </p>
           <p>
            That is why in April our $763 million investment in our Youth Jobs PaTH does commence. As we have said, this is all about getting our youth ready, getting them the skills that they need, giving them a go, getting them that foot in the door. We often talk to our youth, and what do we hear from them? They would love to have the opportunity to undertake some work experience or to get a job, but employers will not take them on—because they do not have that experience. Ultimately, we need to get them a job.
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course, one of the things we are focused on is young Australians who are caught up in that cycle of intergenerational unemployment and welfare dependency. They need the government to work with employers and make an investment in them. Mr President, I am disappointed that those on the other side continue to oppose getting our youth off welfare and into a job.

            said, 'You can no longer support the program.' And Labor, unfortunately, changed their tune.

               I can tell this chamber that it would appear that every single person in this chamber is committed to giving interns a go—unless, of course, it is employers and youth on welfare. Let's go through the list, in terms of the senators on the other side.
              </p>
              <p>
               Senator Gallagher, you have been in this place for just two years, yet you have already had five interns through your office. Senator Brown, the good news is that you have apparently had three. And it does not stop there. Senator Collins, you understand the benefits of giving people a go. You have had three in your office. Senator Marshall, you do not get away from this. Those on the other side understand the benefits of giving people a go in their offices. And Senator Bilyk—I have not forgotten you—you have had two. Senator Dodson, you have been here for less than one year and you have already had two interns. I congratulate those on the other side. If only they could share what they are allowed with employers!

                  (—) (): In response to all the interjections, I have to say that I actually applaud you for having interns in your office. The issue I have is with your hypocrisy. It is okay for those on the other side to have interns through their office, for whatever program they may take them through. But when it comes to government policy to give our youth, who are entrenched in welfare, half a chance to get their foot in the door, why is it that that same opportunity is denied by those on the other side? You love interns—except when it comes to employers having the opportunity to give our youth a go. Of course, it does not stop with Labor. Yesterday we talked about Senator Di Natale and the intern position that he advertised—'no financial remuneration is available and no employment positions are on offer'. Unlike the Greens, the PaTH program does offer employment and financial remuneration. It is a shame you will not support it.
