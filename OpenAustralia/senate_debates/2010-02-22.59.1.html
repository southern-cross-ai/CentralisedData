        On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Works" rel="nofollow">
         Public Works
        </a>
        , I present the 73rd annual report of the committee, and seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That the Senate take note of the report.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Public Works Committee is required under its act to report annually to parliament, and I am pleased to present this report of the committee’s proceedings during 2009. The committee had a busy year in 2009, investigating 14 proposals with a combined total cost of $3.3 billion. There was one proposal withdrawn from the committee’s consideration, and it is discussed in the report. There are some particular features of the committee’s work in 2009 that I would like to note.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee undertook an inquiry into a Defence project in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarin_Kowt" rel="nofollow">
         Tarin Kowt
        </a>
        , in Afghanistan, where members of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        are currently deployed. This is the first time in the history of the committee that the committee has considered works proposed for an operational deployment, and I think this demonstrates the capacity of the committee to undertake inquiries into sensitive projects. The committee would particularly like to thank the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Defence
        </a>
        for its assistance in making this inquiry so successful.
       </p>
       <p>
        At numerous times in 2009, the committee has had to ask agencies to resubmit further confidential cost estimates. The committee, as you would understand, Mr Acting Deputy President, must have sufficient information to be confident that projects have been accurately costed and that they will be completed without cost overruns. Incomplete costings can cause significant delays in the inquiry process, and the committee looks forward to improved project costings in 2010. I encourage agencies to contact the secretariat of the Public Works Committee for advice about how to make a presentation and also for advice about the level of detail that is required by our committee to properly assess proposals. Public Works Committee scrutiny is recognised by many of the agencies which regularly present to us as a valuable tool to ensure that the planning for major capital projects is accurate and well thought through.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee was also notified of 78 medium works in 2009, with a total cost of $425 million. The committee also implemented a new process of publication for medium works under an agreement with the finance minister. The project title, agency name and date of notification of all medium works are published on the committee’s website. This is an important measure to increase accountability and transparency.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I would like to thank senators and members for their work in 2009. I commend the report to the Senate.
