        My question is to Senator Abetz, the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations in this place. Is the minister aware of comments by the President of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Industrial_Relations_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Industrial Relations Commission
        </a>
        that using the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Pay_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Fair Pay Commission
        </a>
        to set minimum wages will see a slowdown in the rate of growth of minimum wages?
       </p>
       <p>
        Didn’t the president say ‘that is what the Fair Pay Commission is for’? Don’t these comments by the President of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIRC" rel="nofollow">
         AIRC
        </a>
        , who of course was appointed by this government, highlight the impact on the low paid of the government’s new workplace laws? Can the minister now explain why the government thinks the nearly two million Australians already only getting the minimum wage of $12.75 an hour should get smaller pay rises in the future?

         indicate that I am not personally aware of the comments, but I will take a punt and accept them at face value only because it is Senator Bishop asserting it. If it were some of his other colleagues, I would not be as confident in accepting their comments at face value. Even if we were to accept that the President of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Industrial_Relations_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Industrial Relations Commission
         </a>
         made those comments, it remains to be seen whether or not that assertion is proven.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, what we on this side have had to tolerate, year after year—indeed, for a full decade now—is that each time we have come in with a reform—be it the goods and services tax, the waterfront reform, our first tranche of industrial relations changes or the first sale of Telstra—no matter what our reform program, it has been met by a chorus of doom and gloom from a whole host of people, some of whom are very well informed but all of whom, I must say, have been proven to be incorrect.
        </p>
        <p>
         We as a government have presided over a decade of seeing the low-income earners of this country enjoying increased wages to an extent unparalleled under the previous 13 years of the Labor government. Given that, I pose this question: why on earth would we as a government, having this wonderful record over the past decade, all of a sudden say: ‘Well, let’s try and lower the wages—after having increased them for a decade, let’s try and decrease them’?
        </p>
        <p>
         It does not make sense, it is not on our agenda and, if there is one thing that the Prime Minister can be very proud of, it is the way that he has looked after the battlers of this country. That is why in common parlance today they are referred to as Howard’s battlers—because he is the one to look after them.

          , arising from that response, I have a supplementary question. Can the minister confirm that, if the government had got its way over the last 10 years, the nearly two million Australians on the minimum wage would be paid $2,600 a year less than they are being paid now? Why does the government always want to pay the nearly two million Australians on the minimum wage less?

           The honourable senator knows that that is a very old, hoary argument that has no substance to it whatsoever. What the honourable senator knows is that, at the end of the day, people judge us on what is in their pay packet as a result of 10 years of the Howard government in comparison with what they got under 13 years of the Hawke-Keating government when the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACTU" rel="nofollow">
            ACTU
           </a>
           had its feet under the cabinet table and the Hawke-Keating government was able to deliver about a 1.2 per cent increase for the battling workers of this country. We have presided over an economic scenario where their wages have gone up above inflation—and, what is more, interest rates have been kept low so that, when they have had to borrow for a house, a car or something else, they have been able to do so on a sustainable basis.

                  I did hear the question, and I thank Senator Johnston for his loud, booming voice, which did allow me to hear the question above the din from those opposite. I am aware of a number of comments in support of a modern industrial relations system in this country. Indeed, in recent times Mr Bracks, the

                   Victorian Premier
                  </a>
                  —and when I say ‘in recent times’ I mean a decade ago—said that the Labor opposition ‘supports in principle the concept of a single national system of industrial relations’. Prior to that we had the

                  know what needs to be done to modernise our industrial relations system. I will give them another quote to assist them. It is this—and I would ask honourable senators to listen to it, because it is very important:
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  It is going to be necessary to strike an alternative industrial relations policy [that has] regard to the open-trading nature of the economy ...
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Those opposite can squirm as much as they like in listening to it, because they know it was said by their real leader—and by their real leader I am not referring to Mr Beazley but to Mr

                  . So we have the prospect of the ACTU itself recognising that you cannot go back, you have to move forward. But what is Mr Beazley’s policy in relation to the reforms we have just introduced? It is a ripper. He is going to rip up our policy and go back to that which existed prior to 1996, when his own ACTU secretary, Greg Combet, has finally been mugged by reality and now acknowledges the need for reform in the open economy in which we now operate.

                   My question is also to Senator Abetz, the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. I refer the minister to his answer yesterday about the government’s decision to remove unfair dismissal protection from nearly four million Australian workers. Can the minister confirm that under the government’s new system employers will be able to sack their workers today but offer them the same job back tomorrow on a lower wage? Can the minister explain why the government thinks that employers should be able to take advantage of the new system simply to cut costs?

                      In this, the 21st century, those sorts of notions have been dismissed, as I just pointed out in my previous answer, even by luminaries of the labour movement such as the
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rt_Hon" rel="nofollow">
                       Rt Hon

                      </a>
                      . What we are looking for is flexibility at the workplace—and flexibility at the workplace requires the confidence of small business employers to be able to put on staff without having the yoke of unfair dismissal legislation around their business necks. Mr Beazley himself has acknowledged the problems with the unfair dismissal laws as they existed in the past but, having acknowledged the problem, his answer is: ‘I will go back to those problems. I will not accept the reforms of the Howard government.’

                     <p>
                      I do not know of any employer who takes delight in sacking a worker. I know there are people like Senator Conroy who take great delight in seeing parliamentary colleagues sacked, but I do not know of an employer who wakes up of a morning and says, ‘Who can I sack today?’ They are concerned about the welfare of their business enterprise—the welfare of which determines their capacity to employ the workers within that enterprise. That is why, especially within the small business community, there is that close relationship between employer and employee—something which has driven up productivity and employment opportunities for our fellow Australians. Indeed, small business has been the engine room of economic activity and employment growth. All we had to do was ask small business, ‘Why aren’t you employing more people?’ and the one answer that came through loud and clear, time and time again, was, ‘The unfair dismissal laws act as a disincentive to employment.’

                                 , as a supplementary question, doesn’t this show that Senator Minchin was right when he said that the great majority of Australians do not support what the government is doing on industrial relations; they violently disagree? Isn’t a system that allows an employer to cut wages by firing workers then rehiring them on a lower wage and inferior conditions simply unfair and un-Australian?

                                  In relation to the last part of the question, the answer is clearly no. Having said that, can I indicate that it is quite natural for our fellow Australians to express some concern at the changes that the government has implemented. They expressed similar concern when we introduced the goods and services tax, and Labor thought it could lazily ride into government on the alleged wave of

                                  discontent. Of course, the people of Australia said, ‘That’s not good enough.’ This is what Labor is trying to do again: ride into government on a scare campaign and a wave of discontent. But I suggest to those opposite that, just as they had to suffer the humiliation of doing their backflip on GST, they get it out of the way now, do the backflip today and save themselves the embarrassment tomorrow.
