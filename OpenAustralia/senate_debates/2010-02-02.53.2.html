        I was asked today a question by Senator Troeth about enrolments and about the actual physical exclusion of a student from a school. I have yet to get information on that. But, with regard to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPLAN" rel="nofollow">
         NAPLAN
        </a>
        participation rate questions that went to whether a student is actually enrolled in a school and excluded from any testing: the NAPLAN participation rates are reported for each school on the website so that it is clear how many students participated in the testing. Any attempt to exclude students from the testing will be apparent from this data. That is the information that has been provided to me by the education department. Students are exempted from NAPLAN tests if they have severe intellectual or functional disabilities or if they are from a non-English-speaking background and have been learning English in Australia for less than one year. Exempt students are not included in the calculation of the school average.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         All Australian
        </a>
        governments have committed to promoting increased participation of such students in the national assessment process. The national protocols for the administration of the NAPLAN test outline the agreed policies and practices for providing students with special support, adjustments and accommodation. I trust that assists the senator.
