           The intent of Senator Lazarus's motion is no doubt good and admirable. It basically calls on governments to collaborate not only with each other but also with the taxi sector and the ride-sharing sector to consider regulatory frameworks that would cover both of those sectors. Normally we would be very happy to support this motion as it stands; however, what Senator Lazarus's motion fails to consider is that there are actually inherent differences between the ride-sharing sector and the taxi sector including regulations, fee introductions, fee modifications and other aspects. On that basis, we have concerns with some of the wording in this motion but we do support the principle of it.
