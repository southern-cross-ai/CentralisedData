        My question is to Senator Nash, the Minister representing the Minister for Health. Under the External Breast Prostheses Reimbursement Program, women who have had breast surgery as result of cancer are able to claim a reimbursement of up to $400 for each breast prosthesis every two years. The recent prosthesis inquiry heard evidence that this initial up-front cost is very much unaffordable for low-income breast cancer survivors. Is the minister aware that breast cancer survivors are being forced to go without these prostheses because they are unable to meet the initial up-front costs which are ultimately reimbursed through the program?

         I thank Senator Griff for his question and for some advance notice of it. I do appreciate his genuine concern for women who are experiencing breast cancer, as I expect everybody in this chamber does. I think all of us right around this chamber—certainly many of us—have been touched by family members, relatives and friends that have experienced breast cancer, and I do appreciate his genuine concern for this.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am advised that a recent evaluation of the national External Breast Prostheses Reimbursement Program was commissioned by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Health
         </a>
         , to consider whether the program does remain appropriate, effective and efficient, and to identify potential efficiencies or improvements to the program. The results of that evaluation are overwhelmingly positive. The program participants reported that typically the program had impacted them directly by improving their overall quality of life. However, I am also advised that the evaluation did note that program access for women in financial hardship, that the senator has indicated, or on fixed incomes, was raised by stakeholders as a challenge. As the government, we are going to consider ways that we can improve access to this program. Senator Griff quite rightly has raised an issue that has been of some concern to people that he has impacted with, and the Minister for Health has also informed me that he is more than happy to meet the senator to discuss the matter further.

           Can the minister advise whether, in the meantime, there is any issue with reducing the up-front out-of-pocket cost, so it is substantially less than the $400?

            I am not aware of any current consideration to date over immediate changes to the program in relation to the funding arrangements that the senator refers to. But I am more than happy to take that on notice. Again, I can indicate to the senator that the minister is very happy to meet him to discuss this. I think it is important to note though that over 90 per cent of women have been able to access their reimbursements in a very timely manner. I think it is about a 10-day turnaround done through electronic fund transfer to be able to recoup that funding. And I think it is important that we note that for the majority of claimants this has worked well. But indeed, as I indicated, I note the issue that the senator has raised and will certainly be facilitating a meeting, if the senator so desires, with the Minister for Health.

              Thank you, Minister. I very much look forward to having that meeting. In the meantime, can you confirm whether other external prostheses are able to be obtained by patients without the need for up-front and sometimes cost prohibitive payments? And if so, what are the reasons for treating breast prostheses differently to such prosthetic devices?
