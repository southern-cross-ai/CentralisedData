        Senator the Hon Michaelia Cash

       <p class="italic">
        Dear Senator
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am writing in relation to questions you raised regarding the Government's commitment to delivering clinical health care standards during Question Time on Wednesday 16 October 2019.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Safety and quality in hospitals is primarily the responsibility of states and territories. The Australian Government supports the states and territories in improving hospital quality and safety by jointly funding the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Care" rel="nofollow">
         Health Care
        </a>
        (the Commission).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        By working in partnership with the Australian Government, states and territories, the private sector, clinical experts, and patients and carers, the Commission aims to ensure that the health system is better informed, supported and organised to deliver safe and high-quality care.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        All hospitals and day procedures are required to implement the Commission's National Safety and Quality Health Service (NSQHS) Standards. The NSQHS Standards were developed by the Commission in collaboration with the Australian Government, states and territories, private sector providers, clinical experts, patients and carers. The primary aims of the NSQHS Standards are to protect the public from harm and to improve the quality of health service provision.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The eight NSQHS Standards provide a nationally consistent statement about the level of care consumers can expect from health services. The eight NSQHS Standards are:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition to the NSQHS, the Commission has issued Clinical Care Standards. A Clinical Care Standard is a small number of quality statements that describe the care patients should be offered by health professionals and health services for a specific clinical condition or defined clinical pathway in line with current best evidence. Clinical Care Standards can play an important role in delivering appropriate care and reducing unwarranted variation, as they identify and define the care people should expect to be offered or receive, regardless of where they are treated in Australia.
