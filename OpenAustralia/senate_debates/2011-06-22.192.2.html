        Senator Wortley has kindly agreed to allow me a few minutes of her contribution because I did not have the opportunity to make some remarks in the valedictory debate that I wanted to make. So I will do that now.
       </p>
       <p>
        I particularly want to firstly acknowledge my colleagues
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Hutchins" rel="nofollow">
         Steve Hutchins
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annette_Hurley" rel="nofollow">
         Annette Hurley
        </a>
        . As will be clear from previous contributions, I have known Steve for many years. As Senator Faulkner said, Steve and I have not agreed on much over the years; although, in our later years here I think we found more things we could agree upon in the mellowness of age, which we both show. But we have not changed much except for our hair colour.
       </p>
       <p>
        In terms of Steve's absolute commitment to the things he believes in, I think they are the hallmark of Steve Hutchins and anyone who knows him here knows that he is a fervent believer in things and he will do everything to pursue the cause of those beliefs. I think that is the greatest mark of a person of honour. I have never had dealings with Steve where I did not believe I could trust his word; he was always honourable in that regard and that is another important mark of a person in my view. Honour in dealings is one of the critical tests that I apply. Annette Hurley I had a little to do with, mostly through the Economics Committee, working on dairy inquiries with other senators in this place. Annette's ability to accumulate knowledge, to understand issues and to work towards a solution were a testament to the capacity that she had. She was very unlucky, from the history that she and others have recounted but also because of what took place in selection of shadow ministries in times gone by, not to have found her way onto the front bench when Labor attained government in 2007. She has made a decision to leave in her own time and do the things that she wants to do, and I can clearly tell from the look on her face that she is entirely comfortable with that decision. I think that is a wonderful thing to be able to say. I have a great deal of respect for her and hope that she and her husband, Bob, continue to be the great partnership that they have been as I have observed them in her relatively short time in this place.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to make some comments about Senator Steve Fielding's role here. As most have observed,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_Fielding" rel="nofollow">
         Senator Fielding
        </a>
        has supported both sides on many occasions. I suppose that when you do that some say you please no-one. But in my view he has done what he has believed was the right thing to do on every occasion. In the position that he is in, he was able to do that when some of us, because we are loyal to our parties and the decision-making process, maybe were less comfortable with some decisions than others. So that is a matter which I think Senator Fielding can take from this place. At all times he did what he believed was right. I respect that.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was pretty regretful of some of the things that happened in this chamber earlier today when a vote took place and comments were being made in a division. I reminded some people that privilege does not apply during a division and it is probably unwise to make certain comments, even in this chamber, when the benefits of privilege do not apply. But I thought that Senator Fielding handled that particularly well.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to say that I think this reflects upon the honourable way in which Senator Fielding conducted himself in here. I have observed his desire that the votes in this place reflect the will of the people. There was one particular vote on a disallowance going up towards 6:50. The debate would have been concluded and, had the debate not gone to a vote, the disallowance, which related to a Queensland fishing issue, would have been deemed carried and the regulation disallowed without the Senate having voted on it. But Senator Fielding, to his credit even though he did not support the ultimate outcome, supported the concept that the will of the Senate, not the effluxion of time and the fact that the matter was not allowed to come to a vote, ought to determine the outcome.
       </p>
       <p>
        He supported his conscience in that regard. His view on the matter was lost in the vote, but he believed—and I believed and said to him that I believed—that he had done the right thing. That reflected very well on him. I believe that to this day. I think that is one of the greatest marks of Senator Fielding's approach to this place. It was a very honourable approach. Thank you.
