        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANZAC" rel="nofollow">
         ANZAC
        </a>
        , Senator Ronaldson. Can the minister advise the Senate of preparations for the Centenary of Anzac and, particularly, commemorations at Gallipoli in 2015?

         I thank Senator O'Sullivan for his question. As the chamber would be aware, 2015 marks the 100th anniversary of Australia's engagement on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallipoli_Peninsula" rel="nofollow">
          Gallipoli Peninsula
         </a>
         . Over the next four years all Australians—and I know I speak for everyone in this chamber—will be commemorating the service and sacrifice from Gallipoli right through until today. The commemorations will start on 4 August, and in September we will commemorate our first engagement in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
          Papua New Guinea
         </a>
         . On 31 October and 1 November this year, in Albany, we will commemorate the departure of the first fleet that left for Gallipoli. I would like to pay credit to Senator Smith and Mr Wilson, from the other place, in relation to the fantastic work that they have done.
        </p>
        <p>
         I have been working closely with Turkish authorities to ensure that these commemorations are solemn, dignified and appropriately honour all those who served—Australians,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealanders" rel="nofollow">
          New Zealanders
         </a>
         and Turkish alike. Between April and December 1915, Australians were involved in a number of matters on the Gallipoli Peninsula. The offensive at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lone_Pine" rel="nofollow">
          Lone Pine
         </a>
         on 6 August was a major battle. Indeed, six Australians were awarded the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VC" rel="nofollow">
          VC
         </a>
         during that battle and there were some 2,000 casualties.
        </p>
        <p>
         To commemorate these actions I am very pleased to announce today that the Australian government will host a major commemorative event on 6 August 2015 at the Australian memorial at Lone Pine. This event will provide extended opportunities for those who cannot get to Gallipoli to participate.

           I can advise the honourable senator that next week I will be writing to some 42½ thousand Australians who registered for the ballot—both the successful and the unsuccessful. There will be those who will understandably be disappointed. There will be those who have asked to be put on a waiting list, and they will still be involved in the ballot. I want to confirm that there will be only four politicians attending Gallipoli next year: the Prime Minister; me, as the responsible minister; whoever the new shadow veterans spokesperson will be; and presumably the Leader of the Opposition,

           Access to the peninsula will be restricted as a result of these events. There will be no alternative—

             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lone_Pine" rel="nofollow">
              Lone Pine
             </a>
             on 6 August 2015 will give Australians who cannot get to Gallipoli the opportunity to be there. Of course, there will be ceremonies at Villers-Bretonneux and in London on Anzac Day next year. This completely bipartisan program, the local commemoratives grants program, was started off by the former government and added to by this government with an extra $25,000 for those who are in the other place. Those grants will enable communities to get together and plan significant local commemorative events, particularly in those regional and rural areas across Australia where countless brothers, cousins, uncles and fathers from small communities lost their lives. This is a fantastic opportunity for this country to commemorate their sacrifice.
