        I want to use this opportunity to briefly make some comments on Senator Bullock announcing his resignation. I was shocked to hear that tonight and, frankly, a little disappointed and saddened. Like you, Mr Acting Deputy President Ketter, I was in the class of 2013 with Senator Bullock. I am sad to see him go, because I had become great mates with him. I know him as a fine man. I did not need him to so selflessly sacrifice his job for his principles to prove to me that he is a fine man; I know that he is a fine man. Through his selfless actions tonight, I think he would have proven to millions of other Australians, who do not know him, what a fine man he is. For me, there is no greater accolade I could give Senator Bullock than to say I wish I could be more like him. I think most of us from time to time do not live up to our values; we put ourselves above our ideals, above our friends and, at times, even above our family. Through his selfless actions tonight, Joe has shown that he has not been enticed away. He himself alluded to the temptation that he would have felt to stay in this place and join another party, the National Party. It must have been a great temptation to resist. But he did resist that temptation and, by doing so, he has shown himself to be loyal to his party, loyal to the voters of

        </a>
        and, most importantly, loyal to his own ideals and values. Senator Bullock may have only graced this chamber for a short period of time but, through his actions tonight, I think he will be long remembered.
