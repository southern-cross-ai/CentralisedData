         Just wait, Senator Wong. When there is silence in the chamber from both sides you will be given the opportunity to answer the question. It is completely disorderly to be shouting across the chamber. Senator Wong, answer the question please.

          I thank Senator Feeney for the question. There are a great many facts which have been put before parliamentarians and senators as to why we should act on climate change, and it is regrettable that there are some in this chamber who still—despite all of the facts, all of the evidence and all of the campaigning by Australians for action on climate change—refuse to acknowledge the need for action.
         </p>
         <p>
          There are two simple facts that we must remember when we consider why we need to act on climate change: first, that Australia is one of the hottest and driest continents on earth; second, that we will be hit hardest and fastest by climate change.

            We know that one of the most strident opponents of any action on climate change resides in the National Party. There are many National Party senators who should listen closely to this: without action on climate change there is a risk that Australia will become a net importer of wheat as soon as 2050. It is very difficult to understand how it is that anyone could stand in here and claim to represent rural Australia and yet ignore these warnings. It is very difficult to understand how you could come in here as a responsible representative and simply ignore these warnings.

               This government was elected to tackle climate change, and for the last two years we have engaged in detailed analysis and design of the mechanism that will deliver practical action to reduce Australia’s carbon pollution for the first time in this nation’s history and reduce our contribution to climate change. Today, we on this side stand ready to take that step. We on this side stand ready to take our Kyoto commitments and to deliver a scheme that will deliver an Australia with a low-pollution economy. We are prepared, on this side, to deliver—

                  Because we on this side want to hold to our election commitment—because we on this side believe it is important to act on climate change—we have made significant concessions to see action taken to ensure we move from policy to action. The final package being offered by the government includes a number of gains for the environment as well as delivering significant additional assistance to help Australian industry make the transition to a low-carbon future.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  At the same time as doing all of this, the government will maintain the level of support for households that we promised. Action on climate change this week will give Australian businesses the certainty that they need to make the investments we want them to make. It will mean that Australia goes to Copenhagen with a means to deliver our targets—the targets those opposite have supported. We have delayed action on climate change too long: it is now time to act.

                    The progress that is required is for various senators in this chamber to understand the risks that climate change poses. What is required is for people to look to the national interest and not their party interest, because failing to act today is the riskiest course of action open to the parliament. Failing to act today is a roll of the dice with our children’s future. We are asking our colleagues to take action for the future, to take action for our children and for our grandchildren, to take action to protect the Australian economy, to take action to protect Australian jobs and to act for the future and not for the past—to act for our children. This day has been 10 long years in the making—10 long years where the tough decisions have been ducked and where the challenges of today were simply buck passed to the leaders of tomorrow. It is time for no more buck passing: now is the time to act.
