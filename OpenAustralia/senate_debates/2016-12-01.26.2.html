         report, which I sought to refer last night and about which we could not agree at the Selection of Bills Committee meeting, gives the Attorney-General an extreme power and therefore should be investigated by the Legal and

         , which I am given to understand the bill has been referred to. That does not allow open scrutiny of these measures and does not include a Greens senator or member of the other place. Therefore, those of us who take a very deep interest in these issues, and who may have an alternative view to the other parties, do not get an opportunity to be involved in the investigation. I put on record we are extremely disappointed that we were not able to have an inquiry through the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee.
