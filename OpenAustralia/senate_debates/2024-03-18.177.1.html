        This is not my first speech. My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs, Senator Watt. Minister, how many of the more than 2,000 visas granted to Palestinian document holders following 7 October have since been cancelled, and how many of those cancelled have now been reinstated?

         Thank you for the question, Senator Sharma. I think it might be your first question in this chamber. The issue that you've asked about is something that I addressed in some media comments this morning as well. The government's practices as to the cancellation of these visas have been on the record. As we have made clear repeatedly, this government is following exactly the same process as the former government in the granting of visas and the consideration of visa applications and has applied exactly the same security tests to those applications as has occurred previously, including under the former government.
        </p>
        <p>
         Decisions were made to award visas to some applicants, not all, and those decisions were based on information that was available at the time those decisions were made. Further information, in some cases, came to light, and, on the basis of that information, the security advice was that some visas should be cancelled, and that action was taken. Then, as time progressed, additional information came to light which required the reinstitution, if you like, of some of those visas that had been cancelled. That is ordinary practice for any government of any political persuasion—to make visa decisions based on information that is available and that is based on security advice from security agencies. And of course—

           I have a point of order on direct relevance. Senator Sharma's question was very direct, very factual. It just asked for a series of numbers. The minister has not yet provided them in one minute and 30 seconds. If he doesn't have them, he should take them on notice and provide them afterwards.

                    Senator Sharma, I would expect that, as an experienced member of parliament and a former diplomat, you would know that governments do not provide that level of detail about security advice that they receive. Simply being a member of the opposition doesn't automatically entitle you to ask those sorts of questions or get that sort of information. You would surely know that governments don't provide that kind of security information. What I can also say is that the
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
                     Department of Home Affairs
                    </a>
                    routinely cancels visas. That department has done so under this government. They did so under the former government. They have done so from time immemorial. That's because all noncitizens who wish to enter or remain in Australia must satisfy the requirements of the Migration Act, and all noncitizens are required to meet health, character and security criteria. They're required to undergo security checks and are subject to ongoing security assessments. That is the practice under this government, as it was under the former government.

                      On 28 February, when asked by the opposition to confirm whether adequate security checks were conducted on all of the individuals from Gaza who were granted visas, Minister, you assured us they were and went on to chastise the opposition for attempting to 'whip up fear'. Minister, is it still your evidence that all necessary security checks were conducted on all of the individuals from Gaza before they were granted visas?

                       Senator Sharma, I have to say I am quite disappointed in you, because we were led to believe that you were someone who, as a former diplomat, respected diplomatic practices in this country, respected security agencies, but now you are taking your orders from certain other people as to how this issue should be approached.

                         Thank you, President. As Senator Sharma and the entire opposition well know, all visa applicants are required to undergo security checks. This government, just like the former government, has followed the advice of the security agencies in making its decisions. We have followed that advice in deciding in some cases to grant visas, in other cases to refuse applications, in other cases to cancel visas and in other cases to reinstate those visas as that advice is changed based on the information provided. Some members of the opposition might laugh about that, but this government take the security of the Australian people seriously and we will continue to do so. It would appear that others don't.
