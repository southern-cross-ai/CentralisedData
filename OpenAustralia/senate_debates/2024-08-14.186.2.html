        I rise today to pay tribute to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran_Bladel" rel="nofollow">
         Fran Bladel
        </a>
        . I first met Fran in 1984, over 39 years ago. Fran was an active member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Labor Party
        </a>
        (Tasmanian Branch) for more than 50 years. Fran Bladel was a woman whose name is synonymous with dedication, resilience and leadership in Tasmania's political landscape. Fran was not only just a politician; she was a trailblazer, a mentor and an advocate who left an indelible mark on our party. Fran Bladel's journey into politics was driven by her deep commitment to social justice and equality. She entered the Tasmanian
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Assembly" rel="nofollow">
         House of Assembly
        </a>
        at a time when women were still fighting for their rightful place in the political arena. Fran did not just occupy a seat in parliament; she broke barriers, challenged norms and paved the way for future generations of female leaders.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fran joined the Australian Labor Party in 1972, and in 1986 she was elected to the House of Assembly as the Labor member for Franklin. Her political career spanned 16 years, during which she held several ministerial positions, including Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Consumer Affairs
        </a>
        , Minister for Administrative Services and Minister Assisting the Premier on the Status of Women. She also served as a secretary to cabinet and as Acting Minister for Education. Fran also served as shadow minister for community services, women and social justice.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a teacher, her passion for education was evident throughout her career. She understood that education is the cornerstone of a fair and just society, and she championed policies that reflected this belief. My state colleague Ella Haddad MP, the state member for Clarke, in her contribution to the condolence motion for Fran in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmanian_Parliament" rel="nofollow">
         Tasmanian Parliament
        </a>
        , said of Fran's efforts on women's participation in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
         ALP
        </a>
        :
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In 1977, Fran established and led the work of an ALP committee to review how affirmative action strategies could be adopted within the Labor Party to increase women's participation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In 1978, she co-authored a study which surveyed the electoral consequences of the limited number of female Labor MPs in Australian parliaments. This work was foundational in establishing the affirmative action targets that we adopted later in the Labor Party. The Tasmanian branch … was the first branch to nationally adopt these targets in the 1980s …
       </p>
       <p>
        Over time, it moved to 50 per cent, ahead of all other ALP branches.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2003 Fran was awarded life membership of the Australian Labor Party and in 2006 she was inducted into the Tasmanian Honour Roll for Women for her service to government, education and the community. Even after her retirement from politics in 2002, Fran remained an active member of the Labor Party, passionately supporting young people and serving as secretary of the Bellerive-Howrah branch for 10 years. Throughout her time in parliament, Fran was unafraid to tackle socially unpopular issues. She chaired inquiries into the sex industry, the control of weapons bill and even explored the use of cannabis for medical purposes and the legal recognition of significant personal relationships long before these topics became mainstream.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fran's influence extended far beyond the walls of parliament. She was a mentor to many young women, encouraging them to pursue careers in politics and public service. Fran knew that representation matters, and she was determined to see more women at the decision-making table. Her mentorship has had a lasting impact, inspiring a new generation of female leaders who carry forward her vision of a more inclusive and equitable society. Fran's legacy is also one of resilience. She faced challenges with grace and tenacity, never wavering in her commitment to the values she held dear. Whether she was advocating for workers' rights, standing up for vulnerable communities or fighting for gender equality, Fran did so with courage that inspired all who knew her.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fran passed away on 5 December 2023 at the age of 90, leaving behind a legacy of commitment to the betterment of others. As I reflect on Fran's contribution I am reminded of the importance of her work. We must carry forward her commitment to justice, equality and fairness. I remember Fran Bladel not just for what she accomplished but for the way she lived her life, with integrity, compassion and an unwavering belief in the power of public service to make a difference. Thank you.
