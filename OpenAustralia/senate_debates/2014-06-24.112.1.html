         </a>
         (No. 5) 2013-2014

        seeks approval for additional appropriations from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_Revenue_Fund" rel="nofollow">
         Consolidated Revenue Fund
        </a>
        of just over $337 million.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I now outline the significant items provided for in this Bill.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        First, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Prime_Minister_and_Cabinet" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet
        </a>
        would receive just over $169 million in funding to enable the Department to undertake the functions and activities that were transferred as a result of the Machinery of Government changes in September and amended in December 2013.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        transferred responsibility for over 150 Indigenous programmes and activities to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_the_Prime_Minister_and_Cabinet" rel="nofollow">
         Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet
        </a>
        to enable a consistent approach to Indigenous policy and provide an opportunity to eliminate duplication in these programmes. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet now also has responsibility for the Offices of Women, Deregulation and Best Practice Regulation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Second, this Bill would provide the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Defence
        </a>
        with just over $58 million, reflecting three matters. Those are: supplementation for Operation Southern Indian Ocean; Defence real estate sales and foreign exchange movements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On more general matters, this Bill reflects the current names of Government Departments, consistent with the Administrative Arrangements Order of 18 September 2013. For example, the Bill proposes appropriations for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Industry" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Industry
        </a>
        , instead of the former Department of Industry, Innovation,

         Climate Change

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Details of the proposed expenditure are set out in the Schedule to the Bill and the Portfolio Supplementary Additional Estimates Statements tabled in the Parliament.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        APPROPRIATION BILL (No . 6) 2013-2014
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         Appropriation Bill (No.
        </i>
        <i>
         6) 2013-2014
        </i>
        , along
        <i>
         with Appropriation Bill (No. 5) 2013-2014
        </i>
        which I introduced earlier, are the Supplementary Additional Estimates Appropriation Bills for this financial year.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill seeks further approval for appropriations from the Consolidated Revenue Fund of just over $972 million.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The majority of the amount in the Bill relates to the Department of Defence. This Bill would provide the Department with just over $603 million, reflecting three matters. Those are: expenditure brought forward into 2013-14 from the forward estimates to assist with the purchase of foreign military assets; supplementation for foreign exchange movements; and the re-appropriation of amounts between Appropriation Acts to better align with Defence's current work programmes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill would also provide the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development with just under $295 million for off-network roads projects, where milestones have been reached earlier than anticipated.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Another $40 million relates to amounts for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Agriculture" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Agriculture
        </a>
        for drought concessional loans under the drought support for farmers package.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Details of the proposed expenditure are set out in the Schedules to the Bill and the Portfolio Supplementary Additional Estimates Statements tabled in the Parliament.
