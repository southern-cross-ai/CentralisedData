         I seek leave to amend amendment (1) on sheet 8026, which is currently before us, by inserting after '29 November 2018' the words 'expressions of interest' and the words 'be awarded', so it would now read: 'before 29 November 2018, submit expressions of interest, tender for and be awarded building work funded, whether directly or indirectly by the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority'. To assist senators I have circulated a revised sheet 8026, which does include this amendment.

          The government supports the amendment moved by Senator Hinch with the revised form of words he has outlined this morning. We understand that there are concerns in relation to whether this covers the undertaking of work on projects that are tendered for during this two-year transitional period. I can confirm that this will be the case.

               The first two clauses of these amendments are something that Senator Hinch has worked on. I commend him for it. They relate to broadening the scope of the objects of the bill, to add the words 'encouraging youth employment with an emphasis on engaging apprentices,' which is a very worthy objective, and I think it puts a focus on the bill.
              </p>
              <p>
               I will spend more time speaking in relation to examination notices and AAT oversight. These amendments maintain the current administrative oversight for the use of coercive powers. An Administrative Appeals Tribunal presidential member will be required to issue the examination notice, rather than the ABC Commissioner as the current bill allows. This is a safeguard against any misuse of coercive power. Other associated provisions from part 3, chapter 7, have also been incorporated.
              </p>
              <p>
               These amendments addresses some concerns about the coercive powers in this bill, although I note that coercive powers are used in other pieces of legislation with the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
                ACCC
               </a>
               , ASIC, APRA, but it is important to note that the coercive powers are not new. In 2012, under the former Labor government coercive powers were retained, with safeguards, for the FWBC. One of those safeguards was oversight by the AAT, which required an AAT presidential member to issue the examination notice.
              </p>
              <p>
               These amendments also clarify that a person who is the subject of an examination notice does have the right to a lawyer. There have been countless times when I have heard senior members of the opposition say that this bill takes away the right to legal representation. The text of clause 61(4) of the current bill states :
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               A person attending before the ABC Commissioner, or before an assistant, as mentioned in paragraph (2)(c) may be represented by a lawyer if the person chooses.
              </p>
              <p>
               It seems pretty clear that there is a right to legal representation. However, to make it abundantly clear, these amendments will change the wording to read:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               The person may, if he or she so chooses, be represented at the examination by a lawyer of the person's choice.
              </p>
              <p>
               I think we can all confidently say that, without a doubt, someone who is the subject of an examination has the right to legal representation and to choose their own lawyer. There are also amendments to ensure that the AAT presidential members appointed to issue examination notices continue to do so when the

               is established. I am very happy to answer any questions in respect of these amendments.

                I am just beginning to wonder why this government, for three years, held a position of moving from the Fair Work Building Commission act to the bill that they have here, which has been amended, amended, amended and amended again. Why did we have these three years of rhetoric about the need for all these changes in the Fair Work Building Commission when we are really back to the legislation of the Fair Work Building Commission.
               </p>
               <p>
                We support this amendment. We would rather go back completely to a position where workers get a fair go in this country and you do not have the code denying workers access to negotiate on reasonable terms and conditions in the building industry—the same rights that workers in every other industry in this country have and are being denied to building and construction workers. I just do not get it. I just do not get this government. There were three years of saying, 'This is absolutely essential to restore law and order in the building industry,' and then they cave-in—anything to get a win; anything to get a position where they can say at the end of the period, 'We have got our
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABCC" rel="nofollow">
                 ABCC

                bill through parliament.'
               </p>
               <p>
                This is not the ABCC bill that the extremists in the coalition want. This is not the ABCC bill that the Abbott crew would want. This is still a bad bill, but they have been pulled back so much that it is an absolute embarrassment for them from where they were with the hard-nosed rhetoric that they were on about. We will support this amendment, but we will be continuing to push a proposition that workers should be able to negotiate and bargain on the same issues as every worker in the country—that is, including building workers. They should have the right to negotiate and bargain on exactly the same terms and conditions as every other worker in the country.

                Senator Xenophon, there are the statements that both you and Senator Hinch have made about the worst public servant in the country, Mr Nigel Hadgkiss. I hope that the government starts to listen about having a biased person there. We should just get that fixed. We will support this, but we have other amendments as well.

                     <p>
                      Clause (16) of the bill will be amended so that the functions of the ABCC commissioner's function, to the extent that it is possible, are carried out in an impartial manner across all building industry participants. Clause (20) of the bill will be amended to include additional reporting requirements in the annual report. This amendment will increase transparency and accountability and also require the annual report to include details of compliance activity against building employers—something that is not done now. The level of accountability under the current framework as proposed is not satisfactory, and I am pleased the government is prepared to agree to these extra accountability and transparency measures.

                     <p>
                      Clause (21) of the bill will be amended to include a requirement for the ABCC commissioner to uphold the

Clause (28) of the bill will be amended to include an additional ground of failing to act impartially between all categories of building industry participants.

                     <p>
                      I have said what I have had to say about the importance of impartiality. These amendments actually do something about it. They actually give a remedy if someone is behaving egregiously and in a partial manner that is not being fair to all building industry participants. I commend these amendments that I move with my colleague Senator Hinch.

                       This is what I call the 'Senator Cameron amendment' and I think it will hold the commissioner more accountable. The commissioner will not be able to cherry-pick in future—to use my old grandmother's line again, what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander—and we think this will toughen things up. Maybe the commissioner will now have to get a diary.

                         <p>
                          We need to understand what is going on here with the
                          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_Code" rel="nofollow">
                           Building Code
                          </a>
                          . We do just need to reflect on the Fair Work Act. The Fair Work Act may not be perfect—that would be our starting point—but it does give protection to people's rights at work. I would even say it is a step to making Australia a fairer place. That is why we just need to consider what is going on with this amendment and with the Building Code in that context. The essence of the Fair Work Act does say that employees and employers can bargain about their conditions for their workplace. The really important aspect of it is that once they reach agreement those conditions have the force of law. That is the centrepiece and that is what the government is essentially trying to knock out—to absolutely destroy how industrial relations work. That is why we need to identify that essence of the Fair Work Act.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Let's remember what we achieve when we have that act in place, and what can end up having the force of law behind it: the hours of work, supporting apprentices and the issue of casualisation—one of the biggest problems facing the workforce in Australia. And then there is the contracting out that is going on. There are so many areas of our working conditions that are negotiated and that is why we need to ensure that this amendment is supported.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          As a matter of basic principle, if an agreement complies with the Fair Work Act, that should be enough. The Fair Work Act already has a number of strict requirements about what can and cannot be in agreements. A Fair Work Commissioner is required to vet every agreement before it is approved and ensure it complies with the laws. That is why the Greens support the amendment and we urge that the Senate does so.
