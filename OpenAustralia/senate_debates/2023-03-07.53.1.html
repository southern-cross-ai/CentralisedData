        I know two minutes isn't long, but I want to carry on from my dear friend and colleague Senator Sheldon's comments. Senator Sheldon talked about the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TWU" rel="nofollow">
         TWU
        </a>
        's Principles for Fair and Sustainable Standards, a charter that has been signed by Coles and Woolworths, the two largest retailers. It succinctly said that Amazon and Aldi refused to sign up to it. So I want to share with the world—and the chamber—the standards that Aldi and Amazon have refused to sign up to.
       </p>
       <p>
        They've refused to sign up to safety and fairness when committing:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … to being accountable for safe and fair outcomes for transport workers throughout our supply chains, from the top to bottom.
       </p>
       <p>
        They've refused to sign up to transparency:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To ensure no worker falls through the cracks we commit to ensuring our transport contracts are transparent about the nature of the work, the working conditions and who performs this work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Aldi and Amazon have refused to sign up to Collective Voice, which will:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … empower workers to collectively stand up and speak out on pay and safety in such a dangerous industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        Aldi and Amazon have also refused to sign up to education and consultation. The others have said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We will ensure ongoing systematic worker and management education and training, and supply chain consultation with the TWU to improve safety and sustainability.
       </p>
       <p>
        This pair of corporate insults—I won't say the word that I'm really thinking!—have also refused to sign up to lifting industry standards, which:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … commit to working with the TWU to pursue industry initiatives that will improve work practices and seek to eliminate arrangements that provide financial incentives or pressures to engage in unsafe practices—
       </p>
       <p>
        as Senator Sheldon touched on.
       </p>
       <p>
        And listen to this, Australia! Aldi and Amazon have also refused to commit to any disaster planning. And with what this nation has seen, what with flooding and the pandemic, I condemn Aldi and Amazon.
