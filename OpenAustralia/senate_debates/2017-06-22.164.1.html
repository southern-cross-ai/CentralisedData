        The committee is considering the Australian education Amendment bill 2017 and amendments (1) to (3) on sheet 8177 moved by Senator Hanson-Young. The question is that the amendments be agreed to.

         Just going back to the discussion we were having prior to the break before question time, I want to seek some advice from the chair as to what is the best way to proceed. I think everyone understands what we have done, but just to clarify, I would like to move my amendments (1) and (2) on sheet 8177. We are not referring to amendment (3). That is now going to be moved as a separate amendment as amendment (1) on sheet 8179. I am wondering whether I am able to seek leave to move all three of them together, or whether I need to move the two sheets separately.
        </p>
        <p>
         The CHAIR: I am advised that you have already moved the three together. You should now seek leave to remove amendment (3).
        </p>
        <p>
         I seek leave to remove amendment (3) on sheet 8177.
        </p>
        <p>
         Leave granted.

          I am not going to prolong this overall discussion in relation to a schooling resource body. I think I have given reasonably clear indications so far that we prefer the more independent model that we have proposed subsequently. I appreciate that the Greens are attempting to improve what has been proposed here in government amendments, but our position will be to oppose these Greens amendments and oppose the government's amendments, because we prefer the more independent body that we will be proposing in subsequent amendments. I have also indicated that we are happy to entertain further amendments along the lines of the discussion that occurred here earlier, were these measures to fail.
         </p>
         <p>
          Aside from that, probably the only outstanding issue I have, which I hope the minister can address, follows from the discussion earlier from Senator Lambie about what funding we are looking at for the National School Resourcing Board, I would like to understand where that funding is coming from. Minister, can you take me to the provisions that account for those funds to be made available for this board?

             No, that is right. They will be normally appropriated. It is not funding provided under the Australian Education Act, which, of course, is a mechanism for funding to be provided to approved authorities and so forth. This will be normal government appropriations for departmental or other entity funding, which will be outlined and reflected in MYEFO with the funding for this entity.

              Minister, what I am seeking to clarify, though, is: does this arrangement involve a requirement for additional funds than have already been outlined in MYEFO, given the lateness of these measures, or does this mean that these funds come at the expense of other allocations that have been made prior to the arrangements to establish this board or is there some general appropriation for which additional funding will be found? I want to satisfy the Senate that the establishment of this board is not going to compromise other existing funding allocations within your portfolio.

                Perhaps I can take this opportunity to ask the minister if he is in the position to provide any of the other information that was canvassed in the previous session discussing this bill. Perhaps the clerks could assist me also. I know we made some progress just before the hours motion kicked back in, and we are now on this bill. Was the minister's response to the order for production of documents tabled during that period? I am seeing a no to that, so I will ask the minister again. We are in this ludicrous situation where, under the government's hours motion, we still do not have before the Senate your response, Minister, to an earlier order for production of documents that the Senate endorsed earlier this week. The deadline is now probably about two days old. You told us that you provided a letter to the President responding to that order of the Senate. I earlier asked why the usual courtesy of conveying that information to the senator moving that motion was not satisfied, and I still have no answer or sight of that letter.

                is now following the hours motion that was agreed to between the government and the crossbench, but we are in this farcical situation where an order for production of documents in relation to the consideration of this bill has still not been provided to the Senate. Minister, I essentially beseech you now, because I do not think it is appropriate conduct for the Senate in scrutiny of legislation for there to be an outstanding order for production of documents when we are trying to progress this legislation. Despite all of the cooperation that has been going on here during the committee stage consideration, us taking that step exposes the farcical element of this process. I beseech you, Minister, to at least table that letter during this committee stage consideration so that this Senate is not left in the situation where it does not have a response to an order for production of documents.

                  just indicate on behalf of my colleagues so there is no ambiguity that we strongly support these amendments. Amendments (1) and (2) on sheet 8177 do allow for a greater degree of transparency. They give greater teeth to the National Schools Resourcing Board. The other amendment on sheet 8179 is an one that is, again, an accountability and transparency measure, including for educational outcomes. It is something that I know my colleague Senator Lambie, who is not in the chamber now, has indicated her support for. I think that these are important transparency measures to improve the outcomes arising out of this bill. My colleagues and I strongly support these measures, and I look forward to their passage.

                       That is fine. If the Clerk can assist, we would be very grateful. So far in the committee stage consideration we have dealt with request (2). My understanding was that we then dealt with the cluster of amendments (3), (4) and (6), but I do not see how that is reflected in revised (3).

                      <p>

                       Okay. If we could have the running sheet amended so that we are all in the same place, understanding what progress we have made, that would assist us, I think, in this committee consideration. As the minister said, we are now dealing with amendments (1) and (7), which are essentially the government's amendments with respect to the schooling resourcing body. I have indicated in response to Senator Hanson-Young that our position is that we prefer the greater independence and the greater specificity of our proposed amendments in relation to particularly the review of the

                       , so we will deal with those subsequently. For that reason, we do not support the proposal that the government has negotiated with the crossbench.

                          I am aware that Senator Collins has indicated our position on this, but I would like to take the opportunity to just ask a few clarifying questions around this area, related not necessarily directly to the amendments that the Greens have put but to the broader amendments from the government as well. I know that there are a few people here in the gallery today, and there are a lot of people listening. The mystery of what is going on in the Senate is something that people often express to me when I am out in the general community. So I think what is going on here is really important in terms of the frame for the questions that I want to ask.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          I think that Senator Collins, in her remarks earlier, asked the question: why is there such haste for this to happen now? For people who are watching this debate, who are here in the parliament today and listening to it, it is a great question that does not have a good answer as yet. Why are we going to sit, potentially through the night? Why is this happening now? It is because this government has decided that it wants to push this massive change—this very, very significant change in multiple ways—through the parliament in this period of time before we rise. In my resistance to the hours motion yesterday —the motion to change this process of the parliament and have us sit for all these hours—I spoke about the reason the government is doing that. Despite the way that this Senate is often described in the media as a site of great difficulty in getting negotiations through, getting things settled and getting agreement—the fractious Senate—the reality is that, as fractious as this Senate might be and is described, the real problem that the minister and Mr Turnbull have is that, if they do not get this legislation through here now, what is waiting outside the doors of parliament is an absolutely revolutionary force of the united power of the Australian education movement. Whether it is government schools or Catholic schools, there is huge concern about what this government is trying to do, and the reason they are concerned is that their questions were not given the opportunity to be asked, let alone answered.

                          </a>
                          or perhaps Treasury—to carefully look at and analyse these things. They would have all the power of government to actually look at what is being proposed by this government, give it great scrutiny and then come here to the parliament with a very well considered piece of legislation.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Really good legislation requires very little amendment. Really bad legislation has been poorly consulted on and has been, in fact, made in the absence of consultation with key sectors of the community—I am talking about the government school sector and the Catholic school sector. When legislation is made badly and without that care, we end up with lots and lots of amendments. What is going on here is amendments to amendments, and we have heard the change to the amendments. If you are a little confused up there, I can tell you that I am also confused, and I have the papers down here some of the time, so I can try to figure out what is going on. We had a change to the Greens amendment that just went through from a discussion from Senator Bernardi that happened here in the chamber last night. It is not necessarily a bad change. I was a teacher, so I understand what outcomes from education are, whether it is in a classroom or whether it is a broader issue for the country. But the fact that it is getting made up on the run here in this chamber now is an absolutely telling indictment of how bad this minister's management of this piece of legislation is.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          The problem is that decisions are being made about a funding structure of billions of dollars for all Australian children across this country that has been based on who knows what? As Senator Collins said, we—the whole Senate—have implored the minister. We have used technical means to say to him: 'Bring in the modelling. Tell us what you are using as your basis of evidence for the decisions that you are making and the changes you are making to how schools are going to be funded. Show us the thinking that went on behind this. Show us the numbers that went on behind this. Show us the consultation.' The minister has refused to provide that. It is called an order for the production of documents. We asked for that and the Senate agreed to it but, in some sort of game-playing that sometimes is really prized in this place, a little technique has been used to prevent that very important level of documentation coming into the chamber so that we can have a look at what is going on and critique what the government says are the facts.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          We cannot critique the facts because we cannot even see the facts that they are basing it on. In fact, there may be no facts, and that is a bit of a problem. So this is where we are: we have a government that is saying, 'We are doing a great thing for the country; it is a transformation; it is going to be wonderful', and we have this lovely even, almost soporific, tone of the minister's very steady answers to the questions—except it is a veneer, because, underneath, the decision-making instruments are not being made transparent to this parliament. I acknowledge that the Greens and other colleagues here are trying to do the best they can on the run, but that is not how you make good policy for every child in the country. This is policymaking that affects every single family and every single community. It is policymaking that has the potential, if the bill is passed, to lock in 10 years of a funding mechanism that would be devastating, in my view, in terms of leaving parts of the country behind.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          This minister, and plenty of his colleagues who backed him up, has been going out and saying, 'It was terrible under that Labor lot. They were so bad. They did 27 special deals across the country. Bad, bad people! They shouldn't have done that!' The reason those deals were done in that way is that Mr Gonski, when he looked across the country, saw that there was no level playing field—that some kids were underwater because they happened to have been born in a state where the funding was inadequate. Others were doing pretty well. In fact, the
                          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                           Western Australia
                          </a>
                          n government was doing pretty well in terms of looking after their government schools. So we had all this unevenness across the country. The whole purpose of the Gonski reforms was to do two things—and this is where the government is hiding a lot. The first thing was to get funding up to a point where it was evenly distributed to all children in our schools and young people in our high schools. Then they needed to put extra money on top of that base level, which is the student loadings, and that is the needs based bit.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          The special deals were done to start to push the ones that were really underwater back up so that they could get to a breathing space. They were special deals to make sure that every Australian kid who happened to be born anywhere was going to get a fantastic shot at education when they walked through the gate of any school, whether it be Catholic, Anglican, Islamic, government, independent—it did not matter. That is what it means when it says sector blind. It means children being able to walk through the gate of any school and find a place where they can learn, because there is equitable access to learning opportunities across the country. That is what we were supposed to be getting to. That is not where we are now. It is not where we are going to get to be with the government's proposal, because instead of thinking that it would be good to make it equal for all the students, this minister keeps saying, 'Now we are giving the states the same deal.' That is not much chop if your state is not getting enough to give a proper level of education to the kids. So the 27 special deals were special. They were good and they were important.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          But what we have seen from this government is a whole different sort of special deal. It has nothing to do with equity for children. They are a whole lot of skin-saving special deals with the crossbench for the government. That is what this is about. We will do a special deal with the Greens. We will do a special deal with
                          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Nation" rel="nofollow">
                           One Nation
                          </a>
                          . We will do a special deal, if we can, with Senator Leyonhjelm—I do not know what his position is at this point in time, but he has certainly made some comments about it. That is what has been going on. It is called horsetrading, I think. It is horse trading in here, under pressure, in a pressure cooker of a time right now. That is what is going on here. It is not good legislative practice. We are faced with a bill that has been inadequately prepared and is in great need of serious amendment.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          I ask the minister a series of questions—and I still do not have an answer to the question I asked yesterday: what research is there, what modelling has been done, what evidence do you have that says giving 80 per cent of federal funding to non-government schools and 20 per cent funding to government schools is a good thing to do? Where is the evidence? We have not seen anything.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          My next question: can the minister please advise what is the total amount of money lost due to the unpicking of the system weighted average for all
                          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
                           New South Wales
                          </a>
                          Catholic schools at level 101? Can you advise what proportion of the funding will be covered by the transitional arrangements? Let me just say it again: what is the total amount of money lost due to the unpicking of the system weighted average? I am a senator for New South Wales; I am really interested in New South Wales. I know Senator Collins asked a question similar to this for the other states and territories. What has been lost? Minister, can you confirm that as a result of your primary capacity to continue contribution changes, average non-government school SES 100 loses $438 per student? Could you confirm that? Non-government schools with an SES of 110 lose $800 per student—can you confirm that? What are the proposed arrangements for schools to apply for transitional funding? Have you got a plan? Do individual schools apply, or do systems apply? How will the funds be distributed? Have you got a plan and can we see it? Can you bring it into the light of day? Can you bring it into the parliament so that we can give it some scrutiny before we roll through, in this outrageous manner, into a funding model for 10 years that you want to roll out across this country? Could you give us some evidence and could you provide a little information?
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          We are talking about the authority. I do have the government's amendments somewhere. I know the Greens will critique this in some way, but the government's amendments just made me laugh when I had a look. Not because it is a laughing matter—it is a very serious matter—but because it is done in a way that only the Liberal Party would conceive of what should be done in an amendment. They have gone on about who should be on it. They 'are appointed by the minister'. It is about how they exercise their power. 'Now that we're in government, the place where we belong, we'll control who we're going to put on and who we're going to take off.' Oh, and it is in the 'opinion of the minister'. The whole of the language in here: 'Reviews to be conducted periodically'. The whole of the language used just on this page does not deal with anything about the purpose of the review board, which is absolutely vital. I concur with many of the comments, including those of Senator Hanson-Young, about the need for the deep scrutiny of what is going on, and certainly around checking the outcomes. But we have not got any of that from the government. We have got a lot about how they will appoint perhaps some friends. It is an appointment process to a board of ambiguous status. It is certainly not independent; it is much more under the thumb of the minister. The reason we do not want to go there is because, under the thumb of this minister, we have had terrible outcomes in how the department has been able to communicate with the whole of the broader population.

                              . In relation to why it is 20-80, I would refer the senator to the

                              of the Senate estimates, where that evidence was given and examined in some detail. In relation to the impact of the system weighted averaging and the figures, I went through with Senator Collins only a few hours ago, state by state and sector by sector, what that meant for next year. In relation to impacts for
                              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SES" rel="nofollow">

                              changes, again I would refer the senator back to the exchanges in the estimates and the committee inquiries. In relation to the terms for transitional funding, I understand the draft terms for the transitional funding were tabled as one of the answers to the inquiries and questions that were made.

                              In relation to the amendment that is actually the question before the chair at present, I would highlight to the senator that, if she wants to know what the functions of the national school resourcing board as proposed are, she need only look at the fact that, indeed, they have functions specifically to look at compliance by states and territories with their responsibilities and to look at compliance by approved authorities with their responsibilities. More generally, we have given commitments that, under the other powers that leave more open what their compliance regimes or their responsibilities are, they will look at the SES score methodology and at its interaction with the capacity-to-contribute arrangements. They will then have a look at system weighted averaging, but ultimately they will be responsible for all aspects of the funding regime. Indeed, as a result of some of the amendments that have been adopted already, they will also have the capacity to self-initiate reviews in relation to the funding mechanisms and how those funding mechanisms interact with student outcomes, most importantly.

                               I thank the minister for answering some questions that he crafted—in a pretty crafty way, actually—out of the questions that I asked. He constructed them in a way that provided him with an opportunity to read from a sheet and stick to the scripts that the government has been trotting out disingenuously for weeks. I was here when you gave an answer to Senator Collins about the funding for the board, and you gave some state-by-state information in an extremely speedy way—a set of numbers that you have not had the courtesy to table, that cannot be checked anywhere, that have just floated on the air into the Senate and that you are asking us to just take on trust. Let me tell you, Minister: it is a pretty hard thing to take your word at this point in time when there are so many key people in education—experts around the country—who are saying that you are misrepresenting their views, that you have not listened to them, that you are ignoring their advice and that you are not answering any questions. So pardon me if I have trouble believing the answers that you have crafted to your own questions, let alone your avoidance of the details of the ones that I have asked you to give me a response to.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                               I would like to think that I heard it all, but you actually spoke fairly quickly, Minister, so pardon me if I go back and say that, in the middle of whatever patter we got then, I did not understand what the proposed transitional funding arrangements are. Did you tell me if individual schools or systems apply for that? What special funds are available to what sectors with regard to these transitional funding arrangements?

We have circulated them to get feedback, quite appropriately.

                                       That is a little bit of a beginning of an extraction of information. So there are some draft terms out there. That takes me back to what I commenced with in my contribution afternoon: why are we doing this now, in such haste, when this absolutely vital part of understanding what is going to happen going forward is out with the sector in draft form, not agreed, and actually unknown by key participants in the system? Why should we as a Senate, representing the Australian people, give the government permission to push ahead with this when it is so clearly underdone, so clearly ill-prepared, so clearly out of touch with the educational experts? I put on the record and say to those in the chamber here tonight that the reason this is so bad is that parents will do what has to be done to protect their children from the loss of educational opportunity that is embedded in what this government is proposing here tonight.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                       The minister might be 'clever' enough to get some sort of deal constructed here tonight—and certainly the pressure is going to be coming on from everybody because staying here all night and doing this is a big ask. I am going to stay until it is all done because I am committed to this. But the pressure of that to push this through is really a sign of how desperate this government is to just corral this group of people here tonight and get a big tick on something that is incredibly uncertain and have a massive influence across the country so that they do not have to go out and spend the next six to eight weeks actually talking to the experts and coming up with decent legislation that does not have to be amended on the run. They do not want to have those conversations and they have not shown the capacity to engage in negotiations with either the government sector or the Catholic sector across the country in a way that has bred a culture of trust. Indeed, trust is broken with the education sector across this country to the point where one of the leading administrators of Catholic education, Stephen Elder, has said this is the worst experience in terms of interaction with a government in 50 years, that it has never been this bad.

                                       So we know that there is a draft out there about who is going to apply, but we do not know if it is going to be individual schools or systems. Minister, how will the funds be distributed? On what basis is that going to be determined?

I will reference one more, who I have not referenced before, whose comments are new. Terry Hynes, the former Tasmanian branch president of the

                                        Senator Collins, you can keep going on. You keep saying, 'Why do we need to do it now?' Let me refer you back to the comments of the shadow education minister, Ms Plibersek, on 14 March, where she said:
                                       </p>

                                        Schools are already planning for next year. They are working out how many classes they'll have, how many teachers they need, what sort of special programs they can offer. Except, these schools have no funding certainty. They don't know how much they will have to spend next year.
                                       </p>

                                        Well, the legislation is here. The Turnbull government has put $18.6 billion additional in the budget not just to give funding certainty but to give absolute clarity that there is clear, strong funding growth. We are doing it through a model of clear, needs based funding. Your side can keep going on about what the Labor Party might have done had it magically found an extra $22 billion. That is your right. But understand that the Labor Party are standing in the way of needs based funding. Former union leaders are calling you out now. The Labor Party are standing in the way of giving certainty to Australian schools. You can keep coming in and asking questions that were already answered through the Senate estimates process or the Senate inquiry process or where documents and tables have already been released, but ultimately it just exposes you as doing nothing more than playing cheap politics with this issue.

                                         I love the minister's outrage that he should have to answer questions tonight: 'Oh, it's all been done before; it's all been done before.' That is why all of the school sectors are out there still raging into the night against what the government is about to do! What we are talking about here is very, very important—how will the funds be distributed? I did listen carefully to the answer, and I think it was basically, 'Trust me; it'll be okay.' I think that is what we got out of the minister, in translation.

                                           just read into the record what it actually means when you do not have the student resource standard that I was talking about in my contribution a little earlier this evening. All this talk about money and transitional funding all goes down to what actually gets to the classroom so that the teachers can do the work that they need to do.

                                           Right across the country, the money from the reforms that were advised by Mr Gonski has gone into every school and has made a massive difference. And it has been different in every school, which is great, because principals are wonderful professionals. They know what they are doing. No system is perfect, and there is always going to be the odd aberrant one, but generally we have amazing principals who are leading educational communities across this country. They know what to do when you give them enough money to interact with their learning community. They know what to do. They have been putting in speech pathology; they have been putting additional teachers into classrooms; they have been putting additional support staff into classrooms to help students; and they have been gradually, deliberately, every day, making advances in helping our kids become better readers, better thinkers and better citizens because they are learning and they are getting the resources that they need. So, when the SRS is not at the level it needs to be, there are big problems.

                                           This is what a teacher had to say—and believe me: I am going to trust a teacher who has committed their life to serving children and serving this nation through education. I am going to believe them and what they are telling me every day over the glib language that we are hearing from this minister. The teacher said: 'As a public school teacher, I struggle to keep my classroom at a minimum standard to meet the requirements to teach the syllabus. This weekend alone I spent $133 on stools for my classroom. Why on earth can't my school afford furniture? Because we are so far below the minimum resource standard. The original Gonski

                                           arrangements made me feel secure in the decision to send my own daughter to a public school when she hits school age. I am not confident in this decision, if the local public school is inadequately funded, while the grammar school is able to provide opportunities above and beyond whatever I could imagine in my own classroom. I cannot provide my students with the future opportunities they so very much deserve without the proper funding that will put my students on an equal footing with those from higher socioeconomic areas.'

                                           That is what is happening across this country. Some of our schools are so desperately underfunded, in terms of the student resource standard. I have been in classrooms to observe students and teaching and found that there was only one novel between two children. They cannot take them home and read it, because there are not enough to go around. I have been to parents and friends and parents and citizens meetings where communities that are not exactly replete with cash are raising $10,000 to buy school readers so that their children in kindergarten years 1 and 2 can actually have readers for learning how to read.

                                           The other day I was on a plane with a person who works for Defence. He told me about his partner, a teacher, who spends money every single week buying paper and practical resources to take to the classroom for the students to be able to learn. That is what the money that is going into education is supposed to address—those terrible things that are missing. It is to give schools the capacity to deal with those things and all the extra things that are needed to help students learn. So, the money we are talking about in all these formulas is all caught up in responding to the real challenges that are out there in classrooms.

                                           Minister, I asked you before about the primary capacity-to-contribute curve. I asked you about the average non-government school SES 100 situation. Can you confirm that those students will lose $438? With the non-government school SES 110, can you confirm that there is a loss of $800 per student. Minister, could you possibly advise, in the complexity of all the special deals you are doing here with the Senate, how many different arrangements will you have in place at the end of your dirty deals? You have eight different indexation arrangements for each state government system. I am not sure if the minister is shaking his head at me or if he is having an unpleasant conversation with somebody on the other end. It would be hard to be getting this sort of critique in stereo, I suppose. There are eight different indexation arrangements for Catholic schools, separate transition arrangements for each independent school, transition arrangements for

                                            and Collins are changing over, to explain my opposition to the government's school funding deal, which is before the Senate. I will speak again in support of my amendment, but I think this initial explanation will be helpful. Einstein said that insanity was doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. We all know that paying all teachers more does not improve school education outcomes. We know that governments that spend up big in their first budget don't fix the mess closer to an election. We know that when Liberal governments have adopted Labor-Greens policies they lose Liberal votes but do not pick up Labor-Greens votes. And we know that governments that borrow incessantly eventually cause mass hardship to the people. Yet, on each count, the government school funding deal is making the same mistakes we have seen in the past.

                                            When Labor was in government it was clear that the previous increases in school funding had not improved the quality of school education. Despite this, Labor sent terms of reference to

                                            that did not require his recommendations to fit within the spending envelope of existing spending. Unsurprisingly, Gonski's recommendations call for increased spending. Labor adopted such spending increases as policy, and Labor legislated for these spending increases in the Australian Education Act 2013. In the 2014 budget the Abbott government instead proposed that from 2018 Commonwealth school funding should be increased in line with the

                                            and student numbers. This was a step in the right direction, but the Abbott government never bothered to enact this proposal, so, to this day, Labor's approach remains the law of the land.

                                            The Parliamentary Budget Office has advised me that the existing law requires nearly $20 billion more Commonwealth school funding over the next decade than Abbott's proposed approach. When the Turnbull government proposed to increase Commonwealth school funding, compared to Abbott's approach by $18.6 billion over the next decade, and when Turnbull actually planned to legislate to convert his proposal into law, I was inclined to support Turnbull's legislation.

                                              Yes, I accept your point. I suppose I am using shorthand for the Turnbull government and the Abbott government. That was not intended to be disrespectful to people in the other place.

                                              The Parliamentary Budget Office has confirmed to me that passing Mr Turnbull's bill would reduce Commonwealth government funding over the coming decade by $1.2 billion, compared to what the current law requires. Despite the government's claim that it was increasing school funding, this was compared to the unlegislated fantasy of the Abbott government. I knew that the government's bill was actually cutting school funding over the coming decade, compared to what the current law requires. That was fine by me. The government was also proposing to make small improvements in how funding is distributed, although, in a perfect world, the Commonwealth would provide no school funding, the states would fund students rather than schools and funding would be properly means tested, such that we could jettison the grab bag of duplicative, poorly designed loadings and capacity to contribute calculations of the current system.

                                              But yesterday the government changed. It proposed a further $4.9 billion in Commonwealth school funding over the coming decade and has prepared amendments to its own bill to make this funding boost the law of the land. So now the government is planning to increase Commonwealth school funding over the coming decade by $23.5 billion compared to Mr Abbott's approach. Crucially, this also means that Commonwealth school funding, compared to the current law of the land, is set to increase by $3.7 billion.

                                              Within a day the government's approach to schools has morphed from a spending cut to a spending splurge. This is despite the evidence that school funding does not determine school performance, despite the evidence that fiscal responsibility is required early in a parliamentary term, despite the evidence that adopting Labor-Greens policies does not make Labor-Greens voters vote Liberal and despite the evidence that a government's incessant borrowing eventually causes mass hardship for the people. The irony is that the consequences of this will fall on current school students.

                                              In order to pay current school teachers more, regardless of their performance, the government is burdening today's children with ever greater debt. Might I remind senators that the government's net debt is $355 billion, and might I remind them that each year the government is adding to this debt by running budget deficits. We are spending money we do not have. We are falling into the very spiral of borrowing and debt that Senator Gichuhi so clearly warned against in her maiden speech. How can you, in good conscience, agree to borrow even more money under the school funding deal? When confronted with a Senate that has a dangerous addiction to borrowing and spending, the government should have been prepared to see its bill defeated, but its focus is on the political theatre of a winning vote, regardless of what that vote entails. It is principle-free governing, and it is ruinous for our nation.

                                               I join with Senator Leyonhjelm in many of his comments regarding the fact that throwing money at education does not improve educational outcomes. I suppose Senator Leyonhjelm and I both went to veterinary schools, where there was not an enormous amount of expenditure of capital—and look where we are today, for the evidence of it! I would be very keen to direct him to my contribution last evening in which I pointed out to the chamber the outcomes of a Senate inquiry on teaching and learning that I ran back in 2011. It was at the time when 'Gonski Macro' was out there doing big-dollar things. Our teaching and learning inquiry, whose report and recommendations had unanimous support, dealt with the non-dollar associations: why children aren't learning and why can't teachers teach? It was things like early childhood, influence of the parents, selection of students leaving school, quality of teacher training, the amount of time that trainee teachers had in practicums, the fact that so many of them—over 50 per cent—regarded themselves as not teacher/classroom ready when they graduated, mentoring that was not happening, professional development that was not being offered to temporary teachers because the very ones who needed it might not be there next year, the quality of teacher training, et cetera.
                                              </p>
                                              <p>
                                               All of those matters found their way into the recommendations, and of course the biggest one of all was discipline. And how disappointing: even though at that time we made it clear that teachers would not need to have their name or the name of their school made public, we only ever had one Tasmanian teacher who appeared before us to tell us why he cannot teach. And it is because if a child goes berserk at the beginning of a class then not only does it take him half the class time to settle that circumstance but the other 25 or so children are there shivering in their desks, and how much are they going to learn? That same teacher from Tassie also spoke to us about the fact that so many teachers are being required to teach outside of their area of specialty. Why? Because when so many of them went into teacher training all they wanted to do was phys ed or art, and how many teachers in schools are required?

                                               He told us he was often one class ahead for the teachers who were being required to teach mathematics and science but were not qualified in that space, and he was helping them out by being one class ahead. We addressed all those things, and I support you, Senator Leyonhjelm—through you,

                                               Commission. And I think it is fair to say—and this is my own comment, not a criticism necessarily, but I would venture the opinion—that the department and the minister might even accept that the minister may have perhaps had a greater level of consultation earlier, may have engaged a little bit more with the systems et cetera.

                                               Having said that, I want to put on record my very clear statement, and it is this. When Senate estimates was on, I met, prior to dinner, with the minister's adviser. Over dinner one night, on the final Thursday night, I met with Minister Birmingham and we discussed where I believed the issues lay with the Catholic education system, particularly systemically. I got out of bed at half past three on the Friday morning to get the 6 am flight back to Perth so I could go and meet the head of Catholic Education, Dr Tim
                                               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald" rel="nofollow">

Just to be sure, I committed it to writing, as I promised Minister Birmingham I would do. I sent it to Dr McDonald asking him to comment and criticise if indeed I had inaccurately reported what I understood to be the circumstance. Remember I had nine years as a parent member on the commission. It was a few years ago. I put to Minister Birmingham the requests of the catholic education system out of WA. Dr McDonald said to me, 'The

I am sure my report to Minister Birmingham is probably boring, but if he wanted it to be released I would have no trouble with that. I delayed my report to Minister Birmingham about the McDonald meeting because I wanted to test whether or not what I thought

Then, in response to Dr McDonald's suggestion, by teleconference last Friday I spoke to the head of the Catholic Education Office in Adelaide and two others. His name was Bruno and the other two Christian names were 'Paul'. We discussed at great length their special needs. I said to them that I would again be corresponding with Minister Birmingham. It is amazing how much work you can get done on the plane going between Perth and Canberra, as you know, Temporary Chair!

The requests were these: 'Please impress on the minister that we should preserve the system weighted averaging for a 12-month period. Please don't rush through the proposed

                                               As you know, Temporary Chair, I have never been a person to rush out into the media on issues. I have worked behind the scenes always. But I was so minded, as is obvious on the public record, and I did go out into the media. I did not initiate that. It was the subject of requests. I said to the minister privately—and I repeated it publicly—that if I could not achieve on behalf of the Catholic education system the requests they were making of me I could not give the government my support. My words were, 'Simon, please don't make me vote against the government in my last week in the Senate.' Those were the words I used and they were accurately reported.

                                               So on Monday of this week a meeting took place at my request with the minister and a number of those people about whom I spoke a few minutes ago. It was between Mr Zahra, Mr Crafter, who I think is the chairman of the National Catholic Education Commission, Ms Cronin, Mr Elder, Minister Birmingham and me. We went through those issues again. Questions came up of disability funding et cetera. At that time the minister took on board what the request was and I said to him I would not be going out into the media because I had no interest in going out to the media—I just wanted to get across the line; I just wanted to get what the Catholic system had asked me to achieve. That was it. There were calls coming in and I could have appeared publicly on television and done all the stuff that some of the people around here love to do, but I do not like to do that and I have not.

                                                  Absolutely, Senator Collins—you have my respect. As for the gentleman behind you, we only ever see him. It has come to pass that the minister has been able to accommodate the requests I have made. Last evening, just in case it was not clear, I rose in this place and spoke and I specifically asked him: are you prepared to have the system weighted average retained for 12 months, will you have an independent inquiry, will you include students with disability in it, will you ensure that the outcome of that inquiry, its report and recommendations, are tabled in this place, and will you please tell me the mechanism that will be used to give effect to it. Today my office and I have had phone calls, we have had emails, we have had everyone—very concerned principals, parents and others. This morning I said my staff, 'Gather together my speech from last night and Minister Birmingham's speech in response.' I have shared that with the ones I have had time to speak to; the ones I have not had time to speak to I have sent a copy. Each and every person has either come back saying, 'Thank you, I now understand the scenario,' or they have not responded and I take that to be acceptance because they were so concerned.

The entire state of WA's Catholic system is funded in a co-responsibility, but you and I know how many kids' parents will be paying fees at Sacred Heart in Broome—very few. If Sacred Heart's school board said, 'You little beauty, we're going to grab the 49 per cent, we're going to get out of this co-responsibility fund and we are going to use those funds', you, Mr Temporary Chairman, would know better than most people that Sacred Heart Broome would probably last for about two weeks because the cost of running that school is vastly greater than that sum of money. It has not helped that we now have this circumstance under way.

I do not want to see the poorer schools in the Catholic system lost, but it is my understanding—I do not think I am an unintelligent person—that should these amendments pass, should we have this 12 months of system weighted average retained with a true independent review including those with disability, then the Catholic education system and indeed the other systems—the Lutherans and the others involved in education—will be able to rebuild their confidence, knowing that they are protected for the future. I have only made this contribution to put on record that that is what I requested and that has been accepted by the minister.

                                                   With the Senate's indulgence, I would like to take a brief moment to respond to the points that Senator Back has made. We have listened to those respectfully, even though we are on the amendments in relation to the student resourcing body, and my intention is to move fairly quickly beyond those after I respond to these issues.

                                                   Senator Back, no-one doubts your good faith on this issue. It takes me back to the legislation inquiry—you might have been on the phone at the time—when one of the witnesses, who had earlier on been verballed by the minister, was retreating to the position about how wickedly complex this bill and school funding are. Certainly, you are not an unintelligent person, Senator Back, but I think you did understand the points that I made yesterday. I think it is fairly clear for anyone who understands school funding—and, indeed, someone like Dr Tannock—that what the minister has provided you with is not, as I said yesterday, the full monty. If you are keen to ensure that the full circumstances for the funding of Catholic primary schools is maintained, then you will support our amendment, which will come along later, to preserve the existing capacity-to-contribute arrangements.

                                                   Senator Back, you were not in the chamber earlier today when I was asking the minister to provide figures that would highlight the difference between the $50 million figure—I think it was about $46 million; I do not have the notes in front of me anymore—as compared to the system weighted average arrangements under the existing bill.

                                                     —$46.5 million was the figure. Senator Back, I understand your good faith in this, but, because I am not really sure there has been a fair characterisation of the nature of some of the lobbying or consultations that have occurred here, I want to bring to the attention of senators—and remind anyone listening to this debate about—reports that have consistently been in the media about what the full value of preserving the arrangements that were established under the act would be. I can take you back, for instance, to a report by Tim Dodd on 8 May this year, where he highlights:
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p class="italic">
                                                     … whatever the motive, the impact is that a large, non-government school system—and the Catholic system is the only large one—gets a significant advantage from using the system weighted average. It's currently worth about $80 million extra a year …
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                     Remember, this is in 2017 terms, and the estimates about what that provision provides going forward across 10 years—as Senator O'Neill and I have communicated to you—grows to about $100 million to $150 million a year. This is why yesterday I said I was pleased that you have achieved some improvements, but it is not what the Catholic education system was fully seeking when they were talking about a review of the
                                                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SES" rel="nofollow">

                                                     and the maintenance of existing circumstances until the occurs.

                                                     Because, earlier today when I asked the minister for figures that would demonstrate that difference to the Senate—he still has not provided them—he said they are interconnected. The system weighted average issue is connected to the formula used to calculate capacity to contribute, and that is connected to the SES. So, for the minister to respond to you, Senator Back, by only partly addressing that and maintaining the provisions in the bill that change the capacity-to-contribute formula, he puts the cart before the horse. He is making a unilateral change with no genuine policy basis because it produces savings. That is what he is doing. As I said, the estimate for 2017 is probably $78 million. It is about $2 million less than what was reported by Tim Dodd back in early May. This is not new information. It is not new issues that the Catholic education system has come forward with. It is an interconnection between those two factors that have been informed and understood in the canvassing of this issue for some time now.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                     Senator Back, I think all of us will be genuinely grateful that you have succeeded in closing that gap a bit over half. As you said in your comments a moment ago in your responses to archbishops and others, 'Sure, there will be damage in terms of the system'—I think I am quoting you accurately. That is true, and we should not pretend otherwise. There will be damage because this moratorium that was canvassed is not a full preservation of existing arrangements under the model, and I do not think we should pretend otherwise. I do not mean any disrespect to you in highlighting that point, but I think it indicates a lack of faith by this minister in his dealings with stakeholders. He has been operating the executive by leaking material to the press about what he is doing in a very inaccurate fashion. You have talked about the advice you would have given about the fantasy figures and the school funding estimator. Unfortunately, the minister has not been prepared to give any assurances about not maintaining that arrangement. He has not satisfied anyone following the detail of this debate about how he could rebase the figure for 2017 on a formula that will never apply to 2017. I am still quite embarrassed for the
                                                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Education_and_Training" rel="nofollow">

                                                     , because I think the approach he has taken has compromised their credibility, and I think it leaves the Public Service in a very poor position. Indeed, it may well be well something I take up with the Public Service Commissioner.
                                                    </p>

                                                     We may have argued today that we should have a schools resourcing body and that maybe that will help us remove the politics out of how some of these issues are managed. This is indeed reflected in the amendments we are dealing with here. How these matters have been conducted is no reflection on you, Senator Back. You have operated with the highest integrity every step of the way, but, unfortunately, this minister has not satisfied your demands. I know that you have got the best that you believe you will be able to get—and that is quite a legitimate position to reach—but I would encourage you, if you want to demonstrate to all that you understand how the capacity-to-contribute arrangements and the existing model apply, to support our amendments that would preserve the existing capacity-to-contribute arrangements in the act. Frankly, Senator Back, I am not hugely confident of those amendments because I know the Greens party has a different position on them. But, if you want to indicate to this government and to this minister that you do understand that there has been poor faith in their dealings, that is how I would demonstrate that point. We will be coming to those amendments later.

                                                     Before we come to those amendments, I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the broader interest of the community at large that there has been in the consideration of this bill. Whilst the committee stage process has been contracted, and we are here now at this hour, the number of letters and emails coming in expressing messages, clarifying points and expressing support for the principle position that a number of people have taken in this debate is something I have not experienced in the past.
                                                    </p>

                                                     Yesterday we had representatives of independent schools in the gallery. Today we have a slightly different story here to the usual. We have the Barnardos Mother of the Year in the gallery, because she is concerned and interested in how this legislation is progressing. Selina, I welcome you to observing this debate and understanding how the Senate is highlighting the issues that have not been properly canvassed in the minister's selective representation of school funding to the community at large. I know that Selina Walker understands how the Catholic education system operates and the sort of co-responsibility that Senator Back was referring to before. She understands, as Senator Lambie did, how that co-responsibility works and assists many Australian families—so much so that in that her case she organised forums here in the
                                                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">

                                                     More importantly, I think, contributing to this debate is a mother who understands the education of children and the importance of the unique Australian education system, a system that currently accommodates low-fee non-government schools doing a great job and in many areas doing the only job. The point that I made before about the nature of our school education system—Senator Williams will be interested in this—is that in some regional and remote areas the Catholic parish school is the only school. In many places they and the public school work closely together with their local communities, and they essentially meet the accessible, affordable education needs of that whole community.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                     This is what you understand, Senator Back, and Selina Walker understands is being compromised by this minister pushing through new fee arrangements in the model. What this minister is saying to parents in low-fee non-government schools is, 'Under our model we now expect you to pay more.' If the SES model is reviewed and a more appropriate formula is put in place, in another 12 months that might help preserve the cliff that happens next year. The Catholic education systems may be able to absorb the shock of some of that change until such time as that review occurs.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                     But we do not know how effectively those school communities will be able to absorb that shock. The minister has not done the modelling; he has not provided us with the information; all we know is that he is persisting in changing the capacity-to-contribute formula in the model despite ongoing reports and requests from stakeholders across the board. In persisting to do that he is not meeting the commitment that he gave that he would continue existing arrangements for low-fee parish Catholic primary schools. They are going to get a whack in the next financial year unless this Senate agrees to withdraw those provisions from the bill and meet the good faith that senators such as Senator Back and Senator Lambie and others have injected into the discussions here and the minister actually does what he said he would do.

                                                      I wish to make the following statement in relation to this important piece of legislation. I believe that these measures will be beneficial to students in Australian schools. What has been negotiated with the crossbench over the past few days has led to an increase in funding commitments of almost $5 billion to a total package of $23.6 billion in additional spending. The fact that the Gonski reforms will be implemented as they were intended to much more quickly, over six years rather than 10, is a very good result for students and teachers around Australia. The amendments moved by my colleague Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, which were passed earlier today and which I strongly supported, have now given more accountability and transparency powers to the National School Resourcing Board as well as powers to ensure that educational outcomes can be monitored. These amendments have strengthened my views on the importance of this bill being passed. No bill is perfect, but this package of reforms will deliver significant improvements for the education of our children across the country, including in my home state of Tasmania.
                                                     </p>
                                                     <p>
                                                      I want to make it clear to my colleagues that I strongly support this bill, I will not be persuaded otherwise and I will not be moving from my position. I have heard everybody out. I have been doing this for months. This has been agenda item No. 1 for my office. There is a lot more that has to be done in our education system—right from the bottom—but this is the best way to do it for this funding and for the way that this model has now been designed. I have total trust in Minister Birmingham following through and making sure that the board and the people he puts on that board do the right thing. I am very grateful that he is putting more people on the board so that there is more diversity. So we have one of two choices here: we can either sit here and keep going all night, or we can do the right thing and let our staff go home. It has been a long week. The game is over. It is now time to get on with it. It is time to look after the future of the kids of this nation.

                                                        As senators are well aware, after the lengthy debates that have been had, the government proposed that, in applying consistency across Australian schools, we would deliver 20 per cent of the schooling resource standard to government schools across every state and territory—the schooling resource standard being the needs based model that the Gonski report helped to develop, which ensures different loadings and different support for students based on different levels of disadvantage. Whilst the deals that had been done previously provided for a very different level of support from the federal government across each different state and territory, the Turnbull government brought down a proposition to say that we wanted to see every state and territory reach 20 per cent of that schooling resource standard by 2027 over a steady 10-year period, taking the state that got the worst deal,

                                                        , and bringing it up to be on level-pegging terms with the jurisdictions who got the best deal, so that everyone was treated equally.

                                                        We similarly proposed, reflective of the historic nature of schools funding, with the federal government providing the lion's share of funding to non-government schools and the states providing the lion's share of funding to government schools, to bring the non-government schooling sector up to 80 per cent of the schooling resource standard. That ensures, with just one or two exceptions, that every schooling system across the country sees growth over that time. It does, though, see around 350 separate stand-alone independent schools transition down to 80 per cent of the schooling resource standard and maintenance that we have discussed in relation to circumstances for the

                                                        The amendments I have just moved, which are now before the chamber, will accelerate the transition period that the government has proposed for all of those schools and systems who are below the 20 per cent and 80 per cent shares. It will not have any impact on those systems or independent authorities who are above the 20 per cent or 80 per cent shares. It will ensure, though, that those who are below that will transition to that common share of 20 per cent and 80 per cent over the next six years. By 2023, we will have every government school system in the country being treated equally, fairly, by the Commonwealth government according to the Gonski formula. By 2023, we will see all of those underfunded, non-government schools and systems treated equally and fairly and transition to a common formula of the Gonski funding. This is really important because it delivers certainty, fairness and equal treatment along the lines of a needs based funding model.

                                                       <p>
                                                        The result of this is that we will see growth in terms of funding additional to that which had a ready been put in the budget papers—growth of around $1.5 billion over the budget period and around $4.9 billion over the next 10 years. That is additional funding to help transition all of those schools, all of those systems, to the common 20 per cent and 80 per cent shares faster. It has benefits across all schooling systems in Australia—government schooling systems and non-government schooling systems, including the Catholic system, other systems and stand-alone authorities. It delivers additional funding faster. But there is an important caveat to that. In the long term, because it is helping all schools to reach that cap faster, once those schools reach their 20 or 80 per cent share they will then move ahead based on the indexation within the legislation. In the long term it does not have any structural impact on the budget from 2027 and beyond but it does ensure that schools reach those targets much, much sooner.

                                                        I commend these amendments to the Senate. They are a significant change and they absolutely help in the mission the Turnbull government brought forward with this legislation to ensure consistency of application of the needs based model across the country. They help to do that much faster than was the case previously. They have been advocated by many different parties and stakeholders during the Senate inquiry in particular, during much of the public debate and during consultations with the crossbench. I acknowledge and pay tribute to the various crossbench parties who have helped with this. Senator Lambie has just spoken passionately about the fact that it is not just about the money but how we make sure the funding is used as appropriately and effectively as possible, especially for kids in schools where there are enormous challenges and difficult circumstances to overcome. Senator Xenophon and his team have worked hard to bring forward the transition arrangements. Senator Hinch and Senator Gichuhi's commitment to make sure there is equitable treatment and it is achieved as soon as possible has been very strong. Senator Hanson and her team have made sure that, through this, we do not lose sight of a focus on ensuring that quality efforts around teaching and teaching reforms are absolutely pursued, as states and territories have previously agreed to do.

These are amendments that absolutely enhance the Turnbull government's reforms. They build upon them. They make them stronger. They will deliver greater support, and faster, to the schools who need it most. I commend the amendments to the chamber.

                                                         I can indicate—somewhat wryly, I have to say—that Labor will be supporting these amendments. Why I take that approach, I suppose, is that I reflect on the government's response to when we had a six-year transition plan and indeed all of the political statements at the time about how it was not fully funded because the funding was not fully provided in the forward estimates over four years—and here we have pretty much the same type of plan. Labor is going to take the responsible position here and accept the improvements that the crossbench has been able to achieve, but again I highlight that response in comparison to the former response of the current government, when we had the six-year transition plan under Gonski 1. We may be talking different quantum figures here, but the pretence that it involves funding beyond the forward years is again essentially replicated here. It is not as stark as it was when it was over 10 years, and I am not going to waste the Senate's time in getting the detail of what proportion of the funding is in the first four years. That is the sort of argument that this government has pursued in the past, and it is really not a credible policy position. We accept that there has been improvement in the amount of funding that will come forward and we appreciate the progress that the crossbench has been able to make on that particular matter, and for that reason we will be supporting these amendments.
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                         I do have to indicate, though, that we still fundamentally believe—and this is what best characterises the position we are taking on this bill as a whole—that the combined approach recommended in the Gonski review, rather than this minister's confected Commonwealth-only approach, is going to achieve the best long-term outcomes. I agree with Senator Back that it is best, in dealing with states and territories, to apply the carrot rather than the stick. I will not say much more on that now, because we will get to that in further amendments when we are dealing with the bill and what has been proposed to deal with that, but we believe that is a fundamentally wrongheaded approach. We have done what we could to try to convince the government that the nature of their approach with states and territories was not going to be to the long-term benefit of Australian school students, but we understand that for the crossbench any improvement they could get on what the government was prepared to propose is better than what was originally proposed. Only the future will tell us, and the Schools Resourcing Board will help us in the future understand how effective we have been in dealing with the behaviour of states and territories and how they fund school education.

                                                         As I said, we still fundamentally believe that the 20 per cent for government schools and the 80 per cent for non-government schools is unfair. The impact of increasing the Commonwealth funding level to some non-government schools cannot be described as fair in any sense of the word. The improvement in funding, for instance, to my high-fee independent school, which will apply almost equally under this six-year transition as under the 10-year transition, is not fair when schools such as my local Catholic parish primary school suffer the cuts that are related to the capacity-to-contribute formula changes. It is not fair. I am not going to go into the various schools, cherrypicking examples; I have given you just my local example.

It just so happens that she is attending that school because it is the best local school that meets her particulars. But I have the income that enables me to pay those sorts of fees. Many children in my local area attend the low-fee Catholic systemic parish school that my children also attended. Their parents do not have the capacity to meet the increased fees that will apply if this Senate approves the changes to the capacity-to-contribute formula. Certainly I could, but many of the other parents of children in that school could not. That school includes students from the refugee community. In

                                                         In dealing with this fundamental shift to 80-20, we note that this faster transition time and the cuts to school funding is still almost $20 billion over 10 years if you use our plan as the status quo. Sure, there has been a lot of discussion about what should be the relevant status quo—the Abbott status quo or the Labor status quo—but that point still remains. Sure, there has been a $5 billion improvement in the overall pool, but these significant cuts to an alternative plan to school funding are still there. This will reduce the quality of education that schools can provide. It will affect

                                                         indicated should be the alternative. They said, 'Preserve the existing agreements—continue them on their six-year plan, continue Victoria on its slightly longer plan to a consistent student resource standard and renegotiate with those other states that weren't able to become participating states.' That is what has not happened here.

                                                         The 20 per cent low rate for government schools still means that only 85 per cent of government schools will get to their fair funding level. That is the big concern about this shift. Let me say that again: the 20 per cent for government schools embedded in this bill still means that only 85 per cent of government schools will get to their fair funding level. Because we have not been able to see any government modelling, and I gather the minister still has not responded to the Senate's order for production of documents, we cannot properly understand which those schools are. Where are those schools? We are reasonably confident a fair proportion of them are in the

                                                         . But where is that 15 per cent of public schools that will never reach their student-resourcing standard?

                                                         Hopefully the new student resourcing board will be able to enlighten us on some of those issues. We can look at the more appropriate ways to target policy to help those schools get to an appropriate student resource standard. But this plan still does not get many public schools there. Remember, no state or territory has agreed to increase their funding, and we will get to a discussion later about how feasible the arrangements proposed really are. I have characterised them pretty clearly, I think. They are a stick approach rather than a carrot approach, and Labor fundamentally believes that they will not work. Of course, then we have this perverse situation where they may indeed encourage some states to withdraw funding from non-government schools. This may indeed encourage some states to retreat rather than improve their funding.

                                                         So, Minister, I have just two questions of you in relation to these amendments. The first is: what does this faster transition mean in terms of the share of the additional funding that will go to public schools? You will have heard the concerns that 80 per cent of the additional funding under Gonski 1.0 went to public schools and only 50 per cent of the Gonski 2.0 additional funding would have gone to public schools. So my question now is: what proportion of the additional funding in—what shall we call it? Perhaps I should consult the crossbench. Will we call this Gonski 2.0+?

We have heard, from a number of parties, concerns about how this model might impact on the wage cases and claims of teachers across the various different sectors and states. My question is: what, if any, impact will this faster transition of funds over six years as opposed to the 10-year plan—so, the additional $5 billion—have on the pressures related to teacher wages? If it is going to achieve an improvement and not damage the appropriate reward for good quality Australian teachers, that will be good, but if it is essentially not going to make much difference because the model really is not addressing those issues and the government does not have any other plans in relation to rewarding quality teaching, then that is a point worth understanding.

As you are aware, through the bill there is consideration given to overall wages growth as part of the indexation arrangements.

These of course relate directly to the issues raised by the Greens in terms of making sure that we do not make Australian kids wait an entire decade to get their school resource standard up to something that is appropriate. We know that kids are struggling in schools right across this country and we know that the bulk of underfunded schools across Australia are public schools. They have waited far too long for the injection of money that has been promised and then unpromised and promised again. It is a relief that we finally have some commitment to bring forward the obligations to ensure that our schools right across the country that are underfunded can start to catch up.

                                                               We know that, when the Gonski reforms were originally envisaged, the recommendations of

                                                               and his panel talked a lot about the fact that we had to start putting our schools on an equal footing; we had to put in a lot of effort to get schools that were well behind up to a standard which was acceptable. Of course there are schools that continue to be well and truly overfunded, and the Greens have an amendment that will start to rein in some of that overfunding at a faster rate as well. In conversations with members of the crossbench, with the government and with the opposition I think it is clear that 10 years was too long. I welcome the fact that the government has acknowledged that and I welcome the change as a genuine attempt at a step forward to deal with the inequalities and disadvantages particularly in our public schools across the country.

I think the minister may acknowledge that Senator Collins has been a very worthy adversary for the government—he does—but the important issue here is that whatever differences we have I think there is unanimity in this chamber that this is a package with more money, more accountability and more transparency than it had at the beginning of the process. This is something that Mr Gonski, Ms Greiner and Dr Boston have all said is an improvement, and I want to genuinely thank Senator Collins for her good grace. I understand that there is a very clear line in the sand between the Labor Party and the government, and indeed some of the crossbenchers, on this, but sometimes a bit of grace is lacking in this place and I think Senator Collins showed a great deal of grace in her statement. I appreciate that.
                                                                 </p>

Of course that goes for my crossbench colleagues such as Senator Hinch and Senator Lambie.
                                                                 </p>

That is a very simple question. I am happy with a yes or no, Minister.

I did note that in the minister's opening remarks yesterday he said he would be making amendments but that they would not impact the budget at all. How do you reconcile this increase of $5 billion or thereabouts with your opening remarks?

I indicated that the long-term structural position of the budget would not be affected by decisions the government was taking. Indeed, the impact of these amendments, which bring forward the transition to a common school funding share across the country, do of course have impacts over the shorter-term periods in the budget, but by 2027 the final position remains the same.

I am interested to know whether you raised that issue at any time through your discussions with the minister during consideration on this education bill?

I never said that children with autism would not be in normal, average schools. I said that they should actually have a special classroom. They should have a classroom where they actually have the special attention that they need with the teachers.

Parents are also saying, 'It is a great idea and thank goodness someone has finally opened up the debate on this and actually wants to discuss it.' Anyway, we have had a lot of support today from people who believe this needs to be opened up for debate. All children deserve a decent education, and I think what the government has done in this bill to increase the funding for autism in schools is a wonderful idea. I believe it has gone from approximately $690 million up to $1.23 billion, so that is much appreciated, especially by

I went to a state school and I was bullied. I was not treated properly and I was left out of excursions, to the point I felt like I could die. It was not till mum found me a Catholic school for special kids that I then started to learn properly. I felt accepted and I went on excursions.'

I think it has been political pointscoring. Parents and children have heard these comments. They have been taken completely out of context.

As I said in part of my speech—I wish I had it here to say it word for word—if it were one of my children I would want them to have all the special needs and attention that they truly deserve. Do not throw the baby out with the bathwater. Look at the problems out there. Listen to what the people are saying. Listen to what the teachers are saying. Even the Queensland Teachers' Union admit there is a problem with autism in the classrooms—that teachers are not taught or qualified in how to handle this. That has to be addressed.

I thought Senator Hanson was proposing that children with autism did not deserve an education through the mainstream education system, but we now have a concept of special classrooms. Was that issue of special classrooms within mainstream schools, or indeed the issue of ensuring that children did not go through the mainstream education system, raised at any time with the minister, Senator Hanson? Senator Hanson?

Senator Hanson, you have an opportunity to set the record straight here and make sure that you are straight with the Australian people. Was this part of your negotiations with the government?

Firstly, that question was asked last night in the Senate committee stage. At that time I made clear that such issues were not raised in negotiations with Senator Hanson during discussions about this legislation. In fact, Senator Hanson and I had discussions about a range of issues, as she has noted, in relation to teacher quality. We discussed, indeed, the application of the nationally consistent collection of data on students with disability, and in that we did discuss students with autism, but at no time in such discussions did Senator Hanson suggest that students with autism should not be in mainstream schools. At no time did she suggest to me that we should not be pursuing, wherever possible, inclusive policies.

                                                                            Senator Hanson was interested to understand how the NCCD process works, and I am also very pleased to tell the Senate that, as a result of the amendments just passed in relation to disability funding, the investment in support for students with disability and their families will increase from an estimated $20.6 billion over the next decade to some $21.2 billion over the next decade. That is, of course, a $600 million increase on what was already a very significant increase in support for students with disability.
                                                                           </p>
                                                                           <p>
                                                                            Of course, one of the important features of using the nationally consistent collection of data on students with disability, one of the very important features, is that students are identified in their school, by their school, based on the level of adjusted assistance that is required for those students. In relation to something like autism and its impact in a school environment, it is widely appreciated—I am sure particularly by you, Senator Di Natale—that there are students who have different levels of adjustment and need different levels of support. The NCCD process will allow schools to differentiate and then receive different levels of support reflective of the different needs of those students with autism, just as it is reflective of the different needs of students with disability overall.
                                                                           </p>
                                                                           <p>
                                                                            I do hope that provides clarity and context to discussions, also to how the support for students with disability will operate in relation to this legislation. As I indicated in the Senate today, the government is very committed to ensuring the NCCD process works. We are very committed to ensuring that schools around Australia meet their obligations under the national disability standards. We are very committed to making sure those disability standards keep up with the expectations and rights of students with disability. We are very committed to all of that because we know that extra resources and support—and better targeted support, under the NCCD arrangements—will enable schools and teachers to respond and ensure the right classrooms and resources are available to support students of all needs and in all environments to have an inclusive and successful education.

As I have indicated to the Senate numerous times recently and indeed in public debate, one of the key features that the Turnbull government sought to put in place with the bill that it has brought to the parliament was some means for the Commonwealth to hold state and territory governments accountable for at least maintaining their real share of funding and investment into the future to at least ensure that state and territory governments could not do as some of them have done in the past, which was to take increased Commonwealth dollars with one hand and pocket them with the other. When state and territory governments did that, it provided no net benefit to students or schools; it simply provided a benefit to the bottom line of those stat budgets, which was contrary to the intent of the governments, be they Labor or coalition, making that increased investment. So we put in place those provisions.

                                                                           </p>

The amendment put before us today seeks to put in place a means of holding the states somewhat to account to reach that 95 per cent target for all of them, to put in place a capability for the minister of the day, if the states do not put in increases alongside the increasing Commonwealth contributions, to look at the level of Commonwealth contribution and ensure that it is more proportionate to that state or territory if they believe that the scale of contribution required is in fact not as great as the schooling resource standard would dictate.

They do set into the legislation very clearly a target, and that target is very clear for all to see: achieving 95 per cent of the schooling resource standard across the board. Equally, they do provide capacity for us to negotiate with the states and territories about the achievement of that target and to set terms around that via regulation following those negotiations. I commend the amendments to the Senate. I again note that they were developed in part out of the processes of the Senate inquiry, out of the advocacy of various stakeholders both in and out of this place and particularly out of the work of some elements of the crossbench.

Indeed, here we potentially have that shifting in relation to the ACT and Western Australia.

Minister, having observed at least the public elements of that process, my reflection would be that these amendments are not well informed. We have had the discussion about how well informed was this policy shift from the combined approach as recommended by the Gonski review to the Commonwealth share approach. I remain to be shown anything that informed that shift. I continue only to be told that cabinet determined it, rather than any informed thought, discussion or policy development. Even the Grattan Institute could not assist there.

As I have said previously, it has been very naive to suggest that one size fits all will work in this federation in relation to school funding. I suspect the future will highlight that. I suspect the future will highlight that this attempt to tie states and territories with this stick approach is not going to work either. There has been nothing that we have observed coming out of the ministerial council or coming out of

I say that with regret, but I also say it with the experience of having worked with states and territories across governments of different persuasions to build the nationally consistent data set for students with disability. I have participated in these forums and I know how they can work when state and territories attempt to work together or when states and territories involve genuine consultation and engagement with the non-government school sectors as well. There is nothing in these amendments that gives me any confidence that this process will work or that it will be enforceable in any other way other than public accountability that might be available through the school resourcing board. I have to say that we can have very little confidence that these arrangements will operate that some crossbenchers, particularly, might have been attempting in encouraging the government to establish this.
                                                                            </p>
                                                                            <p>
                                                                             That aside, Labor still fundamentally believes that all schools across the country should move to a fairer funding level than this 75 per cent of the student resource standard. We believe that the 95 per cent that we struck under Gonski 1 was the appropriate level to aim for, and this 75 per cent state, you say, is still not getting schools to the combined level that we need them to be at, especially given my earlier remarks about the six-year transition and the number of schools that under the six-year transition still will not get to the level we need, or the number of public schools in that case, to the level we need them to get to.
                                                                            </p>

This is why Labor worked with states and territories to achieve this. We have had the government, for the last four years, telling us: 'State contributions don't matter; it's up to them. They should be able to do their own thing.' Now, all of a sudden, we are back to an attempt—it is not a realistic attempt; it is not an enforceable attempt. In fact, what is that expression—putting lipstick on a pig? That is probably a better characterisation of what is occurring here, because now, at the last minute, the government is trying to rush through an amendment that seeks to bind state government budgets, with absolutely no discussion or agreement with states and territories and no advice as to how enforceable those arrangements might be.
                                                                            </p>

Given the somewhat glib characterisation earlier from other senators about the 27 different arrangements, I am really not sure that we have moved that far away from 27 different arrangements, with a range of other accommodations.
                                                                            </p>

This is no longer the pure one-size-fits-all arrangement that the minister has told us consistently, for the last six months probably, was his objective. And indeed, Minister, could you answer: why are you allowing the ACT and Western Australia to cost-shift to the Commonwealth by reducing their funding to schools to 80 per cent of the

We obviously seek to ensure, as I indicated before, that no state that is below that target is able to cost-shift onto the Commonwealth. We seek to ensure, though, that every state is treated equally. In terms of your question, I am happy to inform you that our anticipation is that after 10 years, across the states, all government school systems will be receiving one consistent 20 per cent share of the schooling resource standard. Across the states, all non-government school systems will be receiving one consistent share of the schooling resource standard.
                                                                             </p>

It is about seeking to be blind to state boundaries, but in recognition that yes, we want to seek an aspiration of states and territories meeting the schooling resource standard or thereabouts. We have sought to apply this mechanism so that the states—Queensland,

It does get to 95 per cent, because we are seeking to encourage the states towards a 75 per cent share of the schooling resource standard plus the proposed 20 per cent share from the Commonwealth, which, of course, equals 95 per cent of the schooling resource standard.
                                                                             </p>

But we also do not want to undermine the constitutional autonomy of the states in relation to school funding, so this is about creating an incentive. Yes, the states will still be free to set their funding levels, but for the first time the Commonwealth minister will have clear powers and clear reasons to be able to respond if the states and territories reduce their funding, rather than having the Commonwealth minister's hands tied while the states and territories cut their funding, as we saw in the last report on government services data, which was released by the

As a result of the Senate inquiry we put this in our recommendation and over the past couple of weeks we have been advocating for the government to do something to tie the states into the process. I think this is a good step forward and I am thankful that the crossbench has seen the sense in supporting this, as well. It is absolutely important to ensure that we do not have just the federal government doing their part of the bargain, without ensuring that the states are fundamentally tied into this process. We do not want to see state governments crab-walking away from their commitments to education, thinking that in next year's budget, or the year after that or the year after that, that they can cost-shift and find savings in education. We know that state and territory governments routinely do this.
                                                                              </p>

We all know that cuts to education are dumb cuts, whether it is in the schools sector, in early childhood or in our tertiary and higher education sector. Cutting funding to education drives this nation backwards. At a time when they have high youth unemployment, when we have low job growth, when we have an immense transition of the workforce, the absolute last thing we should be doing is finding cuts in education.
                                                                              </p>

                                                                              </p>

In regard to the criteria for maintaining funding, obviously it is a condition of federal funding that states maintain their level—they cannot drop below. What type of indexation rate will that be set at, because, of course, it is in regulation and not in the act itself?

The amendment before us is about the states and territories where that is below 80 per cent or 20 per cent, for the respective sectors—that they grow it. Because it is aligned with the share, the intention is that it, as a share, grows with the schooling resource standard, which is growing by 3.56 per cent over the next three years. Then, the formula indicated in the bill is a composite of 75 per cent wages growth and 25 per cent inflation growth.

Could you please outline what we are going to do to ensure the Northern Territory is protected, given its circumstances. We know that already Northern Territory schools are funded above the 20 per cent share. I would like to hear how the minister intends to ensure that children in the Northern Territory are not disadvantaged.

You would recall that the type of red tape that was being discussed was the idea that every school in the country would have to go through a process of submitting a school improvement plan as part of the funding, a highly bureaucratic process, whereas what we are seeking to put in place here are accountability mechanisms particularly for the states and territories.
                                                                                         </p>

We are also discussing accountability mechanisms so that where states and territories agree to undertake certain reforms, such as they did in response to the teacher quality review, there is some capability for the federal government of the day to ensure that those reforms are actually followed through—in that case, to lift and enhance the quality of teachers, or perhaps the application of the national curriculum in another case or, indeed, whatever else the second Gonski review may discover and that they may agree to.

That means that their funding needs to be applied over the course of the forward estimates, where they are accountable and where the impacts that are going to be on the budget bottom line are displayed to the Australian people. They are not fanciful projections, if I can say that. They are not pie-in-the-sky anticipations of glowing revenues and blossoming economies. They are actually put down in black and white.
                                                                                           </p>
                                                                                           <p>
                                                                                            We know that we cannot rely on the forward projections when it comes to revenue, but we more or less can rely on them when it comes to expenses. If you double the government's estimates you will probably be pretty close to where their expensive programs roll out. However, in this case the government have been sneaky; they have been tricky. This is exactly what they condemned the Labor Party for when Labor were in office: for making an announcement over a decade or more, with expenditure weighted into the latter years so that it did not interrupt or damage their budget bottom line but so they could go out there with spin and say, 'Look at us! We're fiscally responsible!'
                                                                                           </p>
                                                                                           <p>
                                                                                            Well, they are neither of those things. They are not interested in better educational outcomes—either side, to be frank—because the measuring and the statistics are not there. There is no criteria to peel back the layers and to say, 'I'm terribly sorry, you've failed at your school to educate your children properly so we are going to peel back your funding.' And when the government announced Gonski 2.0, which was a political fix—or an attempt at a political fix; whether it works or not!—it was scheduled to spend $1.9 billion in the forward estimates, or thereabouts, and the remainder of the $18 billion in the never-never. This was on the presumption that they would not be in power.
                                                                                           </p>
                                                                                           <p>
                                                                                            That is a smoke-and-mirrors trick! It is exactly what they condemned in Labor, but now they have said, 'Well, we're only spending $18 billion.' But in the blink of an eye, at the stroke of a pen and at the demand of a crossbencher, another $4.9 billion magically materialises. That is another $5 million a week in interest payments that the very people who they are purporting to want to change the educational outcomes for are going to have to pay back for decades and decades to come! They are robbing from tomorrow to prop up their political perils today.
                                                                                           </p>
                                                                                           <p>
                                                                                            There has to be a better way. There has to be a way that we can have confidence, not only in government projections but in government accountability. You should not be able to sow what would be known in corporate takeover parlance as the 'poison pill'. The poison pill is where you lay a landmine so that when someone comes along who does something that you do not really like, or if you think you are going to lose your grip on power, it is going to blow up in their faces.
                                                                                           </p>
                                                                                           <p>
                                                                                            Putting funding out there on a 10-year projection is a poison pill. It is designed to put off until tomorrow the things you need to deal with today. It is designed to ensure that, should you lose your grip on power because of the wisdom of the Australian people, the other mob are going to have to pick up what has been left behind. Labor were experts at this and, quite frankly, the coalition belled that cat, and they did it properly. They said, 'Gonski 1.0 is not a funding cut because the funds were never there in the first place.' Well, I am telling you that with Gonski 2.0 the funds are not there either. They cannot project revenues into the next year accurately. Every year we hear there is going to be a deficit of $20 billion or whatever it might be, or a surplus. In fact, since 2009 we have been told a surplus is just around the corner, but it is yet to materialise and we are now $500-plus billion in debt. And the minister, through the stroke of a pen, added another one per cent to that yesterday. If anyone here does not think that that is completely bonkers and an abrogation of duty, they should not be here. But this is the problem. On this side of the chamber, for this crossbench, success is measured by how much money it can gouge out of the government so that it can pursue its agenda. I think we cannot afford that anymore. Every intervention from the Nick Xenophon Team costs the Australian taxpayer billions of dollars. It is funnelled into their little target measure. We are seeing the same now from others here.
                                                                                           </p>
                                                                                           <p>
                                                                                            Let me be frank: I am very happy to say that I want to save the taxpayers' money. You can get better educational outcomes by making sure the existing funding, or even supplementary funding, is commensurate and dependent on children being better educated. You cannot have people coming out of schools who are not literate or numerate to a sufficient standard. You cannot have them going into university studies and graduating in degrees that are never going to get them a job and never have a meaningful financial or beneficial outcome for them. But it is a great financial and beneficial outcome for universities, because they only care about the students coming in. That is what this bill does: this funding is only about the students coming in. 'We do not give a hoot about the outcomes,' is basically what this government is saying—'As long as you get the students into the schools, you can teach them what you like and off we'll go.' I, for one, say that is absolutely wrong. This is a gross dereliction of duty by the legislators in this place and in the other place. They are spending money they do not have on promises they will not uphold on outcomes that will remain unknown.
                                                                                           </p>
                                                                                           <p>
                                                                                            And so it is time to inject a bit of fiscal sanity into this. The amendments I have proposed here are that the funding will be allocated in accordance with the government's own projections over the forward estimates—in fact, slightly further on than that because we are already into the first year. Basically, they say: 'Yes, the funding is there for the next four years. Then, if you want more funding to pursue it, come back to the parliament and resubmit it again and have the discussion again about the best way forward.' Do not pretend that this is offering certainty or surety for any school in this country, because it is not. At the stroke of a pen, at the change of a government, whoever can negotiate an even bigger, better or worse deal—however you want to describe it—will then be able to change all of this. If you want proof of that, let's remember what Labor did. When the Labor Party were in government, they promised Gonski 1.0 to provide certainty and surety. They guaranteed it would keep going. They did special deals and all of those things. I make no judgement about that. But they promised the schools that there was certainty going forward, and what is happening? We are changing it!
                                                                                           </p>
                                                                                           <p>
                                                                                            There are only two things that are guaranteed in this place: the first is that we will all get kicked out at one point out or will leave; and the second thing is that the government, of whatever persuasion, is going to tax the Australian people more. It is not death and taxes; it is political death and taxes, in this case. The problem we have is that by appealing to the base instincts of schools or dressing these things up in moral dimensions and saying, 'Unless you do this, our kids will miss out,' we are neglecting the true fundamentals—that is, that money does not solve problems and government intervention does not solve problems. In actual fact, government intervention, more often than not, creates unforeseen and untold numbers of further problems.
                                                                                           </p>
                                                                                           <p>
                                                                                            So, if we want to confine them and we want to restore the accountability and the credibility, quite frankly, of politics in this country, we can start right now. We can start now by saying: 'Let's accept that the government's got an agenda it wants to pursue. People want to improve it, change it and modify it as they see fit. But let's hold them to account on the forward estimates so that the spending they want to spend now is on their heads. Then, if they are elected for another term, and in four years they want to do it all again and they think, "Yes, exactly what we said four years ago is perfect; let's do that," they can introduce the same bill and extend the spending on the same trajectory.' But I will wager London to a brick that this funding will not remain in place as it is passed in this Senate—and it looks likely to today—for the duration of the 10 years that they are promising. There is no certainty attached to this bill. The only certainty that can be brought in is by holding the government to account for its promises over the forward estimates in order to stop the funding attached to it then or to allow the government to make its case for the reason it needs to continue or change. It needs to be one of the two.
                                                                                           </p>
                                                                                           <p>
                                                                                            We stand here not because we are against education—in fact, it is quite the opposite—but because we believe that education is the building block of future success. But it has to be measurable and it has to be wise, and we also have to balance it with the prudence that comes with being a fiscal conservative, where you tend not to spend money you do not have. You can invest money in the future, but investment means you have to know what your expected rate of return is. There is no expected rate of return here, except if you are a politician and you are hoping to neutralise a political deathroll by throwing money at a problem in the hope that it goes away. It will not go away. I think the government is more likely to go away than the problem of our education system. This bill does not save it, but what we can do is improve it. We can improve it by putting what is effectively a sunset clause on the funding until the government makes its case in four years time. I know it is not politically popular, and I do not expect too much support, quite frankly, in this place because it would hold too many of them to account.

It is such a good amendment, I wish I had thought of it myself. It is a modest amendment. It does nothing to alter the architecture of school funding. It is neither a Labor-friendly amendment nor a Liberal-friendly amendment. It simply prevents this parliament from binding the next one and the one after that.
                                                                                            </p>

This could come through appropriation bills which are introduced at budget time and at the time of the mid-year budget update and which are routinely waived through parliament. Or the appropriation could come through amending the Australian Education Act closer to 2022 so that it provides some further years of appropriation. This is procedural best practice. It is how democracy should work, and it is a template that should be applied to every other statute that currently provides an enduring appropriation. If this were done, the government of the day, be it Labor or Liberal, would have a chance of balancing the budget. I commend the amendment to the Senate.

We do not support the government's legislation, but we absolutely believe that there should be ongoing funding for schools and that it needs to be budgeted for by the government. To support your amendment would put that significant part of education infrastructure in Australia at risk, so Labor will not be supporting your amendment.

I certainly will not insult you, as you would see it, with any of the comments that the chair may have just quietly muttered before. I can imagine your reaction to that. Senator Bernardi, I appreciate the intent behind your amendment. It is the type of amendment that, were you to want to apply sunset provisions across all areas of government spending, would be a means and a mechanism to do so. As Senator

We should recognise that there is always an opportunity for the parliament to seek to amend and vary spending commitments that have been made by previous parliaments, as this chamber is doing right now. That is the nature of such arrangements.

We have seen state and territory governments, different political bodies and political lobbyists seek to use pressure at different times and junctures to continually push up the level of federal involvement in school education. While the reforms we have passed tonight will grow it, they will also cap it. As we discussed earlier, Senator Bernardi, the obvious impact of getting to a set share and a consistent share across the country is demonstrated by the fact that the 2027 cost estimates do not vary as a result of the amendments that have been made and passed through here during the debate on this legislation.
                                                                                              </p>

It therefore avoids the risk that your amendment may pose that in four years time an argument may well be made for even greater spending to be put through when such matters have to be reconsidered, which would be contrary, I am sure, to the intent of what you have brought to the parliament. I thank you for that.

On the school outcomes front, I would draw your attention again to the provisions in the bill we have brought forward, particularly section 22, that provide some capacity for the first time for the Commonwealth to make some of the funding provided to states and territories conditional upon their following through on some of the commitments they might make. If we are to be, as has become the case over time, a more significant partner in the funding of school education then we also ought to hold state and territory governments to account for the way it is used, to ensure that it does lift outcomes.
                                                                                              </p>

Those types of agreed reforms, which can help lift teacher quality in the future, are absolutely things we should have the capacity to ensure the states and territories follow through on, to get better outcomes in place for school education.

But I will make this point: one of the great things about the public advocacy for particular outcomes in policy settings is—you are right—it does apply pressure. But pressure, as well as causing those who are brittle to flake and crumble to dust, can every now and again generate some diamonds. So pressure can be a very, very good thing. I think pressure in this place when applied to people who are committed to principles and upholding values can be a very, very positive thing. Having a public debate about these things is sometimes in our national interest.
                                                                                               </p>

I think that is the wrong way. I think there is an element of that that has occurred in this respect with the government. The fact that pressure was applied by a section of the school community and miraculously $5 billion was conjured out of thin air for the near estimates and a little bit further on I do not think is good public policy. As I said, $5 billion is a significant amount of money. I am disappointed that the attempts by the Australian Conservatives to put some fiscal sanity back into this place have been rejected, but I am very grateful to David Leyonhjelm of the

It is not the first time I have heard everyone say how important and good sunset clauses are and how they support them but just not on a particular bill and not on their watch. Somehow they should apply to someone else. It is disappointing, but nonetheless I can read the writing on the wall.

Our schools should not entrench disadvantage; they should do the reverse. Every student in Australia should receive their fair funding level, the level they need for a high-quality education.
                                                                                                 </p>

You can look at the government's proposed bill and try to understand those values, but it is not just what is in their bill that matters; sometimes what is not in their bill tells you a whole lot more. Labor's Australian Education Act, the current legislation, enshrines our values up-front. We set objectives and targets: that all students in all schools are entitled to an excellent education and that the quality of a student's education should not be limited by where they live, the income of their family or the school that they attend. The first object of our act was to ensure that the Australian schooling system provides a high-quality and highly equitable education for all students. You cannot find those objects if this bill succeeds, because they are not there.
                                                                                                 </p>

The government's bill has cut a lot of our national targets. It no longer aims for Australia to be one of the top five highest performing countries in reading, maths and science by 2025; for our schooling system to be considered high-quality and highly equitable by international standards by 2025; or to halve the gap between the outcomes of Aboriginal and

Having the Schools Resourcing Board has a range of the advantages that we have discussed, but we should be establishing the standards we hope to achieve under that transition, whether it is six or 10 years. In six years time, we should be able to revisit this issue and say we have not met the objectives that we set or, indeed, that we have. We need to be able to review what has been achieved by these changes and understand what further changes need to occur.
                                                                                                 </p>

That is because this bill removes the reform objectives contained in the act. It removes reform directions around the quality of teaching, the quality of learning, empowering school leadership, providing transparency and accountability, and meeting student need—many of the issues that were previously incorporated in the plans and the National Education Reform Agreement that this government let languish. Finally, Labor fundamentally believes that all schools across the country should move to their fair funding level, 95 per cent of the schooling resource standard, and today I move these amendments to include this object clearly in the legislation.
                                                                                                 </p>

This new approach is a 'one size fits all', Commonwealth-only share approach. I understand that the Senate chamber seems to be determined to allow that radical shift in approach, but let's at least hold the government accountable for it. Let's include in the act the object of what should be achieved. Let's hold them to account in the future about how this poorly-informed shift in approach has not worked.

Every student in Australia should be entitled to their fair funding level. Any funding system that does not include this objective will just entrench inequality and disadvantage in our schools. By removing these things, this bill abandons the objective that all schools should reach their fair funding level of 95 per cent of the schooling resource standard.

Labor does not believe that we should have a school funding system that does not keep the objective of a quality education at its heart. We are calling on the Senate with this batch of amendments to retain the current preamble, objects and reform objectives in the act to enshrine the objective of schools reaching their fair funding share of 95 per cent of the schooling resource standard.

The preamble that is proposed in the bill for the new act is a very clear preamble. It makes plain to all who choose to see it the importance and significance of education in the life of the individual, the importance of a high-quality education to the future of our nation and the role of the Commonwealth in regard to the provision of education—the centrality and importance of that—and, indeed, as a leader in education systems across the country.
                                                                                                  </p>

But it is the Commonwealth's intention that specific targets, as such, ought to be set via the types of agreements that we hope will be struck with the states and territories following the second Gonski review. The right place for time-limited targets is indeed in such agreements, rather than in enduring legislation.

In fact, it is quite sector specific. There is no reason for the arbitrary decision to fund just 20 per cent of the schooling resource standard for public schools and 80 per cent for non-government schools. That is not what the Gonski review recommended.
                                                                                                     </p>

This was clearly detailed in the Prime Minister and Minister Birmingham's media release on the day of the announcement. The government's target of 80 per cent of private schools in 2027 and 20 per cent for public schools in 2027 has no requirement for states or territories to ever increase their funding. The crossbench, in Gonski 2.0-plus, has somewhat attempted to deal with that issue but we have already covered that territory.

So given the discussion about the original six-year transition, the subsequent 10-year proposed transition in Gonski 2.0 and now a six-year transition, we do indeed need to be reminded that the war in school funding has led to a scenario where, some 15 years after the original review of the funding of schooling, we still will have only 85 per cent of public schools there. It is a serious reflection on how inadequately this political process has dealt with these issues.

Most of them do not understand the complexity—indeed 'the wicked complexity' as one witness claims—of this system. But what they do care about is that their school has enough funding to provide a fine quality education for all children. By moving to a Commonwealth-only model that does not take into consideration state funding, children will never receive the same funding no matter which state they live in.
                                                                                                     </p>

In this case, we are seeking to revert back to the combined funding approach that was going to deliver, especially for children in public schools. On that note, I would ask a further question relating to the earlier question I asked about what share of additional funding went to public schools. My question is: of the extra $4.9 billion for the six-year transition, rather than the 10-year transition, how much of that additional funding, which has been achieved in the negotiations with the crossbench, goes to public schools, and what proportion of that additional funding will, under these arrangements, under this shift to a Commonwealth-only share, go to non-government schools?

There is obviously a fundamental difference in that the Labor Party's outlook in relation to school funding by the national government is that it is perfectly reasonable for a national government to decide to favour one state or territory over another state or territory in the way in which the funding applies to that state or territory.
                                                                                                      </p>

We think that is a perfectly fair and reasonable approach. It is what happens in relation to areas such as funding for hospital operations and the like, where, under an efficient pricing methodology, the Commonwealth funds about 45 per cent of the cost of hospital services and the state and territory governments fund the remainder. In this case, it is reflective of the fact that Commonwealth involvement in the funding of state and territory government schools has been increasing over the years. Not that far back it was close to single digits. At the start of the coalition government around 13 per cent of the cost of government schools was contributed by the federal government. That has moved up to about 17 per cent, and the legislation we are passing tonight will take that to 20 per cent, within six years, consistently across the country. What we expect is that we will see consistency of treatment by the federal government across the different states and territories, ensuring, therefore, that

That was a profoundly flawed logic in terms of the types of incentives that it created. These amendments are—amazingly, astoundingly—even more flawed than what the previous government had sought to do. Yes, these amendments seek to put in place a 95 per cent overall funding requirement, but the consequence of these amendments is that, if a state or territory is not providing a share—pick a number—the Commonwealth will provide the remainder, the entire remainder. I am advised that this would mean that, from 2019 onwards—for all schools except those in Victoria, because the Labor Party continues to treat states differently, so Victoria comes in in 2022—if a state government withdrew its funding, the federal government would simply have to top it up to get to 95 per cent of the schooling resource standard. So it removes all responsibility from the states and territories. Previously the Labor Party had sought a situation where there was minimal responsibility on states and territories and reward for those who underfunded. Now they are proposing a situation where there is virtually zero responsibility.
                                                                                                      </p>

Indeed, there was nothing under the act as it stands, until this Senate and this parliament, hopefully, amends it, for the Commonwealth to take action should a state or territory government reduce their level of funding. In fact, circumstances that the previous government put in place were that, as a state or territory approached 100 per cent of the schooling resource standard, if that occurred somewhere, there was a built-in incentive for that state or territory government to keep funding below 100 per cent because, that way, their rate of federal funding would grow faster each and every year into the future than if they triggered that 100 per cent assessment.
                                                                                                      </p>

In terms of the question that you asked, Senator Collins, I am advised that the answer to that is around 67.6 per cent.

Some of those issues were addressed in our amendments relating to the schooling resourcing body, which, indeed, we are not pursuing now given that the Senate has already determined an alternative approach that we found inadequate for a range of reasons, as I have already said—not only its independence but also that it failed to specify a range of the roles that could occur under that body. As the Senate has already determined the other arrangements, we are not persisting with that group of amendments.

I understand the intent of what the opposition is trying to do. However, we feel very strongly that we have to find a better way to ensure that states do not crab walk away from their responsibilities. We do not want to see cost-shifting in education. One of the reasons why we supported and pushed for the amendment to lock states in in the previous amendment dealt with earlier tonight is we are worried, and we know it happens, that states and territories will try and save on their education budgets. Federal, state and territory governments do it all the time, and we have to put in place a mechanism for that to not happen.
                                                                                                        </p>

                                                                                                         We are worried that there is no incentive to make sure that states continue to fund our schools properly. I understand the desire to make sure our schools are all funded properly.

However, this amendment, I think, will undermine that by the fact that you cannot have a state government just pull their funding because it suits them or because they want to fund a new road or something else come election time. They have to be committed to funding our schools to get good quality education in our public system.

We have canvassed this issue several times already during the debate on this bill, so I will attempt to cover a range of key points fairly quickly to reinforce the discussion that has already occurred. Because the SES scores do not seem to accurately assess the ability of school communities to pay fees and changes to the primary capacity-to-contribute curve, many low-fee systemic schools and indeed catholic schools will be hard hit. The government's bill assumes that primary parents are able to contribute more to fees than is currently the case.

This is the cliff that I have referred to. Other changes in this model allow a transition—it was 10 years; it is now six. There is no transition in this shift. The cuts around the ministers arbitrary changes to the capacity-to-contribute arrangements for non-government schools hit straight, hit right up and hit in 2018.
                                                                                                         </p>

Minister Birmingham has presented dodgy figures to try to present this package as increasing funding. These are the so-called fantasy figures that rebased 2017, on the basis of a formula that will never apply to 2017, to try to convince parents that they would get an increase between 2017 and 2018—an outrageous process in public policy administration.

It is pretty clear—indeed, thanks to Senator Leyonhjelm—that Catholic Education was not exaggerating. I have asked this minister to correct the record from question time when he claimed that there would be an increase in sharer funding for Catholic Education. It is in fact quite the reverse—and starkly so.

For some areas of Sydney fees could more than double. Modelling in other states has found the same.

They do not really understand or do not really have the capacity to quickly gauge the impact. But Catholic Education do, and that is why they were cottoning on to the significance of these changes very early on.
                                                                                                         </p>

But now he seems to be trying to conduct surgery and turn them into something else. We value the contribution the Catholic education system makes to Australian education, and we want to preserve it, whereas these amendments, arbitrarily changing the capacity to contribute formula, could seriously damage this unique and valuable element of our education system.

The figures overinflate the starting point for many Catholic schools. So it is no wonder, when parents started looking at that site and trying to understand how it related to the reality in their school, that Catholic Education very quickly pointed out the farce that was involved in setting up that school funding estimator. It appears that the online calculator includes funding figures for some schools that are wrong by more than $1 million. That is how stark this exercise has been.
                                                                                                         </p>

Senators involved in this debate have heard me ask for figures based on the current settings in the act, which the minister continues to refuse to provide. Despite claiming that they have shared some of this information, the data in the current financial estimator tool has never been shared. They are hiding the actual funding for Catholic schools and systems in 2017, as it will reveal the extent of the cuts—the cliff that happens next year.
                                                                                                         </p>

This type of behaviour will not be possible in the future if we get the school resourcing body operating properly, but this is indeed where we are now in respect of this issue.

They will deliver the full-monty, so to speak, in terms of preserving existing arrangements, until such time as the review of the SES occurs. And they will keep the system weighted average as it is currently provided for in the act rather than the new arrangements that the government has proposed under more-general provisions, once again, until such time as an SES review is undertaken, and should then be supported.

I do not dispute for one second that there are poorer Catholic schools across the country that deserve their fair share of funding. But, let's have a look at why those schools are not getting the support they deserve. We know from evidence given to the Senate inquiry and from a number of reports commissioned by the various Catholic schools commissions themselves that the Catholic schools systems have been funnelling money from poor schools to rich schools. They do that because they want to keep fees low across the board. So, poorer families are subsidising richer families and their kids at the more-wealthy Catholic schools. It is fundamentally unfair. There has been an extraordinary display over the past eight weeks in which the Labor Party, purely for politics, has continued to run a campaign to keep entrenched in this system an unfair advantage to Catholic schools across this country. Senator Collins spoke about the funding differences between public schools, Catholic schools and independent schools resulting from the changes to the model. We know that unless there is a change, unless we put in place a genuine needs based model, Catholic schools across this country will continue to get more money at the expense of public schools. That figure of $4.6 billion proves it. It proves what is wrong with the system that was put in place by

A hell of a lot more than they have held in public schools. The protection racket has been in full swing, and these amendments strike right at the heart of what is wrong with this system. If you believe in needs based funding and you believe that public money should fund our public schools, it is time it was cleaned up.

It is not indisputable that the distribution arrangements that have been applied by Catholic education systems have been doing as Senator Hanson-Young suggests. The material that she put before the Senate committee can be challenged in a range of ways that I do not intend to go through in detail tonight. Of course, the first was the Kathryn Greiner 2015 draft, which we have already dealt with. The other report that Senator Hanson-Young provided to the committee and the other document that she tabled equally can be challenged in a range of ways that I do not intend to occupy this chamber's time with tonight. The report, once understood in context, does not at all do what Senator Hanson-Young suggested that it does.
                                                                                                           </p>

Many involved in the school funding debate back at the stage of Gonski 1 reached a consensus because we accepted that we have a unique education system here in Australia that involves, if you compare it to other countries in the world, a reasonably large low-fee non-government education sector. I know some senators, and indeed some education advocates—it is a very small group nowadays, but there are still some—would argue that public funding should be only for public schools. Certainly that is a smaller and smaller group as the years go by. In my case, I was the beneficiary of funding that was ultimately provided to schools that fit the category of being low-fee non-government schools. I can understand Senator Hanson-Young's concerns about the high-fee independent school sector, and particularly those that this government has described as overfunded, according to their 80 per cent model. I can understand the concerns around those. But the school funding wars have raged here in Australia for so long until that settlement that we had during the Gonski 1 period. Eventually, a large number of public school advocates came to understand that basic principle: you did not need to rob Peter to pay Paul.

The reason why the Labor Party has been highlighting the issues around Catholics schools is that that is where there is the big hit in this bill. That is where the impact is, cleverly hidden by minister Birmingham. That is where the big hit is.
                                                                                                           </p>

We're up for that.' We are up for that. We tried it out, as the minister knows, under Mark Latham's leadership. We know what the coalition did at that time. The Labor Party learnt that political lesson pretty well.
                                                                                                           </p>

The government is, because it was this government who ran the campaign about the schools hit list under Mark Latham's leadership, and now they have a hit list of their own. But they are using that hit list as a shield. The shield that they are using that hit list for is—there are not significant financial gains from their hit list here. The 24 schools that were the original set of schools that were regarded as 'overfunded' did not yield significant budgetary gains. The real budgetary gains here come from the changes that the government has made so far as they impact on low-fee, systemic non-government schools.
                                                                                                           </p>

We have been over that several times. This digression into sectarianism again from the Greens is quite concerning. I know that in Victoria, for instance, the

When that electoral impact was felt, they changed their policy in relation to non-government schools. I do not really understand why the Australian Greens do not seem to have understood that this track did not work for you. It did not work in Victoria, and you changed your policy position in Victoria. I can explain to you why you changed your policy position in Victoria. I can tell you the story from my own local parish and my fellow parishioners who live in my street, who have Australian Greens signs on their front lawns. They are the people who have been inclined to vote for the Greens because of your policies relating to social justice issues, but I do not think they will stomach this sectarianism. I do not think they will stomach that at all.

I would have preferred that this debate not go down this path, because I do not think it was very fruitful. In the committee stage consideration, for example, fortunately at the end of the day both senators withdrew allegations around protection rackets and the like, but it is back again in this debate. This debate is almost concluded. I think it would best facilitate the debate if I do not go any further into those issues. Hopefully, following Senator Birmingham, we just simply move on.

I want to put that up front given the exchange and the discussion that we have just had. We recognise the value that Catholic education systems around the country have in the provision of high-quality education in a range of different environments, including environments of particular social disadvantage.
                                                                                                            </p>

Of course, in those circumstances they receive full fee funding under the government's funding model, as is appropriate, recognising that the schools provide public service in that regard that is not available from government systems.
                                                                                                            </p>

We want to make sure that parental choice continues to be available, which is why we have clearly maintained the support for non-government education of all persuasions under these reforms. But we have done it in a way that seeks to ensure consistency in the way they are applied across all of the different non-government education systems, sectors and authorities such that they are all treated in an equitable manner based on their need and the relative capacity and means of their school communities.

I am very pleased to point out that across each state the share of the schooling resource standard will grow for Catholic education systems as it does for many other non-government bodies and as it does, of course, for state and territory government bodies.

So there is growth in terms of the share of the schooling resource standard that Catholic education systems will receive, as will many other non-government-approved authorities, as of course do virtually all of the states and territories see growth to reach their 20 per cent target by 2023 under the amended bill.
                                                                                                            </p>

I have told this chamber many times and stressed publicly as well that of course there is significant growth in funding for Catholic education systems just as there is, again, across government and independent education systems. In relation to Catholic education systems, that funding growth is from $6.3 billion in 2017—and I know senators have heard that figure before. Strangely, Senator Collins challenged what it is that Catholic systems receive in 2017. I will not go through that for each system, because we have done that before, but it is $6.3 billion in aggregate, growing to $9.7 billion by 2027—clear growth over that trajectory. And the amendments that have been put in place to bring forward the reaching of the 80 per cent schooling resource standard share will see faster growth in the earlier years for Catholic education systems as for others who are below that 80 per cent target.
                                                                                                            </p>

That is reflective of some of those circumstances of need that Senator Collins spoke of and that I acknowledged at the outset. Across non-government systems and schools, Catholic education does service more communities of lower means, lower capacity and higher need. At the end of the transition period, as is the case today, Catholic education systems will receive, on average and on a per student basis, significantly more than other non-government education systems or schools receive. In fact, that comparison today is some $8,800 per student in Catholic systems and approximately $7,200 per student in the independent school systems. By 2027, with full implementation of these reforms, it will be some $12,500, approximately, per student in the Catholic systems and approximately $10,800 per student across the independent systems, with them all being treated—as I have said time and again—according to the same needs based funding arrangement.
                                                                                                            </p>

That is a discussion we had earlier in this debate and last night, putting in place measures within the act that clearly define the autonomy and freedom of the systems to operate their own needs based funding arrangements.
                                                                                                            </p>

These are to address some of the issues around capacity to contribute and otherwise that this amendments put in place. We have made some funding commitments specific to next year. It is very important to make sure that we give that certainty, but that we then also have a proper process that will now be in place to undertake such a review of SES into the future. I do not accept the propositions put by Senator Collins about the disadvantage to Catholic education; I have outlined very clearly why there is a strong advantage.

The minister has flagged that he intends to set the indexation factor at 3.56 per cent in the coming years. This is unwarranted. The schooling resource standard is an amount of funding considered appropriate for a student, so it should be indexed so as to maintain that valuation and not accelerate it.
                                                                                                              </p>

A floor for the indexation factor is again unwarranted. The value of the standard should be maintained, not accelerated.

Growth in excess of CPI would only be warranted if teacher productivity improved. Such an improvement in productivity is not a condition of funding under the government's proposal.

Instead, he will need to consider an index of building prices and the growth of student numbers. I commend the amendments to the Senate.

We know that there has been much talk in this debate about the impact of these changes on the disability sector and children in our schools. We have obviously heard the revolting and very unhelpful comments from Senator Hanson in relation to children with a disability. What the Greens want to do is to request an extra $300 million to ensure that we have enough support in our schools across the country for our children with a disability.
                                                                                                                   </p>

Up until mid-yesterday, we were urging the government to increase the amount of money put aside for students with disabilities. We are concerned that, with the larger number of students now categorised, there is not enough money in that fund to go around. It is absolutely essential that we do not cut short support for our most vulnerable children as these reforms go through. So we are requesting, through this amendment, an extra $300 million to support children who are the most vulnerable.

As I emphasised in the chamber before, the rate of funding growth for students with disability is quite significant. The changes that have already been agreed to during this debate have increased the support for students with disability from $20.6 billion to $21.2 billion over the next decade. As indicated, we are also supporting the review and the work in relation to the continuing improvement of the NCCD.

However, we do understand the Greens' intentions here, but the assessment of needs for students with disability in our school system should be addressed properly in a manner informed by the appropriate evidence. Unfortunately, that evidence has not been available to us because of the nature of the process in dealing with this bill, and the limited information that the minister has made available. In the longer term, with an independent—or not so independent—schooling resourcing body, hopefully that problem will be overcome. But simply picking the nominal figure of $300 million is not enough, especially given that the government is not supporting it, which means that even that nominal figure is not going to be provided.

We remain concerned to understand how these new arrangements are going to apply to the additional students and, indeed, to the existing funding arrangements for students with disability. We have serious concerns that this will be rolled out according to the nationally consistent data for students with disability, in a manner which will have quite serious impacts on students—both those that currently attract funding and those that do not. We appreciate that the Greens are attempting additional funding here. I suspect other crossbenchers have also attempted that endeavour. We understand that, unfortunately, that attempt has failed. We would have preferred to have seen the full data about these students with disability—what categories they will shift into across the model, and understand exactly what the additional resourcing requirements for those students would be.

I was not in the chamber during question time, but I listened to Senator Brandis talk about the significant additional funding that is supposedly in these arrangements for students with disability. There is no significant additional funding. Anyone who has looked at this bill and understands the miniscule amount of additional funding that is involved in this area knows that these measures are insufficient and, unfortunately, our students with disability will suffer the consequences of that.

From my experience in this area in the past, it is no better than a guestimate, because of the amount of information we have available. Given that the government is not going to support it and no-one else has been able to secure it, I do not see, in terms of our point of view about what approach should be followed, that simply nominating a figure informs that—more than as an acknowledgement of our statements from the shadow minister,

I was extremely disappointed and concerned to hear the comments from Senator Hanson yesterday in her contribution on how we address the inclusion of children with disabilities in school. So many people have been fighting for so long in this country to ensure that children with disability are included in our classrooms, to build an inclusive culture in schools. We know we are not there yet, and comments like that set us back even further. We know we are not there yet, because I was a very active participant in the Senate inquiry into the access of students with disabilities to school. We found some very distressing facts there, and some very distressing evidence.

You would get some parents who were saying, 'They'll let my children go for a couple of days, but then there's not enough funding to enable them to go for the rest of the days, or there's not enough funding for them to go on the excursions, so they get told to stay at home.' We know this is still happening.

This was 18 months ago—around that time. Parents and teachers were already expressing their deep concern about the NCCD. They were saying, 'When it comes out, don't believe it!' I subsequently had teachers talk to me about the fact that they did not know where their school's data was coming from. Those were teachers who had students with disabilities in their classrooms, and they said, 'We're not contributing to that data. We did the first year, but not since.' I have had that said to me several times.
                                                                                                                      </p>

                                                                                                                       So this data is not reliable. We know from the evidence that the committee collected that there are still serious issues around children's access to classrooms so that they get the best education possible. That is why we need this additional funding. I am not at all confident that there is enough funding available to meet the needs of students with disabilities, so I am pleased that there will now be a commitment to a review of this process. We have had a lot of feedback about the issues around the data—around NCCD and the lack of funding.

Further, schools often lack the required expertise in developing educational programs for students with disability. Limited monitoring and accountability for the learning outcomes of students with disability is also a significant issue. Finally, experiences of bullying and abuse, including restraint and seclusion, are now shamefully common for students with disability in education settings.

This group works day in, day out with students with disability and their parents. I believed them. I know that they are looking out for the best for students with disability, and when they are concerned for funding we need to take that seriously.
                                                                                                                      </p>

That is a flawed argument when you are talking about the need to improve our inclusiveness and make sure that we do provide the best education possible for children with disability.

We are concerned that, in the absence of knowing what these conditions on teachers or states may be, simply leaving that to the discretion of the minister through regulation is not enough certainty for our states, our schools, our principals or our teachers, and we would prefer to see those elements removed. After the Gonski review of these funding arrangements, whenever that reports—at the end of this year or early next year—we can look at what recommendations there may be and what impacts they may have on state and territory school systems. It seems a bit premature to be putting powers in this bill to put restrictions on state and territory school systems without knowing the content of those restrictions. So we would like to have those removed to ensure that we have a full, transparent process going forward for how we engage with the conditions on states, if and when recommendations come from

We know that the previous arrangements put in place by the Gillard government following the first Gonski review locked in growth rates for schools regardless of whether they were above the resource standard. We know that the result of that has been that there are at least 24 well-overfunded schools that do not deserve continued support in terms of growth rates from the public purse. But we also know that there are a number of schools that will get to a much higher level very soon. The government's original proposal before us allows those schools to be drawn down over a 10-year period. If we are serious about putting equity into the system and ensuring that we redirect our quantum of money to those that need it most—if we care about needs based funding—we will ensure that overfunded schools have their funding brought to the appropriate level, down at the same rate as underfunded schools go up. It is only fair that, as you put more money into schools going up towards the resource standard, those that are well above come down at the same rate. It is about using the public money in the most appropriate and efficient way. If we care about our poorest schools, this is what we will do.

Well, here is a way of saving some money. Here is a way of making sure that the money that is needed will go to the schools that need it first and foremost. I implore the government and the crossbenchers to consider this. It is an important demonstration that we are absolutely fair dinkum about needs based funding.

This is about ensuring that we look after our public schools. Currently under this legislation the government is proposing to fund 20 per cent from the federal government, 20 per cent of the share of getting schools up to their resource standard. We know that, in order to look after the neediest schools, the best thing we can do is increase the share of federal government funding to our public schools. We are worried that, in some states, they are simply not going to have the cash to get those schools up to standard in a reasonable amount of time. This amendment would ensure that the federal government does its best to look after all of those schools across the country, our public schools. That must be our priority. If we were to lift the Commonwealth share from 20 per cent it would cost the budget that magical number that we have heard a lot about over the last eight weeks—$22 billion. It is the figure that the Labor Party has banged on about for the last two months. This is the opportunity for the Labor Party to put its money where its mouth is. Prove that you care about public schools. Prove that you give a damn about putting your money where your mouth is. Do not wait until the next election. Do not tell the voters to hold their breath and wait. Fund it now, do it now, put it in legislation and let 's make sure we look after our public schools and bank that $22 billion tonight.

The $22 billion is a figure designed to fully implement the Gonski 1.0 process. The failure of this government to stay true to the Gonski principles is the issue here. So with this shift that other senators appear to have been prepared to accept away from the Gonski recommendations, away from a combined Commonwealth-state funding model, to a sole Commonwealth funding model—the minister's words here are 'a consistent Commonwealth funding model'—is the problem. That is the issue. Simply creating a new arbitrary percentage for state public schools, which is proposed in this amendment, is not going to remedy that problem.
                                                                                                                                    </p>

These provisions involve a fundamental shift away from the Gonski review principles. The work that needs to have occurred with the states and territories has clearly not happened. The partnership that was envisaged with the states and territories clearly has not happened. I would just be repeating myself to highlight our scepticism that great success will occur there given the path that this government has taken. But we will not be supporting the amendments for the reasons I have already outlined.

These reforms, though, absolutely are about ensuring we have consistency, fairness and equity in the delivery of needs based funding. That is what the Senate is happily on the verge of passing. We welcome that. But we do not support the Greens trying to put tens of billions of dollars extra on top of what is already a very significant additional investment.
