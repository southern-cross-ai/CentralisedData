        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Birmingham. The allegations aired on
        <i>

        last night reveal a culture of sexism, cover-ups, abuse of power and behaviour that could constitute a breach of the ministerial standards. These are not issues of the past, as the Prime Minister characterised them today; this culture continues. This is the parliament's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me_Too" rel="nofollow">
         Me Too
        </a>
        moment and it needs a strong response to ensure that women working in this building feel safe. Will the Prime Minister investigate the behaviour of all his ministers for compliance with the ministerial standards, and will he stand aside Ministers Tudge and Porter while conducting such an investigation?

         I echo the words of Senator Payne earlier, in relation to the type of workplace that everyone should be able to expect to work inâ€”whether they're working in this parliament, whether they're working across the Public Service, whether they're working anywhere across the Australian economy or, indeed, whether they're working elsewhere internationally, where Australia advocates for the highest of standards in terms of workplace practices.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is important that we have high standards and that they are adhered to. It's important that we have processes, in terms of the way in which complaints can be lodged, dealt with and handled. That's why I would reiterate that if a parliamentarian or a member of parliament has any concern about a workplace incident then we do have public processes that are available to all staff in this place, to all members of parliament in this place, on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Finance" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Finance
         </a>
         's website as to how they can access support and the process for reporting a complaint.
        </p>
        <p>
         Anybody in this building who feels that they have been bullied or harassed or is concerned about a workplace incident should contact the Department of Finance, who will provide advice, support and assistance. They will also treat all complaints confidentially and thoroughly, which will be investigated independently of government. Employees in this building can also access the Employee Assistance Program, which is an independent, confidential, professional counselling service that can provide staff with assistance in dealing with work and life issues. These are all appropriate responses that have been built over time, that are in place right now, and that I would urge all members to make sure their staff and others across this building are aware of.

           That existing complaints process is little known and too weak. You have to complain to your boss or to Finance, who then require mediation with your boss, and Finance cannot take any disciplinary action against MPs or

            I would urge the leader of the Greens not to undermine the process that does exist, which is independent of government, and does enable a confidential complaint to be raised. It is important that the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Finance" rel="nofollow">
             Department of Finance
            </a>
            maintain those protocols and principles, which they do. Having had the chance, in the last couple of days, and reason to ask questions about how these processes apply, I don't find out as the responsible minister who has made a complaint or who the complaint is against, because the independence is upheld and is of paramount importance through that process. Employees should have confidence in that regard.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would certainly welcome, Senator, if you want to talk to the Department of Finance about their processes, facilitating that type of meeting for you or anybody else across this building to make sure they have confidence that, if there are issues, complaints can be raised and put through the proper process.

              As Attorney-General, Minister Porter will be responsible for the government's response to the Australian Human Rights Commission's Respect@Work sexual harassment inquiry. Does the Prime Minister think Australian women can have confidence that these recommendations will be implemented by Minister Porter?

               I am sure the government will respond to that inquiry in the usual way, which involves consultation across all of the affected areas of government when it comes to such reports and responses to them. That will include consultation with Minister Payne's department and others that are relevant in responding to such inquiries.
