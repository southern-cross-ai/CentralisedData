        I felt it fitting in my contribution this evening to pay tribute to someone who was a hugely significant figure not just in the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reg_Withers" rel="nofollow">
         Reg Withers

        , who served in this place for almost 20 years, including as

        , passed away in Perth.
       </p>
       <p>
        Reg Withers' path to the Senate is historically interesting. Many may be unaware that, prior to 1977, section 15 of the Constitution required that senators appointed to fill a casual vacancy had to subsequently be elected at the next general election as a means of confirming their appointment. Reg Withers was chosen by the parliament of Western Australia in February 1966 to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Sir Shane Paltridge, who had been Minister for Defence in the Menzies government.
       </p>
       <p>
        When new Prime Minister Harold Holt called an election in November that year, it meant Senator Withers had to face the people. Unfortunately for him, despite the strong result for the Liberal Party overall, the Senate vote in Western Australia fell and, consequently, he was defeated after only nine months in the Senate. That could have been the end of the story. But, showing the resolution and tenacity for which he would become famous, Reg Withers fought his way back and was re-elected as a senator for WA at the half-Senate election of 1967.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a senator, he downplayed his own ambition and ability, telling

        newspaper:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        "I'm just a boy from Bunbury," he says. "I'm not a clever man. They're much too smart for me, these Canberra blokes who are supposed to manipulate power."
       </p>
       <p>
        The boy from Bunbury plainly failed to give himself enough credit, because when the Liberal Party went into opposition in 1972 he became its Senate leader. In so doing, he placed himself at the centre of one of the most tumultuous and significant periods in Australian political history.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just a couple of weeks ago, with the passing of former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, many reflected on the events of 1975 which led to the dismissal of the Whitlam government. I think it is fair to say that for all of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Fraser" rel="nofollow">
         Malcolm Fraser
        </a>
        's determination, were it not for Reg Withers November 1975 would not have panned out as it did. As Senate leader, it was Withers to whom Malcolm Fraser delegated the task of keeping the coalition senators voting together to block supply. This was no easy task—there were a number of senators who were uneasy about the policy and could have cracked at any time. It was Withers' skill that held them together and his adroit deployment of charm, cajoling and conviction enabled the Liberal Party to prevail.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course, Reg Withers himself later felt Fraser's ruthlessness. His dismissal as Minister for Administrative Services in 1978 over a seemingly trivial matter angered a great many of his friends and colleagues. Reg Withers himself later wryly contrasted the situation with his own experiences serving in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Navy" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Navy
        </a>
        . In the Navy, he said, he always knew that if the ship got into trouble the captain would make certain his crew was saved—whereas in politics, he noted, 'the captain is the first one over the side and takes all the life boats.'
       </p>
       <p>
        On several occasions in the years that followed, the man who had once enforced party discipline crossed the floor to vote against the Fraser government on legislation that he felt ran contrary to Western Australia's and the nation's interests. He was not afraid to stand up for his beliefs. Withers noted:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is no use just having one chamber echoing the other—that is a waste of both time and money.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite his obvious political skill, Withers never again held ministerial office and retired from the Senate in 1987. He announced his retirement and flew to Perth immediately because, as he told one journalist, farewells and valedictories 'are not my scene'. However, his commitment to public service endured, and he was later elected

        of Perth in 1991, serving for three years. Mr Withers participated in one of my preselections—and I like to think that he supported me!
       </p>
       <p>
        I extend my sympathy to the family and friends of Reg Withers. I hope all Western Australians will note that with his passing our state has lost one of its most enduring, charismatic and independently-minded political figures.
