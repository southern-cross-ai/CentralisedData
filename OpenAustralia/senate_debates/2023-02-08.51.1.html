       <p>
        I rise to pay tribute to two late stalwarts of the Western Australian Liberal Party, Fran Weller and Michelle Bower, whose contributions and very special personal qualities will long be remembered.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fran Weller's life touched a great many people, not least of all me. Often, Fran's friendship or associations touched several generations within families. Fran's remarkable life and her many interests were such that very few of us would know until her death the full extent of her work and dedication to others. There was her teaching family—Fran having taught in Jerramungup, Harvey and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Norcia" rel="nofollow">
         New Norcia
        </a>
        ; at John Willcock College, in Geraldton; and in Clarkson, in Perth's northern suburbs. Among her pupils were future politicians and future football stars, and her long teaching career was such that, to the surprise of some, Fran more than once found herself teaching the children of her former students.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are some wonderful tributes from her teaching colleagues, and I'll share some lines from letters to Fran from the John Willcock College principal, Julie Campbell. Julie Campbell said of Fran:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The program that you work with provides many of our students at risk the opportunity of experiencing success in a small group situation. That they feel comfortable in your groups speaks for the fact that you always strive to provide a warm and inclusive environment for your students.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I know that the staff who have worked closely with you have very much appreciated your willingness to share your experience and knowledge and many of them have often felt that they can bring to you their personal problems as well. That is not on any job description you will read.
       </p>
       <p>
        That summarises Fran perfectly—always going beyond in whatever she did.
       </p>
       <p>
        Others knew Fran from her commitment to farming and the farming communities in which she lived. All students, fellow teachers and community members valued Fran's warmth and generosity and her clear views on matters. For me personally, Fran Weller was a steady and wise counsellor. I met Fran decades ago. As a young man—a young Liberal—in a hurry, Fran was an encouraging and always reassuring presence. It was a generosity and warmth that blended her country style with the general support and reassurance a teacher brings. I liked Fran greatly. For me, I was never left unsure about when I was on the right track or, equally, when in Fran's view I may have found myself in a political cul-de-sac. Every word from Fran was from her heart; every word from Fran was one you could trust.
       </p>
       <p>
        The WA Liberals, at least from the outside, can sometimes look like a strange and unwelcoming bunch of people. On the inside, though, it's best understood as a family. With the passage of time, and on occasions such as Fran's passing, we are reminded of the virtues of being in a family like the WA Liberal Party. Fran was an emblem of all that is good and noble about the WA Liberals. Fran's presence and participation enriched the Liberal family.
       </p>
       <p>
        People like Fran are a rare but greatly cherished type of person. She was someone whose sleeves were always rolled up. No was task too great, no task was too small. Fran was as comfortable organising the local branch of the division as she was stewarding the party as a state vice-president, as the chair of a committee or as a state councillor. After decades of selfless service, Fran and her husband, Greg, were properly recognised with a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritorious_Service_Award" rel="nofollow">
         Meritorious Service Award
        </a>
        presented to them by the then prime minister, Mr Tony Abbott.
       </p>
       <p>
        Above all else, Fran was a wife, a mother and a grandmother. Some of us knew Fran as 'Greg and Fran', a term of endearment that painted a picture of teamwork in the couple, who first met in Waroona in the 1960s. In Greg's own words to me before the funeral, he said, 'It was a marriage made in heaven.' I was honoured to join Greg and his family at Fran's funeral recently in Waroona. I was particularly privileged and honoured to be asked to give the eulogy, which has shaped this contribution in the Senate today. Although tremendously saddened which Fran's loss, we are so grateful to have in our own unique and very special way our lives touched and shaped by such a wonderful lady. We are reassured that she is now at peace—no doubt with a few views of her own—with our Maker.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another member of the WA Liberal Party to sadly leave us has been Michelle Bower, heavily involved in the Fremantle and later Nedlands branches from 2013. Here I'd like to share with the Senate the words of my friend and fellow Liberal Michelle Boylan, who made a heartfelt and touching contribution at Michelle Bower's funeral:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Michelle was a beautiful woman … incredibly caring and thoughtful. While small in stature, Michelle was strong in character, not afraid of hard conversations or letting you know when she did not approve of a party matter or policy. Her discernment was an incredible character trait.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Michelle had a strong and dedicated work ethic and was always supportive. Often, turning up out of the blue with a smile, treat, hug or a word of encouragement, and her timing was always perfect.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Michelle was a great champion for the women in the Party both as an active supporter and contributor to the Liberal Women's Council. Michelle served the Party right to the end, phone canvassing for Celia (Hammond) in the most recent Federal election while terminally ill, which speaks to her character, one of kindness, integrity, strength, and her beautiful ability to put others first.
       </p>
       <p>
        I echo the sentiments that it was a genuine honour to know Michelle Bower—who served us so well, even when facing her own adversity—and to enjoy her friendship and her support. There's no doubt she will be greatly missed. Again, I send my condolences to Michelle's husband, family, and friends.
       </p>
       <p>
        To these very special Liberal ladies, I end by simply saying: thank you.
