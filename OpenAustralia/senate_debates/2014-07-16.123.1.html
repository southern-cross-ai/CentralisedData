        My question is to the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women, Senator Cash: I refer to the government's failure to produce substantiated data that demonstrates the impact of the 2014 budget on women. Given the lack of data, can the minister confirm

        modelling that has identified that unemployed single parents who are predominantly women will lose $54 a week as a result of the government's budget?

         I thank Senator Moore for her question. In relation to women and the policies that this government has, I can inform the Senate of one thing: this government will deliver on policies for women. Unlike the former government, who, when it came to policies for women, liked to talk but failed to deliver.
        </p>
        <p>
         Let me give you an example: under the former Howard government, the gender pay gap was 14.9 per cent—it was still too high, I assure you. What did it get to under the former Labor government and, in particular, former Prime Minister Gillard?

                     I am talking about budget impacts on women and, in particular, single parents. As I was saying, when you fail to include superannuation in your Paid Parental Leave policy, that is hardly delivering for women in this country. When you have a gender pay gap under a former Prime Minister—

                      , I ask a supplementary question. The minister has actually mentioned part of my question, on superannuation. I refer to the government's decision to abolish the low-income superannuation contribution, which we know assists 2.1 million women. Given that women currently retire with half the superannuation of men, won't abolishing the LISC further exacerbate the gender superannuation gap and leave women more vulnerable in their retirement?

Despite your rhetoric, despite the questions which you come in and put to this side of the chamber, under your government, under Prime Minister Gillard, the gender pay gap in this country reached an all-time high of 17.6—

There is delivering on superannuation. You want to talk about the low-income superannuation guarantee, which you have asked before. You clearly did not hear my answer. That was based, Senator Cormann, on the promise of the revenue raised from the mining tax. How much did they promise? Billions upon billions. How much was actually raised? Next to nothing. Those on the other side can come in here and they can make all the claims they like. But I can tell you: the facts will stand up every single time.

                           , I ask a further supplementary question. I assure the minister I am having no difficulty in hearing her answer. It has been proven that women are harder hit by debt and take longer to pay off interest charges, often due to their family responsibilities, which impacts on their access to education and career opportunities. Given this evidence, can the minister further confirm that women are likely to be more disproportionately impacted by the government's extreme higher education changes?

We cannot help it if you do not like the answers that we give. In relation to women and choices, let me tell you what this government is doing. It has had a

                            review into child care, because we understand that women are often unable to make choices because of the lack of proper child care in this country—unlike those on the other side, who promised the world in relation to child care and failed to deliver on anything. It is a little bit like, as Senator Cormann said, they had the pub with no beer—they had the mining tax with no money. Those on the other side, when it comes to women in this country, are all talk. But the 17.6 per cent gender pay gap under their government, the failure to include superannuation in a
