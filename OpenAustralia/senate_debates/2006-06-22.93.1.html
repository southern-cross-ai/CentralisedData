        My question is to the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Ellison, representing the Minister for Human Services. Can the minister inform the Senate of how Centrelink is helping parents and people with a disability to obtain work? Is the minister aware of any alternative policies?

         The Howard government views work as a first option and taxpayer funded welfare as a second option. There are many people in the community with disabilities who want to work, and that is precisely what we will be doing in relation to the job capacity assessments when that kicks in on 1 July. We will be looking at around 37,000 customers a year and providing more streamlined and comprehensive assessments for them in relation to their work capability and connecting them to the service that they need. This is an essential part of promoting the self-esteem and personal circumstances of those people who have a disability.
        </p>
        <p>
         Job capacity assessors will have access to a new stream of funding in the job capacity account. The account will allow the

         </a>
         s to fund short, sharp programs to help job seekers overcome work barriers associated with disability, illness or injury. This new arrangement for the job capacity account will commence, as I say, on 1 July this year and funding for the account is approximately $25 million a year for three years. This spells good news for those people who want to find work who have a disability and want to be assessed in an appropriately streamlined fashion.

         While on the subject of disabilities, I want to close on this point: I urge all senators to participate in the Adopt A Politician scheme, which we have in my home state. Senator Webber is a member of that, as are Senator Campbell and I. I understand Senator Sterle and Senator Siewert will be joining the scheme. This is a commendable one where a family with a member with a disability adopts a politician, and you work very closely with that family. It operates very well in

         . I am giving it a plug and I would urge all senators to see it set up in their home states.
