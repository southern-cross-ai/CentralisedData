         I have a series of questions. I was just flagging those when we ran out of time during the last sitting debate on this particular bill. Firstly, can I ask the minister to explain why these amendments are necessary? My take on these amendments—and if you could confirm whether this is correct—is that they move decisions that were previously under disallowable instruments to a point where they are no longer disallowable. Is that a correct understanding?

          In a nutshell, yes. The amendments will make the current trial sites legislatively consistent with the proposed Bundaberg and
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hervey_Bay" rel="nofollow">
           Hervey Bay
          </a>
          trial site. We believe that this will give certainty to trial participants and local communities. In summary, these amendments, as you indicated, move the current content of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security" rel="nofollow">
           Social Security

           Let's just be clear for the committee: that's to ensure that this chamber can no longer consider those measures as disallowable instruments in the way that, for example, during the last sitting we considered some of those issues for the current trial sites. That's what this is about. Then, when you look at community bodies as notifiable instruments—community bodies, so everybody knows, are very contentious in the trial sites that have community bodies, where members of their own community cannot find out who are the people making decisions over their lives, literally. At the moment, as I've articulated in this place, members of the communities cannot find out who the faceless people on these community bodies are and, secondly, whether they exist at all. In Kalgoorlie there isn't a community body, and it's yet to be seen who goes on the community body, if there is one, in the trial site that we are currently discussing. This is what this is about. To be honest it's because the Greens and I have been raising concerns about the way these trials are operating. The government has moved to stop that from occurring by taking these into the primary legislation, as the minister just articulated, which removes and reduces the transparency and accountability of this government on this highly contentious social policy. That's what these amendments are about. I confirm—and it will come as no surprise—that the Greens will not be supporting these amendments.

              Then It might assist for me to put the opposition senators' view about this. We do not support these amendments. This is primarily because we do not support the expansion of the cashless debit card beyond the trials in Ceduna and the East Kimberley. It is also because we are concerned that the changes could reduce parliamentary scrutiny of the trials, where certain changes to trial areas would be enabled through a notifiable rather than a disallowable instrument. The purpose of the trial is to allow scrutiny of the effectiveness of that trial. If presented separately, Labor would support powers for the secretary in relation to reducing the proportion of income that is loaded onto the card. That is something we would be prepared to consider, but while they are clustered together we cannot support the amendments as a whole. We are of the understanding that, in circumstances of technical malfunction or natural disaster, changes could already be made quickly by the minister through a legislative instrument. It is our expectation that the government has the numbers in relation to this amendment. We are not at this stage seeking for parts of it to be considered separately.

               I'm seeking the guidance of the committee. As I flagged, I have a series of questions around the bill itself, not just relating to these amendments. We can either deal with them now or vote on the amendments and then come back to these questions. I'm in the committee's hands,

               I therefore ask the minister, on the amendments, why specifically these amendments are now being moved, if it's not to reduce the ability of this place to look at the amendments and review amendments around these specific issues. Why are you doing it now when in the past you felt that the best way to proceed was to have them as disallowable instruments?

                           I want to check I am understanding Senator Siewert's question correctly. Senator Siewert, you were asking why the secretary doesn't have to satisfy himself that there isn't some adverse personal effect on an individual before they're subject to participation in the trial. Is that correct?

                             The government's view would be that the starting point and assumption should not be, and isn't, that the trial and participation in it is to the detriment of an individual or that it restricts their human rights, so I think we're starting from a different point of embarkation, if you like.

The community have the right to know who's on the reference panel, who will be making decisions on their behalf and whether participants are actually involved in the decision-making.

                                                    Thank you. I'll move on and come back to that, given the minister's response. Going back to the trial focusing on those under 36 on the specific areas of income support: did the community—I'll use the term 'community consultations', though I think I've already articulated my concerns about some of the consultation processes—ask for the trial to be focused on those that are under 36 and on those specific areas of income support?

                                                          Thank you. Could you also outline how many of those that will be impacted by this—in other words, future participants in the trial—were actually consulted—not told and informed about it, because the inquiry heard from people that were likely to be affected by the trial that they were told what was going on but they weren't consulted. But that's, of course, the people that we spoke to during the hearing. What I'm interested in is how many people that are future participants were actually consulted about the trial.

Could you please tell us: will people in the proposed trial site have access to the external transfer facility where the extra $200 per 28 days can be transferred from an Indue account to a personal account that is currently available in the Ceduna and East Kimberly trial sites?

Some concern has been raised with me about the terms and conditions that Indue apply on the card compared to what the government's terms and conditions are on the card. Could I clarify that: are Indue allowed to put additional terms and conditions on people's accounts?

As recently as September of last year, when an extension of the cashless welfare card was being proposed for the Goldfields region, SAS Consulting Group listed Indue Ltd as a major client and actively lobbied the government on their behalf.
                                                                               </p>

However, Larry Anthony, as most people in this place are aware, is the federal president of the National Party. At their federal council in August, the National Party referred to a policy committee resolution supporting the rollout nationally of the card for people under 35 on welfare and those on parenting payments. Also, we note that in here the National Party is, indeed, supporting the government's proposal currently before the Senate. Could the Minister please clarify why the Liberal-National government does not see it as a serious conflict of interest that the company it contracts to administer the cashless debit card was a major client of a consulting group co-owned and run by the federal president of the National Party, a party which is actively attempting to expand the card nationally?

Obviously I do know who Mr Anthony is, but I have no knowledge of his professional engagements. What I can state very clearly is that the organisational National Party, along with the organisational Liberal Party, have responsibility for choosing parliamentary candidates. They do not determine the policy of the coalition government. It is the joint party room of the coalition government and the various other internal processes of the government that determine government policy.

If that was asked and directly responded to at Senate estimates you could supply me with that, but if it hasn't been directly answered. I am asking whether the Indue relationship with SAS consulting was advised to the government and whether the government knew of the relationship between Indue and SAS. They are simple yes/no questions.

Some of the submissions we received in the Senate inquiry imply that Indue imposes conditions on cardholders or applies settings on the card or deposit account products, but, as we know, Indue is not a decision-making body in respect of the functional design of the cashless debit card. All functional design decisions or decisions about particular individual limits are made by the Commonwealth government. If I'm not correct in that, I'd appreciate your, before I go on, just indicating whether I'm correct.

We agreed that the government sets the terms and conditions for how the cashless debit card operates, what the limits are and all those day-to-day events. What I've had a look at—which I'm happy to table, but I'm guessing the department is well aware of this—is Indue's debit card, its conditions and how it's used. There is no reference to the Commonwealth government. If the Commonwealth government is setting the terms and conditions, why isn't that spelled out in the conditions of use that Indue publish?

The reality is that those of us who have spent time in that area—and I have, as the duty Labor senator for that area—have done proper consultation with the community, unlike those opposite. The government made the decision: 'This is what we are going to do. We are going to come in and impose this from on high.'

The federal president of the National Party has been lobbying for this, and Keith Pitt, the National Party member for Hinkler, has been pushing this in the local community.

He faced a by-election, which he contested and won, based on his strong opposition to this. He received an overwhelming vote. The mayor of Bundaberg—as I said, a former LNP minister in the previous Queensland government—was originally in favour of this proposal, but, due to the strong community opposition in Bundaberg, he has now switched his position. So the mayors of the two biggest towns that make up Hinkler are strongly opposed to the plan by this government. When the government say they consulted, they'd already made their decision and now they are trying to force this on the community. They've got no interest in what the best outcome is for the people in Hinkler. All they want to do is continue their ideological obsession. They're not going to do anything to boost the services that need to follow such a decision that they're making in this regard.

Whilst federal Labor have spent this year in Hinkler listening to these communities, the government have done nothing of the sort. They've sent a few bureaucrats, but they've actually sent no-one on the ground who can make decisions, no-one who can listen to those people and make decisions accordingly.
                                                                                          </p>

The fact that the local LNP mayor, who was a minister in the Newman government, has now come out and opposed it shows you that the community has turned against this government and, in particular, this proposal. All the government will do through what they're pursuing—and it's disappointing that apparently some of the crossbenchers have decided to sign up to this—is divide the community. That is all they're going to do, and they're very good at it. They've divided Australians all over the country, and they're going to divide the community of Hinkler as well. And they're not going to ensure that there will be any benefit to the people who will be impacted by this. So this is a terrible decision by this government. It's one that Labor will continue to highlight, and Labor will continue to work closely with the impacted communities.

It's clear that they're not going to get the representation they deserve from their local member, Keith Pitt, or this government, which is completely arrogant and completely out of touch. This is another lacklustre representative effort from the minister responsible here, Senator Fifield.

I would think that they would be able to inform the Senate today what that consultation process was and if there was drafting back and forth between Indue and the government or if the government drafted the document and sent it to Indue. That's the process—the department officials are here, so I think that question should be able to be answered fully.

They feel that it will increase stigma, it will reduce their autonomy and it won't help them pay their bills. It will make it harder for them to live their lives. It certainly doesn't empower them to make financial decisions about what they do with their own money. Is this just an ideological commitment from the government to tell people how to spend their money? There seems to be a disconnect there. I don't think the minister has even been to the region and asked these people what they think.
                                                                                                    </p>

I managed to go and Senator Siewert managed to go. My predecessor, Senator Andrew Bartlett, managed to go, and I hear that a number of Labor senators have managed to go as well. When is the government going to send its minister to this region to actually listen to the community and hear that they don't want this draconian approach to them spending what are already limited funds?
                                                                                                    </p>

Then you are cracking down further on people who are doing it tough and who are doing their best, and who don't need the patronising, dead hand of this painful Liberal government telling them what to do.

The card operates in an analogous way. Clearly, there are differences in the way it operates, which is the purpose of this discussion.

To say that something operates in a similar way is not to say that it operates identically.

I do seem to recall you asking this on a previous occasion when this legislation was through and I was in a similar situation of being not the substantive minister but the minister who's carrying it for a colleague. As on that occasion, on this occasion I will seek more precise advice as to how that particular scenario would work.

At the time we didn't reach a satisfactory conclusion as to how that would operate. I understand that the department has been looking at this. One thing that has been suggested to me is that extra infrastructure has been put in. I'd like a clear outline of how that process now operates such that it is just like using a normal debit card.

                                                                                                                                                            I guess my question is going to the cost-benefit of even rolling this card out at all in the region. I've already noted in my consultations with the folk there—Kathryn Wilkes and Daniel Stafford in particular—that there is no support for this card and, in fact, they are crying out for money to be spent on funding services like homelessness and domestic violence shelters and education pathways and on creating jobs. So my question is: has the department or the minister, or anybody in charge of this, actually done that cost-benefit analysis of funding those support services?
                                                                                                                                                           </p>
                                                                                                                                                           <p>
                                                                                                                                                            Surely they would reap far more social benefits, as QCOSS has pointed out. With the dubious benefits of the card so far, the evidence just isn't there to show that it works. In fact, there's the potential for social harm to increase. Why don't you just fund the services that we know work and help people. Surely doing at least a cost-benefit analysis of that is worthwhile. Is that on the cards? If so, can you tell me anything about it?

The government is committed to both. The first independent evaluation has shown that the card has a considerable positive impact in communities, including 48 per cent of drug-takers using fewer drugs, 41 per cent of drinkers drinking less and 48 per cent of gamblers gambling less. A recent media release from the mayor of Kalgoorlie, where the trial of the card began earlier this year, stated that all the indicators were positive.

So claims there has been a reduction in social harm are just not correct. The ANAO report has clearly pointed that out. For the record, people, please read the ANAO report, because it has shown that there is not the evidence to claim there has been a reduction in social harm. The statistics that were just quoted are cherry-picked from a very flawed analysis by Orima. Read the ANAO report and look at what they said about the data that was very conveniently not included in the analysis: the flawed approach to the survey of participants; the push-polling approach to the participants; and the fact that so many participants have said it's made their lives worse. In fact, when I was in Leonora the other day to discuss the storage of waste and uranium mining, which I'll talk about in the chamber at a later date, the issue of the card was raised with me there. A person who had previously been a supporter of the card is now on the card and, quite frankly—surprise, surprise—it's making their lives more difficult. They are unable to use it satisfactorily. So can we please not keep falsely claiming that this card is reducing social harm, because the evidence is not there to show that it is. At best, the evidence that the government uses is anecdotal. I can repeat many anecdotal examples that people have given directly to me. They have told me of the harm that it is causing them, the difficulty in using it and the many other concerns they have about the card, including being called 'druggies', being stigmatised, feeling humiliated and dealing with the difficulty of managing and using the card. So, please, don't keep repeating just what is handed to you by the government, which at best is basically just anecdotal points.

I'm also concerned that they appear to be drafting the terms and conditions rather than the department doing what I thought would be the government's job, but other people have prosecuted that. I'm interested in the amount of profit Indue is making out of this and, again, whether there has been a cost-benefit analysis of whether that profit would be better spent on community services to help people in that community.

Our understanding is that the government has already paid $7.9 million to Indue. The government has also paid $1.6 million to ORIMA for their research report that has been referred to over the course of the debate. That has been heavily criticised, including by the Auditor-General, for providing essentially meaningless information about the success or otherwise of the program. We understand that the accrued cost of the cashless debit card trial up to 15 March this year is about $24 million for just two sites. Can you confirm that the cost of the trial across the two existing sites is well over $10,000 per person?

The reason I'm interested is that you provided information which you said was based on the operational cost of the card per individual. I suspect that the program cost is greater than that. I'm trying to understand what the overall cost of the program is to government and what that means for the costs allocated per participant.

I think there are real concerns about proceeding on the basis of such limited information. If the minister and, indeed, the government are in possession of information that would provide us with some detail about the kinds of costs associated with this—the value and the cost-effectiveness of what is being proposed—it would assist the Senate in considering the business before us. That is the basis of the previous series of questions asked by me.

What is the government's budget now that the Goldfields has been proceeded with and has gone ahead? Are you just going to keep using the commercial-in-confidence argument for everything when you don't want to tell us what something is costing? The trial has gone ahead. Why can't the government now tell us what their budget is for that area? Secondly, how can you tell us that this is now $2,000 a head when you don't know—and this is what I am taking from what you are saying—how much it's going to cost? How can you tell us it's $2,000 a head?

That's the maximum because, as I've said before, with these tenders it's an 'up to' value, but obviously the government makes sure that it makes adequate provision for what might be required.

I'm not asking for the name right now; I've heard what you've said—I'm not agreeing with it, but I've heard what you said. Can you tell me if there is at least one, if not more, future participants on the reference group?

The Auditor-General has said that the information was of such poor quality that it is not actually possible to say whether or not the trial was effective in any way. Their words, in particular, were:

Overall, there were appropriate arrangements and processes in place. However, the department does acknowledge the issues raised in the report and, where improvements can be made, the department has been making improvements to the trial and process over time and will continue to do so. These improvements will ensure the trial can continue to be effectively implemented and monitored. Senator Storer's amendments will require the government to conduct a review of any evaluation to ensure that the findings are accurate. We welcome Senator Storer's amendment and will be supporting it.

I asked you what had changed in the department following the Auditor-General's scathing review of the monitoring and evaluation program. Your answer indicated that you accepted the Auditor-General's remarks but, in any case, they just confirmed existing departmental practice and you were putting in place arrangements to ensure that monitoring and evaluation continued. That doesn't sound to me like any meaningful or material change to the way the department thinks about these kinds of tasks. My real question to you is in the context of the amendment before us. Senator Storer is asking for serious monitoring and evaluation, and that is an objective that I support not just in the context of this kind of program but in all social policy. My question to you is: what has been learnt from the failures of the $1.6 million ORIMA review—what has materially changed in the way the department will conduct future reviews of this program?

Therefore, at the end of the trial, because no adequate baseline data was collected, it was not possible to evaluate whether or not any changes to people's wellbeing had taken place as a consequence of your intervention. What you've told me is that you've got some better processes in place to gather information about cost. Okay; perhaps that is an improvement. But the core issue that we're trying to test here is whether or not an intervention of this kind makes people's lives better. What is the department doing, in this second evaluation that it has now commissioned, to make sure that that can be meaningfully evaluated? And, incidentally, you mentioned a commitment of funding. What funding has been committed to the second evaluation?

I can't tell you how and when that will happen, but no doubt it will be something which is shared in the context of estimates, committees and other forums of this place. I can't tell you what will be a mechanism in addition to that which the minister may choose.

We agree with Senator Storer that increased scrutiny is certainly needed. The significant flaws in the existing evaluation have been referred to on many occasions in this debate, and an improved evaluation would be very welcome. We will, therefore, support your amendment. But I also wish to place on record my scepticism that it will improve things a great deal. Already $1.6 million of public money has been spent on a failed evaluation. I am not certain that the minister is capable of conducting a successful one.
