        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. Will the minister explain why the Prime Minister branded the story in yesterday's
        <i>
         Australian
        </i>
        about Mr Bob Carr being offered the Senate vacancy and the position of Minister for Foreign Affairs as 'completely untrue'? Does the government still maintain that the story was completely untrue?

         Clearly these questions are best directed to the Prime Minister. I have no personal engagement with them other than in a general sense. I am happy to say that the Prime Minister has dealt with these issues. I am pleased to say that the Labor Party, in seeking to replace Senator Arbib in this chamber and fill his very big shoes, has gone out and tried to engage with its membership to attract the best possible candidates. I am pleased to say that the discussion so far has been focused on a range of very high-quality candidates who would make a real contribution to the Senate and to the government if they were to come forward as the replacement senator. But that is a question that will be determined by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         Labor Party in the normal course of events. Formally, it will be a decision of the New South Wales parliament, as I understand it.
        </p>
        <p>
         Mr Carr would obviously be an outstanding candidate, but he has ruled himself out. There are other candidates such as Mr Mundine and others who are putting forward their names. As I said, I am encouraged by the quality of candidates. The Labor Party is in the process of selecting a quality candidate. Once that decision has been made, they will replace Senator Arbib in the Senate, provided normal constitutional conventions are observed by the New South Wales government. I assume they will be. I know we will get a quality representative to replace Senator Arbib and that they will make a contribution to the government and to the Senate.

                 state secretary in future. He is not faceless because I can recognise him. He has the job of coordinating the selection process in the New South Wales branch, just as the Liberal Party officials do. I run into the national director of the Liberal Party every Tuesday when the party room meetings are on. I do not know why he is always in the building. I always bump into him on the way to our caucus meeting. The Prime Minister will decide the ministry and the New South Wales party will nominate a replacement, and I am sure it will be a quality replacement for Senator Arbib.

I think that turns it into a very broad question, and Senator Evans is well within the broad remit of that completely irrelevant question.

                       , I am just making the point that the opposition has the choice of making unsubstantiated allegations to try to smear various people or of actually focusing on the issues that are important to Australian families. They could ask us about jobs, they could ask us about the economy, they could ask us about health or they could ask us about education, but, no, they make a series of smears, a series of political smart-alec tactics. They have no interest in big policy debates. I suggest that the Australian people will judge the opposition very harshly.
