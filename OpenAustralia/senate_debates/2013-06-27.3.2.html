       <p>
        I also want to take, if the Senate will forgive me, just a short period to acknowledge the contribution of my predecessor, Senator Stephen Conroy. Senator Conroy is a man of great Labor heart, and he has made, and will continue to make, a great contribution in this place. I regret that our work together as a leadership team was as short as it was and thank him for his service as Leader of the Government in the Senate.

         by leave—I congratulate Senator Wong and Senator Collins on their election as leader and deputy leader respectively of the government in this place. I also acknowledge the role of Senator Conroy, who was Senator Wong's predecessor. He was a worthy opponent. I enjoyed our chitchat across the table when others were shouting over us from time to time and I look forward, albeit I do not know for how long, Senator Wong, to us being able to engage in that as well. I also acknowledge the role of Senator Ludwig. Politics is a tough game—a brutal game—from time to time, and, for those who do suffer as a result of that, I just wish them all the best personally.

         may, I might be as droll as to observe that a man in a blue tie got rid of a female prime minister but note that, in this place, a female replaces a man with a blue tie. But we wish them all the best.

          by leave—I, too, add my congratulations to Senator Wong in her new position and also to Senator Collins. I also acknowledge the work and contribution of those who have served on the front bench here in the Senate under Prime Minister Gillard, and look forward to an orderly transition at the end of this week to an election before the end of September.
