        and Energy, Senator Wong. Since the Labor government's first budget four weeks ago, in which the government had no response to the immediate energy price rises, various government ministers have publicly flagged export controls on gas, price caps on coal and gas, a new mining tax and direct energy subsidies to households. Other than publicly floating different policies, can the minister finally provide some certainty to Australians, to industry and to investors by ruling out—

           Don't you think? I thought you'd agree. So other than publicly floating different policies, can the minister finally provide certainty to Australians, to industry, to investors by ruling out intervention that would only make a difficult situation even worse?

            I'm asked a question about policy certainty. I'm asked a question about policy certainty from the coalition. I'm asked a question about policy certainty from the coalition on energy. How many energy policies did they have? Was it one? Was it two? Was it 10? Was it 12? Was it 15? Was it 18? Was it 20?
           </p>
           <p>
            A government senator: Higher!
           </p>
           <p>
            Was it 22? Oh my goodness, 22 policies! And, surprise, surprise, the market said, 'Well, we don't want to invest when we don't even know what the policy framework is.' We saw dispatchable energy out and we had less energy in; prices started to increase; there was a default market offer with an increase. Guess what their great certain policy response was? 'Let's hide it!'

            I'm sorry, Mr Morrison and Mr Taylor. They said: 'We know what we'll do; we'll just hide it. That's what we'll do. That's our great policy response.' Then we come to government and we see the mess and, yes, we are working our way through your mess, which has got worse.

              When we come to government what we discover is a hidden price increase. We discover an energy market which is on the edge. All on top of what is occurring in global energy markets, which Senator Rennick says are irrelevant, but Senator Birmingham stood on this side and told us all about. We will work through this and we will work through this with the states, but nobody on that side can—

                 Unlike those opposite, we do understand the importance of policy certainty and we do understand the importance of working with the states. As the Prime Minister said, I think last night on
                 <i>
                  7.30
                 </i>
                 , 'We will work through these issues, including with the states,' and, obviously, with the National Cabinet. We will work through this with the states, and, of course, it is a difficult issue. We don't shy away from that. We are dealing with a legacy problem, or we're dealing with a global markets problem. What I would say, Senator Bragg, is that if more on your side understood some of those policy issues, I suspect the country wouldn't be in the position it is.

                   said that Australia needs more gas. Why did the government cut supply-side policies in its budget, and can you name one government policy that aims to increase the production of Australian gas?

                    I'm not sure what the minister is referring to—sorry, what the senator is referring to. I gave you a promotion, Senator Bragg! I'm not sure what you're referring to, but I would make a point about gas supply. Between 2014 and 2021, east coast gas production increased—

                      . The point of order is on relevance. The question went to policies, not historical statistics that the minister is referring to.

                        You might not like to know this: despite the 300 per cent increase in gas production, domestic gas prices went up by 420 per cent in real terms over that time. So, the point is, the policies you had failed. That's the point.
