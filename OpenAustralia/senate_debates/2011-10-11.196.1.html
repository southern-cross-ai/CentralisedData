         ) Branch in the Attorney-General's Department has commissioned independent market research to benchmark current awareness and attitudes among the Australian public about violent extremism, and to build understanding of how key audiences are likely to respond to communication activities. Countering violent extremism is a complex issue and a sensitive topic for many communities. This research will inform and provide strategic guidance to CVE communication activities, programs and initiatives.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
