        (a) notes former Senator Day, in his 35 years as a builder:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) built over 10,000 homes,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) directly employed over 1,000 people and indirectly over 5,000 trade contractors,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii) donated millions to charities, becoming known in Adelaide as "the man who gives away houses" because of all the houses he built for charity groups,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iv) sponsored hundreds of sporting clubs, individuals and community groups,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (v) was appointed an officer of the Order of Australia in 2003 for services to the housing industry and to social welfare, particularly housing the homeless, and to the community,

       <p class="italic">
        (vi) later in 2003, was awarded the Centenary of Federation medal for service to housing and charity, and

       <p class="italic">
        (b) notes, in relation to the failure of former Senator Day's business that :
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) all homes under construction are covered by Home Owners warranty insurance, which means any costs to complete the homes will be covered by insurance, not taxpayers,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) many suppliers and trade contractors have credit insurance which will cover much of their losses, and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii) former Senator Day has always agreed to sign personal guarantees, which means he will lose his house as a consequence of the failure of his business;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) congratulates former Senator Day on his commitment to assisting those who have been impacted by the company's closure; and

        (d) thanks him for his service in the Senate.

            Bob Day

            South Australia
           </a>
           . Bob Day resigned from the Senate to deal with the collapse of his housing construction business. Bob Day has very honourably given personal guarantees to his company's creditors, so he and his family will be directly affected by these events. As honourable senators know, there are a number of unresolved issues pertaining to Mr Day's candidacy for election as a senator and his business interests. In those circumstances, and until those matters are resolved, the government will not be supporting the motion.
