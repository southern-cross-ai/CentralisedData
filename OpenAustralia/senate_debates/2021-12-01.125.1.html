             I think that was a great example of one of the things that can inadvertently divide us in this chamber. This Friday, 3 December, is
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day" rel="nofollow">
              International Day
             </a>
             of People with Disability. It is a great opportunity for us all in this chamber to focus on the things that unite us and the achievements that we can all be proud of. This day is about recognising people with disability and how we all support them to realise their aspirations and realise their full potential.
            </p>
            <p>
             The
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
              NDIS
             </a>
             plays a critically important role in supporting 480,000 Australians to achieve their own life goals, just as we all aspire to do. Let me share with you one of the 480,000 individual stories of how the NDIS is changing lives. Mr Kupics from Victoria wrote to me recently and said: 'My support worker and the NDIS funding have provided me with the opportunities I never ever thought I would have again.' The letter goes on, saying how exercise, healthy eating and getting outside to enjoy the sunshine have been completely life changing for him, as it allows Mr Kupics to stay positive and also to continue to work. He also said: 'I can't be thankful enough for my government implementing the NDIS.' On International Day of People with Disability, we unite across the political divide to acknowledge the contribution of people with disability and our bipartisan, in fact multipartisan, support for their aspirations.

                Thank you again for the question. Australians can also be incredibly proud that we were one of the first nations in 2007 to sign the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability. We can also be very proud that we continue to lead the world in implementation. Again, the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
                 NDIS
                </a>
                is a great example of this as a world-first scheme that promotes dignity and respect and puts participants at the heart of decision-making about their own lives and about what they aspire to achieve. Choice and control mean that NDIS participants are more able to participate in our community and in society both economically and personally and also to live their lives independently. The Morrison government is committed to ensuring that the NDIS endures and continues to deliver for the 480,000 participants and also for their families, whose lives have been changed by this scheme.

                   has been transformative for hundreds of thousands of Australians with permanent and very significant disability. It's also important to remember that it not only changes their lives; it also changes the lives of their family and those who love and care for them. Being a world's-first scheme, there were bound to be teething issues with a scheme still being designed as it was rolled out to welcome hundreds of thousands of individuals into the scheme. But, with eight years experience behind us now, now is the time to again work together to mature and to evolve the scheme.

                   I would like to thank the states and territories and also, in particular, the disability representative organisations for their engagement on a wide range of issues and reforms to continue to improve the scheme. I will shortly be bringing forward a bill for the Senate to consider to further improve the participant experience.
