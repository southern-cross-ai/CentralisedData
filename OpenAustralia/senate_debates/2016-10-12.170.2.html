         Being elected as a senator for Queensland is a daunting task. The expectations of Queenslanders weigh heavily on me to protect our natural wonders, provide hope for the future and represent the many different cultures that make up my great state, including the many Aboriginal and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
          Torres Strait Islander
         </a>
         traditional owners, custodians and elders of the lands of Queensland, whom I acknowledge. I also acknowledge the traditional owners of the land on which we meet today: the Ngunawal and Ngambri people and their elders past and present.
        </p>
        <p>
         I believe we are in danger of being swamped by cheap populism, bigotry and falsehoods. There are many significant challenges facing our country, but the views espoused by some of my new senatorial colleagues are born in the politics of fear and isolation. This is not to be dismissive of the voters who elected us. They sent a powerful message that I intend on listening to and addressing in this speech.
        </p>
        <p>
         For those who have known me a while, there is a pre-Stella me and a post-Stella me. There is no doubt that the first version would never have become a senator. I am very lucky to have Stella in my life and I thank her for the ongoing sacrifices she has made for me to be here today.
        </p>
        <p>
         Hello to our three beautiful children, Elouise, Sofia and Xavier, who are all starting to understand that I am away a bit more than normal. The first thing Elouise did when the sitting calendar came out was check whether it clashed with her birthday. Sure enough, we are sitting on 30 November—her eighth birthday. Not one to waste an opportunity, Elouise immediately requested a more substantial birthday present. I am sure the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
          Parliament House
         </a>
         gift shop will deliver the perfect present for an eight-year-old girl! Sofia, when I am travelling I will keep an eye out for those rare Beanie Boos you are chasing. Xavier, I think your kicking is coming along very well—very good off the right foot, but I promise to do more practise on the left foot. Whilst I can sometimes get caught up in the work I do as a senator, there is nothing more important to me than being a good dad. Over time I hope you get a better understanding of the work that I do in this place and I hope that is something you can be proud of, but I will always strive to be the best dad I can be.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, there is an element of fraud for any Queensland Labor member to stand in the upper house of a parliament given the events of 1922, when we abolished the state upper house. I hope I can make a difference to justify the outrage from the grave the suicide squad of 1922 is no doubt feeling.
        </p>
        <p>
         I pay tribute to former Queensland Senators Jan McLucas and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Ludwig" rel="nofollow">
          Joe Ludwig
         </a>
         for their dedicated service and enormous contribution in this chamber; particular thanks to Joe for his advice and guidance over many years. Thanks also to Senators Ketter and Moore for their support. I look forward to working with my new Labor colleague
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Watt" rel="nofollow">
          Murray Watt
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         I intend to do the impossible in this speech: prove to my Labor colleagues that former state secretaries have a heart and a soul! My good friend Senator Dastyari has made a head start on me in this regard.
        </p>
        <p>
         I have always been fortunate in my life, but from a young age I always understood some people were less so. I was named after
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Porter" rel="nofollow">
          Anthony Porter
         </a>
         . Anthony was born with extreme physical disabilities. Not long after his birth Anthony's family were told not to expect him to survive beyond his first birthday. My mum, Marion, volunteered to help care for Anthony as part of a community effort to help the Porter family manage life and attempt to help Anthony's long-term recovery. Some of my earliest memories are in the company of Anthony and his family and friends. Despite Anthony's challenges he possessed a magnetic personality and a wicked laugh that drew people to his court, and despite his struggles I find most of my memories of him are happy ones.
        </p>
        <p>
         Whilst for many years Anthony defied the odds, he did not lead a long life, passing away in the year 2000 at the age of 31, but his remarkable family along with other community members were able to set up a long-lasting service to help families confronting similar challenges. That house was called Handihome, but is now called NIRAN. The title comes from the first two letters of the names of its original residents: Nicole, Irene, Annette and Anthony. NIRAN is based in Aspley, not far from where I live. It provides full-time care for disabled people and has housed numerous over the last couple of decades. When you spend any time at NIRAN house you get a sense from the parents of the people who live there how grateful they are to have such a service. As the parents themselves get older in life their concern always turns to who will look after their children when they can no longer do it themselves. The start-up of the National Disability Insurance Scheme is providing great hope to these families and, I am sure, countless others around the country. I will be vigilant to ensure the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
          NDIS
         </a>
         delivers for those who need it most.
        </p>
        <p>
         My family has a long history of helping with fundraising and other activities at NIRAN. My mum currently serves as president and all my family assist in one way or another. This community-mindedness has been at the heart of my upbringing and has been inspired by my mother, Marion, who still dedicates much time in her life to causes such as NIRAN and St Vincent de Paul along with myself and many family members. The work I have done with St Vincent de Paul in my local community over the last seven years has given me a tremendous insight into the daily struggles many families have. Whether it is assisting in callouts or the annual Christmas hamper delivery, it keeps your feet firmly on the ground. Standing with a mum in suburban Brisbane with a couple of bags of groceries and some toys, and handing them over to her as tears well in her eyes, you know that without this, Christmas would be just another day and there would certainly be no toys under the tree come Christmas morning. The saddest part about this is that when you do it again the next year and see a lot of the same families.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is this upbringing that will drive my ambitions and hopeful achievements for as long as I am in this place. For many years I served as state secretary of the Labor Party in Queensland. I oversaw success and failure, but I come here stronger and more experienced for it. History-making state election wins in 2009 and 2015 certainly outweigh any disappointments. I will be forever grateful to the branch members and MPs who supported me through my time as secretary. Particular thanks go to Sharon Neame, Linus Power,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Sullivan" rel="nofollow">
          Jimmy Sullivan
         </a>
         , Anika Wells, Jon Persley and Premier Palaszczuk, who worked closely with me in my time as secretary. Thanks also to my current staff—Bart and Liam.
        </p>
        <p>
         As secretary, and now senator, I have enjoyed enormous support, even when this has not been the easiest task for many people. But I will always be thankful and endeavour to honour that support by being a representative they can respect. Thanks to Ben Swan and Scott McDine and the

         </a>
         for their friendship and guidance over many years.
        </p>
        <p>
         I have also been fortunate to have some excellent mentors:
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Swan" rel="nofollow">
          Wayne Swan
         </a>
         and

          Mike Kaiser
         </a>
         are the two most significant. It is tremendous to be serving in the same parliament as Wayne, and Mike has always made time to provide advice that was timely.
        </p>
        <p>
         I also have some great friends who serve with me in the current parliament, in my great mate since my days at uni,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Chalmers" rel="nofollow">
          Jim Chalmers
         </a>
         , and in my predecessor as state secretary, Milton Dick. It is exciting to be serving with you both, along with my good friend the member for Blair.
        </p>
        <p>
         My father, Neville, passed down two beliefs: one was in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlton_Football_Club" rel="nofollow">
          Carlton Football Club
         </a>
         and the other was in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Labor Party
         </a>
         . It is fair to say that I have got much more joy out of my Labor membership than I have from my Carlton membership over the last 20 years! My father's family had a long history of involvement in Labor politics in his home state of Tasmania. The Apple Isle is also the home state of my mother and all my brothers and sisters. I am the exception, as my family moved to Queensland not long before I was born.
        </p>
        <p>
         While at primary school I can remember the disdain my parents had for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Joh" rel="nofollow">
          Sir Joh
         </a>
         and their excitement at the emergence of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Goss" rel="nofollow">
          Wayne Goss
         </a>
         . By the time of his sad passing I was able to call Wayne Goss a friend—his style of honesty, integrity and perseverance for reform is one I hope to honour with my work as a senator.
        </p>
        <p>
         Growing up the youngest of five had its advantages, especially at Christmas time. Once my brother and sisters entered full-time work, the quality of Christmas presents improved greatly! Thanks to John, Melinda, Michelle, Dearne, Les and Karen for their love and support, along with my nieces and nephews Riley, Billy, Lochie, Tom and Kenzie. Thanks to the extended Chisholm, Leary, Bowes and Nothling families, many of who have travelled here today. Thanks also to Stella's family: Maria, Carlos, Jason, Charlie, Stacey, Isabel and Amelia.
        </p>
        <p>
         My upbringing was more focused on what you had, rather than what you did not have. A good example is the family car. Until the early 1990s it was a blue 74
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XB" rel="nofollow">
          XB
         </a>
         falcon. How no-one died from the fumes coming through the rusty floor in the back seat is a miracle. It is these experiences that shape your ambition and priorities. Home ownership is a challenge for many Australian families, my own parents included. What many people take for granted is simply unattainable for some. The median house price in Australia is now around 5.6 times what the median annual income is. This is up from a ratio of less than three in the late 1980s. Labor has made a brave first step in tackling this issue with its recent policy with regard to negative gearing. It is important for the nation that we continue to tackle the generational disadvantage that is looming from an unfair housing market. We must be prepared to push harder.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another aspect of home ownership that needs urgent progress is that for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. Imagine growing up in a community, on land that is your traditional country, but you are unable to purchase your own house—generation after generation. For too long there has been very little progress on resolving land tenure in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. Whilst I can understand the fears and uncertainty of people within communities on changes to land tenure, for the prosperity of future generations I believe change is vital. Any change cannot be at the expense of the rights of traditional owners.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another associated challenge with home ownership and financial security for many people is financial literacy. When you grow up knowing money is tight, it becomes a subject that parents and children do not discuss. This can only add to generational disadvantage. Any lack of literacy also increases the risk of people being taken advantage of by unscrupulous operators. The start of compulsory superannuation means more working people are involved in actively planning their financial future sooner, but more must be done to ensure financial literacy is improved amongst all members of the community.
        </p>
        <p>
         As involved as I have been in politics over the last twenty years, I was always careful not to let it dominate my life. It has come close many times, but never quite got there. The key to this for me has been maintaining some old friendships that date back as far as primary school. My Wavell High mates Matt and Leisa Bauer, Paul and Megan Kay, Stu and Lavinia Affleck, Paul and Miranda Fabre, and my primary school friends
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Goodwin" rel="nofollow">
          Dan Goodwin
         </a>
         , Ben Hollis, Lonnie Swain, Chris Channon and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbie_Ward" rel="nofollow">
          Robbie Ward
         </a>
         are all still close friends today. None of them work in politics, and for me they provide a regular reminder of what is important in life and where politics fits into it for most people. I hope that does not change.
        </p>
        <p>
         It has been said before that Queensland is the most decentralised state in mainland Australia, where more people live outside the capital than in it. It is also arguably the most diverse state.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islanders" rel="nofollow">
          Torres Strait Islanders
         </a>
         live a very different lifestyle to people in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Farm" rel="nofollow">
          New Farm
         </a>
         , and there are plenty of differences between the average day of a miner in Blackwater and of a surf instructor at Burleigh. In any other continent these cultures, climates and communities would be separated by national borders or further state borders. This diversity results in quite different economic, social and health outcomes across the state. Too often, the pain of an economic downturn has a larger detrimental impact outside of Brisbane. Current unemployment in areas outside of Brisbane is a percentage point higher on average than it is within Brisbane. This is up from a difference of just half a per cent three years ago, indicating a growing divide.
        </p>
        <p>
         Wages data in Queensland also highlights differences across the state. The average wage in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Brisbane" rel="nofollow">
          Greater Brisbane
         </a>
         is almost five thousand dollars greater than in regional Queensland. This also underscores the importance being a senator for all of Queensland. I have already spent time in many regional towns throughout Queensland, and this will remain a strong focus of my work.
        </p>
        <p>
         We also see this volatility electorally. The recent election saw the lowest vote for the major parties in Queensland since World War
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
          II
         </a>
         , a combined 74.1 per cent. So this was not a business-as-usual election. Fears about economic inequality and technological change, job insecurity, low wage growth and high unemployment are some of the factors that drove people to look for alternatives.
        </p>
        <p>
         Queenslanders are a loyal mob. Many of us like to stick close to work and family, so for many the idea that their future does not lie in their traditional workplace or community is hard to accept—especially when rapid change can often leave small towns or regions behind. Coupled with being told to work until you are 70, this combination, for many people, does not make for an exciting time to be alive. It makes them fearful for their future and that of their children.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is only Labor that can ease these concerns, provide solutions and a long-term vision that Queenslanders can grasp. For a state like Queensland with such wonderful natural assets, like the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef" rel="nofollow">
          Great Barrier Reef
         </a>
         , getting the balance right between protecting these pristine environments and providing long-term prosperity and jobs for many workers is a challenge we must get right.
        </p>
        <p>
         I understand the importance of a growing economy and the role business plays in creating jobs and economic wealth, but this cannot be unfettered. For every kid that finds their way and makes a start that is fantastic, but for those who miss out or do not have the same luck the state must be there to provide that support. Whilst I believe much of the vote drivers behind this are related to challenging economic conditions, there is a real distrust of politicians and a lack of faith in our ability and our parties to get the answers right. There is also a cynicism around the system.
        </p>
        <p>
         One aspect which I believe needs urgent attention is donation and disclosure reform. Whilst Labor has a better record than the conservatives is this regard, we can always do better and changes in this area that are bipartisan survive electoral tides. I intend to be active in this important debate to ensure public confidence in our democratic systems.
        </p>

         Today marks the fourteenth anniversary of the Bali bombings where 202 people lost their lives, including 88 innocent Australians, most of whom were just enjoying a holiday in Bali. This is a stark reminder of the danger facing Australians at home and abroad.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since 11 September 2001 more than 30,000
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Defence Force
         </a>
         personnel have served in Afghanistan and more than 20,000 have served in Iraq. Currently, we have more than 2,300 Australian troops deployed in operations around the world. It is important to recognise the work our armed forces do and ensure they, and their families, receive appropriate and ongoing support throughout their lives.
        </p>
        <p>
         The threat from terrorism has subsequently led to significant legislative changes designed to protect Australians. I will be vigilant in my duties as a senator to support laws and actions that protect us. There is a fine line to tread with the Australian people for legislators in this regard. At a time of real threat to our people, Australians are trusting of parliament taking action. But if parliaments or governments abuse this goodwill, the consequences will be felt for generations to come by making the country less safe.
        </p>
        <p>
         We cannot let hate, fearmongering or divisive politicians seek to exploit genuine fears for political gain. Protecting Australians must be the priority, but it needs to be balanced with civil liberties and protecting our privacy. It is important that all members are prepared to question proposals or legislation. It means you are doing your duty to the Australian people for generations to come.
        </p>
        <p>
         In closing, the challenge we face as senators is a great one—growing inequality, rapid technological change, the urgent need to better protect our environment, an increased threat to the safety of Australians and an impatient public. Being elected a Labor senator is a tremendous honour. I look forward to playing my part in solving these great challenges, speaking out on behalf of Queensland and dedicating myself to representing those people who need it the most. I thank the Senate.

           I stand here in this chamber today to present my inaugural speech on oath, to deliver my message to the Australian people. What follows will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth before almighty God and the people of Australia.
          </p>
          <p>
           To senators, veterans, Indigenous elders of this great land and all Australians, Pauline quoted 'I'm back!' My quote is: 'I'm here! Despite all attempts to silence the WA voters' choice, I am here—bright-eyed and bushy-tailed—despite all attempts to deflate my tyres on the drive over from Western Australia.' As one would know, a good farmer always keeps a good puncture kit handy in the ashtray of the ute and a good toolbox in the back. It is true it can be hard to pull up a cocky.
          </p>
          <p>
           Just reiterating a few housekeeping rules: it appears that during other speeches certain members are leaving the field before the final siren goes, so if any senator wants to leave now is as good a time as any.
          </p>
          <p>
           I pay tribute to my party leader

           . A good PH balance will grow a healthy Australia, and this 'hung parliament' promises to do exactly that. Being a Nationals voter for 35 years, I am honoured to be a One Nation senator representing my constituents in WA. With the support of my fellow senators

           cathedral in Canberra. This now needs to be mirrored in both chambers in the Australian parliament. As a farmer, it is true, the only audience I have had to address up until now has simply been a mob of sheep in the yards.

           I want my actions in this place to reflect my own personal experiences, and having been locked in a financial crocodile roll for the last six years with people trying to steal my intellectual property, I have lost all incentive to invent anything again. But I have not lost my incentive to fix the mess so it doesn't happen to others in the future. Prime Minister Turnbull says Australians need to become more innovative. I would say innovation raises a flag to attract large corporations to attack the innovator of a great idea, so let's fix that first.

           My inaugural question in the Senate on 12 September this year was to the honourable the Attorney-General and concerned the inconsistencies and unconstitutional behaviour of our courts. I have started in this place as I mean to go on, with my inaugural question aiming right at the middle stump on constitutional issues. That question was unprecedented and referred to the High Court rules review committee. It is on notice that

          </p>
          <p>
           The hunted has now become the hunter. Australia is not running on all cylinders and it is desperately in need of a tune up, to simply put the blue flame out and put it into overdrive. This will be done with the support of my team in Western Australia and those of my colleagues who are prepared to put the best interests of this country first. During tough times, my family always stood firmly by me and reminded me that fail means First Attempt In Learning.
          </p>
          <p>
           One man's fortune is another man's misfortune. I have experienced highs and lows in business, but Australians are fighters, and the attitude that has built this nation is to 'never give up'. The reality for Australians today, however, is that the fight is not being carried out on a level playing field. It isn't a fair go, and the battle is too often against our own governments and those who purport to uphold the laws. For too long in this place, successive governments have defied the Constitution our nation was founded on, and in doing so have ignored their duty of care to the people of Australia. Australians—not a global government pushing
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
            UN
           </a>
           dictates which undermine our sovereignty—are the defenders and upholders of the Constitution and our laws. It is long past time for an Ausexit from the UN and removal of all its shackles.
          </p>
          <p>
           Agenda 21 demands, such as deregulating or removing the laws that have provided ethical guidance for foreign corporations in this country, have been responsible for the attitudes we see in our banking institutions, such as 'Can do' or 'We live in your world', when dealing with their clients, as recent inquiries have exposed, and are still being ignored by this government. The reason why the Australian people want a royal commission is the very reason banks don't. It should not be about going to our government and asking for a royal commission; it should be the people's right to demand one.
          </p>
          <p>
           A parliament is not acting in the best interest of the Australian people if it doesn't listen. A royal commission or a re-constituted grand jury is inevitable and it will happen. Justice demands it. In the words of

           region of Western Australia I attended both primary and secondary schools in Narrogin. While I may have got up to a little bit of mischief as a child, I always defended others against bullies and stood up for what I believed was right. I defended my principles. At the time I started my career in the wool industry Australia was riding on the sheep's back. The wool industry was large, prosperous and well regulated, protecting both the industry and its consumers against poor quality product and exploitation of its farmers and communities. I ventured into that industry, trading on futures and buying the Australian wool clip.
          </p>
          <p>
           In 1981, I started working at my father's business in Narrogin and surrounding districts, where I was one of 21 employees in his 35-year-old wool-buying business. Yet through privatisation that level of competition was removed. In fact, it has become extinct. Growers now carry the risk and are considered captive to current markets. The term privatisation, itself, is just a con. The reality is that foreign corporations are the beneficiaries of our tax laws and our lack of regulatory structures.
          </p>
          <p>
           My father's business was on fire until January 1991, when the Australian government announced the suspension and later the abandonment of the wool reserve price. The primary industry minister back then,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kerin" rel="nofollow">
            John Kerin
           </a>
           , on 11 February 1991 made announcements which would change the wool industry forever. After being suspended for almost six months the price fell from 870 cents a kilogram clean to 700 cents a kilogram clean. The wool industry had stalled until, through government intervention, it fell further, from 700 to 430 cents a kilogram clean. In other words, another commodity stabilisation scheme had failed, leaving the Australian industry with a stockpile of 4.6 million bales of wool and close to one year's normal production, and a debt of $2.7 billion. A national disaster was the result. It was the biggest economic collapse in this nation's history and, like the recent beef and dairy industry disasters, it was also created by inappropriate government policy.
          </p>
          <p>
           This period still haunts me today because, like others in the industry, my father's business was dealt a lethal blow. The government then took considerable time to press the reset button, which started the demise of a magnificent Australian industry. Private buying would never perform to that standard again. Government intervention further caused the collapse of the price and also destroyed the livelihoods of producers, traders and decimated rural communities. Our stock was worthless, although growers were granted a supplemental scheme and did not feel the immediate impact at the time; however, my father's business did not qualify for such compensation. As a result, the national wool industry finished overnight. The government was not finished with the industry however, and ordered 20 million sheep to be culled. The sheep were gassed and shot en masse as a result. I remember going to a farm to look at a clip I purchased in Kulin—one on the back—and I thought the main power had failed, as the grower had the generator going. I found that the petrol motor running was being used as an improvised gassing plant. The farmers were running sheep into the back of semi tippers, rolling the tarps over the top, shutting the back tailgates and gassing the young sheep to death—under instructions from the then government! I vomited over the fence, as a lot of the sheep appeared to be still clinging on to life. I saw numerous stray sheep in bush reserves, and many pits dug around the region to dispose of such sheep carcasses. These memories still haunt me today and I can still recall the smell of Phostoxin in the air.
          </p>
          <p>
           Like then, a national disaster was caused by implementing poor political decisions, made in ignorance, without appropriate research, by politicians who simply refused to go out to the coalface to learn the consequences of their actions or to rectify their initial errors. When it was clear the government policy had failed, where was
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_B" rel="nofollow">
            Plan B
           </a>
           ? These ongoing and systemic policy failures by governments have accelerated the degradation of rural families and communities, including beef, dairy and sugar. That has seen the decline of rural communities across Australia. Rural Australia runs on passion and commitment. Agriculture runs on hope and faith, and builds the true-blue Australian character that has built this nation—a character that may soon become extinct.
          </p>
          <p>
           Had the Nationals and other major parties been doing their jobs for farming families and their communities today through proper representation, our farming industries would still be vibrant. The sad reality is that too many rural families feel shunned by their own communities, ashamed to speak out about the unconscionable treatment by the banks, lawyers, receivers, auctioneers and their agents. They feel there is nowhere to turn, and then find that the very politicians who enacted the inept policy decisions that caused the collapse of their businesses are just as quick to refuse help to farming families, and continuously accept large donations from the foreign banking corporations entrenched in this travesty of justice.

           believe that farmers need access to more debt: another band-aid solution. This could not be further from the truth.
          </p>
          <p>
           Farmers do not need more debt. They do need a rural bank that will work with them, without making adjustments to property values based on one year's weather events or on knee-jerk decisions of government. Farmers' biggest risks once focused on hopes of getting 'plenty of rain to produce plenty of grain'. Now our farmers are paid a price that has no bearing on the costs of production, quality controls or even the retail market prices. With foreign corporate retailers dictating market prices as well as farmgate prices, our farming families are denied any market control or voice. Every year they are locked into a system that extracts more and more from them, and does the same at the consumer end of the market.
          </p>
          <p>
           Before deregulation, Australia had the lowest grocery prices in the developed world and a quality second to none. Post-deregulation, however, Australia's consumers now pay the highest grocery prices in the developed world, with much of the food on offer imported and devoid of the quality and safety controls that our own farmers meet on their world-class products. The foreign-corporate middlemen extract higher and higher profits at the expense of both farmers and Australian consumers. That must end. Australian farming families and consumers deserve the benefits of their nation's own quality produce.

           , which is located near Broome in Western Australia. How can any responsible government consider that acceptable—environmentally, socially or economically?
          </p>
          <p>
           The reason that the foreign investors want to buy our land is the very reason why we should not be selling it. It is clear that our governments, through the UN, are supporting a world government that will strip sovereignty, and ensure international—not national—ownership of farms by transnational agribusiness corporations, branded

           s, and global investor partnerships. This will result in more imports for local consumption throughout our domestic markets, and further destruction of our primary industries and the national economy. We as Australians must remember the sacrifices of current and past Diggers; sacrifices made for all Australians and for all that this nation represents and values.
          </p>
          <p>
           Before we take the word of a major political party who receives large donations across the board from the big end of town, the foreign banks, the duopoly retailers and others and then just accepts their decision, we must be mindful of the consequences of their treacherous betrayal of our freedoms, our heritage and our constitutional rights. We, too, owe a debt of gratitude to those who have gone before. We, too, have sacrifices that we must make to guard and uphold the freedoms passed from generations long gone. When the government committed Australians to the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the G20, despite vehement opposition across the country, did they ever, ever, ever discuss the terms and conditions with the Australian people? Did the government take the proposal to a referendum, as demanded under the Constitution? No, they did not. It appears that all major parties live in hope that the Australian people will abandon their present democracy and their Constitution and let today's politicians formulate a new constitution based on the very imposts they have already forced on the people of this nation in breach of our constitutional rights, and all done without the consent of the Australian people through referendum.
          </p>
          <p>
           When I attended Senate school recently, I was handed a Senate pack which contained a pocket addition of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Constitution" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Constitution
           </a>
           , with overviews and notes by the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government_Solicitor" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Government Solicitor
           </a>
           . Due to certain disgruntled malcontents trying to remove me from the parliamentary 'poker table' through section 44(ii) of the Constitution—challenging my validity to stand here today as a senator under section 9—under Disqualification, I began to read and appreciate just what a powerful document our Constitution really is. It is the foundation document of our nation and clearly constitutes the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            Commonwealth of Australia
           </a>
           . In this document lies the protections and rules that govern our rights and freedoms.
          </p>
          <p>
           Before 1901, Australia was not a nation. From conventions, the Constitution was drafted and was then put to a vote by the people of the colonies, in referendums. On reflection, I was faced with the obvious question: why aren't we teaching our children the Australian Constitution in our schools? By doing so, our children would know their rights and understand and defend the Constitution that underpins our laws and freedoms. How would Australians know what is being taken from them if they were never taught about this great gift they have? As I raised in my inaugural question in this chamber, our courts have side stepped their responsibilities under the Constitution and are currently acting in defiance of the foundation rule of this nation—the Constitution. I stand humbled and honoured to have been elected to this place and make a commitment that I will continue to defend and uphold the Australian Constitution as an elected senator, a One Nation senator, and as part of a team that is destined to grow as the people of Australia come to understand just what successive governments have traded away and then stand with us to reclaim it back. This nation stands at a minute to midnight, and our obligation to future generations is no less than those who have gone before us and were prepared to do for us.
          </p>
          <p>
           When my wife, Ioanna, and I purchased a farm to raise our children in Williams, we wanted them to learn respect and experience the chores required when living on a farm. If our children were disrespectful, they had to pack their own survival kit and go camp outside the front gate of the farm to reflect on their behaviour. It wouldn't take them long to walk back down the driveway and say, 'Dad, I'll mend my ways.' Other than respect, what they learned to appreciate is that grassroots is what reflects the best qualities of life. Instead of discouraging or disparaging the inventiveness and enthusiasm of our youth, our governments should be men and women of vision and inspiration—leaders who can set a standard that provides a model to our youth. This country and its people deserve our very best effort, and our future generations deserve no less.
          </p>
          <p>
           Australia has been blessed with natural resources and attributes that remain the envy of the world. Our governments need to stop telling and to start listening and learning from the mistakes they have already made. Many today are oblivious of the threats to this nation. In 2003 I invented a revolutionary concept that saw me become an industry leader and also a major threat. It attracted attention around the world and dominated domestic markets. The patent was known and trademarked as 'Grain Keg'. This concept allowed my wife and I to set up a fully integrated farming manufacturing and logistics company to take our homegrown products by direct conduit to end-user markets. In simple terms: paddock to plate. Grain Keg was a leader in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OHS" rel="nofollow">
            OHS
           </a>
           risk and enabled bulk product to be introduced to existing feed rooms, and it would save thousands of tonnes of landfill. End-user markets were developed further domestically and right around the world.

           , my financier, and Mitavite competed for the exclusivity of the Grain Keg Concept. I went with Mitavite and joined forces with the general manager, Graeme Dillon, and national sales manager, Colin Price. But the venture failed due to inconsistent products, which caused major palatable concerns, despite multiple warnings. Mitavite clearly pigeonholed the concept through exclusivity and encouraged paten trolls through Mitavite agents Dean Holzer,

           was self-destructing due to its involvement in the 'oil for food' scandal and was facing litigation of $1.8 billion from international grower groups. They had about as much as chance of flying as a grand piano falling out of a window of a 10-storey building. It was during this period of March 2009 when we purchased another farm. Like others, we were unaware that the

           could not carry out funding past six months. Yet, many farmers were given an interest-only loan at the time for 22 years. Roland

           </a>
           , better known as the 'toe cutter' at ANZ, stated that the only way growers could get a payout figure was to sign a new ANZ Bank letter of offer—a formality of switching from 'green to blue' and all terms and conditions would remain unchanged 'until your next review'. The majority of farmers just simply signed over to the ANZ Bank, and before the ink was dry they were forced to pay sums of up to $6 million within weeks.

           , I wish to put you on notice that farmers don't have a general mortgage; they have a joint venture—meaning, at best, a lender will only lend you 50 to 60 per cent, so the other 40 per cent is the farmer's skin in the game. That is his equity.
          </p>
          <p>
           Roland Andrew Davis also forced farmers to increase their personal injury and their death cover. When ANZ approached me to sign over to the ANZ they wanted all fixed and floating charges over the intellectual property, which was a new condition to the loan. I was the only farmer, as I did not sign. It was clear that both the ANZ bank and Rabobank were the main external funders and all the hedge providers that provided the money for the rural program, and Landmark, simply sat there as a
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_Horse" rel="nofollow">
            Trojan Horse
           </a>
           . The ANZ bank took it upon themselves to create new bank accounts that were foreign to my company and, upon completion, immediately defaulted my companies. This literally blew the tail feathers clean out of the backside of not only my own companies but also many other farmers around the country, and we had to flap like hell to keep elevated. However, some could not. Some hit the deck.
          </p>
          <p>
           In attempts to avoid the ANZ bank taking down farmers, we literally stood up and took them head-on. The downside of the ANZ action was that it clearly put blood in the water, which invited other companies to also attack and go after my intellectual property in the Australian Keg Company. The company was forced to fend off a patent action where the quote from the lawyers exceeded $914,000. I was forced to go to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
            UK
           </a>
           to sell the licence in Britain through Dodson &amp; Horrell. Although they wanted it, it was hindered because, as an inventor, I could not guarantee the outcome of the patent challenge on one of the companies that held it that was currently before the courts; hence we had to fund this attack ourselves. And guess what? We won.
          </p>
          <p>
           Upon my return, we were to appear before a registrar in the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court" rel="nofollow">
            Supreme Court
           </a>
           of Western Australia. We did not understand the ANZ had become an introduced virus infecting our businesses. It had taken over by stealth, as it had with many other farmers. Permanent Custodians Ltd was my true lender. On 28 May 2013—a date of infamy for this nation's courts—my wife and I appeared in the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian_Supreme_Court" rel="nofollow">
            Western Australian Supreme Court
           </a>
           before Registrar Whitbread, who denied us both the right to speak and awarded our farm, along with our life's work and assets, to be handed to Permanent Custodians Ltd, and Landmark as well.
          </p>
          <p>
           Registrar Whitbread could have simply said, 'Mr and Mrs Culleton, this action is about you losing both your family farms and businesses, so I will grant a short adjournment for you to go down to the registry and fill out a form 6 to enable you to enter an appearance.' Registrar Whitbread chose not to clarify our situation to us, despite her being aware that both my wife and I were clearly inexperienced in court and court deficit. I learnt that day that the real law is called common sense law. Under that rule you only have three days to appeal. This rule 62 rule 4(a) is a guillotine order, which the Western Australian Supreme Court proudly does not allow to have set aside. On that day the Western Australia Supreme Court had proudly shut its doors on my, my wife's and my children's inheritance.
          </p>
          <p>
           Through these actions of our state courts, I have come across people with severe mental and physical health issues. This includes people who have attempted self-harm and suicide. I have witnessed this on the frontline around Australia. In a meeting at Winton in Queensland with
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Katter" rel="nofollow">
            Bob Katter
           </a>
           and
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Jones" rel="nofollow">
            Alan Jones
           </a>
           , I gained an understanding of how many victims the ANZ bank had claimed Australia wide. The disturbing reality was that this was grossly wrong, and I was determined to stand up and fight, protecting not only my own interests but also many others who did not feel they had the strength or the knowledge to fight. I grounded my fleet, including my logistics company and the east coast milling enterprise.
          </p>
          <p>
           I heard a very good analogy yesterday, a
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python" rel="nofollow">
            Monty Python
           </a>
           analogy, come out of the chamber. I would like to apply my own Monty Python analogy in the chamber today: 'It's only a flesh wound. Come on, I'll fight you, you bastards.' And fight we have! Since Winton we have been able to keep many farmers on their properties, to keep producing and providing wealth for our economy. We have also been able to withstand the full assault of receivers, who were supported by multiple armed police officers and
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWAT" rel="nofollow">
            SWAT
           </a>
           teams who held us at gunpoint, openly threatening farm owners as the receivers came to properties to evict us farmers. These illegal actions—I have just got to use a bit of choke here guys; I am running a bit rich—were exposed nationally on the
           <i>
            60 Minutes
           </i>
           program in April 2015. Those same police officers have alleged that the receiver's car was stolen, even though they had the key and were filmed locking the vehicle before they left.
          </p>
          <p>
           At my property in Guyra, while protecting my assets and myself from attack by a cranky tow truck driver, a single tow truck key valued at $7.50—that is what I valued it at—was deemed stolen, and is resulting in further court action. However, the truth will come out. And a warning: what I have to say next may be a little bit distressing. If I had to choose between being publicly disgraced by the media or removing a loaded gun away from a boy's hand, I would choose the first option again and again. I would rather be humiliated than risk losing another life. I can deal with that; he should not have to. During this experience I have witnessed cases where receivers have violated farmer's wives, children's mothers, and have forged signatures. As a result, growers have had in excess of $15 million worth of cattle removed from their properties and not one cent has gone off their debt to the bank. And yet they are still paying the loans. The cattle have been stolen by the banks' agents. One had the audacity to send the freight bill back to the farmer! It is this arrogance that is pushing people over the edge.
          </p>
          <p>
           I have also spoken to a number of people wanting to take their own lives. A grower, watching this speech up there right now in the public gallery, tried to end it all by tipping 20 litres of petrol on himself and walking into an open fire, all because of the ANZ bank. He was in a coma for six months. And what about Jimmy Wayland's son who shot himself with a .222 in his first year home on the farm? Rabobank, this must end! The Waylands had to leave their son on a driveway of a farm for two days with a sheet over him until the coroner got there.
          </p>
          <p>
           These growers were never a distressed asset and had perfect farming operations—as I did—but the government came in and shut down their live cattle trade and left them easy prey for the banks. Just the same as they did to the wool industry in the nineties.
          </p>
          <p>
           During the last week's banking inquiry held by Mr Turnbull—which we all call the 'banker's belly scratch'—I was sent a note from a lady who was fighting with Rabobank. It was a suicide letter, because, after watching the news on the pathetic inquiry, she had given up all hope. So while the bankers were saying sorry, I say sorry does not cut it. Bank advertising needs to have warning signs like 24 cigarette packets do: 'If you take out this loan, be warned it could have health implications or cause death'.
          </p>
          <p>
           Despite all the multiple warnings in my own case, all company assets which had no relationship with the land, were taken by my purported buyers, Graham Arthur Harding, and Matthew and
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Ford" rel="nofollow">
            Jesse Ford
           </a>
           were put on notice that the properties 'to be bought' by them were not for sale. They were also put on notice that the farms contained assets of other companies that had no relationship with ANZ Bank or PCL. Despite these multiple warnings, they pushed ahead, conferring with ANZ Bank and continued to proceed with the purchase. The ANZ Bank sold the properties, 'walk in, walk out' on instructions of VNW real estate, Steve Vaughan and Hugh Ness.
          </p>
          <p>
           They sold a magnificent asset for one tenth the price—including, 2,000 tonnes of grain stock worth well over a $1.2 million dollars. So they got it for nothing—and all the family furniture and belongings, which included our children's sports medallions. The ANZ Bank had acted unlawfully not only to us, but to a large number of growers around the country. We have yet to have our clearing sale. It was said that over 4,000 farmers had been sent to the wall by ANZ Bank. It was the biggest assets-for-Asia grab in this nation's history. ANZ Bank and the other major banks, including Rabobank, have clearly performed financial terrorism on the people of this country and they will be held to account.
          </p>
          <p>
           A royal commission or a grand jury will happen. I appeared on
           <i>
            60 Minutes
           </i>
           to show Australia what was happening to our farmers around Australia. The old saying, 'A picture speaks a thousand words', worked. This can be viewed on my website and my Facebook page and I urge all Australians to revisit it. It is called 'Farmers fighting back'. You will see that the ANZ Bank's receiver agents were clearly caught on camera in the kitchen of Bruce Dixon's farm, saying, 'We're not here to head-bash you,' and 'We can get the tactical response group in to remove farmers'. My proud son filmed that exchange and saved not only Bruce's 26 farms but many farmers and small businesses around Australia. We also saved his life.
          </p>
          <p>
           Yes, it is true that over 40 police officers attended the Dixon farm. We were told: 'ANZ Bank is now in possession. You have only days to remove your items and equipment'. Who can do that in a farming operation? As a result, this clearly did not happen. That day reverberated a message to the banking industry right around Australia and there have been many beneficiaries from our actions in that program. Our farmers have been given their properties back. What bank goes around spending shareholders' money repaying all their bills, paying out their local accounts and giving their properties back and saying, 'Gee, I made a mistake.'
          </p>
          <p>
           The police locked the receiver's car and left with the keys, which was all recorded on national
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">
            TV
           </a>
           that day. I have since been personally charged with stealing a motorcar that the receivers left behind at Bruce Dixon's that day. Twenty-two police officers have been called before the Western Australian Magistrates Court to give evidence against me. I still scratch my head and wonder how I got past so many cops that day. It has only just dawned upon me how talented I must be.
          </p>
          <p>
           We need to keep things simple, respect others and activate our personal powers and tell the courts to smarten up. Family Courts, in which the legal vultures are feasting on the carcasses of the marriage vows, are treated as a joke, and this court needs to be reviewed now. We say 'don't drink and drive' because every life is worth saving, yet our Family Courts are driving 27 young healthy Australians every week to suicide. It is the solicitors' fees and potential trauma that is the very reason they do not want marriage reconciliation.
          </p>
          <p>
           I am about to wind up. You have now been made aware of this as the custodians of these people. In fact, they may have voted for you. They, through their vote, entrusted you to act in their best interest. I, along with One Nation, want a moratorium to be placed immediately on the Family Court and not another life to be lost.
          </p>
          <p>
           You are here for the Australian people, not for the corporations. Many ask: 'We have a constitution? What's that about?' These questions are feedback from a large sample of the Australian population and I was one of them until Senate school. The penny dropped. We all need to be aware of what we have, because, if we are not, we will never know if someone is stealing it or taking it off us.

                Other nations are envious of what we have. It is clearly God's land. I would like to see government-backed banks, a reintroduction of co-ops—and build a society that values and cares for the most vulnerable.
               </p>
               <p>
                To conclude, if the judges do not respect law, how then can they establish law and order? If the Constitution is the grand express motorway, why would you take the road full of potholes and road works? Yet this is what our lawyers are doing. Does no-one care? People's hard-earned life assets are just stripped and the courts are the ones that drag out cases for years and make people homeless. I can say from my own experience: you would not want to break down in the desert with only one water bottle with a lawyer.
               </p>
               <p>
                I stand in this chamber with respect for all those who share this responsibility and privilege as senators—and I do respect you all, Senators. I challenge each and every one to remember section 51 of the Constitution, which states that the parliament exists 'to make laws for peace, order and good government'. I put Australia and this chamber on notice. It is time those elected to the Senate did exactly that. There is an answer and a simple fix: bring back the Constitution and bring back our real laws.
               </p>
               <p>
                To end, I want to say thank you to my biggest supporters: my incredible wife—just a bit more choke here guys—Ioanna; my sons, who have been galvanised heroes, James and William; and my beautiful daughter, Abbey. Without your support, I would not be standing here today. I said I would go in and fight for us and others as long as I did not lose the respect of my children and you have supported me right through. You are all my heroes. I would not be the man I am today if it was not for the love that you have shown towards me. I am a proud father, brother, husband and son. To Ron and Leslie, who are watching me now and who I am very proud of, I love you dearly. And for all the farmers: I said I would come here and when I made it simply say: and well may we say God save the Queen, because nothing will save these bankers! Thank you.
