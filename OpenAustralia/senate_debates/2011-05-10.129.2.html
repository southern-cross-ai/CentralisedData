         Government response:

        <p class="italic">
         Under COAG's National Indigenous Reform Agreement (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIRA" rel="nofollow">

          States and Territories
         </a>
         have agreed to 11 actions to improve Indigenous data collections including the data required under the NIRA. As a part of the National Integrated Strategy for Closing the Gap on Indigenous Disadvantage, the Commonwealth is to provide an additional $46.4 million over four years to fund work undertaken by national data agencies, such as the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Bureau_of_Statistics" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Bureau of Statistics

          Australian Institute of Health and Welfare
         </a>
         (AIHW), to improve the evidence base and address data gaps.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         A key agreed data quality improvement is to achieve consistency and accuracy of Indigenous data across jurisdictions. This involves the adoption by all jurisdictions of standard ABS Indigenous status questions and recording categories on data collection forms and information systems for key data sets. In addition, all jurisdictions will improve data collection procedures for health and education data through staff training and awareness of the importance of quality Indigenous information.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         All data sources are affected by the collection of information which identifies Indigenous status, particularly data obtained from administrative datasets. Census data is particularly important; given the information collected on the Indigenous population is used in many other dataset calculations.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The most critical data quality improvements relate to improvement in the count of the Indigenous population in the Population Census, and the improvements in the identification of the Indigenous population in key datasets across all the States and Territories. Work on this, primarily through the AIHW and the ABS is ongoing. Many of these improvements will lead to longer term benefits which will lead to improved estimates in mortality and life expectancy through the identification of Indigenous people in the Population Census and changes in health administrative datasets.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">

        <p class="italic">
         4.203 The committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government review its overall communication strategy for regional and remote Indigenous communities with the view to making information available to communities on an ongoing and regular basis and in an accessible way. In the instance of the SIHIP program the communication strategy should provide information on how the decision to fund housing in the priority communities was made, as well as regular information on how the construction of this new housing is progressing.

         recently asked the Indigenous Communication Coordination Group (ICCG), chaired by the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (FaHCSIA), to examine the effectiveness of coordination arrangements for market research and development of communication strategies, particularly in remote locations. The Executive Coordination Forum for Indigenous Affairs (comprising senior Commonwealth officials) endorsed a principles-based framework in-principle on 13 August 2010. The framework outlines processes for ensuring the Australian Government presents a uniform message to the Australian community as it progresses its work to close the gap. It also includes common messages to help staff explain Closing the Gap to Indigenous people and communities, and to other stakeholders with an interest in the Government's work in Indigenous affairs.

         In addition, as the lead Commonwealth agency for Indigenous Affairs, the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (FaHCSIA) has developed two new whole-of-government products —a magazine and radio program —launched in mid-2009. They address a perceived gap in communications channels to Indigenous people. Entitled Newslines and Newslines Radio respectively, they provide regular and consistent channels designed to reach Indigenous audiences around Australia, as well as intermediaries and community influencers in more remote areas. The editorial policy for these publications prioritises Indigenous perspectives and community success stories rather than top- down government news. Government information (e.g. about programs and services) is provided in sidebars. The magazine is produced five times per year and mailed to more than 10,000 recipients. The radio program is produced weekly for up to 40 weeks a year and distributed through the national Indigenous and community radio networks. Both the radio program and magazine are also available on the internet at www.fahcsia.gov.au and www.indigenous.gov.au. Evaluations of the two products are currently underway and expected to be completed by mid-2011. In addition, informal feedback received through the email address and website has been overwhelmingly positive and the magazine has attracted many new subscribers.

         Consistent with the findings of the review, the Australian Government now has a direct role in delivering the program. The Australian Government Program Director is now jointly managing the program with the Northern Territory Government Program Director.

         Recommendation 4
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         4.228 That in communities without access to a local store licensed to accept the Basics Card, alternative arrangements should be made so that people are able to access income managed funds at their local store. This could be in the form of a temporary arrangement with the store until the licensing process can be completed.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Government response:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (FaHCSIA) works closely with Centrelink to ensure that people who are on income management can access their income managed funds at their local community store. As at 17 December 2010, 91 community stores (including stores such as station stores that have been specified as community stores by the Minister for FaHCSIA) in the NT are licensed. When people who are income managed travel interstate, they are encouraged to contact Centrelink before travelling, to ensure that they can access their income managed funds. They can also use their BasicsCard at approved merchants nationally.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         There may be cases where a business meets the definition of a community store under Part 7 of the Northern Territory National Emergency Response Act 2007, and seeks to become a BasicsCard merchant, but may not reasonably be expected to meet licensing requirements. In these rare instances, the Minister can make case-by-case decisions to allow consideration of the community store to become a BasicsCard merchant without having a community store licence. The FaHCSIA Secretary may take into account the level of turnover of the store, and whether this is sufficient to support compliance with licensing requirements.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         In cases where a store is not (or no longer) eligible to participate in the income management regime, and there is no alternative store for the community, FaHCSIA and Centrelink develop contingency plans for the community which may include arrangements for bush orders, one-off payments by Centrelink and/or transport to a nearby community.

         The Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and the Department of Health and Ageing have agreed on a process whereby provision of Opal fuel is taken into account in BasicsCards approval for petrol stations, while still ensuring sufficient availability of petrol to income managed customers in the relevant region.

        <p class="italic">
         4.256 The committee recommends that the Commonwealth commit to longer term program funding so that organisations can enjoy greater funding certainty and offer staff greater job security. This is especially the case in relation to organisations who have established relationships with funding bodies and good risk management strategies in place.

        <p class="italic">
         The government supports longer term funding arrangements, within the constraints of prac­ticalities and program issues. It is accepted that longer term funding arrangements provide benefits to organisations, including greater certainty, the opportunity to develop longer term strategies, greater ability to build long term partnerships and trust, and develop capacity within their own organisation. However, there are a number of practical and program issues that affect the length and nature of funding arrange­ments including: the nature of the program and program objectives, the duration of specific budget measures, compliance with existing funding agreements and, in particular, risk management (including the assessed level of program and provider risk).

The program focused on nutrition to tackle the 'failure to thrive' for infants and babies and provided meals and assistance for elderly members of the community delivered through the Homemaker centres. While it was recognised that the focus of the Homemaker program was working with parents, children, youth and older persons, the Commonwealth's funding was provided to improve housing management, as a complementary measure to the existing housing programs being administered by DFC. The Home Living Skills Assistance program was a distinct initiative separate to the operation of the Homemaker centres. The cessation of funding for the Home Living Skills Assistance program was mutually agreed between Commonwealth and South Australian Government officials on the basis of new improved arrangements to be negotiated through the National Partnership Agreement for

         SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON REGIONAL AND REMOTE INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES THIRD REPORT 2009

         WHOLE OF GOVERNMENT RESPONSE

         Recommendation 1
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         2.42 The committee recommends that COAG consider at its first meeting in 2010 how communication and consultation with all relevant stakeholders in the delivery of the COAG targets can be improved. Furthermore, progress in improving communication and consultation should be publicly reported.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Government response:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The Australian Government notes this recommendation and advises that both the COAG Reform Council and the Coordinator General have responsibility for publicly reporting on COAG Indigenous reform activities.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Communication and consultation with stakeholders in the delivery of the COAG targets is taking place under the auspices of the National Indigenous Reform Agreement, the National Integrated Strategy for Closing the Gap in Indigenous Disadvantage and the Remote Service Delivery National Partnership Agreement.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The National Integrated Strategy for Closing the Gap in Indigenous Disadvantage provides for an engagement and partnership approach in delivering the Closing the Gap reforms.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         For example, the National Partnership Agreement on Remote Service Delivery is changing the way governments deliver vital services and infrastructure to Indigenous communities in remote Australia. Local Implementation Plans, tailored to the specific needs of each community, are being developed through consultations and planning workshops which are taking place in each priority location, supported by Regional Operations Centres. These plans will continue to be monitored to make sure they are on track and delivering agreed priorities throughout the life of the agreement.

         2.68 The committee recommends that the

         take a more active role in driving reform of the criminal justice system with the aim of reducing the alarmingly high level of contact of Indigenous Australians, particularly Indigenous young people.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Government response:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The Australian Government accepts the recommendation in principle. While criminal justice matters are primarily the responsibility of State and Territory governments, the Australian Government Attorney-General's Department is leading cross government work to reduce the high level of contact that Indigenous people have with the criminal justice system.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The Government is providing funding for additional community engagement police officers in remote Northern Territory Indigenous communities. These eight additional police officers will focus on community engagement to build trust and confidence in the justice system in order to strengthen local safety and security.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The Government has committed $2 million for a series of outcomes evaluations of Indigenous justice programs. The first tranch
