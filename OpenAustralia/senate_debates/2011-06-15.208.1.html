        (1) What is the number of individuals exceeding the concessional contributions caps, as per Table 1 in the answer to question on notice no. 367, broken down by the marginal income tax rate brackets for the each of the following financial years: (a) 2008-09; (b) 2009-10; and (c) 2010-11 (as an estimate).

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (5) Given that in the answer to question on notice no. 367 says that the Government does not assume a rise in excess contributions tax, has there been an assumption elsewhere that the personal income tax collected will increase; if so, by how much.

        (7) At what point is it expected that the costs of administering the system will outweigh the excess contributions tax.

         (6) It is not possible to provide projected forward estimates given the legislative detail for some measures are still being finalised, e.g. concessional contributions cap for those over 50.

         (7) Excess contributions tax is an integrity measure to ensure the tax concessions provided to superannuation are both fiscally sustainable and targeted appropriately.
