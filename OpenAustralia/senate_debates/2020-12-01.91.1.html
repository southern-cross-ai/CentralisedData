         I thank Senator McDonald for that question. The Morrison government is resolutely committed to supporting Australian jobs and boosting the economy during COVID-19, and I'm so proud that defence is significantly contributing to this economic recovery. Since the beginning of COVID-19, we've been working with Australian industry to progress defence projects to both deliver essential defence capability and also to provide much needed cash flow throughout our economy.
        </p>
        <p>
         I'm pleased to announce to the Senate that we are proceeding with all of the scheduled work under the $2.25 billion Australia-Singapore Military Training Initiative. Last month, I was delighted to announce that the Australian company

          CPB

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
          North Queensland
         </a>
         . This $800 million investment near Greenvale will create long-term local jobs and support local industry in North Queensland. The construction workforce is expected to peak at 350, with 90 per cent of the workers drawn from the local area.
        </p>
        <p>
         This advanced new training area will provide significant long-term local economic opportunities for North Queensland and particularly Townsville. When the Australia-Singapore Military Training Initiative reaches maturity, up to 14,000

         personnel will train in Queensland for 18 weeks a year. This will provide enduring economic and social benefits to Queensland for at least the next 25 years.

            In addition to Greenvale, the Morrison government is further investing in the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoalwater_Bay" rel="nofollow">

            </a>

             Central Queensland
            </a>
            . Both of these investments in North and Central Queensland coincide very happily with the 30th anniversary of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Armed_Forces" rel="nofollow">
             Singapore Armed Forces

            training right here in Australia. This $2.25 billion dollar Australian-Singapore Military Training Initiative will meet the future needs of both our own
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Defence Force
            </a>
            and also the Singapore Armed Forces. As part of this initiative, we're investing $800 million into Central Queensland's Capricorn region. The Shoalwater Bay investment will support 47 local companies and 450 workers at the peak of construction. This is further evidence that Queenslanders can trust the Morrison government to bolster regional growth and also to support local jobs.

               Singapore is a highly capable and very, very close defence partner of Australia, with a shared commitment to regional security and also to stability. In October, I made my second official visit to Singapore, where I met with Prime Minister Lee and also my defence counterpart, Dr Ng. It was very, very clear to me during this visit how much Singapore values its deep engagement with Australia, particularly so this year, in our 30th anniversary of Singaporeans training here in Australia. They appreciate this relationship just as much as Australia does. As close and enduring defence partners, these training areas support our interoperability right across the Indo-Pacific. This also ensures Singapore's ability to generate a force that provides strategic weight in the region. As Australian-owned and managed training areas, they also support a more capable and agile ADF—
