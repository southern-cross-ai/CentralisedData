        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship, Migrant Services and

        </a>
        , Senator Cash, and relates to net migration, which is the difference between the number of arrivals each year and the number of people leaving. In the October budget the figure for net migration in 2020-21 was negative 71,600. The budget made the statement, 'Permanent migration will not resume until the second half of 2021.' Minister, are these two statements still accurate?

         I thank Senator Roberts for his question. Senator Roberts, you would be aware that in fact it is now 12 months since we had to close the international borders due to COVID-19. As a result, there is no doubt that immigration to Australia has been impacted. This has had a number of effects, as you know. The government is completely aware of this, and I know that I have discussed this with you previously. We are doing everything that we can to keep Australians safe, in particular in relation to the rollout of the vaccine. But, from our perspective, immigration, as you know, at this point in time, has been stopped as a result of COVID-19. Our priority as a government is to keep Australians safe, and that is exactly what we are doing.

           for updated information on 16 February, and this information has not yet been provided. Minister, how many settler arrivals and how many other arrivals have occurred nationally in 2021 to date?

            Senator Roberts, in relation to the exact figures, you did mention the Minister for
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
             Home Affairs
            </a>
            ; I would need to seek those figures from the Minister for Home Affairs. I don't represent the Minister for Home Affairs. What I can confirm, though, is that the 2020-21 migration program, as I said to you in the answer I provided to your first question, has had to be shaped and has had to be adapted to changing circumstances and to support Australia's economic and health recovery from COVID-19. I think you would accept that that is a fact.
           </p>
           <p>
            In terms of the migration program ceiling for 2020-21, it has been retained at 160,000 places, to maximise flexibility for program delivery. In relation to those places, I can advise you that 79,600 places were allocated for the skills stream, 77,300 places were allocated for the family stream, 100 places were allocated for the special eligibility stream and 3,000 places were allocated for the childâ€”

              In the last three days, Sydney airport processed 50 international passenger flight arrivals. Each day, Australia receives more than 10 overseas passenger flights. Arrivals and returns are broadly equal, so there can be no talk of empty planes. My office is fielding a question over and over again, so I ask that question: Minister, who specifically is on these planesâ€”students, temporary workers, refugees, partner arrivals for migrants already here or other categories?

               Again, Senator Roberts, you actually have asked a question that would be more appropriately directed to the Minister representing the Minister for
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
                Home Affairs
               </a>
               . So, in relation to that, I will take the question on notice for you and provide you with what advice I can. But, as you knowâ€”and I think as the Prime Minister and the Minister for Home Affairs himself, Minister Dutton, have been very clear aboutâ€”our priority is to get as many Australians home as possible. That continues to be our priority.
