        My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Gallagher. As has been pointed out several times in this chamber, new analysis of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
         OECD
        </a>
        data reveals that Australians have experienced a greater collapse in living standards than any other advanced economy, with inflation adjusted disposable incomes falling 5.1 per cent to June 2023. Why is it that the governments of the United Kingdom, France, Denmark, Poland, the United States of America, Spain, Chile, Belgium, Finland and Hungary were all able to deliver real growth to household disposable incomes last year, while the Albanese Labor government has inflicted the sharpest decline in household incomes of any advanced economy?

         I thank Senator McGrath for the question, and my answer will be the answer that I've been giving consistently in this chamber around the plan that this government has to support households who are doing it tough because of the inflation challenge that we inherited from those opposite.

             The inflation challenge that we inherited from those opposite—I know you don't like it, but the single biggest quarter of inflation growth was your final quarter in government. That is when interest rates had to start going up to deal with it, because we inherited—

               I have a point of order on direct relevance, because Senator McGrath's question goes to the 12 months to June this year, which is the

                     As Senator McGrath knows—because context is important here—the decline in household living standards occurred in its sharpest form in the final quarter of the former government, when inflation was at its peak. That context is important, as is the fact that, in the countries nominated by Senator McGrath, inflation peaked earlier than it did here. It rose earlier, and it peaked earlier.

                       In many of those countries, inflation peaked higher than it did in Australia, but it certainly peaked earlier, and so it would make sense that our return of inflation to a target range will be later than those other countries. They're the facts. It doesn't change our plan for cost-of-living relief, getting the budget in better shape and making investments in the productive capacity of the economy.

                          , in their statement on monetary policy, have updated their forecasts. In my recollection, it's largely in line with the Treasury forecast as at budget time. That is what the Treasurer has advised the community. If there is anything further, I will update, but it is staying higher than we would like for longer than we'd like. I don't think anyone has made any pretence about that. So the job we have to do is to not get distracted by the shouts of irrelevance over there—the shouting irrelevance that you have become—but to stay focused on what we need to do, which is roll out cost-of-living relief, get the budget in better shape and make those investments in clean energy, skills and housing. That is what we are focused on.
