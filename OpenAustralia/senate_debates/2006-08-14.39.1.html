        My question is to Senator Ellison, the Minister for Justice and Customs. Can the minister explain when he first became aware of concerns over the running of the sky marshal training academy? Aren’t there allegations that as part of a ‘mates’ culture at the academy trainees were bullied, harassed and discriminated against during the training course? Weren’t many female participants failed for no good reason, yet independently assessed as passing the course? Don’t these serious allegations raise concerns about the training and effectiveness of our sky marshal program? What action has the minister taken to address these concerns and stamp out the problems at the academy?

         As I said earlier, the Australian Air Security Officer, or

          ASO
         </a>
         , program is one of the best in the world—in fact, acknowledged as such internationally. The setting up of the ASO program involved at the time the integration of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Protective_Service" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Protective Service
         </a>
         into the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Federal Police
         </a>
         , and numerous initiatives had to be addressed in relation to management practices, selection processes and training methodologies to bring them into line with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
          AFP
         </a>
         management practices and procedures. I am aware that there were a number of complaints made to the AFP professional standards group and that these have been addressed. There are a number that are still outstanding, but a number of them have been found to be unsubstantiated.
        </p>
        <p>
         I do say, however, in relation to a number of the complaints, that they have been addressed and management practices have been introduced as a result of that. This has in no way reflected on the quality and effectiveness of the program, which is an outstanding program. In fact, there is an improved differentiation between male and female physical competencies, in line with AFP training practices, designed to ensure equal access to roles within the organisation. All members undergo independent assessment against those competencies, and that addresses the question that Senator Ludwig has raised in relation to female participants. Course participants now receive adequate feedback as a result of standardised assessments, as well as support and mentoring to ensure that they have every opportunity to meet the high standards that are required for ASOs.
        </p>
        <p>
         Contrary to some reports, the AFP is not aware that anyone has resigned as a result of these complaints or investigations that have been carried out. I think what the opposition needs to realise here is that, just as I said earlier, security is a work in progress, so when you are dealing with a robust program such as the ASO program you are going to look at continuing methodologies, continuing improvements, and that it is part and parcel of a program of this nature. This program is one of the best in the world and is acknowledged as such. Its outstanding reputation can be measured by the number of people who want to join it, who want to participate in the ASO program.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is a program that operates both domestically and internationally. As I said earlier, we have secured agreements with the United States, Singapore and the Philippines, and we are negotiating with other key countries in relation to agreements with them. This is not only international recognition but national recognition in the form of people who want to join this program. It has provided career opportunities for the AFP-
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PS" rel="nofollow">
          PS
         </a>
         , it has provided aviation security and assurance for the Australian travelling public—both at home and internationally—and I dare say that, in the future, improvements will continue to be made to management processes and training methodologies. You would expect nothing less in relation to such a program as this. To simply leave it standing still would not address the current situation that we find ourselves in. This has been ongoing since the inception of the program, and I would imagine that it will continue.

           UK
          </a>
          , aren’t sky marshals at the front line of any defence against plots to hijack or bomb aircraft? Doesn’t the community deserve to have full confidence in the program and in the training and skills of those deployed? Why hasn’t the minister moved quickly to address these concerns and stamp out the problems at the academy? Minister, will you tell us when those reports came to your attention and what investigations are under way, and will you make them public to ensure the public have confidence in the sky marshal program?

           It would be highly inappropriate for the minister of the day, of any government, to carry out investigations in relation to
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
            AFP
           </a>
           professional standards. Senator Ludwig knows full well that this is provided for both by legislation regulation and in the make-up of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Federal Police
           </a>
           . The AFP professional standards group are the appropriate people to deal with these issues. It is not for the minister of the day to engage himself or herself in those aspects. I have full confidence in this program and in the men and women who participate in it. The Australian community can have full confidence in relation to the operation of this program, which has been recognised both nationally and internationally as an outstanding air security officer program.
