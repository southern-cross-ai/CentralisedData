        My question is to Senator Cash, the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection. I refer to the recent revelations that my colleague Senator Sarah Hanson-Young was the subject of a surveillance operation while visiting Nauru in December 2013. On Monday, during question time you stated:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In relation to the claims made by Senator Hanson-Young that she was spied upon, the claims that were made have been confirmed to be false.
       </p>
       <p>
        On that same day in the other place the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Minister Dutton, said
       </p>
       <p>
        'they should provide that information to the police, and the matters will be properly investigated.' Given that the immigration minister has now conceded that the matter should be referred to the police, will you today correct the record and admit that spying by a government contractor actually took place?

         I have to say it is a great shame that twice now this week in the chamber the Greens leader has come into this place and asked a question on border protection. He could have asked about the thousands of lives that this government has saved because of the implementation of our policies. He could have asked about the billions of dollars that have now been returned to the budget—again because of this government's policies. He could have asked—

            As I was saying, he could have chosen to ask about the places that are now being given to people in camps who have been there for five years, 10 years, 15 years and 20 years and are now being able to be returned to Australia. But instead, as always—

                 But again they come into this place and reflect upon themselves. Again I will advise the chamber that the claim that Senator Hanson-Young was spied upon is not accurate. The original allegation by Senator Hanson-Young of large-scale spying during her visit was very broad and, as usual, short on detail. Senator Hanson-Young was not placed under any surveillance or security that is not usually afforded to high-profile visitors to Nauru.

                <p>
                 The department did conform, however, that the senator's vehicle was monitored whilst parked overnight. This was, as I stated in my answer on Monday, without the approval or knowledge of the government or the Department of Immigration and Border Protection. Any proposal or plan to undertake any such surveillance activity would not have been allowed to proceed. I am advised that the contractor in question has provided evidence at the Senate committee which refutes the claims made by the

                   I disagree with what Senator Di Natale is saying. The minister has not said that. I want to now go to the response that has been given by Wilson Security. They stated:
                  </p>
                  <p class="italic">
                   We categorically reject the claims made on the 7:30 program. These anonymous allegations are untrue and we stand by our sworn testimony given to the Senate inquiry. We continue to assist the inquiry with accurate and factual information and to stand by our staff who perform very professionally under difficult circumstances.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I am also advised that the contractor in question provided the evidence, as I said to the Senate committee, and refuted the claims.

                    , I ask a further supplementary question. Given that Wilson Security have conceded that surveillance did take place and that people have been disciplined as a result of that action, I ask now: will the minister suspend any ongoing contract negotiations with Wilson Security until this matter is fully investigated?

                     Again, as I stated, Wilson Security themselves have stated that what occurred was unauthorised, and my understanding is they have disciplined the person involved. You just hate offshore processing and you will do and say anything in this place to undermine what is now a very, very successful policy on behalf of this government.
