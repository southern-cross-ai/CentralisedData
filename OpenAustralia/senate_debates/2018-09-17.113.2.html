        (c) to the extent that the report fulfils a due diligence task, it cannot be characterised as legal advice and, therefore, cannot attract the privilege â€“ it is noted the document comprised largely information that is available online free of charge or for a nominal fee, such as company details, insolvency notice search results, media searches, ASIC personal name search results, and AUSTLII case searches;

        (f) as a country that upholds the rule of law, the Government must not rely on conventions, no matter how longstanding, that are contrary to established principles in law.

        (2) That the Senate does not accept the public interest immunity claim made by the then Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Energy (Senator Birmingham) in relation to the due diligence report prepared by the Australian Government Solicitor, and requires the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment to table the due diligence report, in accordance with the order for the production of documents agreed to by the Senate on 21 August 2018, with any appropriate redactions where there is some particular harm to be apprehended, accompanied by a properly made out claim for public interest immunity identifying the harm.

           The due diligence report constitutes legal advice. The government did not claim public interest immunity on the basis of legal professional privilege, but on that basis there is public interest in the government's legal advice remaining confidential. This is based on the longstanding practice of successive Australian governments. There is a significant public interest in government having access to confidential legal advice for the purposes of policy development and decision-making. The government sees no reason to depart from this principle in this case.
