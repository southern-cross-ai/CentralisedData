           It is a pity, Senator Abetz, you were not able to listen to this. The government has today announced it will be boosting jobs and investing in Australia’s long-term future by building or upgrading buildings in every one of Australia’s 9,450 schools. This $14.7 billion

            Building the Education Revolution
           </a>
           initiative is a massive shot in the arm for our economy and for our education system. It highlights the government’s determination to significantly improve the educational outcomes for all Australian students. Building the Education Revolution is a long-term investment in improving the quality of our school facilities, no matter where that school is or whether it is a government school or a non-government school. Building the Education Revolution will also support local communities. It will be a condition of funding that schools make the new facilities, such as the halls and libraries, available for community use at no or low cost.
          </p>
          <p>
           Building the Education Revolution will begin this financial year and will be rolled out over the next three years. It will be delivered through cooperation between the Commonwealth and the state and territory governments and the non-government school sector. This is an historic initiative that reverses a decade of neglect and lays the foundations for the future. This is an initiative that provides genuine opportunities for all children in the

           . This is an opportunity for all schools and all communities to address some of the fundamental needs facing these communities.

                   brings forward up to $110 million to fund quality proposals in round 2 of the Trade Training Centres in Schools Program. The government has also today announced the $511 million training and learning bonus, which provides for an upfront, one-off bonus to assist eligible students with their costs for the 2009 academic year. It also provides a temporary additional incentive for social security recipients to return to education and training. This incentive will be available until June 2010. Around 440,000 students and people returning to study will be paid this one-off cash bonus. I look forward to the opposition supporting these initiatives.
