        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development, Senator Cash. Regional communities rely on aviation services to support small business, tourism and the residents who live there to access employment opportunities as well as vital services, such as medical treatment and education. Virgin has previously withdrawn services from regional areas and, in the last week of February,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Airlines" rel="nofollow">
         Rex Airlines
        </a>
        announced plans to cut some of its regional services. This has concerned many rural and regional Australians reliant on these vital services. Can the minister please outline how the Liberal and National government is supporting regional aviation to maintain as many of these essential air services as possible not only for tourism but also for the viability of our communities in rural and regional Australia?

         I thank Senator Davey for her question. Without a doubt, 2020 presented the domestic aviation network with the greatest challenges it has ever faced. The Morrison-
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCormack" rel="nofollow">
          McCormack
         </a>
         government were proud to support the domestic aviation network through these challenges. That was actually demonstrated again last week when we announced a $1.2 billion package to support the tourism sector and to encourage more Australians to have a holiday domestically but in particular in regional Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         When the pandemic first hit, aviation without a doubt was hit, and it was hit hard. The government at that time put in place key supports to keep essential services running throughout the pandemic not only to support regional airlines but also to ensure that they could keep as many jobs as possible that are actually supported by our regions. Currently there are around 12 commercial regional airlines which operate regular scheduled passenger services across Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         It's almost one year to the day since the government announced its initial package to assist regional airlines to support critical air services to regional and rural communities, securing access to critical medical supplies and testing, securing freight and securing transport of essential personnel through the regional aviation support program. The government provided an additional $100 million in funding to directly support the smaller regional airlines if they needed it. The reason we did this is that those regional airlines are critical supports for regional communities, providing critical aeromedical services and links to capital and metropolitan areas for medical appointments, medical freight and locum doctors. Certainly, we are committed to ensuring that these services continue.

           , as my leader likes to call it, announced last week will initially service 13 key tourism regions, but can the minister please outline the future measures that our government will undertake to promote tourism and the maintenance of key air services in the regions not currently included in that program?

            Prior to COVID-19, Australians spent approximately $65 billion on overseas travel in 2019. This now presents enormous opportunities for our regionsâ€”that $65 billion on overseas travel in 2019.
           </p>
           <p>
            What we're doing as a government is supporting more Australians to back our regions and supporting Australians to holiday at home this year. As you would know,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
             Mr President
            </a>
            , last week we announced the half-price ticket program. This will operate initially in over 13 key regions, with the potential for more regions to be added on the basis of consumer demand, consultation and the success of the program.
           </p>
           <p>
            In addition to this, the vital domestic aviation policies that are supporting our regional airlines, regional health systems and regional jobs will continue for six months from the end of March to the end of September 2021. Again, as a government, we will always back our regions.

               All Australians will have access to these fares through airline websites and booking agents in the coming weeks for flight bookings from 1 April. The discounts will be offered on tens of thousands of fares per week across an initial 13 key tourism regions, and the government is working with airlines to increase the number of flights to these tourism areas.
              </p>
              <p>
               Not only will regional Australians benefit but regional airlines; regional accommodation providers, regional restaurants and bars and regional tourism operators will all benefit from the policy put in place by the government. In particular, I would encourage all Australians who are considering taking advantage of the discount fare to book through a travel agent. Book through a travel agent not just to support the local business but also to ensure that you can actually make the most of your travel and experience in terms of what all of our regions have to offer. Obviously, doing this will support those local travel agent businesses.
