         ATC
        </a>
        s, there seems no reason to oppose the establishment of three more.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And, frankly, any move by this Government to get off its tail and do something to train more skilled tradespeople would have to be welcome.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Despite our criticisms of the ATC program—and they are many and cogent criticisms—Labor in government will not close down the ATCs.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        What we will do is to make them work—by bringing them closer to state and territory school and TAFE systems, and by ensuring that their operations are coordinated in harmony with those existing systems.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That is the rational way to go.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        , by contrast, has established these outrageously expensive new colleges as a political fix to a policy problem—the dire shortages we find in the skilled trades, the shortages that are holding this country back.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Virtually every one is in a Coalition or a marginal seat. The ATCs represent yet another way for the Government to try to buy its way out of trouble and back into power at the coming election.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The ATCs are the Mersey Hospital writ 28 times. They are a blatant political ploy of a desperate government.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Expensive and wasteful
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And it’s an expensive ploy. This Parliament will be appropriating more than half a billion dollars—$550 million—to graduate 10,000 tradespeople by 2010.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That’s $55 000 per graduate! That’s over twice the cost of turning out a student in a similar program in a government school.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On top of that, since most of the colleges are actually in the private school sector, the students will pay fees, like at any private school. So whether a student from an ordinary working family would be able to get into one of these lavish colleges, I doubt very much.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        At the moment these colleges aren’t working. they can’t find staff: they can’t find students.
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         The ATC planned for the Pilbara in WA can’t open because it can’t attract teaching staff.
        </li>
        <li>
         The Lismore-Ballina college hasn’t even got off the ground—no tender has been let.
        </li>
        <li>
         Two other colleges have also failed to open so far.
        </li>
        <li>
         The Eastern Melbourne ATC has only 86 students, against a planned enrolment of 180, Senate Estimates was told. And it’s costing the taxpayer $15.4 million to under-achieve like this, by over 50%.
        </li>
        <li>
         The college in Northern Tasmania has only 120 students, when 175 were projected. That one is costing you and me and other Australians even more—$16.7 million.
        </li>
        <li>
         Several other ATCs are also significantly under-enrolled. Only two colleges have met their target enrolment for 2007.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Only one-third of the colleges are legally registered in their own right to provide training. The majority of the training actually provided by the ATCs is outsourced to TAFE and private

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And yet on 13 September, we had the Minister, Mr Robb, claiming at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_Time" rel="nofollow">
         Question Time
        </a>
        in the House that the ATCs were “an unqualified success”!
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In the face of all the qualifications I’ve just listed, and many more—he has the hide to describe the Government’s farcical initiative, its failed initiative, as “an unqualified success”!
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        He claims that parents and prospective students—some of the kids still only in primary school—have been flocking to ATC information nights in their hundreds. So how come only two of the colleges have met their target enrolments?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The  Minister says that students in ATCs are telling him that “for the first time in their lives they feel motivated, they feel understood, they feel valued.”
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        He says “We are restoring with these Australian Technical Colleges a great sense of pride and confidence in these young people.”
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        How can that be? What kind of a difference can the ATCs be making to the education of young people when the majority of their teaching is contracted out to existing TAFEs?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Minister is talking through his hat. What he says has no connection with the pathetic reality of the situation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This is irony in the extreme—the whole idea, we were told, was that these new colleges were going to be showcases that were ultra-responsive to local industry needs. They would be state-of-the-art establishments that would inspire the stick-in-the-mud states and territories to lift their game.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Prime Minister himself said, on 26 September 2004:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        “The creation of 24 Australian Technical Colleges will promote pride and excellence in teaching and acquiring trade and craft skills at the secondary school level ...
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        All Australian Technical Colleges will be run autonomously by their principals, who will also engage teaching staff on a performance pay basis, attracting teachers of excellence with up to date industry and skills experience.”
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Far from being “run autonomously by their principals” and “attracting teachers of excellence”, the colleges are in fact being run by someone other than their principals and the students taught by existing TAFE and private VET college teachers!
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In my own state of Victoria, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Howard Government
        </a>
        admits that 5 out of the 6 ATCs have actually outsourced their teaching to TAFE colleges—the very colleges suffering from funding starvation under the current Federal Government’s policies.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am sure the TSFE colleges and their staff are doing a fine job, but that’s hardly the point.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Only nine of the existing 21 ATCs have no relationship with the established TAFE system. So much for a ground-breaking new model! So much for a new broom for trade training!
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The spin that accompanied the establishment of these colleges assured us that all the students would secure apprenticeship placements. This would happen, it was said, because the ATCs would have much better and closer relationships with local industries and employers than other VET providers have.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Yet students at many of the ATCs have been unable to find apprenticeships. At the Illawarra ATC, for example, against a targeted enrolment of 50 only 35 students have enrolled. Of these, only 20 have been given apprenticeships.
       </p>

         ANAO
        </a>
        report
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recently the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_National_Audit_Office" rel="nofollow">
         Australian National Audit Office
        </a>
        released a report on the ATC program. This report confirmed the litany of problems I have outlined today. It found that, in the tendering process for the Australian technical Colleges:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Insufficient attention was paid to state and territory governments;
        </li>
        <li>
         Initial tender applications were weak and inadequate; and
        </li>
        <li>
         There was little choice among applicants.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        The ANAO found that, with respect to nearly half of the initial 24 colleges, tenders were awarded based on only one or two applications. The ANAO said that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        “… an option… may have been to return to the market to develop more industry and community interest…”
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A sad but wise comment, especially given that the Government’s ATC website assured us that the colleges would be established in:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        “… areas where there are skills needs, a high youth population and a strong industry base.”
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It would seem that the clamour from industry and the community for these Howard Government new-style colleges was so deafening that no one could hear it!
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This whole program is a miserable embarrassment for the Government. This is expensive and wasteful.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is not far short of a farce. Labor in government will move swiftly to repair this idiocy. We will sit down with the states and territories and sort out some rational and sensible way out of this mess. As I say, we won’t close the colleges down, but we’ll get them running on a reasonable and efficient footing.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Context—trade skills shortages, and funding
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The whole comic tragedy of the Australian technical Colleges needs to be seen in the context of the serious shortage of skilled tradespeople that Australia faces.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We sorely need more qualified tradespeople. It’s a pity that this Government chose to set up a political stunt, rather than to be serious about redressing the funding shortfall in public TAFE and in public schools.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In 1997 the Howard Government cut funding to public TAFE. Commonwealth funding decreased by 13% over the years 1997 to 2000. The increase in the subsequent four years was a miserly 1%.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government’s own estimates put the projected shortfall in skilled workers over the next five years as high as 200 000.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A large proportion of existing tradespeople are due to retire in the next decade or so—they are baby-boomers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Over 400 000 workers in the statistical category “tradespersons and related workers” are aged over 45.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These valuable skilled workers have to be replaced. We are not turning out nearly enough of them. The Government seems to think it can get away with importing skills through use of the 457 visa program but that is not a sustainable long-term option.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia needs to train up our own young people for careers in the trades.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Comparison with Commonwealth funding for TAFE
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I have said that the ATC program borders on the farcical. Just take a look at these figures and tell me I’m right:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         The Government says it’s going to fund 10 000 students at Australian technical Colleges. Over four years, that will cost the taxpayer more than $550 000.
        </li>
        <li>
         At the same time, it has announced that it is funding 128 000 additional training places in the TAFE system. How much will the Commonwealth contribute to funding those 128 000 students? Just $215 million—less than half the amount it’s shelling out for just 10 000 students in ATCs.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        This beggars belief. It proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that the Australian Technical Colleges program is no more and no less than a shabby political stunt—and a mighty expensive one at that.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is irresponsible to waste taxpayers’ money like this. It is hollow vote-grabbing. The Government should hang its head in shame.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In contrast to the Government, Labor is serious about addressing the magnitude of the current skills crisis for all Australians.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Labor believes that Australia must focus on areas of maximum impact, including:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         TAFEs, which remain responsible for the substantial majority of post-secondary VET;
        </li>
        <li>
         VET in Schools; and
        </li>
        <li>
         On-the-job trades training.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Labor has already announced a 10 year, $2.5 billion
        <i>
         Trades Training Centres
        </i>
        plan aimed at the 1.2 million students in Years 9, 10, 11 and 12 in all of Australia’s 2,650 secondary schools.
       </p>

        By contrast, I remind you, the Government’s own estimates show that a maximum of 10,000 students are expected to graduate from the ATCs by 2010.

        The Labor plan will provide secondary schools with between $500,000 and $1.5 million to build or upgrade VET facilities in order to keep kids in school, to enhance the profile and quality of VET in schools and to provide real career paths to trades and apprenticeships for students.

        Conclusion
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As I noted at the outset of my remarks, despite our serious misgivings about the ATC program, a Labor Government will not close down existing Australian Technical Colleges. We will honour all current contracts with providers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But we
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WILL" rel="nofollow">
         WILL
        </a>
        move to transform this misguided stunt of a program into a genuine part of Australia’s education and training system. We will work with the states and territories, and with private providers, to achieve this.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We will put an end to the waste of taxpayers’ money that characterises this program.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        At the same time, as I have outlined, we will take definite and concrete steps to improve the supply of skilled workers—to provide the skills that are essential to Australia’s future prosperity.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We will educate and train Australians so that all can play a part in the great enterprise of creating a future for our nation based on innovation. That’s Labor’s vision for tomorrow’s Australia.

         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          This is largely to account for an additional 3 further colleges.

         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          The flaws of this policy and of ATC’s not withstanding, many of these colleges are now established and open, albeit with far fewer students than expected or desired, and at far greater cost per student than would have been the case if the existing
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">

         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          In view of the continual attacks on all higher education funding by the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Government" rel="nofollow">
           Howard Government
          </a>
          , Labor have accepted these colleges and supported the concept, albeit with reservations. Any additional funds for our higher education sector are welcome so this bill is supported.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          The Howard Government has presided over ongoing cuts to
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VET" rel="nofollow">
           VET
          </a>
          funding that have seen hundreds of thousands of young Australians denied a place in college.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          The Howard Government has, despite many loud and clear warnings allowed the number of trainees and apprentices to fall to the stage where we as a nation are now confronting a massive skills shortage which is severely hampering our productivity and growth.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          They of course claim this is not so and that numbers of trainees have risen, but they ignore the fact that the bulk of any increase is in non traditional trade areas, such as retail or fast food outlet trainees.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          They ignore too the fact that many of those commencing training are not actually finishing the course for whatever reason.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          It is in the traditional trade areas, such as construction, manufacturing and mining that major shortages exist.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          It is putting at risk our future productivity and prosperity.

          were devised as policy on the run, and announced with minimal planning or consultation.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          They were devised as a means of competing against existing Labor state and territory TAFE systems with a requirement for staff to be on
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWA" rel="nofollow">
           AWA

          ’s. So they were governed not by any sound educational reasoning but pure Liberal ideology.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          They were far too little and too late, and as so often happens with policy on the run they were established in a hurry, with inadequate planning and time.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          A report by the ANOA, released in July, into these ATC’s found that too little attention had been paid to state and territory governments; initial tender processes and applications were weak and inadequate and that there had been limited choice among applicants.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          In nearly half of the first 24 colleges there were as few as 1 or 2 applications. A fairly under whelming response from the business world.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          The
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANAO" rel="nofollow">
           ANAO
          </a>
          found that in one region the program had to address significant issues because of the co existence of a new college with existing State schools.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          The ANAO found that the Commonwealth should have carried out greater risk assessments of organisations bidding to set up and run the colleges.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          None of this should have been surprising as applications were largely from businesses or groups thereof who, with all the best will in the world, were totally inexperienced at submitting for educational facilities.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Additional work had been required with the Department on many applications in order to finalise them with proper costing or business plans.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          The ANOA believed that many applications were so weak that a better option may have been to return to the market and try again. However, as usual with this complacent and arrogant government they refused to consider doing this.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          While an average school may well be up to 4 years in the planning and establishment, four of these ATC’s were open within just 6 months of being approved. Again government claims this as a positive move—but the ANAO report held otherwise.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          As a result these ATC’s, first announced as part of the 2004 election promises, have not produced one graduate—that is 3 years and nearly half a billion dollars down the track. Indeed there is no immediate sign of any graduates even this year.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          The ATC’s have been at best a poor policy also badly executed and at worst a cynical political exercise
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          There are still well under 2000 students enrolled while the target was for some 7500. Again the Minister tries to put sufficient spin on this fact to claim they are well on target for enrolments. Sad for the government their spin doctors are running out of words.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Most of those colleges that are open have to outsource the bulk of their training to existing schools, TAFE’s or other
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Registered_Training_Organisations" rel="nofollow">
           Registered Training Organisations
          </a>
          as only one third of them are actually registered training organisations in their own right.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Furthermore, to add insult to injury not all students enrolled have been able to find employers to give them apprenticeships, which was an essential part of this concept. Despite government claims of great acceptance by business of these colleges, this seems not be wholly true either.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Critics say that these colleges duplicated existing state programs, government estimates of enrolments had been over estimated and costs had blown out. All of these are of course absolutely true.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Many then are in effect “virtual colleges” with a staff only of administrators, but no teachers or actual facilities other than an office or so.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Despite this the government still try to blame the skills shortage on the states for past neglect and insist that these colleges are going great guns. This despite the fact that enrolments in traditional State and Territory TAFE colleges continue to rise while ATC’s struggle to get the numbers.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Just how out of touch with national needs and lack of progress can you get? How much spin can a government try to bamboozle the electorate? Fortunately for Australia it seems that the nation has ceased to believe or accept the vast amounts of spin put on reality by an out of touch and out of favour government.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          The Australian Technical Colleges were a political fix for what was a long running policy failing, and so it is not surprising that they are nowhere near achieving a solution to our skills shortage, neither will they, with under 10000 graduates expected by 2010 while the government even admits to a skills shortage of 200,000 workers in the next 5 years.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          In order to seriously address the skills shortage Australia must invest in the existing TAFE’s which continue to deliver the vast bulk of post secondary VET.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          We need to put more resources into VET in schools and on the job training.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Only Labor has such a positive policy proposal for Trades Training Centres aimed at the one million students from year 9 up in our secondary schools.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          This will give all secondary students a chance of working and learning in the traditional trades areas.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          They will be assisted to access one day a week of on the job training, all of which will go towards their Job Ready Certificate.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Despite all the shortcomings of ATC’s as policy, Labor will not close any of them.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          While the establishment of 3 more colleges in an election year could be seen just as a cynical political move, any TAFE funding increase is better than what has happened over the past decade.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Labor will support this bill but condemns the Federal Government for failing to act to address the growing skills needs of the national economy.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          But this Government has failed to ensure that young Australians could get the skills training they need for skilled jobs.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          It has cut funding to VET by 13% from 1997 to 2000 and only increasing by 1% from 2000 to 2004, and created an expensive and duplicative network of stand alone Australian Technical Colleges with little consultation or cooperation with the states and territories.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          The best this government can do is appropriate half a billion dollars for 30 colleges that will at best produce only 10000 graduates by 2010 when the government itself estimates a skill shortage of 200,000 skilled workers and it’s record will show that it has put at risk the future of so many young Australians and our future prosperity.

           spoke to a second reading amendment on 7 February and again on 9 August this year, expressing his concerns…concerns about the program’s value and effectiveness, but also its inefficient and very costly implementation to date at the expense of an already established—though neglected—vocational training infrastructure.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           I, too, have previously addressed the issues related to the Government’s hasty policy making and implementation with regard to skills training.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           There are 21 ATCs currently operating. Four more are to open in 2008, with the three new ATCs to commence operations in 2009.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Current estimates show that 8,400 students will be enrolled across Australia when all ATCs are fully operational which is expected to be in 2009.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           8,400 students enrolled…However, it is estimated that more than 200,000 skilled workers will be needed in Australia over the next five years.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Indeed, according to the Government’s own projections, 240,000 more skilled workers will be needed by 2016.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           And the first graduate from the Australian Technical Colleges is not expected until 2010.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           And my research reveals that when these students graduate from the ATC, they will have the approximate equivalent of one third of an apprenticeship… what this means is that graduates will likely have approximately one and half years of a three to four year apprenticeship …
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           So in fact, even those graduating from an Australian Technical College in 2010, will be between two and three years away from being the skilled workers we so desperately need …
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           So what has the

           been doing for 11 years to address Australia’s skills shortage?

          <p class="italic">
           In the year 2005, the unmet demand for education and training places in

            TAFE

          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           In the same year, the unmet demand in the whole of the vocational education training sector was 45,100. These are not just figures; these are 45,100 real people with real families who wanted to embark on training to gain skills…real people who were turned away.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Forty-five thousand Australians who potentially could have graduated as skilled workers this year or next year …
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           There have also been concerns raised about the overall impact on the institutions already up and running in the TAFE and
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VET" rel="nofollow">

           sectors, which could be providing the skills training …
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           The average expenditure for each student who goes through the Australian technical colleges will exceed by thousands of dollars the average expenditure for each student in TAFE.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           In addition to the set-up and operational costs that we are discussing here today, Australian technical colleges are entitled to all of the funding available to schools under the Schools Assistance (Learning Together—Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Act 2004.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           They are also entitled to general recurrent funding per student, most of them at the non-government school rate.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           They will also have available to them targeted funding for special programs and capital funding.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           The ATCs will also receive the relevant state funding. And they will receive all this, while the Howard government fails to make a genuine commitment to our existing TAFE system.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Instead of working in partnership with already established vocational providers and tapping into the existing expertise to maximise training outcomes, the Howard government embarked upon a course of its own …
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           So what led to us standing here today, what was the process and why are we back here again amending this Bill …
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           There is no doubt that the establishment and operation of ATCs has not gone to plan.

            DEST

           invited submissions from consortia—which included government and non-government schools, registered training organisations, local councils, industry bodies and local businesses—to establish colleges. The closing date was 20 May 2005. This allowed a period of some seven weeks for the preparation of submissions! A total of 73 proposals were received, four after the closing date. All were assessed by DEST.

           (
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANAO" rel="nofollow">
            ANAO
           </a>
           ) Report released—two months ago—clearly sets out the problems that have resulted from the Government’s approach.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Among other issues, the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditor_General" rel="nofollow">
            Auditor General
           </a>
           refers to the inadequate period of time allocated for the planning and implementation of the program.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           The ANAO report raises concern about this haste stating:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           “The policy provided DEST with little time to plan for the establishment of the colleges. The new schools had to be established in far less time than is usual for new schools, which can take three to four years of preparation before acceptance of their first students.  This limited time made more difficult DEST’s tasks of selecting the best educational and financial models to achieve the programme’s objectives.”
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Among the consequences of this were:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            Insufficient time to allow the preparation of well-developed, thoroughly costed proposals … resulting, in many instances, in little or no choice in consortia available to DEST;
           </li>
           <li>
            Inadequate consultation with state and territory government education authorities and relevant organisations, with the result that existing systems and infrastructure have been duplicated.
The Auditor General states that a formal, ongoing strategy to deal with the interests of State and Territory governments ‘would have been beneficial’, as these are key stakeholders in implementing the program and have, after all, experience in the provision of secondary schooling;
           </li>
           <li>
            Duplication of curriculum areas: each ATC develops its own training curriculum for the same, small number of trades and small numbers of students—which is both time consuming and costly;
           </li>
           <li>
            Waste of public funds in pursuit of a quick political fix: of the five colleges visited during the audit, the Auditor General examined two in detail; DEST advised him that each of the two colleges were required to open with minimal planning in order to meet the very tight establishment time…and that each had to rent and refurbish premises for one or two years while permanent buildings were designed or identified;
           </li>
           <li>
            Development of policy ‘on the run’: as the Report acknowledges, given the short period allowed for planning and implementation of the ATCs …

DEST was obliged to develop policy and procedures ‘as the program progressed’;
           </li>
           <li>
            Over estimation of the number of students to be enrolled in 2006: three of the first five operating ATCs signed Funding Agreements in December 2005 and one of these opened in August 2006. As the Audit Report comments, ‘signing Funding Agreements close to the opening date and not commencing at the start of the school year is likely to adversely impact on the number of enrolments’ .
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="italic">
           There are also issues related to the Government’s direct funding of the consortia via Funding Agreements.
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            A significant number of initial business plans and proposed budgets required additional work.

DEST informed the Government that although successful applicants could be announced, this further work would be required before DEST could finalise Funding Agreements.
To announce ‘successful’ consortia for short-term political purposes, in circumstances such as these, shows a very nonchalant disregard of proper financial management;
           </li>
           <li>
            The Audit Report notes that the typical
Funding Agreement ‘provides funding by way of grants based on the application of the
individual college, not by the use of
a formula based on student numbers;

Given the number of students currently enrolled—only 1800 in total—this strategy can hardly represent acceptable deployment of taxpayers’ monies;
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="italic">
           The Auditor General’s report reveals that ATCs leasing land or buildings, or carrying out capital improvements with public funds, are obliged under the Funding Agreement to enter into a Purposes Agreement with the Commonwealth—if requested by DEST.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           In one instance documented in the ANAO Report, an ATC had spent approximately $M6 refurbishing a leased property, but no Purposes Agreement had been signed. The landowner in this instance was known to the Commonwealth to be an established institution.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Cleary, though, neglecting to execute a Purposes Agreement in such circumstances must increase the risk that the Commonwealth would have limited recourse to funded assets, in the event that an ATC ceased to operate on, or before completion of, a Funding Agreement.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           This episode provides yet more evidence that the scheme has been poorly thought out and implemented, and is fraught with potential difficulties such as those I have just outlined.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           I understand that conflicts of interest have emerged and that mingling of operational and capital funding has occurred. When asked about a particular instance, DEST advised the
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Auditor General, significantly, that:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           ‘In this case the imperative to establish the College quickly determined the need to procure items urgently … to meet the very tight establishment time frames … DEST went on to say These colleges have been required to open a school with minimal planning time… It is inevitable that no existing buildings would satisfy the educational requirements of the colleges, thus refurbishment has been necessary in all such instances… DEST concluded saying This approach reflects the Government’s objective to open the colleges as quickly as possible …’;
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            In another instance outlined in the Report, potential conflicts of interest around leasing, employment and the provision of services emerged in an ATC.

While a subsequent inquiry revealed no undue gain to companies associated with ATC board members, the Audit Report indicates that competitive quotes and a rental valuation had not been obtained, and no formal contracts had been entered into by the parties.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="italic">
           The dangers inherent in such a hasty approach, coupled with insufficient scrutiny of transactions, need hardly be spelt out.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           The Auditor General’s Report reveals also:
          </p>
          <ul>
           <li>
            undue haste
           </li>
           <li>
            poor planning
           </li>
           <li>
            insufficient consultation
           </li>
           <li>
            duplication of resources
           </li>
           <li>
            inattention to issues of governance and risk
           </li>
           <li>
            ever-increasing cost
           </li>
           <li>
            inadequate levels of operational scrutiny,
           </li>
           <li>
            and potential for the loss of objectivity in decision making with regard to public funds.
           </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="italic">
           The process applied in the establishment of the Australian Technical Colleges is another example of how this government has neglected, downgraded and failed to act in so many areas … until compelled by electoral imperatives, of course—with the result being, poorly drafted legislation and planning that is rushed …
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           For 11 years under this government vocational education and skills training have been systematically neglected—more accurately, systematically downgraded…

          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           The Government has squandered the goodwill and co-operation of education partners in its pursuit of ideological goals, and is reaping a pitiful harvest in the form of an ever more pressing skills crisis in this country.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Once out of touch and complacent, now out of touch and panic-stricken, this government has failed time and time again to deal with the real issues that confront families and workers every day.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           High among these, as I have said, are the skills shortage that continues to critically impact Australian industry, and the need for effective skills training—now and in the years to come.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">

           would maintain the established ATCs but would transfer their management into the state-based skills and training education system…this could include the TAFE system, the Catholic or Independent Secondary system, an industry skills and training arrangement or  even industry itself. And this would be done through consultation with all interested parties and as contractual agreements allow.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           And a Labor government would provide $2.5 billion in capital funding over 10 years to build new trades training centres in Australia’s secondary schools to promote vocational education for students in Years 9 to 12.

            Now the skills crises did not just happen over night—the skills crisis we know has arisen as a result of complacency and neglect by this government—despite warnings for many years about skills shortages.  This Government has presided over a skills shortage of 200,000 and what do we see from the Australian Technical Colleges initiative. These colleges will see less than 10,000 graduates by 2010.

           <p class="italic">
            Labor will not oppose the bill, as we are willing to support, in principle measures that are, in theory, aimed at addressing the skills crisis facing our country.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Indeed not withstanding the flaws of the Government’s ATC plan, Labor has committed not to close the colleges down, if elected.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Enough money has been wasted already duplicating infrastructure for the purposes of political gain.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            So Labor will not be tearing up contracts.  We won’t be closing ATCs.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Labor is committed to sitting down with relevant parties when the contracts do expire to work out the best and most appropriate way of folding the management of the ATC’s into the state based systems.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            This just makes sense. Why have separate systems working against each other that are working towards achieving the same goal?

           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Indeed according to the Governments own figures, Australia will face a shortage of more than 200,000 skilled workers over the next five years.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Why?  Because for 11 long years the Government has chosen to sit on its hand and to under invest in traditional trades training.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Because it decided to slash funding to the existing state-based
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
             TAFE
            </a>
            systems ,with commonwealth revenues in vocational education decreasing—when they should have been increasing—by 13% between 1997-2000 and only increasing by a pitiful 1% from 2000-2004.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Indeed it has been estimated that the Governments grave neglect and under funding in this area has resulted in over 325,000 people—seeking trades training and skills—being forcibly turned away from TAFE training facilities since 1996.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            There is not doubt that the Howard Governments neglect of the traditional trades is responsible for the situation we find ourselves in today.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            And the Government’s solution?
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            To establish around 28  ATC’s in  ‘nominated’ regions around the country—90% of which are unsurprisingly located in marginal electorates—such as Bass and Braddon, in Tasmania, at a cost of around half a billion dollars.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            They have chosen snub and shun the existing state-based TAFE system—preferring to spend tax-payers dollars on building duplicate facilities to compete with that of the states.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            The result?
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            After three years and more than half and billion dollars the Governments ATC’s the fact are these:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             have not yet produced a single graduate
            </li>
            <li>
             Only 1800 enrolments
            </li>
            <li>
             Just two out of 21 colleges are meeting their 2007 enrolment targets
            </li>
            <li>
             An average cost of nearly $175,000 per student
            </li>
            <li>
             Only one third of colleges legally registered to provide training; and
            </li>
            <li>
             Outsource the bulk of their training to TAFEs or registered training organisations.
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p class="italic">
            Indeed according to the Minister for Vocational and Further Education only nine of the current 21 colleges have no involvement with the TAFE system. So what exactly is the ½ billion in tax-payers money actually going to?
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            With currently only 1,800 enrolments on total, and some colleges struggling to find apprentices for students that have enrolled—it does not look like there is much end in sight to the skills crisis facing Australia.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            This is the Government’s answer to the skills crisis problem it has created over the past eleven years. This is the best that it could come up with.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            This is so typical of this government—a government that for a long time now has and will continue to under invest in essential ‘infrastructure’ such as trades training.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            It just proves that for a long time now—this government has been hiding behind the economic prosperity of the mining boom—but yet has had no real plan for the future.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            And here we are—three years on from the 2004 political stunt that is the ATCs and with another federal election looming all we have from this Government is to duplicate the states trades training system, spend millions of dollars doing it and not even produce one single graduate!
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            And it is not just in the case of trades training that the Governments lack of vision for the future is being exposed.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            It has for the past 11 years it has placed its head in the sand and denied the reality and threat of climate change.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            It has failed to come up with a ‘broadband’ solution for all Australians.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            And it has ignored the struggle faced by many families around Australia when it comes to managing their everyday living costs—whether it be paying the mortgage, rent, or paying for childcare, groceries and petrol.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            This Government just does not get it. It has proven that it does not comprehend what is needed in the short term to ease the pressure on working families in this country—many of which are at breaking point—or what is needed in the long-term keep our economy strong after the mining boom diminishes.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Indeed, the way in which it has chosen to respond, after 11 long years on neglect, to the skills crisis facing this country is illustrative of just how this government operates- slapping together a political appeasing, short-term policy targeted at voters in marginal electorates in an attempt to ensure that they retain power at the next election.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            There is no long-term plan for the future, no genuine commitment to overcoming the problem faced and no real policy that is likely to bring about real results.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            It is the lack of results and the duplication of the state based system that has led to Labor retaining strong reservations about the effectiveness of the Australian Technical Colleges program and its capacity to genuinely combat the severe shortage of skilled labour in the country.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Enrolment figures discovered during Budget Estimates reveal that just two of the 21 existing colleges are meeting their enrolment targets.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Indeed the combined total of enrolments for the two Northern Tasmanian campuses located in Burnie and Launceston is just 120, 55 students short of the 175 student target.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            So what is this going to mean?
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Economic growth in areas like that of Burnie and Devonport on the North-
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast" rel="nofollow">
             West Coast
            </a>
            of Tasmania that are currently experiencing a period of increased development will stunted because there is simply just not enough skilled tradesmen to keep up with the amount of work on offer.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Indeed this situation is not confined to the North-West- it is one relative to the whole state, with the Tasmanian Survey of Business Expectations for the March quarter 2007 noting that “the availability of suitable qualified employees continues to be the number one constraint on business.” in Tasmania.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Therefore government’s decision to opt for this short-term, ‘band-aid’ solution to the problem is not only failing to overcome the skills shortage, it is
            <i>
             preventing and stifling
            </i>
            economic growth in regional centres all across the country.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            And what’s more, it is not only preventing economic growth but it is denying people that want to take advantage of jobs created through increased development the opportunity to work, because they are unable to access the requisite trades training.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            These are the kind of situations that we have to look forward to under the Government’s short-sighted, politically motivated plan.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            It is clear that the immediate solution to such a skills shortage is not going to be found in the technical college program- with enrolments not even coming close to refecting the demand for skilled labour.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Skill shortages are holding back businesses and denying opportunities to young Australians:

           <p class="italic">
            What is needed is an approach that utilises existing institutions and structures and allows kids to receive the training they require, right from high school.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            In contrast to the Government’s approach, Labor has announced that its $2.5 billion Trades Training Centres plan aimed at helping the 1 million students in Years 9, 10, 11 and 12 in all of Australia’s 2,650 secondary schools access trades-based training.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            The plan will provide secondary schools with between $500,000 and $1.5 million to build or upgrade trades training facilities and provide $84 million to ensure all vocational education and trades training students get one day a week of on the job training for 20 weeks a year.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            It will also see the development of new Job Ready Certificate as a statement of a student’s readiness for work in addition to a Year 12 Certificate and any separate vocational education and training qualification.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Labor’s plan is aimed at tackling the skills crisis head on, by providing all Australian’s with the opportunity to access trades-based training- not just those that live in marginal electorates.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            And of course

           <p class="italic">
            Skills Australia, will be an independent statutory body to advise government on fixing the nation’s skills crisis—which is expected to worsen.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Government’s own research shows we will need 240,000 more skilled workers by 2016 to ensure our economic future.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Skills Australia will play a central role to ensure we lock in a full-employment economy and developing a highly skilled and innovative workforce for the future.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Skills Australia will provide government with recommendations about the future skill needs of the country.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            The recommendations made by Skills Australia will help inform government decisions to encourage skill formation and drive ongoing reform to make our education and training system more responsive to business and economic needs of the nation.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Skills Australia will make sure that the skills crisis we are currently suffering from doesn’t happen again—because Labor will have a national approach to it.

            For too long, this government has neglected to acknowledge the crucial role that workers with trades based qualifications play in keep this country running and afloat.
           </p>

            This neglect is reflected not only in their under funding of trades training over the past eleven years but also in their

             Industrial Relations
            </a>

           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            A Government that respected and acknowledged the hard work and long hours that the majority of these trades-based workers put in would not put in place laws that take away their basic rights and conditions.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Workers in trade-based industries—such as plumbers and electricians—because of the nature of the industry—more often than not are forced to work long hours in substandard conditions to get jobs done.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            They often incur situations that put then in a relative degree of danger and are forced to be on call during traditional non-working hour times.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            These are the people that keep things running in our towns and cities—they are the ones behind the scenes-making sure everything works and are often the one’s called upon to  avert disaster.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            They should be not only valued but acknowledged for the vital role they play.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            But for eleven long years the government has chosen to neglect the valuable role that such workers play—by under investing in trades based training and stripping many existing tradies of their basic rights and conditions in the work place.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            This Government after eleven long years in power—roaming the corridors of parliament—have lost touch with the people of Australia and what is needed to see this country prosper into the future.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            They have forgotten what it really takes to make things work in this country.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Labor has committed to keeping the existing ATC’s open, if it wins the election.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Labor also has chosen to support this bill, not wanting to deny any initiative aimed at in theory aiding the skills shortage in the country.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            But when all is said and done the Governments ATC’s policy proves one thing—that this is a government that is short-sighted, election driven and out of touch.

             As a growing body of evidence shows, long-term social and economic outcomes are significantly influenced by the investment that nations make in the education and training of their people.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             On measures of pre-school, school, vocational and tertiary education research, Australia has fallen well behind its competitors. We need an education revolution. We must lift the quantity of investment in education and the quality of education outcomes.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             We cannot afford to waste the talent and potential of any Australian. We must set for ourselves a new national vision—for Australia to become the most educated country, the most skilled economy and the best trained workforce in the world.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             Labor believes that Australia’s economic prosperity can only be guaranteed by training a highly-skilled workforce. Vocational education and training helps Australians develop skills to obtain and perform effectively in secure, sustainable and satisfying employment, and to use those skills to ensure our national economic prosperity. Labor will invest in those skills.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             While Labor supports additional expenditure in the critical area of vocational education and training, we recognise that the Australian technical Colleges are a political, duplicative response, and, in essence, do not address the serious skills shortage in Australia.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             By the governments own estimates, Australia faces a skills shortage of more than 200,000 skilled workers over the next 5 years. Again, using the Governments own figures,

              540,000 young Australians aged 16-24 were not engaged full time in work or learning.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              That’s a disgraceful waste when skilled labour is so scarce.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              So completion rates must be improved.

             <p class="italic">
              To do that, education and training must be made more relevant.

             <p class="italic">
              The social and economic consequences of not doing so are dramatic.

             <p class="italic">

             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              In 2004 the Howard Government—again recognising the folly of its funding cuts in the face of skill shortages—announced it would create 24 new technical colleges across Australia.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              These colleges were to be located in industrial growth areas.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              That’s code for areas of political interest to the Government’s electoral ambitions.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              So the new colleges have been set down for, Northern Perth, Southern Perth, Queanbeyan (in the marginal electorate of Eden Monaro), ditto Northern Tasmania,

              , Northern Adelaide and so on and on the list goes.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Twenty one of these colleges are now operating and this Bill will bring the total to 28.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Eventually, 8400 students will be enrolled to complete the final two years of school while working as apprentices.

             <p class="italic">
              Currently, 21 are operational with 1800 students attending.

             <p class="italic">
              That’s way below the target.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Normally, one would expect any added investment in education to be welcomed with great acclaim.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              The chronic need in technical training I’ve already referred to.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              But in this case—just as with the Mersey hospital—it makes no sense at all.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              The simple failure is that all Australian states have technical education programs of rapidly increasing size and quality.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              This Howard Government adventure is nothing but duplication.

             <p class="italic">
              Moreover, it’s expensive duplication.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              An estimate is that the cost per student of this model is $175,000 per head.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              So question becomes:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Why has the Prime Minister embarked on this crazy program, knowing there’s an existing system of technical education, growing in quality and competence?
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              The answer is simple:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              The complete failure of the Howard Government to work with the states, which have the constitutional authority.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              One might ask: why haven’t the states co-operated?

             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              I regret to say the ANAO report struggles, as it must, to deal with the real issues with this ATC program.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              That’s because the policy is given.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              And it’s not the role of the ANAO to be critical of that policy, no matter how stupid and illogical it might be.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              It is possible, however, to read between the lines because all the inferences of political imperative are writ large …
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Though disguised in top-class bureaucratese.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Nowhere is the political imperative more obvious than in the speed with which this program was established.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              The ex-minister (as he is now), was hardly one for niceties, such as the process and detail necessary to establish such a program from scratch.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Knowing the reputation of that minister serves only to add to our suspicion.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              As we know he’s no longer a minister.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              And that’s quite a feat in the Howard Government.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              May I suggest, the ANAO’s comment, that:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              “Such ventures might normally be expected to take several years rather than 18 months” is code for concern that lots of corners were cut.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Indeed they were.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Later audits undertaken, when the political imperative has subsided, might see a more critical and forensic examination of such shortcomings.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              The ANAO, however, is very polite.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              For example, the lack of cooperation with state governments, resulting in this duplication, is expressed in a recommendation that:

              In other words,

             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              But there are plenty of other clues about problems which are worth noting.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              For example, concern for the capacity of commercial organisations, unfamiliar with Commonwealth tendering and contracting policy, to comply with financial agreements.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              In other words, the risks were not properly taken into consideration, so what improprieties were there?
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              There’s also some understated concerns at capital investment being inappropriate.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Especially in property of third parties without protection of the Commonwealth interest.

             <p class="italic">
              It shows a failure to assess the supply of educational facilities with respect to existing state resources.

              That’s what happens with wasteful duplication.

             <p class="italic">
              And that’s another sign of impetuosity and political desperation.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Reading between the lines of this ANAO report, I suspect there’s much more to be revealed.
             </p>

              Apart from the obvious matters I’ve referred to already:

             <p class="italic">
              That’s because it’s Labor policy that these extravagant new colleges be transferred to the states.

               to invest in measures aimed at meeting the future skills needs of the nation and promoting the value of trade based education.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               The additional funding provided under this Bill will ensure that a further three
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Technical_Colleges" rel="nofollow">
                Australian Technical Colleges
               </a>
               can be established in the regions of greater Penrith, northern Perth and southern Brisbane, adding to the existing 25 Colleges that have already been announced by the Government. These three new regions all have strong local industry support for the establishment of Colleges and have high unmet demand for skilled labour and many young people.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               The benefit of these Colleges to these regions cannot be overstated. Once fully operational, up to 450 students will graduate from the additional Colleges every year. These young people will achieve their senior secondary certificate, as well as being up to one third of their way through an apprenticeship in a trade that is in an industry of need in their region. These students will be highly trained, having had exposure to the same state-of-the-art equipment used by industry. They will also be highly motivated, having had a high level of tailored support and mentoring that would not be available to them at other schools. They will have a strong foundation to continue with their preferred trade, having already worked in that industry area for up to two years and having received a specialised education that incorporates enterprise education, small business and employability skills.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               The Australian Technical Colleges can only achieve these outcomes and become centres of excellence, lighthouses in trade training, if they are appropriately resourced.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               The funding committed by the Government to the programme, $530.9 million over 7 years, shows how serious this Government is about raising the profile of vocational and technical education. This level of funding ensures that each College has the capacity to develop or access the latest machinery and equipment, and to employ or engage highly experienced and qualified teaching and vocational training staff. As these Colleges are specialised institutions, they are also able to offer a flexible and fully integrated education and training programme that allows students to complete the requirements of a senior secondary education and undertake trade training in a Certificate Ill Australian School-based Apprenticeship. As a result, students will be exposed to more realistic work experiences which will assist them in making a smoother transition into a full-time Australian Apprenticeship at the end of Year 12.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               The Australian Technical Colleges programme will also go towards addressing the mistakes made 20 to 30 years ago when as a community we started to talk down the trades and we closed all the technical high schools around the country. About 60% of our modern workforce needs a high quality technical education. Currently only 30% have these skills. The Colleges will help to re-balance who does what, and help restore pride and excellence in trade skills training for young people. Encouraging more young people to consider a career in the traditional trades and to participate in the training is a vital and positive development for the training system as a whole.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               Currently, 21 Colleges are already operating and more than 1,800 students are benefiting from the high quality education and training that the Colleges offer. This shows that the Australian people have recognised not only the benefits of the Colleges but also the benefits that a trade based and focused education can offer young people. The fact that five State Governments have followed the lead of the Australian Government by establishing their own trade schools is recognition of the importance to Australia’s future of having a pool of qualified trades people available to meet future skills needs.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               Four more Colleges are expected to open in 2008, and the three additional Colleges that will be supported through the passage of this Bill will open in 2009. Industry, business and community support for the Colleges are the key reasons why Colleges have been able to be established in such short time frames. It normally takes an average of about three years to establish a new school. Yet the majority of the Australian Technical Colleges have been able to commence operations in a period of less than 18 months.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               Industry leadership has proved to be the right model for the Colleges. Each College is driven by local industry, and responds directly to the specific needs of industry. This leadership not only ensures that students are trained and educated according to current industry requirements, it also facilitates the Colleges ability to network with local industry to promote the benefits of Australian School-based Apprenticeship arrangements and work directly with employers to determine the best model for on-the-job training. Already, students and employers are seeing the benefits of such partnerships and over the years the relationship with industry will only grow and improve the outcomes of the Colleges. This close alignment will also enhance young people’s prospects for further training and career development now and into the future within their local region.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               Passage of this Bill will provide the necessary $74.701 million funding to develop an Australian Technical College in another three key regions of Australia and provide opportunities for young people that will not only improve their long term prospects but also the future of the region in which they live. It is clear that in the coming years, there will be a huge demand for Australians with trade and technical skills. The Australian Government recognises this situation and has implemented a number of initiatives to address this matter. The Australian Technical Colleges programme is just one of these initiatives and support for this Bill is crucial to the success of the programme.
