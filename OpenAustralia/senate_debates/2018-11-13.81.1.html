Media reports also reveal that private investigators had to be hired to serve the senator's former chief of staff with a subpoena to produce documents and give evidence in the Federal Court. When was the minister first aware that her former chief of staff was served with a subpoena? Has she discussed the matter with him?

         I thank Senator Watt for the question. Senator Watt, you know more than I do, because I've only just been informed of that matterâ€”by you. Whether or not it's true, I have no idea, but I'll take it on your word that it is. I have not discussed it with my former chief of staff, but I also would make the point that he is a private citizen, and it is sub judice. Also, Senator Watt, you would be aware that you can issue a subpoena to anyone. It does not mean that they actually had information that is relevant to the case. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWU" rel="nofollow">
          AWU
         </a>
         may well want to subpoena Mr Shorten, for example, to ask him, 'Did you authorise the $25,000 donation that you gave to your own campaign?' The AWU may wish to subpoena Mr Shorten to answer the question, 'Did you authorise the $100,000 that you gave to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GetUp" rel="nofollow">
          GetUp
         </a>
         ! that was the money of the member of the AWU?' They are the fundamental questions, and those on the other side have asked a lot of questions in relation to Mr Morrison over events that occurred some time ago. Well, maybe Mr Shorten ought to front up. The AWU can subpoena him, because you can subpoena anybody.

           Yes, a point of order on direct relevance: this minister is the last person who should be talking about 'fronting up'. The question had nothing to do with the issues she's raised. It goes to the subpoena of her chief of staff in relation to events that occurred whilst he was her chief of staff.

             subpoenas. I advised Senator Watt that I wasn't aware of what he just stated. I also advised him that you can actually subpoena anybody; there is no law against that. In fact, there is a law that allows you to do that. And perhaps the AWU would like to subpoena Mr Shorten so that he can absolutely give evidenceâ€”once and for allâ€”that yes, he did or he didn't authorise the $25,000 he gave to his own campaign and authorise properly, in accordance with union rules, the $100,000 he gave to

                    Senator Cash has also been subpoenaed to appear in the Federal Court but has publicly indicated that she has instructed her taxpayer funded lawyers to challenge the subpoena. Does this remain the senator's position? What does the senator have to hide?

                     Absolutely nothing. My position has been made incredibly clear from day one. Senator Watt, I'm not about to play out a court process here, because it is sub judice, but, as I've already stated, you do know you can subpoena anyone. There is no law against it. In fact, there is actually a law that allows it.
