           I thank the chamber. As Senator Carr himself, the then Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, said at Senate estimates on 3 June 2008 in relation to Labor cutting the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
            CSIRO
           </a>
           budget and closing CSIRO locations:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           ... the government has made the budgetary decision. The implementation issues are matters for the CSIRO and the board. The CSIRO board has to sign off on these decisions.
          </p>
          <p>
           When asked about the shutting down of the CSIRO Rockhampton site, he said:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           I have had representations on the site and a number of members of parliament have drawn to my attention the importance of the facility. The simple fact of the matter is that these budget changes have been made as a result of decisions of government and that $63 million over four years has to be found by the organisation.
          </p>
          <p>
           The CSIRO is an independent statutory agency governed by a board of directors. The board, in conjunction with senior management, are responsible for operations, including staffing and setting the CSIRO's priorities. Advice from the CSIRO is that there will be no net job losses overall across the agency. There have been no changes in government funding to the CSIRO. Any suggestion that this was as a result of changes to the CSIRO budget is incorrect.

              I rise to speak on notice of motion No. 1153 regarding cuts to the

               CSIRO
              </a>
              . I note that in December last year our Prime Minister, in a statement on his National Innovation and Science Agenda, said:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Our businesses, universities and research organisations like the CSIRO are also among the best in the world.
             </p>
             <p>
              He also announced $1.1 billion to incentivise innovation and entrepreneurship, reward risk-taking and promote science, maths and computing in schools by focusing on our four priority areas, yet in the same breath the

               PM
              </a>
              allows the CSIRO to shed 275 jobs Australia wide, undermining decades of incredible innovation. This move will have a particularly devastating effect on my home state of Tasmania, with 35 scientists expected to lose their jobs. At a time when jobs and good economic management is crucial in Tasmania, it seems incomprehensible the government would cut highly skilled jobs. With dwindling job opportunities, Tasmanian scientists will have no choice but to move interstate, damaging Tasmania's strong scientific reputation.
