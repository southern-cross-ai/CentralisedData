       <p>
        On so many levels and in so many ways, last night's budget was a missed opportunity to deliver for South Australians. But what is beyond comprehension to me is that this government, in this budget, failed to deliver a solution for the urgent healthcare needs in Ceduna at Yadu Health. I have stood in this chamber previously and talked about Yadu Health and the catastrophic situation we have in Ceduna. This Aboriginal controlled health clinic is in a state of catastrophic disrepair with mould, painted-over asbestos, a roof falling in and unsealed windows. Parts of the building have been condemned, and staff members risk being electrocuted at their desks. It is that unsafe. It is that unfit for the people who work there and the people they serve. It is appalling. Yadu has been ignored. This community has been ignored. For far too long, too many people have walked through the doors of Yadu, seen how catastrophic the conditions are, and just kept on walking. The government know the situation this clinic is in, and they could have used this budget to fix it.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am deeply proud that Labor have committed that if we are in government we will spend $13.35 million to rebuild Yadu Health. It's time for the Liberals to match that commitment. Every single South Australian Liberal senator in this chamber should be standing up for Yadu, for the people of Ceduna and for the communities that this clinic serves. The member for Grey certainly should be doing everything he can to secure this commitment from the Liberals. The people of Ceduna deserve so much more. The remote Indigenous communities that this clinic services deserve so much more. If you are serious about closing the gap and the healthcare needs of people in Ceduna, fix Yadu Health, rebuild it and match our commitment.
