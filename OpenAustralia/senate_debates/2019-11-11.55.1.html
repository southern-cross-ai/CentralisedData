         I thank the senator for her question and for her interest in drought affected communities, and in regional Victoria in particular. The Drought Communities Program is an incredibly popular program, where $1 million is provided to over 122 councils across the country which are drought affected. It's been going for a couple of years and there have been three rounds thus far. It uses measurements such as rainfall and agricultural employment, amongst a raft of other measures, to determine eligibility. If councils are successful in attaining Drought Communities Program eligibility they can put forward projects to stimulate their local economy: anything from doing up the local hall to building a road. Some councils in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         have actually decided to employ drought support officers—yes, stimulating local employment but also making sure that that local community has a dedicated person to look after needs in the drought.
        </p>
        <p>
         So it's been an incredibly popular program. We've expanded it, under our new drought response, to include an additional six councils—

The methodology, as I've outlined, takes into account agricultural employment and also rainfall data. It's an incredibly popular program. We gave those 122 councils who were already recipients of Drought Communities Program funding last week an additional amount of money—

                  , I'll take that on notice. But can I say that our drought announcement last week focused on frontline support for farmers, ensuring that those regional towns that are going to be so important for the recovery, once the rains do come, hold onto their local employment. It's seeing money stimulated through their hairdressers, their IGAs and their rural supply stores. This program is key to keeping them in town, their families in town and their kids in school because—

                    . You might have missed it as you flicked through our drought announcement: $50 million for drought affected councils, which will be at the minister's discretion to use and appoint. I know Minister Littleproud is developing those guidelines as we speak.

                      As the Morrison government has failed the people of Moira so badly, how can Australians have any confidence in your ability to support the nation through this drought?

                       cattlemen in the Barkly, talking about their dry times. I've also been speaking to farmers in Victoria, in

                       </a>
                       . I've been on the ground in these communities for the last three days. I've been listening to them, acting and taking up the things they need to be done. That's what our government have done. We've actually talked to people. We actually know what these communities want to see. They want cash on the tables of our farmers. They want their regional towns supported through the drought so their rural supply stores and the skills sets are still there when the rain comes and we need to ramp up productivity. Our communities, such as Moira, Moyne, Kempsey—you name it—will be supported by our drought announcement, with 122 councils, plus another six and then 50 more using the ministerial discretion.
