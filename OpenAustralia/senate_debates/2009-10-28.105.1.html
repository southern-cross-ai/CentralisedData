        I rise this evening to thank the community of Geraldton and the surrounding region for their support for the recent community cabinet held on 1 October. This was the third community cabinet held in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        . There was a great turnout, with around 360 community members attending the public forum with the Prime Minister and cabinet members. This was followed by a series of meetings between ministers and representatives of the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Music students from John Willcock College, Geraldton Secondary College, Geraldton Grammar School, Geraldton Primary School, and the Allendale, Beachlands and

        primary schools all entertained the gathering before the arrival of the Prime Minister and ministers. We were welcomed to John Willcock College, the venue for the community cabinet, by Principal Julie Campbell. Yvonne Radcliffe, a Naaguja elder, gave the welcome to Yamatji country. Ashleigh Websdale, a year 9 student from John Willcock College, sang the national anthem. Well done, Ashleigh; you did a beautiful job. I would like to thank all these people for helping to make the community cabinet a success.
       </p>

        As the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PM" rel="nofollow">

        highlighted at the community cabinet meeting:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It’s very easy for somewhere as remote as Canberra from this community of Geraldton and this region, for governments, whatever their good intent, to simply become detached from the reality on the ground. That’s why every six weeks or thereabouts the Government goes out to a different part of Australia. It’s the first time a Commonwealth government has done this.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is a very important initiative. Ministers gained firsthand insights into issues in the region through their numerous local meetings, before and after the community cabinet, and from the forum itself. Issues raised at the forum included progress on local projects, such as the Oakajee port development; Australia’s bid for the

         Square Kilometre Array
        </a>
        project; changes to the youth allowance; native title claims; climate change and energy efficiency; and funding for the rock lobster industry. The community cabinet process highlighted what a dynamic and growing place Geraldton is.
       </p>
       <p>
        Geraldton holds an important key to growth for the state and the country: from iron ore and magnetite resources to the big wheat crop that is expected this year; from the fishing industry to the growth of the wild goat harvest, with its significant economic and environmental benefits; from the incredible opportunities for science that the Square Kilometre Array represents to the important dynamic community services that cater to the city and the region with their innovative programs. Geraldton’s strong and active community works hard to make the most of its opportunities and seeks to share these opportunities with everyone.
       </p>
       <p>
        Here are some of my highlights that really illustrate Geraldton’s drive and community spirit. It was terrific to visit the Geraldton Street Works Corporation with the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, the Hon.

        . Geraldton Street Works, otherwise known as ‘Streeties’, started in 1991 in response to the needs of young people who were roaming the streets of Geraldton late at night. Streeties provides innovative youth services to both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children and young people in Geraldton. In a short time I was able to get a glimpse of what a terrific community force this organisation is, providing programs for young people that develop in them a sense of respect for themselves and others, confidence, resilience and security. It was great to meet some of the young community leaders that Street Works is developing. I would like to thank you, Streeties, for the delicious kangaroo tail stew and damper.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was also moved by the work undertaken by the Geraldton Womens Health Resource Centre. The centre has just commenced a program to support women with post-natal depression. I thank the centre for their commitment to improving the health and wellbeing of local women, especially those who are experiencing domestic violence or social isolation.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was also very pleased to visit the Geraldton Legal Aid Office. The agency explained to the Attorney-General and me the difficulties they face in providing remote and outreach legal services. Along with the Minister for Employment Participation, Senator the Hon.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        . The link contains additional capacity to accommodate the SKA. Geraldton and the surrounding region is set to play a key role in Australian and international astronomy. It will be exciting to watch this unfold in coming years.
       </p>
       <p>
        While in Geraldton, the Prime Minister announced funding for new cycling facilities in the city. This project will support local jobs as well as build permanent facilities to encourage healthier lifestyles and a more sustainable community. These include the construction of new bike racks, new off-the-road concrete bike paths and the establishment of three bike lanes along key roads. These facilities will complement the foreshore that the Gallop government revitalised, which is now looking terrific.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Rudd government is committed to understanding the issues confronting Geraldton as a dynamic, important and growing regional city. This is underscored not only by the community cabinet visit but also by the fact that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rudd" rel="nofollow">
         Kevin Rudd
        </a>
        is the first prime minister to go to Geraldton in 55 years. He has been not once but twice in the last year. Finally, thank you to the many hundreds of people from Geraldton and the wider region for taking time to raise your issues with the Rudd government and for sharing your vision for your community. In partnership with you, the Rudd government can help your vision be realised.
