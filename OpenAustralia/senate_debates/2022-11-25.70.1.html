         <p>
          What we have heard during the course of this week, during Senate question time, has been an endless litany from this government of failure to admit that the rushed approach to its extreme
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IR" rel="nofollow">
           IR
          </a>
          legislation is an approach riddled with mistakes and an approach that will have dire consequences for businesses, particularly small- and medium-sized businesses across the Australian economy. The mistakes in the regulatory impact statement of the government are such that it is clear this government has not done its homework on the IR bills that they are seeking to ram and rush through this parliament next week. The truth is they didn't take these reforms to an election. They didn't take them the Australian people. They didn't tell them upfront what they were going to do. This is a government that, instead, in its early days decided that it would try to drive through the parliament reforms that were not communicated and make sure that in doing so it was able to deliver for its union friends that which it wasn't game to tell the Australian people about beforehand.
         </p>
         <p>
          What we've heard is that the regulatory impact statement miscalculated elements of the costs to small and medium-sized businesses and, as every day has gone by, we understand that more and more costs will be racked up and applied to Australian small and medium-sized businesses as a result of the government's approach. We were told that, in miscalculating those costs, it was in part because they were based on a few google searches, it seems. These searches were of some of the most curious and unusual businesses that you could seek to base an economic analysis upon.

              Psychics or magiciansâ€”it might be funny if it weren't so serious in terms of the consequences of the government's legislation. The consequences of the government's legislation will be to see Australian businesses face costs and disruptionâ€”costs in terms of the regulatory impact, costs in terms of negotiating, disruption in terms of the increased strike actionâ€”and be forced to act in ways that are not analogous to the needs of their individual enterprise or business.

                The consequences of those higher costs, higher strikes, more disruption will be, as Senator Duniam said, lost jobs. There will be fewer jobs in the Australian economy and higher costs for businesses. Contrary to what the government claims, it's not going to help productivity. It's going to hurt productivity when you've got businesses tied up in red tape and dealing with strikes. Productivity will go down and costs will go up. Will that help or hurt inflation? It will drive inflation and it will make a difficult situation, a real problem, even worse. The government's actions will make the problem worse. They should be listening to the

                 Reserve Bank
                </a>
                . They should be listening to the experts. They should be listening to any business across the country, not just as I've heard in this chamber this week but, remarkably, in the other place. When the Minister for
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Business" rel="nofollow">
                 Small Business
                </a>
                was asked to name one small businessâ€”just oneâ€”who supported the government's extreme

                bills, guess what? She couldn't name even oneâ€”not even one.
               </p>
               <p>
                As if the chaos from the hapless management of the industrials relations built by the government isn't bad enough, we've been exposed in recent days to the work of the Assistant Treasurer and the way he is conducting his negotiations on the financial accountability regime bill. He seems to be changing position on that bill on a daily basis and doing it all through the media. One day there are new fines, the next day those fines are being taken away. Where is the certainty for Australian business? Where is the certainty for Australian investors? What on earth is this government doing? Well, they're making these mistakes because of the undue haste and because they are dancing to the tune of their union masters. That's why these mistakes are happening. The IR bill is no doubt full of other mistakes that are yet to be exposed because of the rushed approach. The financial services bill is also being changed on a day-to-day basis because the government is dancing to the tune of others. It's trying to twist around to make sure it keeps the unions happy and the industry super funds happy. They're telling them to go harder, go faster on these reforms. But they're not doing their homework and so not getting it right, and as a consequence Australians are going to face higher costs, fewer jobs, a weaker economy. And we won't stand for it.

                             Tactical genius over there! Yet again, we see this Liberal-National party, the dregs of government, doing the only thing they know how to unite onâ€”that is, standing up against working people. That is the only thing these divided remnants of a hapless government can actually do togetherâ€”stand up against working people. That's what you've consistently done all week. It's the one thing that unites you: 'We love a deliberate design feature of our economy being low wages, and we're going to fight really hard to hold on to it.' That is what has occurred all week and that is what is occurring now.

                                     Those opposite say they care about pay equity. This bill seeks to deal with some of those pay equity issues by banning pay secrecy clauses and giving the Fair Work Commission the powers to deal with pay equity. This is the bill they're fighting so hard against. New limits on rolling contractsâ€”another equity provision. There are all these aspects of the legislation that they do not wish to debate. They want the debate to be about just one thing, because they don't actually want to deal with the real issue: at its heart, this bill is about trying to make Australian workplaces fairer and get wages moving again. That is what this bill is about. You cannot join with that issue, can you, because, fundamentally, you don't agree with it. No matter how much debate, no matter how much so-called scrutiny, you are ideologically, historically and forever committed to opposing this bill. We all remember from the last election the dollar pay increase, and the way in which your then government responded. Australians remember that. What is clear from the way in which you have dealt with this debate on this bill is you haven't learnt the lesson.

                                      do not support the question before the chair. I do want to make some comments about the Financial Accountability Regime Bill 2022 negotiations, but before I do I want to be abundantly clear that the Australian Greens certainly do not support the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Secure Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 2022 being referred to a committee for an inquiry that is both needless and designed only to delay. Neither do we accept that the management of the chamber this week has been chaotic. In fact, it has been very productive, and we genuinely hope that next week will be the same.

                                      On the Financial Accountability Regime Bill, on Tuesday this week, at about six o'clock, Minister Jones and I met in his office and we made an agreement. That agreement was that the Greens would facilitate the passage this year of the Treasury Laws Amendment (2022 Measures No. 2) Bill 2022, the Treasury Laws Amendment (2022 Measures No. 3) Bill 2022, and the Financial Accountability Regime Bill and its cognate bills. The condition on which that was agreed was that the government would support the Greens amendment to the Financial Accountability Regime Bill 2022 to insert civil penalties for accountable people, including bank executives, for breaches of their accountability obligations. That would have been a great step forward.

                                      Yesterday, Minister Jones and I met again in his office, and he informed me that the government was no longer prepared to honour that agreement. We all know what's happened here. Labor has cracked under pressure from the bank executives. Reneging on the agreement shows very clearly that Labor values the interests of bankers over the interests of customers. Minister Jones has learned very clearly what happens when you get in between a bank executive and a bag of money. He's learned that you get absolutely steamrolled, and that's what has happened to him this week. There is absolutely no doubt that Minister Jones and I had an agreement, and any claim that there was no agreement is false.

                                      I can also inform the Senate that yesterday evening I wrote to Minister Jones offering a revised agreement in which the Australian Greens would facilitate the passage of the relevant bills this year on the basis that the government would support a revised amendment which would ensure that small and mutual banks and, importantly, executives of small and mutual banks are not unreasonably impacted. For clarity, this means that executives of small and mutual banks would not be subject to civil penalties for breaches of their accountability obligations. In other words, we would be going squarely after the top end of town, where this kind of reform is so desperately needed to send a clear message to the executives of the big banks in this country that their poor behaviour and their appalling culture, uncovered by a once-in-a-generation royal commission, will not be tolerated any longer. We hope the government is prepared to accept our revised offer, which we make in good faith, despite what has happened in the last 24 hours. We look forward to the government's response.

                                       This is the Fair Work Act. We see an amazing bill coming through now involving a lot of partsâ€”27 parts. Some are simply necessary tidying up; we support them. Some are worthy improvements; we support them. Some are big issues that are not thought through. Some are big issues that are thought through but appear to be hiding things. Some are designed deliberately, it appears, to confuse and to obfuscate. We need more time to scrutinise this. The government has said that this is about increasing pay. Rubbish! They have left out my Fair Work Amendment (Equal Pay for Equal Work) Bill 2022, which is fundamental to getting more pay for workers. We cannot add complexity to this already complex dinosaurâ€”the Fair Work Actâ€”without proper scrutiny. That's the only way to do this. I support the move to suspend standing orders, and we'll be supporting the motion.

A deal has allegedly been done between a government minister and yourself, and a deal has been broken. Seriously! Did the minister even have authority to do the deal with you, now begs the question. That minister should today at least have the decency to front the press and actually confirm whether or not a deal was done. In this place, let's be honest, if a deal is done, you stick with the deal. It would appear that

                                        , the Assistant Treasurer, did not have the authority, Senator McKim, to do the deal with you. I don't know what the deal was. I may not even agree with the deal, but I have to say: the revelations that a deal was done demand that the Assistant Treasurer front the media today and give an explanation to the Australian people.

                                        Why do I say that? Because this is a government that was elected on a basis of integrity and transparency. As the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate has said, what this motion does is merely allow further scrutiny in relation to possibly the biggest industrial relations changes this country has seen for decades and decades. It doesn't ask for that scrutiny to be extended in an unreasonable time frame. In fact, what it says is basically, 'Give us the Christmas period to go out there and talk further to employers.' Becauseâ€”and we all need to remember thisâ€”governments don't create jobs. Employers do. When you have every employer in the country standing up and saying, 'We agree with wage rises; we have nothing against wage rises, but this bill will not deliver wage rises,' I'd have thought you'd sit back for five minutes and just listen.

                                        For the benefit of those in the gallery, this is the contempt with which the Albanese government treats businesses in Australia. To calculate costs for small business they have utilised a website called 'How much should I charge a consultant in Australia'. That sounds reasonable until you click on the link in the regulatory impact statement and the author of the article is described as 'a cross between a business strategist, a modern day spiritual healer and a self-development expert'. Benjamin J Harveyâ€”and good on Benjamin J Harvey!â€”is:

                                        What does the government do? The government says, 'Sorry, it was a mistake,' and throws their own department under a bus. Interestingly, the figure of $175 per hour was actually the same figure that Benjamin J Harvey's website came up with. So I have to start wondering whether or not merely throwing the department under the bus was the right thing to do.

And the bad news is that it isn't $5,000 less; it's not $70,000 that medium businesses will be paying. It actually now goes up to $80,000. Do you know what the relevant minister said in relation to that? On a $5,000 mistake, when it increases the cost for a business from 75 to 80â€”I kid you notâ€”it is only a 'typo', a mere typo. So all those businesses that have 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20 employees, I can tell you, your Christmas present from the left-wing Albanese government is the additional $5,000 that you will have to pay for the pleasure of being compelled to bargain. A bargaining tax of $5,000? I do not know where you are finding this $5,000 with every other cost that is being imposed on you. But the contempt that those opposite have to say that a $5,000 increase is a 'typo'â€”

                                         Nothing symbolises more how lost this crowd are on industrial relations than Senator Cash. The former workplace relations minister, nobody is more responsible over on that side for a government that had the longest period of historically low wage growth in our history everâ€”ever! Since Federation, those guys opposite presided over the lowest period of wage growth in our history and the lowest period of productivity growth in our history. Why? Because they see industrial relations and workplace reform for one thing: they can't stand the union movement. That is all they care about. They are not interested in anything more. It is a one-eyed, prejudiced, blinkered, ideological view about Australian workplaces that can only see one thing. And when there is a little bit of legislation put in front of themâ€”moderate sensible, practical, straightforward internationally comparableâ€”what are they doing? I will tell you what they are doing.

                                            Do you know what? The international evidence demonstrates this. What does this legislation lead to? Multi-employer bargaining leads to more employment. It leads to lower unemployment. It leads to better jobs. It leads to higher wages. It leads to higher productivity. It leads to less gender inequality. But you guys opposite are not remotely interested in any of that. I tell you what, your relationship with the concept of productivity is so broken. What you have here is a government that is doing what it said it would doâ€”that is, legislating its agenda. The only thing that you are doing is trying to break the productivity of this parliament because what is going on does not suit your political timetable. That is what this is really about. What you, you and you want is months and months and months to run a dishonest partisan political scare campaign in Australian workplaces to frighten ordinary small-business owners out there. These propositions are very straightforward, very simple to understand. I will give you an example of how simple to understand they are. There is an outfit called the

                                            . You lot opposite may have heard of it. It is run by a fellow who used to loaf around over here trying to keep Australian wages down. That is what former Senator Cormann did; he tried to keep Australian wages down. The outfit he leads, one of the most respected economic analysis outfits in the world, makes the proposition very simple. It says multi-employer bargaining is a cornerstone industrial relations institution in 18 out of 26 OECD countries. It is a cornerstone not just of their industrial relations system but of their macro-economic systemâ€”
