           It is the government's clear position that women and children in Australia should be safe at home, safe on the streets and safe online. I believe everybody in this place can agree that domestic and family violence does not have a place in Australia. After the events in Queensland last week and knowing that there are incidents of violence against women and their children that go unreported, enough is enough. The government has been showing unprecedented leadership on this issue. Addressing domestic and family violence is a national priority and that is why we have elevated the issue to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Australian_Governments" rel="nofollow">
            Council of Australian Governments
           </a>
           for discussion in 2015. As a part of this important agenda,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
            COAG
           </a>
           have agreed to implement a national domestic violence order scheme and national perpetrator standards, and to address technology-facilitated abuse. State and territories are key in delivering outcomes as is appropriate. The Queensland government, for example, have announced that they are looking to increase penalties for breaking domestic violence orders. As part of the evaluation of the second action plan and the development of the third action plan under the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their children, we will be conducting wide-ranging consultations to inform our way forward as a nation.
