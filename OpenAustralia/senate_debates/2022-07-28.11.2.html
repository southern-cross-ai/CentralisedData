             Yes, I was. I want to make a few observations about that amendment in the debate. From the Australian Greens' point of view, we're not too sure what the fuss is about, here, in terms of Labor's position, and we will be supporting the opposition's amendment.
            </p>
            <p>
             Eight weeks is not a particularly long period for an inquiry. These bills create an important agency, and it's important that we get this agency right.
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Senate" rel="nofollow">
              The Senate
             </a>
             absolutely needs to do its job here. We make the very reasonable observation that the government has a jobs summit coming up on 1 and 2 September. Obviously that's a really important summit, and we want to understand what the outcomes are from that really important jobs summit in time for those outcomes to be fed into the committee's considerations and, ultimately, the deliberations of the Senate around this legislation. We believe that the outcomes of the jobs summit should have the capacity to help shape Jobs and Skills Australia, the agency established by this legislation.
            </p>
            <p>
             I want to make a couple of very quick and preliminary observations on Jobs and Skills Australia as proposed in this legislation. There is no mechanism beyond a consultation mechanism for stakeholders' voices to be heard and acted on, and we do note this is a big step backwards from previous
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
              Australian Labor Party
             </a>
             machinery that has empowered and resourced diverse sectoral voices at the table. We also note that the advice parameters appear, as a preliminary assessment, to be very narrowly focused around data and analysis.
            </p>
            <p>
             We want this inquiry to have the capacity to consider and explore those issues and any other issues that stakeholders bring up. Jobs and Skills Australia will be a critical agency and the Senate has to get it right.

              The Greens

             believe that an inquiry that reports, as is proposed by the opposition, on 23 September strikes the right balance between getting it done and making sure it's done right.

             <p>
              This was an issue we discussed last night that we weren't able to reach agreement on. The government's preferred position is that we refer, but with a reporting date so that we can start considering this bill during the September sittings. We would facilitate briefings and the opportunities for crossbenchers and the opposition to discuss that legislation with ministers, but our preference is to have this legislation ready to debate in September. We don't think it is that complex, actually, to establish Jobs and Skills Australia. It is a key commitment of ours that we took to the election, and we want to get cracking on it.
             </p>
             <p>
              If the committee doesn't report until the end of September, then we potentially won't be able to program this in the October sittings, when we have the budget and then budget estimates. Then we're leaving this right until the end of the year, when we have a range of other priorities, before we're able to establish this agency. I think, if the committee wants the referral, then the committee should get to work between now and the next sitting. It's a month. You can conduct a pretty reasonable inquiry in a month's time.
             </p>
             <p>
              That is certainly the government's preference. I can see from contributions from others, though, that we don't have the numbers to stop that referral to the 28th, but our strong preference would be that people consider dealing with this as soon as possible so the legislation is available for debate in this chamber in the September sittings.
