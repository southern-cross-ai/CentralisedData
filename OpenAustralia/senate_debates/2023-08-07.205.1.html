         DUNIAM (—) (): This is an extremely important matter, not just for those of us from the state of Tasmania but for all Australians who have an interest in the environment and foreign affairs and our place in this world as a leader when it comes to Antarctic science and the preservation and protection of the frozen continent. We are revered, globally, as a leader when it comes to Antarctica. I acknowledge my good friend and colleague Tasmanian Senator Carol Brown for her support on many matters. I am hoping today we can hear the Australian government echo my concerns around what is happening to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Antarctic_Division" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Antarctic Division
         </a>
         , and other great Tasmanians, like Senator Lambie, Senator Tyrrell, Senator Whish-Wilson and Senator Chandler, all share this concern.
        </p>
        <p>
         The reality is that in Tasmania we have a proud history of being the home of Antarctic science. We are home to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
          CSIRO
         </a>
         , we're home to the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies and we're also home to the Australian Antarctic Division and have been for some time. Generally speaking, the support for that sector is what I would call multipartisan. There has been no voice absent in support of our strong Antarctic science sector, and that's for good reason. Additionally, I think it's important to point out that we're home to the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, or
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCAMLR" rel="nofollow">
          CCAMLR
         </a>
         , the international treaty organisation that is entrusted with the management and guidance of policies related to the Antarctic. Those headquarters are located in Hobart. But, in recent times, there have been some troubling developments which concern me and many other Tasmanians greatly. Those concerns involve a reduction in the amount of funding available to the Australian Antarctic Division for them to do their vital work and be able to manage their scientific program, which rolls out over a number of years. Many of the projects that they run are multi-year projects. This reduction of funding—$25 million—is not an insignificant amount for a very important entity that does world-leading work. That money is being taken away by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Labor
         </a>
         government.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are seen as a leader. All of our treaty partners and all the members of CCAMLR watch what we do with great interest. When we invest, they hail it as a wonderful achievement and something that other countries should follow suit in, but, when we cut, they look aghast at what exactly the Australian government is up to and what it is doing as a leader in this space. Of course, we don't really even have to mention it, but, as a leader in this space, there is a lot of interest in what happens in Antarctica, particularly from countries that don't necessarily share our interests, our democratic values and our views of how best to manage natural resources—and that is what we need to be vigilant about.
        </p>
        <p>
         It was distressing to hear the denials, from both the Minister for the Environment and Water and the Leader of the Government in this place, about there being any cuts. They made these denials in the face of two emails from the director of the Antarctic Division saying that there will be job losses and that not all jobs will be safe. The denials came in the face of serious concerns being expressed by Mr Zac Batchelor from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_and_Public_Sector_Union" rel="nofollow">
          Community and Public Sector Union
         </a>
         , who has a very good handle of what's happening there at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAD" rel="nofollow">
          AAD
         </a>
         , and in the face of multiple concerns expressed by academics whose work is on the line. We know that there are jobs going, we know that there are vacancies that will not be filled and we know that that is sending a terrible message to our treaty partners and jeopardising our position as a leader in Antarctic science.
        </p>
        <p>
         It also draws into question the Australian government's commitment to the Antarctic and Science Precinct, something that I, again, thought had multipartisan support—co-locating these scientific entities on the Hobart waterfront, near where the
         <i>
          Nuyina
         </i>
         , the new billion-dollar-plus icebreaker, will be berthing. All of this is now in question because the commitment by the Australian government has suddenly started to be watered down. The multipartisan, non-political support for Antarctic science—which has previously been viewed much in the same way we generally view foreign affairs and defence—has suddenly started to fritter away. I'm very concerned. So I'm looking forward to hearing the Australian Labor speakers in this debate. Their contributions, I hope, will clearly outline exactly what I've been calling for—that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Labor Party
         </a>
         politicians from Tasmania will be forcing the Australian Labor government to reverse these cuts and restore multipartisan support for this area.

          I am really pleased to be able to stand up here and allay the concern that Senator Duniam says that he has over the funding of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Antarctic_Division" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Antarctic Division
          </a>
          . It has been put to me that this MPI is just a stunt by the Liberals, looking for a headline, without thinking of the workers that they may be worrying. So I'm glad to be standing up here to say that there have been no cuts to the $804 million budget for the Antarctic Division—not a cent. So now I've alleviated the concerns of Senator Duniam. There will be no job cuts.

            Well, I've spoken to the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPSU" rel="nofollow">
             CPSU
            </a>
            , Senator Chandler. But there are no job cuts. In fact, more people will gain full-time employment. I can hear the cheers from the other side! What happened here is that there was significant funding for the commissioning of a world-class Antarctic science ship. The money dedicated to the
            <i>
             Nuyina
            </i>
            has been spent—and I'm sure Senator Duniam has seen the ship docked in Hobart. Tasmanians know the sad truth is that, under the former coalition government, Australia's Antarctic program was irresponsibly managed, and, as a result, since the election of the Albanese government we've had two separate inquiries into the program in less than a year, both of which were into cultural issues occurring within the division.
           </p>
           <p>
            This government's priority when it comes to the Antarctic Division—I'm glad to let Senator Duniam and all those that are interested in this MPI and the Antarctic Division know—comes down to two things: (1) supporting critical science and (2) supporting permanent, good jobs in Tasmania. Labor has always valued and properly funded scientific research and, particular to this matter of public importance, Antarctic research. Since the election of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Hawke" rel="nofollow">
             Bob Hawke
            </a>
            , Australia has been a global leader on the Antarctic, ensuring that all Antarctic activities remain consistent with the principles of peace, science and environmental protection. Our world-leading scientific work in the Antarctic enables us to better understand the world around us and has provided us insights into climate science that can be gleaned nowhere else.
           </p>
           <p>
            The government has given clear assurances—and I give them again today—that there are no cuts to the $804 million budget for the Antarctic Division. The government has also been given assurances by the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Antarctic_Division" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Antarctic Division
            </a>
            that there is no plan for redundancies. In fact, a number of contractors are being transitioned into secure, permanent jobs, and the critical, world-leading science will continue. The work is essential work. While the Liberals and Nationals are still over there on the opposition benches, unable to reach a unanimous decision that climate change is real, the government is getting on with the job. I hope that so far Senator Duniam's concern has been alleviated. If the former government were still in power, the Australian Antarctic Division would be millions of dollars worse off, having faced a reduction in funding in the year 2022-23. That is information from the former government's own budget papers, which show a funding cut of $33 million from the years 2021-22 to 2022-23. The budget papers give black-and-white evidence that under our government funding over the coming years is higher than funding for every year under the coalition's last budget. Further, in 2022-23 the Australian government spent over $32 million delivering Antarctic science, which is a $3 million increase on the prior year.

             The Liberals

             I think those workers and scientists at the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Antarctic_Division" rel="nofollow">
              Australian Antarctic Division
             </a>
             watching us today would be hoping that we can put the politics aside just for a minute on something this important. Senator Brown says there have been no budget cuts or the government hasn't implemented any budget cuts, and that is true. But what Senator Brown and the government know is that the Antarctic Division is having to find $25 million in budget savings because $25 million has gone missing from its budget. I have seen the internal email from the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
              CEO
             </a>
             saying they had to cut their operating budget—cut their operating budget—by 16 per cent in every division to find these savings. You're being a little bit cute with the language, but can we just focus on what the workers and scientists are facing?
            </p>
            <p>
             The government says it is committed to funding critical science programs, but underline the word 'critical'. We also know from that division that a number of science programs, potentially many dozens of them, are being cancelled because somehow under this new regime they're not considered critical. Go tell that to an early career scientist, potentially a young woman who's been waiting for her turn to get down there on the ice in the very brief six-week window they had this summer to conduct a program she's probably working with scientists around the world on. No, been canned because we have to find $25 million. We will get to the bottom of what happened, whether it was mismanagement or whatever it was, but we know the reality is the Antarctic Division is having to cut its budget, including its operating budget. If we support science and we prioritise science, surely we can find the $25 million to make sure that all these scientists can actually have the funding they need to do the work at one of the most critical times, may I say also, in human history.
            </p>
            <p>
             There was an excellent article in the international
             <i>
              Guardian
             </i>
             today asking, 'Is the climate crisis finally catching up with Antarctica? Finding the answer has never been more pressing.' This is talking about mapping the sea floor around Antarctica. Do you know we've only mapped 12 per cent of our Antarctic territory? Until we do that, we can't estimate the impacts that sea ice melting will have on sea level rise. Apparently—and I have seen the spreadsheet—that is one of programs that's been canned, Senator Brown, mapping the sea floor off Antarctica. This is critical. We come in here and play politics and use semantics or what's commonly called 'spin' to try to avoid responsibility. Can we please all work together on getting a solution for the Australian Antarctic Division, so they have funding certainty and they can hire more people, including many young women who have been waiting in that boys' club down there to have their turn to do their science programs?

              Australia has a proud history of longstanding scientific research in Antarctica, and Tasmania has a proud history as Australia's gateway to the frozen continent. But all of this is now under threat because of this Labor government's proposed cuts to the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Antarctic_Division" rel="nofollow">
               Australian Antarctic Division
              </a>
              . News of this proposed $25 million cut appears to have come completely out of the blue, and we know it's having a devastating impact on the morale of people who work at the Australian Antarctic Division and will potentially have a devastating impact on their operations if this cut comes to fruition. A cut of $25 million represents almost 16 per cent of the Australian Antarctic Division's operational budget. Like I said, this has come as a real shock not only to the people who work at the Australian Antarctic Division, the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAD" rel="nofollow">
               AAD
              </a>
              , but also to the broader Tasmanian community, particularly in the south of the state near the AAD's headquarters in Kingston. In fact, Labor never once mentioned or alluded to any cuts to the AAD in the lead-up to last year's election. I think the potential of this $25 million cut really does bring into question this Labor government's commitment to scientific research and our country's caretaking responsibilities in Antarctica.
             </p>
             <p>
              Australia's Antarctic territory spans 42 per cent of the continent. With custodianship of such a substantial territory, and a long historical connection dating back to the expedition of
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Douglas_Mawson" rel="nofollow">
               Sir Douglas Mawson
              </a>
              , Australia has taken on a significant leadership role Antarctica. As an Australian, I'm very proud of that. And as a Tasmanian I'm very proud of that, because Tasmania certainly plays its part in this regard.
             </p>
             <p>
              We have set the example of responsible custodianship and sensitive scientific research in Antarctica. We know this place needs to be treated with care, and we need to ensure we protect and preserve the ice content into the future. Any cut to our resourcing of the Australian Antarctic Division lessens our role and obligation to Antarctica. As one of the 12 original signatories of the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Treaty" rel="nofollow">
               Antarctic Treaty
              </a>
              in 1959, we cannot afford to minimise our responsibilities to Antarctica, especially when concerns have been raised about the intentions of other nations to exploit Antarctica for natural resources. Maintaining a presence on the continent to ensure that Antarctica is protected from any such exploitative activity is essential. With Labor's proposed cuts to Antarctic funding, one has to ask the question: is this now under threat?

              In highlighting Tasmania's important role as the gateway to Antarctica, I think it's also important for the chamber to understand the depth of the island state's involvement in Australia's broader Antarctic activities. In Hobart, we are used to seeing icebreakers berthed on the waterfront. The orange hulk that was the
              <i>
               Aurora Australi
              </i>
              <i>
               a
              </i>
              was always a prominent sight at the docks, transferring essential equipment and supplies as well as intrepid expeditioners to and from the icy continent. Of course, we have the new icebreaker in Hobart as well.
             </p>
             <p>
              The AAD is headquartered and operated out of the current location in Kingston, which, as I said earlier, is in the south of the state. It makes sense for our foremost agency responsible for our Antarctic operations to be based in the state with the closest proximity to Antarctica. The AAD's presence in Tasmania, coupled with our proximity to the continent, has seen the island state become a hub of Antarctic scientific research.
             </p>
             <p>
              Tasmania is also home to some of our nation's foremost manufacturers of Antarctic equipment. Elphinstone, based in Triabunna on the east coast, has been designing and manufacturing Antarctic equipment since 1985. The company manufactures a wide variety of sleds and other equipment used in Australia's Antarctic operations. I've been fortunate enough to tour Elphinstone and see firsthand their exceptional work to design and build equipment that needs to withstand the harsh conditions. This business is an absolute testament to Tasmanian ingenuity and expertise when it comes to the Antarctic. What do the government's proposed cuts to the AAD mean for companies like Elphinstone, which provide services and equipment to support the AAD's ongoing mission in Antarctica? I would be very interested to know.
             </p>
             <p>
              In conclusion, Tasmania is well and truly ingrained in Australia's Antarctic story. It makes it more astounding that the Labor government would even entertain a budget cut which will only reduce Australia's and Tasmania's Antarctic involvement. News of the proposed $25 million cut has caused much unease and anxiety among Australia's Antarctic community, particularly in southern Tasmania. It is time for this government to guarantee that Tasmania will continue to be our Antarctic gateway.

               in Hobart. Taking any money out of this very important agency is—I don't have any words for it—it's just ridiculous. Not only does it threaten jobs and very important science that happens there; let's talk about national security, shall we?

               Listen to this, Tasmanians: China's on our tail; here it comes! This sends a clear message to China that the government—the government that's so big on national security!—has taken its eye off the ball already. China has permanently occupied Antarctic stations and is currently building a new one in the

                Listening to those opposite speaking on this MPI is quite spectacular—their dedication over the last 20 minutes to science compared to their lack of any form of dedication or commitment to science over the last nine years when they were in government. This is just a stunt. Their history tells us that they have no credibility in this space. They undermined any form of climate action, saying, 'Question the science,' every single time. 'Question the science.' They repealed the climate policies that were in place; joked about our Pacific island neighbours going under water, as if that's funny; sabotaged the Murray-Darling Basin Plan; hid the

                Just to be clear, echoing the words of Senator Brown, there are no cuts to the Antarctic Division. The fact is the budget is going up every year for the next three years. We are working very hard to clean up the mess left behind by the Liberals, by the coalition government, that, over a lengthy and painful nine years, put the Antarctic program into a whole lot of distress. It was so badly managed. Our priority, the Albanese Labor government's priority, is to support critical science, to support permanent jobs, especially in Tasmania. Australia has been a global leader in the Antarctic, ensuring that all Antarctic activities remain consistent with the principles of peace, science and environmental protection. That's where we're at. The sad truth is that the program, previously, was irresponsibly managed, and that leaves our program of critical science at risk. Our scientists are doing terrific research—the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denman_Glacier" rel="nofollow">
                 Denman Glacier
                </a>
                , the million-year ice core, the ice cap, greenhouse gases in the southern atmosphere and so much more. This is essential work, and it's essential work that is based out of Tasmania.
               </p>
               <p>
                While the coalition, the Liberals and Nationals, on those benches opposite were in government, they were unable to reach any form of unanimous decision that climate change is real. Yet, such a significant amount of the research that we have going on in the Antarctic is about just that. We are seeing warming, and that has a profound impact on the Antarctic.
               </p>

                 Australian Antarctic Division

                that there is no plan for redundancies, that a number of contractors are going to be transitioning into secure permanent jobs and that the critical science is going to continue. Senator Brown has already said in this debate that she has spoken to the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPSU" rel="nofollow">
                 CPSU
                </a>
                and has confirmed some of these issues. Just to be clear, in 2022-23 we spent over $32 million delivering Antarctic science, which was an increase from the 2021-22 year. The last season in the Antarctic set some amazing groundwork for the programs that will be delivered in the next few years. This season we will see a couple of critical pieces of work—some critical work at the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunger_Hills" rel="nofollow">
                 Bunger Hills
                </a>
                and also the 2.8 kilometre drill down to collect ice cores that are more than a million years old. Scientists will test the tiny air bubbles trapped in the ice so their studies can continue, and we can learn more and develop more in terms of where we are at and what's happening in the Antarctic. Our Antarctic Division does incredible work, and Australia has long played a critical leadership role in the Antarctic, and that will continue. Nothing is going to stop.

                 China already has four bases within our Australian Antarctic Territory for research, mapping, communication and resources, which are all vital to China. Based on China's investment and activity, when the treaty is up for reconsideration in 2048, China will lay claim to Australia's portion of Antarctica. When we cut the budget, our future claims will not be treated seriously if we do not treat our own claims seriously now. This is a matter of security, productive capacity and human progress.

                  System in keeping the Antarctic region and its oceans free from militarisation and exploitation of resources, things which are critical to Australia's national security as well as to the fish stocks and other mammals that feed on those fish in the southern oceans.

                 <p>
                  The Labor Party and the members here claim there are no cuts. If they wish to use that terminology that's fine, but we know from the emails from the leadership of the
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Antarctic_Division" rel="nofollow">
                   Australian Antarctic Division
                  </a>
                  that they are having to manage with $25 million less. Don't call it a cut if you prefer not to, but the division has $25 million less to pursue its programs. That reminds me of the precedent we've seen in areas affecting national security, including the Defence budget this year, where there was a lot of discussion about the urgency and the agreement of the 2020Defence Strategic Update. Yet when independent observers such as
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASPI" rel="nofollow">
                   ASPI

                  </a>
                  —who have long done well-respected, independent analyses of the Defence budget—looked at the papers they said that there has actually been a $1.5 billion cut over the next three years in the Defence budget. So the Labor government can say one thing, yet independent experts, whether it be the head of
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAD" rel="nofollow">
                   AAD
                  </a>
                  or ASPI, look at their budgeting and say that the agencies concerned have less money to do their job with. In Defence's case it's because the inflationary pressures around the cost of operating Defence continue to go up. So in real terms the ASPI assessment is correct in that Defence has $1.5 billion less to do the vital job of protecting Australia's national interests.

                  The significance of the investment and the work in the Antarctic is that when the whole treaty system is up for renegotiation—of which Australia is a founding member and a major player, with a claim of 42 per cent over the Antarctic continent—the amount of investment and activity on the continent will be a critical factor in determining the validity and strength of those claims. That's why the Australian Antarctic strategy and the 20-year action plan, which was released last year in 2022, call to expand the logistical capabilities and critical research in the Antarctic ice sheet, to lead new research so as to improve our understanding, to fund new capabilities in infrastructure and to continue working closely with other Antarctic nations through the

                  . If the head of the Australian Antarctic Division is flagging that they have $25 million less then clearly those objectives will not be not met.

                  Contrary to the assertions of those opposite, under the former government there was some $800 million provided over 10 years to strengthen scientific and strategic capabilities for Antarctic work. Some of those measures included $136 million to support Australia's inland traverse capability, critical charting activities and mobile stations as well as other core activities of the division. There was $109 million to increase aerial and inland capabilities and $44 million for additional shipping to support the

                  to focus on extended science, as well as, as part of our inland capability, $35 million for medium-lift helicopters—which, as a former professional helicopter pilot, I think is a wonderful investment. It highlights the fact that the coalition put its money where its mouth was and invested in those enabling capabilities that secure our long-term position in the international community in this critical continent.
