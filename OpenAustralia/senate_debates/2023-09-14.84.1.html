         Introduction
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Statutory Declarations Amendment Bill may seem unassuming and modest, but make no mistake it will have an impact.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Each year Australian small-to-medium businesses and individuals spend an estimated 850,000 hours executing more than 3.8 million statutory declarations each and every year.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These documents are used to create reliable statements and attest to series of events for administrative, civil, commercial and private purposes. Whether it be to:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Historically, these documents have been strictly paper-based, requiring wet-ink signatures and in-person witnessing for valid execution.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Following the successful pivot to digital processes in response to the COV
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID" rel="nofollow">
         ID
        </a>
        -19 pandemic, the Australian community and businesses in particular expect Government to offer innovative digital solutions and pathways that modernise old systems and established processes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill will go some way to meeting those expectations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill will establish a framework for making Commonwealth statutory declarations that is fit for purpose, less cumbersome and reflects the way that Australians want to engage and communicate digitally.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill will allow a statutory declaration to be executed in one of three ways:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        The three methods of execution will be equally robust, and result in an equally valid and legally effective Commonwealth statutory declaration.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Importantly, the Bill responds to community feedback on the advantages to modernising the execution requirements for these solemn documents and in providing choice in relation to their execution.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill will particularly benefit those who face barriers engaging with paper-based processes, such as those in rural, remote or regional parts of Australia, and those Australians experiencing low mobility or sensory concerns.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Those without adequate access to technological devices or internet connectivity, or those who simply prefer not to engage with the electronic or digital execution options, will not be disadvantaged by this Bill. The traditional, paper-based method of execution will continue to be available.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that technology can be used successfully and reliably to facilitate the making of Commonwealth statutory declarations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill will make permanent the temporary measures put in place during the pandemic that allow a Commonwealth statutory declaration to be witnessed remotely via video link and signed electronically.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These measures were introduced to assist .individuals who, as a result of the pandemic, were either unable to meet in person to have a statutory declaration witnessed or could not meet in person because of stay-at- home or other restrictions on movement.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The temporary measures provided for the continuity of business operations and government services during the COVID period, without compromising the solemnity or integrity of the Commonwealth statutory declarations framework.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Stakeholders have told us that the temporary measures save time and money, and provide convenience and flexibility. This Bill will ensure Australians continue to enjoy the benefits of these temporary measures enabling electronic execution after they expire on 31 December this year.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Government
        </a>
        is committed to its vision of delivering simple, secure, and connected public services for all people and business through world class data and digital capabilities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Since 2021, across various fora, business and community stakeholders have consistently told Government that they want use technology, such as digital identity frameworks, to engage with legal documents like statutory declarations in new ways.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australians want to engage digitally to access Government services, and expect that Government is responsive to the changing technological expectations of the community.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill responds to this feedback by introducing a digital verification method for making a Commonwealth statutory declaration.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The economic case for allowing statutory declarations to be executed digitally is also strong. Research undertaken in2021 estimated that digital execution could result in time and cost savings of over $156 million per annum across the economy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill will allow a person to leverage their

        to make a statutory declaration, end-to-end online, on their computer, smartphone or other portable device.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         Framework
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To future proof the Act, the Bill will provide a framework that will set out the requirements to execute a Commonwealth statutory declaration through digital verification, with technical requirements and conditions to be prescribed by regulation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The framing of these provisions is important, noting the ever-evolving nature of technology and the need for the Government to respond quickly to these changes as they arise.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         Requirements
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Like the other methods of execution, the digitally verified statutory declaration will require use of the prescribed form, that must be signed by the declarant.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Unlike the other methods, there will be no requirement that the declaration be witnessed, in-person or via audio-visual link.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Instead a number of requirements and conditions will be imposed by the framework, through the Bill and through Regulations, that together achieve the legal purposes behind witnessing and provide legal certainty and surety to requesting entities. These include:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <i>
         Identity verification
        </i>
        <i>
        </i>
       </ul>
       <ul>
        <i>
         Evidence of execution
        </i>
        <i>
        </i>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Through robust technological processes, the digital option will negate the need for physical witnessing while still satisfying the underlying rationale for witnessing requirements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         Safeguards
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        recognises that it must ensure that any digital option produces a legally effective document within appropriate safeguards that mitigate against fraud and the misuse of personal information.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Statutory declarations may contain a large volume of personal information and this Bill introduces new ways of executing statutory declarations that engages with technological services. The Bill therefore contains a number of safeguards to protect Australian's personal information, and maintain confidence in the framework, including:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>

       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        The provision enabling the Minister to prescribe further standards that a prospective digital service must meet will provide the ability to require:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TDIF" rel="nofollow">
         TDIF
        </a>
        will ensure that entities meet strict requirements for privacy protection, security, risk management and fraud control. The AGDIS has been designed to protect privacy and security so that the individual is able to control their personal information.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This means that, at least at first, the Government will be able to prescribe myGov as an approved online platform and myGovlD as an approved identity service able to verify a declarant's identity to a prescribed identity proofing level.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Through prescribing entities and requirements, the Bill will have the flexibility to adapt and grow with any expansion of the AGDIS to the private sector and states and territories. However, noting that digitally verified statutory declarations are a first of its kind, the Government would carefully consider the appropriateness of prescribing other providers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As I mentioned, copies of statutory declarations and personal information associated with the declaration will not be stored on the approved online platform or any other database. The approved online platform will only keep the minimum de-identified data required to verify execution in accordance with the requirements in the Bill.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australians Will be able to be confident that the digital option is robust and reliable, and that their personal information is secure and protected.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         Conclusion
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill modernises and re-imagines how individuals and businesses engage with solemn documents and, through extension. with the Australian Government.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill will provide the framework for a stand-alone digital statutory declaration execution service that will leverage established Australian Government digital infrastructure to allow Australians to safely and securely make a statutory declaration end-to-end online.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Consistent with the principle of consent that underpins the Australian Government Digital ID System, the Bill will also continue to provide options from which Australians can choose based on their personal circumstances and preferences, including electronic execution and traditional paper-based execution.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill will respond to how Australians want and expect to engage and communicate digitally with Government by providing options to make Commonwealth statutory declarations facilitated by technology. This Bill is an important milestone in driving the digitisation of government services. It will deliver a world-class, simple and secure public service for all Australians.
