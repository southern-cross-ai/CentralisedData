         This is a very important question from Senator McGrath because, of course, the first duty of any government is to keep Australia and Australians safe. As senators on this side know only too well, in 2018 that task is becoming increasingly complex. Whether it is in cyberdomains, space or terrorism, advances in technology are having far-reaching impacts on national, regional and global security.
        </p>
        <p>
         On cyber, we are particularly working to ensure that countries act in accordance with accepted norms. At home, we're working with the private sector to deter and respond to cyberincidents, and we're building regional capacity with our neighbours to improve cyber-resilience, as we did through our $38 million program in the Indo-Pacific. I will note that I opened

         recently.

        <p>
         Technology is also bringing access to space within the reach of more countries and businesses, including in Australia. Space, particularly the openness that satellites give us, is now more integral to our day-to-day lives and more crowded. There's a growing risk associated with so-called dual-use technologies, where a satellite might also be used as perhaps a weapon to deliberately collide with a peaceful-use satellite. These are very complex circumstances. So this government continues to work very hard with our international partners on processes that can deliver better trust and transparency in space.

         Unfortunately, Mr Terrorist—

          Mr President

         !—we also know that terrorists are proving very agile and innovative. It's a significant part of our work in this area to promote strong regional and international counterterrorism frameworks to ensure that would-be terrorists can't plan, communicate or operate with impunity. We are absolutely focused on ensuring that we keep Australians safe and that we keep us together in the face of 21st century challenges.

            A strong economy, as Senator McGrath has alluded to, does enable us to invest more in regional security initiatives, whether it's the Pacific Fusion Centre that I announced during the

            training centre in Fiji, to name just a couple of this government's recent initiatives. They enable us to work more closely with our regional partners to address security challenges of importance to them and to work in partnership with them. Not only does a strong economy enable us to invest in the essential services that Australians rely on, it also adds weight to our diplomatic efforts. That's why we place such importance on our economic diplomacy that continues to promote Australia as an attractive place to visit, to study and in which to invest. And, last week, we launched our new Economic and Commercial Diplomacy Agenda, which will enhance our support to Australian exporters looking to break into new markets.

               There are significant risks posed by other approaches. The best example we've got of that is, of course, the period of government between 2007 and 2013, when those opposite were supposedly in control. When you're in control, that apparently means that you do not invest in one new naval vessel from an Australian shipyard, you use the Defence budget as an
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATM" rel="nofollow">
                ATM
               </a>
               and you take $18 billion out of the Defence portfolio during that time in office. Our contrast, of course, is to increase government spending to two per cent of
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
                GDP
               </a>
               ahead of our target date, ensuring that we can effectively contribute to both regional and global security challenges in the years ahead. Those opposite also lost control of our borders. We know well what it meant when they dismantled the successful border protection policies of the Howard government, because, during their time in office, more than 50,000 people arrived on 800 boats, and tragically more than 1,200 people died at sea. Those—
