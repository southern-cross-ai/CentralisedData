         I thank my colleague Senator Polley. The government’s response to the very real dangers of climate change is a continuation of its reformist agenda and its commitment to make major and decisive decisions in the interests of all Australians. We have seen an example of that most recently in the Rudd Labor government’s decisive actions to the global financial and economic crisis, so tough decisions have been needed and will be needed. It was not easy to float the Australian dollar; it was not easy to pull down tariff walls; it was not easy to open up financial markets or introduce national superannuation, and responding to climate change is certainly the most difficult of all of these policies.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are tackling climate change through economic reform, for climate change is already affecting the world economy as well as national and local economies. The flow-on of these effects will mean more changes for households, family budgets and jobs. The Garnaut inquiry highlighted some inconvenient truths for some in this place. What would happen if we did nothing about climate change? Irrigated agricultural production in the Murray-Darling Basin could drop by more than 90 per cent this century if we do nothing. Unmitigated climate change would increase the cost of food by more than 10 per cent relative to other goods.

           I am glad the National Party senators are at least listening. Unmitigated climate change would lead to falling wages and rising prices, reducing the level of consumption for every Australian by around $5,700. The

           has estimated every year of delay would cost the world economy some $500 billion. They are just some of the economic costs of doing nothing. Our economic prosperity is at risk. The impact of climate change on infrastructure alone would reduce our

            , I ask a supplementary question. Can the Assistant Treasurer inform the Senate about whether there are economic opportunities we as a nation would be squandering if we fail to take the lead in meeting the challenges of a world in which climate change is a clear and present reality.

             The low-carbon economy of the future offers an enormous opportunity. It offers opportunities to those people in those countries ready to take action. China, for example, as a significant trading partner offers enormous opportunities for business to benefit from its low-carbon development. The recent report by PricewaterhouseCoopers for the China Greentech Initiative estimated the total addressable market size for clean- and low-pollution industries in China could be between

             $500 billion and US$1 trillion by 2013, so it presents significant opportunities for value adding for those countries like Australia that act early and decisively in responding to this very significant economic challenge. The low-carbon future will bring a new wave of innovation without putting the renewable energy sector, expected to grow some 30 times its current size—
