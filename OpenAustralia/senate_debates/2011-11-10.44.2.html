            I thank you for drawing it to my attention. My question is to Senator Evans as
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Government_in_the_Senate" rel="nofollow">
             Leader of the Government in the Senate
            </a>
            . I refer to this week's lame efforts by the government to distance itself from its alliance partner, the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Greens
            </a>
            . To quote one Labor senator, 'You could say we learnt our lesson. We didn't want to look like we were married to the Greens.' I also refer to statements this week by Senator Milne that the carbon tax vote 'is only the first step', that it puts in place a 'platform to campaign for even more' and that now there is no limit to 'upward ambition'. Given the government's capitulation to the ideological push by its alliance partner, the Greens, in legislating a carbon tax in breach of its promise not to introduce a carbon tax, how can Australians be assured that Labor will not give in yet again to the extreme attacks by their alliance partner, the Greens, on Australian industry, jobs and living standards?

            <p>
             I am glad the senator used the word 'lame' in introducing his question, because it certainly was. I am not sure there was much of a question in that diatribe, but to the extent there was I will try and give some sort of response. It just seems to me that it was a political diatribe, much like the many we heard during what was supposed to be a debate on important legislation this week. The government has a very positive and strong legislative agenda that it is pursuing through this parliament. We have been very successful at getting that legislation supported in this parliament. The carriage of the climate change legislation is a very important, historic achievement in this country. I would like to thank all members of parliament who supported that legislation. The government is very proud of that achievement because we regard it as important economic and social reform, but also it is a very clear sign that this government, despite not having a majority in either house of parliament, is able to work with other members of parliament of goodwill to bring forward important legislation and have it carried by the parliament.
            </p>
            <p>
             The behaviour of the opposition is in stark contrast to that of the other legislators in this place. All they are interested in doing is saying no, being oppositionists and contributing nothing to the public policy debate. This government will carry on trying to get important legislation debated and carried through this place. We hope this evening that the opposition does not continue to delay too much in getting the plain packaging tobacco legislation through the parliament. That, again, will be a very important piece of legislation in combating the terrible effects of smoking in the Australian community. We are getting on with the job.

              , I ask a supplementary question. Given the government has capitulated to Green demands to break its promise on a carbon tax, have a media inquiry, dissolve Work for the Dole, means test private health and guillotine 40 pieces of legislation, how can the public be confident that Labor will not give in to further extreme demands from their alliance partner, the Greens, in relation to the coal and gas industries, which will place our economy at even greater risk?

              <p>
               Senator Abetz's obsession with the Greens continues to worry me. I think he ought to get over it and try and join the public policy debate in this country, because that obsession is leading him down a very nasty and dead-end path. This government is getting on with its legislative agenda, governing for Australia and driving important reforms. We will continue to do that through this parliament and we will look for support from all other members of parliament prepared to enter into discussions with us about good public policy. It would be very helpful if the opposition decided to take a more positive attitude, try to contribute to the public policy debate and perhaps come on board for those important economic reforms, but at the moment there is no sign of them playing any role in public policy debate in this country, and that is a shame.

Is the minister aware of reports that his deputy, Senator Conroy, recently acknowledged that the Greens inspired carbon tax was destroying the government and admitted to grave reports about climate change science? Is this the real reason your deputy, Senator Conroy, was absent for Tuesday's vote on the carbon tax?

                    Is it not uncommon for people, when they get dissociated from the rest of the community—when they become isolated—to get paranoid and dominated by conspiracy theories. I think Senator Abetz and the opposition reflect that process. They see conspiracy theories in the Greens all the time. Now, apparently, Senator Conroy being paired while attending to cabinet duties is somehow a conspiracy. Senator Conroy was paired for the debate and has been an active participant in the parliament this week, as always. But, like many members of parliament, he occasionally is paired. He was paired with a Liberal senator. I do not know whether that is a conspiracy! Was a Liberal senator part of the conspiracy? It really is an indictment of the Liberal Party. They are so irrelevant, so paranoid and so consumed by conspiracy theories that they have nothing to offer to public policy or the parliament.
