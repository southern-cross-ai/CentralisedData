        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Conroy. I remind the minister of the government's $403 million in retrospective cuts to public hospital funding this financial year as part of its $1.6 billion in funding cuts for public hospitals in MYEFO. Will the government rule out further retrospective cuts to public hospital funding midway through a financial year in the future?

         Thank you for the opportunity to talk again, Senator Fierravanti-Wells, about what this government has been doing to increase funding—to increase funding, not as is being suggested, reduce it. Let us talk about
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         . There is a massive Commonwealth investment in New South Wales delivering more doctors, more nurses, more beds and more services to patients. Commonwealth funding to New South Wales will increase from $4.8 billion to $5.9 billion over the next four years, an increase of $1.1 billion, or 23 per cent.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are delivering $378 million more this year than New South Wales would have received if the healthcare agreement of Mr Abbott was still in place. That is right: $378 billion more than the healthcare package Mr Abbott negotiated on behalf of those opposite. With this record investment it is clear that the New South Wales government should concentrate on service delivery rather than giving inaccurate and untrue information to those opposite, because this government is delivering record funding in New South Wales.
        </p>
        <p>
         Queensland is another state which is trying to claim that the Commonwealth government is reducing health funding. Well, Mr

          Campbell Newman

         should stop his dishonest political scare campaign and start delivering better health services to Queensland families.

          , I rise on a point of order—on relevance. I asked the minister a very clear question, and that was: will the government rule out further retrospective cuts to public hospital funding midway through a financial year in the future? It is a simple question—yes or no will suffice.

                  , on a point of order: the minister's answer is no more relevant to the question than it was when you directed him to answer the question. He was asked whether the government would reinstate the retrospective funding cuts in states other than Victoria. He is defying your ruling, and you should either sit him down or insist that he answer the question.

                   There is no point of order. The minister still has 25 seconds remaining. I am listening closely to the minister's answer and you are quite correct: early on in the piece I did draw the minister's attention to the question, and I draw the minister's attention to the question once again. The minister has 25 seconds.

                    That is right. The premise of the senator's questions is that the federal government has been reducing funding to Queensland. This is false. Premier Newman is engaged in a deliberately deceitful campaign—

                             . Again, Labor's record of increasing public hospital funding is strong. Over the last five years, Commonwealth funding for public hospital services has significantly increased through the introduction of a generous indexation formula and an increase to base funding for public hospitals of $500 million per annum. The Victorian government are cutting their health budget by $616 million. The federal health funding to Victoria has increased by 26 per cent. Queensland have cut their budget by $3 billion; federal health funding to Queensland has grown 21 per cent.
