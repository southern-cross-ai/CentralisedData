        My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig. I refer the minister to the government's knee-jerk ban on the export of live cattle to Indonesia last year, made without any formal submission going to cabinet. Is the taxpayers' contingent liability for compensation to the live cattle industry still unquantifiable? If it is not unquantifiable, what is the government's estimate of the actual liability? Does the minister deny this liability will be in the hundreds of millions of dollars? What other unquantifiable liabilities are on the budgetary horizon?

         I thank Senator Abetz for his continued interest in the live animal export trade.

         say that the government supports the industry and its trade, and that is why we acted to put it on a footing. Self-regulation had failed in that industry to be able to ensure animal welfare. What the government did was to put in place a regulatory framework that meant the exporters had control right through to ensure animal welfare outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
         In terms of the contingent liability, that is an issue that has been raised in the budget. It is a matter for the Treasury to deal with. It is in the budget papers as a contingent liability. My advice today is that matters raising legal issues should be dealt with separately from me; and therefore I have said consistently that I will not comment on those matters. If it is a Treasury question then it should properly go to the Treasury portfolio. If it is an issue around legal advice then, as I have said continuously through this issue, it is an issue that I have said that I will not comment specifically on. They are matters that people can agitate, and it is not for me to question it.
        </p>
        <p>
         In terms of the broader issue around live animal exports, this government remains committed to it. We have done the right thing to ensure animal welfare is taken into account right throughout the control of the animal welfare. What that means is that, unlike the opposition, who for the 10 years they had the trade going—they have the

         , they had a range of reviews into the matter—and did nothing about it, continuing to allow animal welfare issues to remain unaddressed—

          , I ask a supplementary question. Has the minister sought or received legal advice going to issues of compensation to Seafish Tasmania as a result of the government's latest backflip? Does the government acknowledge that its knee-jerk reaction has exposed the Commonwealth to yet another significant liability, as with live cattle exports and its bungling of the

           In terms of the network tender I can reject the premise of that question. I am sure I have heard Senator Conroy answer that comprehensively a number of times. Again, in relation to matters of claims by commercial entities, they are matters the department can deal with should and when they arise. It is not something I am going to then canvass with you today. What I can say is that I have not seen any request for commercial compensation in relation to the small pelagic fishery.
          </p>
          <p>
           In terms of the broad advice from the department I continue to get advice across all of these issues. In terms of legal advice, it is a well-known principle in this place that we will take it on notice as to the particular part of that question.

                The Australian government supports investment in agriculture whether it be in live animal exports, whether it be in fisheries investment, whether it be in pasture, whether it be in cattle stations. That is because we support jobs in regional Australia. We support farms. We support building a strong economy. Our government is unambiguous and clear about our support for foreign investment.

               <p>
                If you look at the coalition, though, you are all over the shop like a dropped pie when it comes to foreign investment. You do not know whether you support it or are opposed to it. That, in fact, is what you look like: you look like a dropped pie when it comes to foreign investment. The reality is that foreign investment is not a new thing. Foreign investment has been the backbone of this country for a very long time. It is about time the doormats woke up to that and that it is important for agriculture.
