        My question is to the Minister for Finance, Senator Gallagher. Yesterday the minister outlined how the former government's tricky approach to budgeting has put several government programs and services at risk after 1 July. Can the minister update the Senate on how the former coalition government's budget would have impacted the national institutions here in the capital, which house and protect our national stories and culture?

         I thank Senator Walsh for her question and, again, for her support for important national cultural institutions here in the territory that, as Senator Walsh said, house and protect our national stories and culture.
        </p>
        <p>
         Labor's budget in October last year was the first step in cleaning up the budget mess left behind by the former government—a mess left by a tricky former government that deceptively trapped the budget with $4.1 billion worth of fiscal traps and funding cliffs for essential programs and zombie measures. Since then, we've only uncovered more evidence of these traps, these funding cliffs for programs that Australians rely on and treasure. We've also uncovered chronic underinvestment in the key cultural institutions that Australians treasure and are crumbling around us—literally crumbling. And those opposite did nothing. Those collecting institutions are there to make sure the most precious items of the Australian story are kept safe, kept publicly available and kept safe forever.
        </p>
        <p>
         But the previous government did not intend to keep these precious items safe or intact forever; the previous government only intended to care for them until 30 June this year. What did they then do after that, I wonder? Just let the gallery sink into the lake? Let the tarp on the roof of the library stay there forever, flapping in the breeze? Additional funding runs out for the

            I thank Senator Walsh for her advocacy for Trove. It is a program I have received significant representations on since taking on the role of finance minister. Trove is one of the Australian government's most visited online services, with more than 50,000 visits a day. Yet again, like the list that I went through before, it was chronically starved of funds by the coalition. Australians from every state and territory use Trove to research and find their family history, and it's a tool that helps Australians to get to know themselves better.
           </p>
           <p>
            Not only does Trove attract more than 50,000 visits a day; it's got over 1,500 digitised newspaper titles and 900 partner institutions. Under the coalition's proposal, under their arrangements, it will run out of funding on 30 June this year, leaving thousands of Australians unable to research family history and to undertake that important work. This is what we are uncovering line by line as we work through the former government's budget.

              Minister, as more Australians operate their daily lives online, the role of the eSafety Commissioner is becoming even more crucial. Can the minister outline to the Senate how the former government's approach to this government agency would have left Australians more at risk online, and how the Albanese Labor government will take a different approach?

                   I'll take the interjection from Senator Birmingham. We started cleaning up the mess in October—$4.1 billion. We started to clean up the mess and will continue it in this budget.

                      Thank you, Minister Farrell. I asked the minister to resume her seat because there is too much disorder in the chamber, particularly from the frontbench on the left side, but not only there. I would ask senators—all senators—to listen respectfully and silently.

                       On the important eSafety Commissioner, their important base funding of $10.3 million has never been increased since it was established in 2015, and they're facing a fiscal cliff of $23.3 million from 30 June this year. This is how they budgeted. They were budget vandals, and we're cleaning up the mess.
