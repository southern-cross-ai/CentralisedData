        My question is to Senator Coonan, the Minister for Communications,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Technology" rel="nofollow">
         Information Technology
        </a>
        and the Arts. Has the minister seen reports that the ABC board will release new editorial guidelines to fight what it sees as bias in a range of non-news programs, including children’s television and comedy? Does this mean that comedy programs like
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Glasshouse" rel="nofollow">
          The Glasshouse
         </a>
        </i>
        will now be subject to guidelines setting ‘standards of impartiality’? Is the minister aware of whether any commercial broadcaster is subject to similar standards? Can the minister also advise what impact these guidelines will have on children’s programming? Does the minister have any concerns about bias on programs such as
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wiggles" rel="nofollow">
          The Wiggles

        and
        <i>
         Bananas in Pyjamas
        </i>
        ? Should there be a green Wiggle, perhaps? Should other fruits and vegetables get their own shows? Isn’t this just a ridiculous attempt by a board stacked with zealots to remake the ABC in its own extreme conservative image?

         I thank Senator Conroy for the question. To continue the analogy, that was a question from a real fruit tingle. Whether Senator Conroy thinks that
         <i>

         </i>
         is a children’s program or not is not entirely clear. I am aware that the ABC will be releasing revised editorial policies today—16 October—to come into effect on 1 March next year. I am advised that the editorial policies have been devised following extensive consultation with the ABC staff and managers and the board. Senator Conroy will note that I have not said anything about extensive consultation with me. I have not said anything about that, because that is not the case. Staff were briefed on the proposed changes today at midday, as I understand it. The managing director, Mr Mark Scott, will be making an address on the policies later in the day.
        </p>
        <p>
         I have been given to understand that the policies will make some significant changes.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_ABC" rel="nofollow">
          The ABC
         </a>
         will demonstrate impartiality at the platform level—that is, across
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_TV" rel="nofollow">
          ABC TV
         </a>
         , ABC radio and ABC online—regarding opinion on topical and factual content. That will mean that the ABC will provide its audience with a range of different perspectives on the subject under consideration. There will be a new content category called ‘opinion’, meaning content presented from a particular point of view about a matter of public contention. In respect of such issues, a range of views must be presented over time. Finally, a director of ABC editorial policies will be appointed. This new position will provide independent assessment of the ABC’s editorial performance.
        </p>
        <p>
         Based on the limited information that I have received at this stage, the new editorial policies certainly appear to me to represent common sense and integrity in national broadcasting. That is very welcome and very timely. As I understand it, the policies require impartiality at the content or program level for news and current affairs. As to opinion and topical and factual content, there will be a requirement for impartiality at the platform level—that is, across the platform of ABC TV, ABC radio and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_Online" rel="nofollow">
          ABC Online
         </a>
         . While I understand that the new policy—rightly—has a strong focus on balance and impartiality for news and current affairs and topical and factual opinion, that is less strongly emphasised in relation to performance content such as drama, satire and comedy. This too seems to demonstrate a sensible differentiation and a common sense approach.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Managing Director of the ABC has clearly stated that ABC journalists will be able to undertake courageous journalism, journalism that is fair, accurate, balanced and objective. That is entirely what one would expect from any impartial public broadcaster. With the charter the ABC has, it has an obligation to present news and views in a fair and appropriate way. I must say that I welcome this new look at the ABC’s editorial policies. I have yet to see them in any detail but insofar as it is suggested that this is something to do with some government push, that is dead wrong. Obviously, the motivation for these policies has come from the board and from management. These policies are welcome, and it is appropriate that they be implemented.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Now that the minister has confirmed that an ombudsman-style manager will be established to address complaints about ABC bias and to test whether or not there is balance over time, will she now accept that this is just an attempt to bully and intimidate ABC staff into reflecting the government’s preferences? Why is the minister allowing the board to use our national broadcaster to settle scores in her cultural war?

           I thank Senator Conroy for what I regard as a compliment. He thinks that I have such influence over the ABC that somehow or other it is doing my bidding, when I do not even know what is in this editorial policy, apart from a broad outline given to me before question time. This is nonsense; this is paranoia at its absolute best on the part of the Labor Party. They need to get a grip on themselves. They need to get out a bit more and understand that the ABC represents all Australians and is discharging its charter.
