        I'm grateful for this opportunity to deliver a speech written by Keira Fuller, a 16-year-old from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        , as part of the Raise our Voice program, and she says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Imagine what Australia could look like—and feel like—within the next decade if Parliament listens to diverse perspectives and actively seeks out young people's assistance in decision making.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I believe there should be more opportunities and connections for young,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations
        </a>
        , people of colour and LGBTQIA+ people to be involved in decision-making in Parliament.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Politicians have so much power over the legislation, laws, and opinions of Australians, however these views and opinions are often from the same types of people.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As young people, we cannot vote until we turn 18 but we have so much to contribute.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There is a stereotype that young people are uneducated on 'the real world' that I whole-heartedly disagree with.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia's youth have access to so many different resources that keep us informed and in touch with environmental and humanitarian problems we are facing.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We have so much knowledge and experience on what it's like to live in our modern-day Australian society. We question everything and have the determination to change things.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Our voices are so valuable if only people in power are willing to listen.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If only they are willing to work with us, not just for us.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        With accessible channels open to communication, we could have a more wide-spread, current view on many topics and ensure they are actively resolved.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Creating a more equal, inclusive Australia, for the world to be inspired by.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Our voices hold so much value, and we are right here, ready for the opportunity to share that with Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you, Keira. I am so proud to read your words in parliament and can assure you that this government takes your voice very seriously and I look forward to meeting you.
