        Since the terrorist attacks in the United States on that fateful day of 11 September 2001, there have been significant efforts made right around the world to improve transport security. Consistent with this, the former coalition government made ongoing efforts to ensure Australia had a security regime suitable for protection against potential terrorist threats and attacks. The

         Transport Security Legislation Amendment (2010 Measures No. 1) Bill 2010
        </a>
        relates to both aviation transport security and maritime transport and offshore facility security.
       </p>
       <p>
        Both these forms of transport in the air and on the sea are particularly important to Australia, bearing in mind that one has to travel approximately 4,000 kilometres from east to west to cross our continent. Our aviation industry is central to the Australian economy. We are all aware that our maritime industry is equally critical to our economic prosperity. Australia relies on sea transport for 99 per cent of our exports, and a substantial portion of our domestic freight is also sent by sea.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill amends both the Aviation Transport Security Act and the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act. The amendments to the first act are designed to increase the flexibility of the aviation transport security framework to rapidly respond to an aviation security incident. In relation to the maritime act there are various amendments, which, amongst other things, give or allow for increased powers to various maritime security officials for various purposes. This bill seeks to introduce new security arrangements for both civil aviation and passenger ships.

        </a>
        mentioned this bill at some length in his speech in the other place. The coalition supports any legislation that continues to improve both maritime and aviation security. These amendments do that. We recognise in the coalition that threats to our security are increasingly complex and unpredictable and that we must get on the front foot with a coordinated and uncompromising approach to protecting our marine borders and our aviation spaces. This bill does that and for that reason the coalition supports it. We commend the bill to the Senate.
