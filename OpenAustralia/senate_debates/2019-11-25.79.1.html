          I thank Senator Molan for that question and, like the general acclamation in the chamber just then, I also welcome you back and look forward to working with you again on defence and national security issues. In relation to the question, the Indo-Pacific region is clearly facing an increasingly complex and dynamic strategic environment. Major power rivalries,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korean" rel="nofollow">
           North Korean
          </a>
          nuclear activities, challenges to international law in the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China_Sea" rel="nofollow">
           South China Sea
          </a>
          and asymmetric threats such as terrorism and cyberwarfare all have the potential to undermine security in our region.
         </p>
         <p>
          South-East Asia is at the centre of these shifting dynamics, making regional forums that facilitate dialogue between us all and cooperation more important than ever. Since its establishment in 1967,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN" rel="nofollow">
           ASEAN
          </a>
          has been a central pillar of regional peace, stability and also cooperation. Australia became ASEAN's first dialogue partner 45 years ago and has since maintained a very strong commitment to engagement with ASEAN and also participation in ASEAN-centred institutions.
         </p>
         <p>
          Australia remains steadfastly committed to ASEAN's centrality, which is why, last week, I was delighted to represent Australia at the 6th ASEAN Defence Ministers' Meeting Plus in Bangkok in Thailand, and I congratulate the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Thailand" rel="nofollow">
           Kingdom of Thailand
          </a>
          for conducting and delivering such an important forum. The ADMM-Plus is the premier forum for engagement between regional defence ministers. It seeks to foster practical military cooperation between the 10 ASEAN countries and eight Plus countries: Australia, China, India, Japan,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
           New Zealand
          </a>
          , the Republic of Korea, Russia and also the United States. In Bangkok I had the opportunity to meet all ASEAN defence ministers, and I reiterated Australia's strong commitment to cooperation and to cooperating with ASEAN Plus to reinforce promotion of openness, trust and practical cooperation.

             This year's ADMM-Plus meeting was productive and it also unanimously adopted the joint statement on advancing partnership for sustainable security. Australia's input helped to reinforce commitment to the peaceful resolution of disputes in accordance with international law and to respect for freedom of navigation and overflight. The forum reviewed the progress of cooperation through the working groups on

             , maritime security, military medicine, counterterrorism, peacekeeping, humanitarian mine action and cybersecurity. Australia announced it will co-chair the expert working group on military medicine with Brunei from next year. I was also delighted to announce, with the Philippines' Secretary of
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Defense" rel="nofollow">

             , Lorenzana, that Australia will transition its support under Operation Augury in the Philippines to an enhanced defence cooperation program from the end of this year. This will enable the ADF to continue its highly valued support for countering regional terrorism.

                Yes, I can. As I've just said, Australia is facing challenges in our region that are increasing in number and also complexity. Australia cannot deal with these challenges in isolation, and strengthening defence relationships with regional partners is crucially important. In South-East Asia alone, the ADF is busier than ever, conducting around 50 bilateral and multilateral exercises each and every year with some of our closest partners and friends, including Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. The ADF is also working with regional allies such as the United States and Japan, including through the United States Force Posture Initiatives and

                </a>
                , to increase our interoperability and to maximise our defence engagement in our region. This government will continue to work with our partners in support of the security and stability of our region.
