        My question is addressed to Senator Abetz, the Minister representing the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Has the minister now been informed that the Chair of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_Export_Authority" rel="nofollow">
         Wheat Export Authority
        </a>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Transport Committee
        </a>
        admitting that he gave misleading evidence at estimates last November? Why did it take three months for Mr Besley to correct the record, when his evidence was so blatantly wrong?
       </p>
       <p>
        When was the minister first informed that the evidence given by Mr Besley to estimates was incorrect and that the Wheat Export Authority had investigated
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWB" rel="nofollow">
         AWB
        </a>
        ’s contracts with Iraq and the use of a Jordanian trucking company? What steps did the minister then take to ensure that the record was corrected immediately? Is the minister satisfied that the Wheat Export Authority did all that it could to correct the record, when it must have known that the evidence it gave at estimates was so obviously wrong?

         The honourable senator can use rhetorical flourishes to try to beat this issue up but Mr Besley’s letter is somewhat different. In it he refers to ‘factually incomplete’ as opposed to ‘misleading’. There is no doubt that Mr Besley reconsidered his evidence after Senate estimates—and I indicate that all honourable senators know that it is not uncommon for witnesses before Senate estimates or indeed other Senate committees, on reflection, to note that they have given incomplete information.

               , but until such time as these things are fully determined, it is inflammatory to use language such as ‘misleading’ as opposed to ‘factually incomplete’—and there are differences in the nuances there. At the end of the day, it will be for the inquiry to make these determinations. I do not, unlike those opposite, seek to set myself up to make the sorts of determinations that they want to.
              </p>
              <p>
               In relation to when the minister became aware of Mr Besley’s reconsideration of his evidence, that is an appropriate question. I do not know the answer to that. I will take that on notice and find out from the minister when he first became aware of that. In relation to the other matters, I suggest to those on the other side that they take a bit of a cold shower and allow the inquiry to undertake the very important task that it has.

                    The issues here are serious. They should not be trawled through, as the opposition are seeking to do. It is appropriate that these issues come before an inquiry. That is why we have set up this inquiry. The Prime Minister has already made it clear that, should the commissioner seek that ministers and other people appear then that will occur. The relevant documentation has been put before the commission as well.

                     , I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for belatedly getting back to part of the question. The minister did not advise us what steps the minister took to ensure that the record was corrected immediately, as required, and we have not been told whether the minister is satisfied that the

                     did all that it could to correct the record, when it must have known that the evidence it gave to estimates was so obviously, blatantly and completely wrong, given the letter that was released yesterday.

                    <p>
                     Why did the minister choose to bluster and obfuscate during question time yesterday? Was Minister Abetz aware of the letter from Mr Besley during question time yesterday? Had he been briefed by Minister McGauran in relation to that letter and his answer in question time yesterday? And is it true that he knew that the

                     sleazy deal had been known to the Wheat Export Authority? Was this simply another effort to cover up the truth or had the minister simply failed to read the brief?

                      Once again we have got the language ‘seeking to cover up the truth’ or ‘giving evidence that they must have known to be wrong’. It seems as though we do not need an inquiry on this because those on the other side have already made all the determinations that are needed. Commissioner Cole does not need to undertake any further investigation because the smart brains of Senator O’Brien and Senator Ray have already determined the state of mind of everybody in this. I have indicated previously that we as a government will cooperate fully with the inquiry. We want to get to the bottom of this. As to when Mr Besley became aware of the factually incomplete evidence that he gave and when the minister found out about that, I have already agreed that I will take that on notice.

                       Before I call Senator Ferguson, I say to those on my left: when you are asking ministers questions, how can they possibly answer the questions if there is continual noise and interjections from that side? I ask you to consider that before the next question.
