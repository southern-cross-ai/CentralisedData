If it is possible to prepare a detailed summary of the document, doesn’t that prove, if any further proof were necessary, that the claim that the commercially confidential information in the document could not have been identified and redacted to enable the release of the full document before parliament rises is a lie?

         I thank Senator Brandis for his ungracious question.

         Co. has finalised its three-year corporate plan and its 30-year business plan. The company submitted the plan to the government on 8 November 2010. The government is committed to releasing as much information as possible from the business case and released a summary of the business case on 24 November 2010.
        </p>
        <p>
         As the Prime Minister said yesterday, the summary was released to facilitate the passing of the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2010, which facilitates the structural separation of Telstra. Following a series of detailed discussions with the Independent senators, the government determined that it was possible to publicly release this material from NBN Co.’s business case in order to answer some of their key questions. The government has been very careful to ensure that the released material does not cause any market uncertainty and that the material does not relate to matters which are under cabinet consideration. As the Prime Minister has made clear, NBN Co.’s business plan will be released in December. The business case summary includes material on capital and operational expenditure, government equity investments, products to be released to consumers, the basis for the pricing of NBN Co.’s products and NBN Co.’s risk management. The summary expands on the information in the letter we received from NBN Co. on 19 November. It confirms that the NBN will be built on a financially viable basis with affordable prices for consumers.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I note that the ground put forward by the minister for not releasing the full document before parliament rises is no longer ‘commercial in confidence’ but ‘consideration by cabinet’. Since the business case has obviously already been the subject of detailed and close analysis by the government, does the minister still maintain the fiction, 16 days after its delivery, that a redacted form of the full document cannot now be released? What interest is the minister protecting—the public interest, or his own collapsing career?

                    , I ask a further supplementary question. If the minister cannot be honest with the Australian parliament about the cost of the single largest project in Australian history—and he has just represented to the Senate content from the document which it does not in fact say—how can he be expected to maintain the confidence of the public and of the markets?

                     As I was saying, the business case says many important and detailed things. It confirms that the

                      , on a point of order: Senator Conroy says it reduces prices over time; in fact, that excludes the basic service offering—and that is on page 21.

                         The financially illiterate on the other side clearly do not understand the difference between nominal prices and real prices. Let me be very clear: real prices, at least for the base product, will go down; and nominal prices will fall, over time, for the entire product range. I cannot help the fact that those opposite are economically illiterate.
