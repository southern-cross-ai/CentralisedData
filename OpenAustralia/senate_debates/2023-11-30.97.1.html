        My question is to the Leader of the Government, representing the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
         Climate Change
        </a>
        and Energy. Today, the climate change minister delivered the
        <i>
         Annual

        <i>
         climate change statement
        </i>
        <i>
         2023
        </i>
        . But what was not mentioned in that speech was the uncomfortable fact that the emissions figures released today show that, in the last 12 months under your government, national emissions have gone up by 3.6 million tonnes. Why are you still continuing to open up new coal and gas mines?

         I thank the senator for her question. What I would say to you—and I confess: with all the things we've had in the chamber and elsewhere today, I haven't read all that the minister said—is that I would think this makes the very point that I have made in this chamber to you: our targets are, whilst achievable, ambitious. This is the fundamental difference between your party and our party. We have, for many years, wanted to take action on climate change. We have fought to take action on climate change. We have brought legislation into this chamber, including for an emissions trading scheme, which was sunk by your party. We understand we have to transition an economy which is very emissions intensive to be able to be competitive in a world which is moving to net zero. We also understand that you don't do that by engaging in stunts and slogans. You don't do that by coming into the chamber and asking questions. You don't do that by making political points. You do that by doing what Minister Bowen is doing, which is to put in place the policy mechanisms to drive that change.
        </p>
        <p>
         We accept that this is ambitious. It is. But, instead of coming in here and telling us we should be doing more, perhaps you could focus on what could be done to transition this economy whilst ensuring we maintain a strong economy. The answer cannot be that we don't transition to an economy that is equally prosperous and resilient. We have to continue to make sure we have a prosperous and resilient economy as we make this transition. Herein lies the difference between the Greens and the Labor Party.

           Minister Bowen rightly told the House that the climate crisis is a national security crisis. This means that every new coal and gas mine the government approves makes Australia less safe. Why is the government determined to expand Australia's coal and gas industry?

             <p>
              Senator, I go back to what I said at the beginning. We recognise this is a transition that is going to take time. We don't believe that the way in which we either reach our own domestic emissions targets or contribute to global emissions reducing over the trajectory that has to occur is by simply shutting down parts of our economy. We don't believe that. Now, what we do have to do is to transition in the way we are doing, and we've put in place the safeguards mechanism, and we have a capacity investment scheme, which the minister announced last week. They are all about making sure we make that transition.
             </p>
             <p>
              I have said many times in this place precisely that: that climate change is a national security issue, and it is an economic issue, as well as an environmental issue.

                 The senator would well know, first, that domestic household gas consumption is an important part of people's everyday energy consumption, and it will remain so for some time. You would also know that the transition to renewables will take time and will take policy.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I regret—I do regret—that we are having this debate in 2023. I stood here in 2009—not in this place; I think it was over here—and I would've liked the mechanism that we put in place then to have been in place. What we did pass was the renewable energy target legislation; expansion of that target was legislation I introduced, and that has been successful. It shows what you can do when you have a regulatory system which actually drives investment in renewables and in the transition which is required.
