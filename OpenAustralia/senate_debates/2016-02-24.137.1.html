         I thank Senator Carr for his question, and I am aware of an article in
         <i>
          The Australian
         </i>
         this morning that alluded to a number of these issues. The article is incorrect in making the assertion that this was under consideration by me. I stated yesterday that, as part of taking over this portfolio, I have recommitted to the review of the

         system that was announced by the government last year. I am being briefed, and I am discussing a number of options, but at no point have I got to actually considering specific options. I look forward over the coming weeks to meeting a number of the key stakeholders in the sector. I am keen to listen to their views. I am keen to hear all views about how to make this system more financially sustainable as well as to increase the mechanisms by which the Commonwealth can undertake compliance. I think the senator will appreciate that it would be foolish of me to state that I have any preferred options after six days in the role.

           Senator Carr, I disagree with your assertion in the first part of the question that the challenges this sector is facing are as a result of changes and policy implemented last December by the coalition government or indeed earlier last year by the previous minister, Senator Birmingham. All

My department undertakes compliance monitoring of the tuition assurance status of the providers. It is currently involved in a number of major compliance investigations but it would be premature to comment on the details at this stage.

             I am happy to address that, because the problems in this sector occurred under policies that were put in place under the watch of the previous government. And, quite frankly, as I said yesterday, the substantial and unprecedented growth that I have not seen in another government program has partly come about, along with some of the problems, because of my early view that there is a flawed legislative framework for this program. I have made this and will make this my highest priority, because this is an important sector to Australia and, in fact, some of the problems in the

             Senator Carr, it is disingenuous in the extreme, given legislation put in place by your previous government, for you to assert that the problems that have arisen as a result of that are in any way attributable to this government, which under numerous ministers has actually taken substantial measures to address the flaws you left in place.
