           The government will not be supporting this motion. The minister has maintained his claim of public interest immunity in relation to certain documents sought. The claim is consistent with longstanding practices under previous governments. The minister has previously said that this issue would be considered by the Australian Universities Accord. It's been addressed in the accord's final report, which has now been released, and the government is considering its response to that report.

            The question is that general business notice of motion No. 512, standing in the name of Senator Henderson, be agreed to.
