        ’s historic reform to amend many Commonwealth laws that discriminate against same-sex de facto couples and their children.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Attorney-General introduced the first bill, the Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws—Superannuation) Bill 2008 in the House on 28 May 2008.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Today we undertake major reforms which will effectively remove same-sex discrimination from almost all areas of Commonwealth activity.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This bill will amend 68 Commonwealth laws.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It will not only remove discrimination against same-sex couples—they also remove discrimination against their families and children.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Shameful delay in removing discrimination
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am sure many would agree that these reforms are long overdue.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The delay in removing this discrimination is a matter of shame for both sides of politics.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is almost 20 years since ‘sexual preference’ was added as an additional ground of discrimination under the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights" rel="nofollow">
         Human Rights
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Opportunity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Equal Opportunity Commission
        </a>
        Regulations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In 1997 the Senate and Legal and Constitutional Committee identified discrimination in Commonwealth laws and programs that deal with tax and superannuation benefits.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In 2004, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
         UN
        </a>
        Human Rights Committee found that Australia was in breach of the prohibition on discrimination in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Civil_and_Political_Rights" rel="nofollow">
         International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
        </a>
        because Veterans Entitlement Act denied a person a pension on the basis of their sexual orientation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And of course, in May last year the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_and_Equal_Opportunity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission
        </a>
        released its report Same-Sex: Same Entitlements—the outcome of a significant national inquiry and consultation on that issue.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         The Commission
        </a>
        found that:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         At least 20 000 same-sex couples experience systemic discrimination on a daily basis.
        </li>
        <li>
         Same-sex couples and their families are denied basic financial and work-related entitlements which opposite-sex couples and their families take for granted.
        </li>
        <li>
         Same-sex couples are not guaranteed the right to take carer’s leave to look after a sick partner.
        </li>
        <li>
         Same-sex couples have to spend more money on medical expenses than opposite-sex couples to enjoy the Medicare and PBS Safety Nets.
        </li>
        <li>
         Same-sex couples are denied a wide range of tax concessions available to opposite-sex couples.
        </li>
        <li>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_same" rel="nofollow">
          The same
         </a>
         -sex partner of a defence force veteran is denied a range of pensions and concessions available to an opposite-sex partner.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        On coming to office, the Attorney-General instructed his Department to carry out a whole-of-government audit of Commonwealth legislation building on the Commission’s excellent work.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The audit confirmed Commission’s findings.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It further identified that discrimination also occurs in a range of non-financial areas, such as administrative and evidence laws.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         What the bill will do
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This bill removes discrimination against same-sex couples and their children in many of the laws that were identified by the Commission and the audit.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill will ensure in each law it amends that same-sex couples and their families are recognised.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The amendments in the bill recognise a same-sex partner and adopt a similar approach to that taken in the first Bill to recognise a child in a same-sex family.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The general approach taken by the bill is that a child will include a child that is the product of a relationship, where one partner is linked biologically to the child or where one partner is the birth mother of the child.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        By applying this definition, opposite-sex and same-sex families are treated equally.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        is aware of criticism of this approach.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        However, without it there is a risk that we will not recognise all children in same-sex families.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The approach also avoids relying on inconsistent State and Territory parenting presumption laws.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We must take a national approach to addressing these issues.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Many in this House would agree that it would be inappropriate for Commonwealth benefits to recognise children on the basis of which State or Territory they happen to have been born in.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Definition of a ‘de facto partner’
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill includes a new definition of de facto partner which will be included in the Acts Interpretation Act.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This definition will become the standard definition for most Commonwealth laws.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It will provide a more consistent and uniform approach to defining who is a de facto partner across a range of Commonwealth laws.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It will apply to de facto partnerships whether the parties to the relationship are of the same sex or different sexes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This definition of de facto partner will recognise two different types of relationships.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The couple will be taken to be in a de facto relationship if they have a relationship as a couple living together on a genuine domestic basis having regard to a number of circumstances included within the definition.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Registered relationships
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The definition will also clearly recognise registered relationships, or relationships that have been registered under prescribed State and Territory relationship registration schemes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        What this will mean is that couples who have registered their relationships under a State or Territory law will not have to demonstrate the circumstances to satisfy the definition of de facto partner under most Commonwealth laws.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        They will be taken to be a de facto partner on the basis that they have satisfied the requirements for registration under the relevant State or Territory law.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This will provide a significant incentive for couples to register their relationships under State or Territory schemes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        They can be confident that registration of their relationship under a State or Territory scheme will, for most purposes, be recognised automatically by the Commonwealth.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is also an incentive to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_Territories" rel="nofollow">
         States and Territories
        </a>
        that do not have such schemes to develop their own.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Acts that take a different approach
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The definition in the Acts Interpretation Act will not be used in all the Acts being amended by the bill.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Some Acts, such as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Social Security Act
        </a>
        and the Migration Act and the Veterans’ Entitlements Act, currently have their own approach to defining who is a member of a couple or a de facto partner or a child of a person.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Given the specific issues that are dealt with by these Acts, a slightly different approach to the definition of de facto partner or child is adopted.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The factors are generally similar but they do not refer to the new definition of de facto partner to be inserted in the Acts Interpretation Act.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In relation to these Acts, the bill amends the relevant provisions to ensure that same-sex couples and their families are recognised.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Interdependency
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill does not recognise interdependent relationships.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recognising interdependent relationships raises many complex issues.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These relationships can be difficult to define.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There is no consistency in how they are defined or applied across Commonwealth laws or programs.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And there is also a lack of reliable data on the likely numbers of relationships—which makes it difficult to calculate the financial implications of any recognition.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Interdependency can include a wide range of relationships from flatmates to adult children living at home to siblings who care for one another and who are emotionally and financially dependent on each other.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recognising interdependent relationships may not be appropriate in all situations. For example, in the social security or pension context it could mean that two sisters who live together would be treated as a couple and receive a lower amount in pension because of their interdependent relationship.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        While the position of some interdependent relationships (such as carers) may need to be closely considered by Government—this bill (which seeks to remove discrimination against same-sex couples and their families) is not the vehicle to address those concerns.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Marriage and marital status discrimination
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This bill also removes some laws that treat people in the same circumstances differently depending on whether they are married or not.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For example, at the moment an opposite-sex de facto partner of a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament" rel="nofollow">
         Member of Parliament
        </a>
        is not recognised for the purposes of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_Parliament" rel="nofollow">
         Members of Parliament
        </a>
        (Life Gold Pass) Act.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Nor is the opposite-sex de facto partner considered the associate of a person for the purposes of the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It seems incredible that for almost 24 years it has been unlawful to discriminate against a person on the basis that they are or are not married.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And yet Commonwealth laws still exist that only provide a benefit to a person on the basis that they are married to another person while a person who is in exactly the same situation but not married would be denied that benefit.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill addresses these areas by recognising both opposite-sex couples and same-sex de facto couples.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Step-children, step-parents, widow/ers
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Another area of marital status discrimination is in relation to step-children, step-parents, widowers and widows.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Currently, the ordinary meaning of these terms requires that a person be married.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This problem must be addressed if we are to remove discrimination as children in same-sex families would never qualify as step-children because same-sex couples cannot marry their partners.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The problem not only effects same-sex de facto couples but also affects opposite-sex couples.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill expands the definitions of ‘step-child’ and ‘step-parent’ to include a child of an opposite-sex or same-sex de facto partner by a former relationship and to include a same-sex or opposite-sex de facto partner of a parent of a child by a former relationship.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Another example of marital status discrimination is where entitlements are payable only to a ‘widow’ or ‘widower’.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Again, the ordinary meaning of these terms requires a person to have been married to another person.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Without amendment a de facto partner (whether of the same or different sex) would not be entitled to the benefit as they were never married to that person.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill’s general approach to these issues is to replace the terms by referring to a surviving spouse or de facto partner.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Tracing rule
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill also introduces a tracing rule to identify family relationships.

        Where family relationships such as ‘brother’, ‘aunt’, and ‘grandparents’ are provided for in an Act, the tracing rule will allow relationships referred to in the Act to include relationships that are traced through the child-parent relationship.

        This will ensure that family relationships will be recognised in same-sex couple families in the same way as they are recognised in opposite-sex couple families.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For some of the Acts amended by the bill transitional, saving and application provisions have been drafted to ensure the smooth implementation of the amendments.

       <p class="italic">
        A provision has also been added to the bill allowing the Governor-General to make regulations prescribing matters of a transitional nature (including prescribing any saving or application provisions) relating to amendments and repeals made by the bill.

         Diminishing Marriage
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is unfortunate that this debate sometimes gets sidetracked into a debate about undermining the important position of marriage in our community. Removing discrimination against same-sex couples does not undermine marriage.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The issue of same-sex marriage is a separate issue from that of providing equal recognition for same-sex couples and their families.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Rudd Government’s policy on marriage is very clear.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It reflects the widely held view in the community that marriage is between a man and a woman.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This in turn reflects the traditional view of marriage that has been built over many centuries.

         Conclusion
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Removing discrimination is about making sure that same-sex couples and their families are recognised for all practical purposes and have the same entitlements as opposite-sex de facto couples.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill provides equality of treatment for children who are brought up in same sex families in many Commonwealth programs and laws.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It provides functional recognition of these families in a way which will make a real practical difference to their lives as well as removing discrimination.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is time to stop treating people differently under Commonwealth laws or programs because of who they love.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is also time to stop treating children differently under Commonwealth laws or programs because of the sexual orientation of their parents.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This bill is long overdue and will remove discrimination to ensure that same-sex couples and their children will be able to receive the same treatment as opposite-sex de facto couples and their children in the same circumstances.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It represents a major step to ensuring full equality before the law for all Australians, regardless of their sexuality.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I commend the bill to the Senate.

        Ordered that further consideration of this bill be adjourned to the first day of the next period of sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.
