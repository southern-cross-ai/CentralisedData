        On that previous question, Senator Faulkner, the residents of the Illawarra will be watching that issue with great interest. My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Senator Wong. I refer the minister to the government’s announcement of the requirement for employers to distribute a so-called fair work information statement under the National Employment Standards. Will the government rule out including the name of a particular union or unions or the contact information for unions in the fair work information statement?

          It is pleasing to see that the opposition have a new-found interest in the conditions of workers in the workplace because, as we know, when the opposition were last in government they were responsible for the most extreme industrial relations laws this country has ever seen.

            I note the interjection by the

             Leader of the Opposition in the Senate

            , Senator Minchin. He is a well-known supporter of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_Choices" rel="nofollow">
             Work Choices
            </a>
            . In fact, my recollection is that Senator Minchin was one of those who thought you should have gone further. Is that still your position? And he still cannot help himself. He still comes in here and defends the legacy of an industrial relations system that was all about reducing wages and conditions.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is the case, as Senator Fierravanti-Wells has indicated, that a fair work information statement is one of the 10 minimum standards. I refer her to the National Employment Standards for an outline of what is included in that statement.

             , I ask a supplementary question. It is clear that the minister refuses to rule out that there will be details about the unions in the fair work information statement. But I refer the minister to Minister Gillard’s comments last year:
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             I’m troubled Australian employers are basically being forced by the government to hand out its propaganda.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             …            …            …
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             ... the burden of that for a small business person I just think is astronomically large and I don’t see why small business people particularly should be forced to bare the burden of handing out the Howard government’s propaganda.
            </p>
            <p>
             Given these comments, will the government be legislating to exempt small business from handing out the Rudd government’s propaganda? Will the minister guarantee that no Australian worker will be worse off under Labor’s new employment standards?

             <p>
              In terms of what is included in the statement, I refer the senator to section 65(2) on page 50 of the National Employment Standards, which states:
             </p>
             <dl>
              <dt>
               (2)
              </dt>
              <dd>
               The Fair Work Information Statement must contain information about the following:
               <dl>
                <dt>
                 (a)
                </dt>
                <dd>
                 the National Employment Standards;
                </dd>
                <dt>
                 (b)
                </dt>
                <dd>
                 modern awards;
                </dd>
                <dt>
                 (c)
                </dt>
                <dd>
                 agreement-making under this Act;
                </dd>
                <dt>
                 (d)
                </dt>
                <dd>
                 the right to freedom of association;
                </dd>
                <dt>
                 (e)
                </dt>
                <dd>
                 the role of Fair Work Australia.
                </dd>

              </dd>
             </dl>
             <p>
              So it is very clear what it must contain. The regulations may prescribe other matters and I am sure that those opposite will know the process by which regulations are made.
