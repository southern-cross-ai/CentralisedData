         I don't accept that that's what he said and I don't accept that that was the issue to which he was responding when he made those remarks. I have so much experience of Labor senators misrepresenting and misquoting statements by members of other places that I don't accept it, Senator Gallagher. But I tell you what I do accept. I do accept what Mr Bill English, the Prime Minister of

                Given that that's not what she said, Senator Gallagher—once again putting words in Ms Bishop's mouth that she never uttered. I dare say that the Labor Party—we saw Senator Wong this morning being caught out and exposed by her colleague, Mr Albanese, on this matter. So you wonder why I don't accept anything that is attributed to others by those who sit behind Senator Wong. Senator Wong said this morning that at no time was the issue of Mr Joyce's identity raised. Mr Albanese, meanwhile, within an hour of Senator Wong's interview had this to say:

                   I don't know why it is you choose to ask these asinine questions, Senator Gallagher. I thought you were a bit smarter than that.

How can it be that Senator Wong, knowing what she knew, could have made the speech she made in this chamber at about 3 pm yesterday afternoon? When this issue was squarely raised, Senator Wong addressed the chamber for five minutes and not once did she reveal what she well knew: that this was orchestrated from her office by her chief of staff, and now she's been caught.
