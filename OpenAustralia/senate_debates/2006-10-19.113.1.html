        My question is to the Minister for Communications,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Technology" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and the Arts, Senator Coonan. Will the minister advise the Senate on Australia’s take-up of broadband? Is the minister aware of any alternative policies?

         I thank Senator Ronaldson for the question. Indeed, I am very confident about Australia’s take-up of broadband. Figures released by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
          OECD
         </a>
         this week show that Australia has continued its strong growth in terms of broadband take-up. I advised the Senate on Monday that the report singled out Australia as a country that is connecting to broadband at a very high rate. However, what was not entirely clear until now was just how well Australia actually did go over the past year in connecting to broadband compared to the rest of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of the 30 OECD countries, guess where Australia was ranked over the past 12 months for the growth in broadband take-up. We came second. Only Denmark is connecting to broadband at a rate greater than Australia’s. The OECD figures confirmed what we suspected, that Australia now has the second-highest growth rate for broadband in the OECD. It is an extraordinary achievement for Australia. It is further evidence that Australians are now embracing broadband faster than most other countries. Australia was previously ranked fifth in the OECD for broadband growth but, with a record number of broadband connections over the past year, we have been elevated to second.
        </p>
        <p>
         The figures show Australia is also on the verge of moving up the OECD league table on the overall number of broadband subscriptions, which was above 3½ million at the end of June. The number of broadband subscribers in Australia is well above the OECD average, climbing faster than all other OECD countries except Denmark. This extraordinary performance seems to have been somehow or other overlooked by those who diminish and disparage Australia’s performance.
        </p>
        <p>
         Perhaps we could put it in context if we liken it to the football results. It might be something that people can understand. Last year Australia made the quarterfinals in broadband take-up but not the semifinals. This year we made it all the way to the grand final and were runner-up. With the historic investment in broadband being made by this government, Australia does look set to be the premiers in the near future. It is this government’s broadband policy which is producing these results. The government’s policies are delivering strong investment in broadband. The OECD figures, which rank Australia second for broadband growth, are proof that this government’s policies are on track and working.
