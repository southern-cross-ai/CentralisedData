        The housing and rent crisis is a national tragedy. In Australia, one of the richest countries in the world for resources, we have working families homeless, sleeping in their cars or under bridges. In August 2020, the national average rent was $437 a week. It's now $627, an increase of 40 per cent in just a few years. The national rental vacancy rate is just one per cent—actually slightly under that—far below the three per cent rate that's considered a healthy market. House prices are out of control. In 1987, the average house cost 2.8 times the average income. Today, a house costs 9.7 times the average income. This is why there are hardworking Australians sleeping on the street—families on the street. People under 30 have given up hope of ever owning a home, yet we oldies are meant to hand our young people a better life than we had.

        promises to fix this housing crisis for all Australians. We will make the tough decisions that the Liberal and Labor uniparty won't. Two point eight million temporary visa holders are in the country today, up from 2.3 million pre COVID. That's an additional 200,000 homes needed for these new arrivals. While Australians can't afford roofs over their heads, we need some of these people on visas to leave. An Australian can't buy a house in China, yet foreign investors can buy both new and existing houses here. One Nation would ban all foreign ownership of residential housing. Australians must come first. We would allow people to use some superannuation to invest in their homes. After all, it's your money. We will ditch Labor's facade, its pathetic, bureaucratic Housing Australia programs. Instead, we'll use the same funds to create cheap 30-year mortgages fixed at five per cent interest to get Australians into homes.
