        by leave—It is worth while, while everyone is in the chamber, dealing with this so that all senators understand what will happen over the next couple of days. It is my intention, at the conclusion of this short statement, to move a motion to alter the hours of business for the Senate. I will go through that first. On Thursday—that is, today—the hours of meeting shall be, as we know, 9.30 am to 6.30 pm, when we will have a dinner break until 7.30 pm. Then we will go to adjournment. Adjournment will be at 11 pm. In addition, during today we will do a usual day—if I could say that, to the extent that it is—but consideration of general business, consideration of committee reports and government responses and Auditor-General reports will not be proceeded with. We will continue with routine of business from 12.45 pm until not later than 2 pm, which will be the non-controversial period and government business only. Then from not later than 4.15 pm—as I understand it—there will be a ministerial statement and there will be time to allow the opposition, the minor party and the Independents to contribute. It shall be government business from then on, on the

        legislation. Divisions may be taken after 4.30 pm today. If the Senate is still sitting at 11 pm then it shall be suspended until 9.30 am on Friday. On Friday, 27 November, the question for the adjournment shall be put at 3.45 pm.

            And there will be no adjournment debate. We will conclude at 3.45 pm. The expectation is that the committee stage of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_Pollution_Reduction_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
             Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme
            </a>
            legislation would be completed at 3.45 pm that day. On Monday, 30 November the hours of meeting shall be 10 am to adjournment. The routine of business from 10 am shall be government business only. That will include no question time. The question for the adjournment of the Senate shall be proposed after the Senate has finally considered the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation. The expectation is that we will continue to sit, although by that time I suspect that if we have completed the committee stage—with cooperation on procedures around this place—we should complete those matters of business that are required to finalise the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation on Monday. More broadly, Tuesday may be required so I would also encourage people to ensure that they have that time available—but the expectation is that we will finish on Monday. However, if it is necessary for us to come back on the Tuesday we will deal with that by agreement. That can be dealt with between the two managers.
           </p>
           <p>
            That is broadly the outline of what the government wants to be able to complete. There will also be a number of bills—and I think I have had the opportunity of talking or circulating to the opposition, the minor party and the Independents the range of bills that are still to be finalised in the spring sitting. However, there is an expectation that we will be able to deal with those on Monday, where there may be some hiatus in the program while we finally conclude the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation. But that as well will be a matter for negotiation between the managers, the minor party and the Independents. I would ask for cooperation to, as far as practicable, deal with those outstanding bills. They are listed in priority order of the government. In addition to that, there are non-controversial bills. We will need some cooperation at 12.45 to be able to complete those during that period. I know that is a long explanation, but if everyone can take that on board that is where we are at for the remainder of this week and early next week to finalise the legislative program as outlined.

              by leave—As I understand it, it is 10 am. That will also allow time for the outstanding spring 2009 bills to be dealt with. Of course, it will depend on cooperation as to what we can actually achieve in that short period, but I hope that we can work through some of the more urgent bills before we recess for the year.

               by leave—I think it is appropriate to put this on record. I have just checked with our leader and our clear understanding was a 12.30 commencement for the Senate. The House of Representatives was to come back earlier because otherwise we would be sitting around a lot longer without any action. We will not object, but we understood that that was our agreement. In relation to the bills list, I also place on record that we would want to have a negotiation about what bills are introduced because, quite clearly, we have agreed to this for a range of reasons but one of them is for the facilitation only of the

                by leave—I thank the opposition for their concession around the starting time on Monday, but I did indicate during my primary comments that it would be a matter of negotiation as to what bills we can achieve debate on. I understand there may not be much time available. If there is not then obviously we all have to cut our cloth accordingly, and that includes the government’s outstanding legislative program. I do understand that, to be able to bring on debate of the

                bills by 4.15 pm, I am now consuming time that people might want to contribute to that debate. I understand also that senators will want to provide their own contributions and ensure that others who want to contribute may also do so in the available time so that all parties may use the time effectively.

                  do not support the motion, but we will not call a division on it. We know everybody wants to move on. I have previously stated the reasons for not supporting the motion. We wrote to the executive about this months ago. I got no response whatsoever from Prime Minister Rudd—total indifference. Here we now have the government wanting the Senate to sit extra days ad hoc to facilitate its agenda. It is a totally cavalier way of treating the Senate, but, if the opposition has an arrangement to go along with that, so be it.

                  I have just given to leaders an amendment to this motion that I had hoped to have circulated earlier to have question time tomorrow and on Monday. It has always been the Greens’ point of view that if the Senate sits there ought to be a question time. It is appropriate that, if the government wants the Senate to sit extra hours, the government should subject itself to questions on the matters that the Senate might want to raise. If there are no questions, we can go straight on with business. I move:

                   It is funny that all those senators who support reducing carbon pollution are quite happy to fly back to Canberra next week with carbon dioxide spewing out of the planes. They are all very happy for that to happen, which is pretty unreal. We know that this debate on the
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_Pollution_Reduction_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
                    Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme
                   </a>
                   is already concluded because both the government and the opposition have agreed to pass the
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPRS" rel="nofollow">
                    CPRS
                   </a>
                   bills before the Copenhagen conference. The debate is going to be a sham—they already know that. Now they want to extend that sham and increase the carbon dioxide emissions that they are apparently so desperate to cut by getting us back here next week. It is a joke.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   As I have said before, the government cannot manage their way out of a wet paper bag when it comes to managing this chamber and I will not be supporting the motion to sit extra hours. Actually, the only thing of benefit that could come from the extra days is question time. That is the only thing that might hold the government to some account. Frankly, we are wasting taxpayers’ money by coming back next week. It could be done this week, because these two parties have already agreed to the deal, and they know it. They absolutely know that the debate on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme is a sham because—guess what?—the two have already agreed before we have even started. There will be no changes to the legislation other than what has already been pre-agreed. It has already been predetermined, and sitting next week is an absolute joke given that the people who want to sit next week are the same people who want to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Flying up here next week at taxpayers’ expense is just absolutely ridiculous.

                    I will only speak briefly. Let me assure the Senate of the importance of the ministerial statement I would like to make this afternoon. I also appreciate the points that are made about constraints of business. It had been my intention to make some very curtailed remarks and then incorporate my complete statement on Afghanistan. I intend to distribute to the chamber anyway the ministerial statement and I will be seeking leave to incorporate a more complete statement in
                    <i>
                     Hansard
                    </i>
                    . I hope this approach outlined by the Manager of Government Business will give the chamber adequate time—perhaps not to debate all the issues that Senator Brown was talking about but at least to, as is often the case in this chamber, allow a senator, in this case I suspect it will be Senator Johnston, to move that the Senate take note of the ministerial statement and then allow debate to ensue allow any senator who wishes to make a brief contribution to do so. Let me give this assurance to the Senate: I will keep my remarks brief to allow those senators who wish to make a contribution on the matter this afternoon within the time that has been proposed by the Manager of Government Business.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I appreciate the courtesies extended around the chamber to enable debate on this critically important issue in relation to Australia’s involvement in Afghanistan to take place. I cannot think of anything more important in terms of a capacity for the parliament, for the Senate, to receive regular reports on the situation in Afghanistan and for the Senate to have an opportunity to consider that. But in this case, of course, as is always the case, the Senate’s consideration would be around the issue of taking note of the ministerial statement. So I appreciate the courtesies around the chamber to enable this to take place and I commend the approach that has been proposed.

                     The opposition will support the government’s substantive motion and will not support the Greens amendment. I will explain briefly why. We do not believe we need to spend any more time here than necessary to deal with the
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_Pollution_Reduction_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
                      Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme
                     </a>
                     bills. We have reluctantly agreed to the extension of hours but we understand the package and the arrangements that have been negotiated between the coalition and the government. We will facilitate the additional legislation that needs to be discussed Monday morning, providing that that legislation is reached by agreement, which I indicated previously by leave.
                    </p>

                     </a>
                     again place on the record that we have found the government’s management of the annual calendar this year and again for next year to be incompetent at a best description. I also say that we have again given up our general business today. We have not lodged a matter of public importance, to assist the facilitation of the business. Irrespective of the urgency of and the necessity of Senator Faulkner’s proposition this afternoon, we are supportive of that to take place. We note that that does eat into other time, including the consideration of other documents.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The government is not off the hook in relation to its management of hours just because we have agreed that the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme suite of legislation be debated. Again I request that the government increase the number of sitting weeks for the 2010 calendar year. Could I say through you,
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
                      Mr President

                     </a>
                     that if the government had increased the number of sitting weeks then we would have been using the emissions that you were describing earlier because we should have been flying up and back at least another two or three weeks for this calendar year alone. Our frustration means that our patience is wearing thin. We have continually said that it is up to the government to set the sitting calendar so that we can work our entire calendars around that sitting framework. However, if the government continually refused to allow enough sitting weeks in each calendar year then we may then have to reconsider our position and agree with the Greens and other minor parties on increasing that sitting calendar for the Senate. I do not want to have to be in a position to stand up and do that in the new year, but the government is clearly on notice that this is the situation that has arisen this year because we have run out of sitting weeks, the lowest number for a long period of time. Again I would urge the government to consider increasing their sitting schedule for the next calendar sitting year.
