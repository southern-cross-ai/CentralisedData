         I thank the senator for her question. I can advise the chamber that on 29 July I was pleased to announce funding totalling $10 million over three years to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         government to develop accommodation and provide infrastructure for regional services in Tennant Creak and in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Springs" rel="nofollow">
          Alice Springs
         </a>
         . This critical infrastructure will be to assist end-stage renal patients who need to relocate to continue to access treatment. I think we can all agree in this chamber that it is not good enough that Aboriginal and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
          Torres Strait Islander
         </a>
         peoples in remote
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Central Australia
         </a>
         experience end-stage renal disease at rates 18 to 20 times higher than in the wider Australian population. Sadly, these people are on average at least 20 years younger than in other areas of Australia. This new funding will assist improved access to renal infrastructure in the remote communities of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_River" rel="nofollow">
          Docker River

         , allowing patients to remain in their communities.
        </p>
        <p>
         While the Northern Territory government has ongoing responsibility for the delivery of dialysis and renal services, the Commonwealth is contributing infrastructure funding to support patients to have access to the renal care they require where it is needed. The Northern Territory Minister for Housing,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bess_Price" rel="nofollow">
          Bess Price
         </a>
         , commented in her recent media release that:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         There is a high level of need for these services in Central Australia and this funding will provide much-needed support for patients to access appropriate housing, daily treatment and clinical support.
        </p>
        <p>
         I echo Ms Price's statement that both levels of government have listened to the needs of the people living remotely and I am proud to be supporting better services for the bush. The new funding complements the government's $1.4 billion commitment over three years to continue the delivery of primary health care to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.

            Sarah Brown
           </a>
           —does an amazing job working with dialysis patients and the government is pleased to be able to provide this extra funding for those renal services in Central Australia. The government is also working with Purple House to finalise details of a funding agreement to provide a further $6.3 million for the development of additional renal infrastructure in remote communities and to assist renal patients to remain in these communities. This funding will not only give patients ongoing access to dialysis treatment in country; it will assist Purple House to expand its dialysis treatment to provide holistic services and Indigenous employment.

             The renewed five-year agreement from 2015 to 2020 promotes shared responsibility and the need for genuine, ongoing partnerships between Aboriginal community controlled health services and both levels of government. The initiative is another example of a coalition government that is able to work constructively with states, territories and
