         I understand there has been considerable discussion of these amendments and there will not be any need for a prolonged debate.
        </p>
        <p>
         The delay in the commencing of the unfair contract provisions of the bill to 1 July 2010 or a date fixed by proclamation within six months of royal assent is the subject of these amendments. They seek to specify considerations the minister must take into account when prescribing terms that may be examples of unfair terms, such as the detriment caused to consumers by a term, the impact on business generally and the public interest. The amendments seek to clarify the transitional arrangements for contracts and effects before the commencement of the law, and there are various technical amendments to correct drafting errors in the bill.

          I move amendment (1) standing in my name on sheet 6093:

          (1)   Government amendment no. 38 on sheet
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BJ" rel="nofollow">

          </a>
          236, after “Commission”, insert “or any other person”.
         </p>
         <p>
          To put it in context, the government’s amendment (38) allows a person who is party to a consumer contract to, along with the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
           ACCC
          </a>
          , seek a declaration that a term is unfair. The amendment that I have moved seeks to add ‘or any other person’ to this so as to allow parties such as consumer groups to seek a declaration that a term is unfair on behalf of all Australian consumers who may not be able to do so on an individual basis. So it is a question of standing in terms of any action, and I commend the amendment to the Senate. This is about broadening the category of persons that can actually bring an action, and it is much more practical for a consumer group, an entity representing consumers, to take this matter forward, rather than relying on either the ACCC or an individual to do so.

          <p>
           The government’s position is that Senator Xenophon’s proposed amendment is unnecessary and would not add anything to the provision. What the original, government amendment seeks to do is clarify that an individual party to a contract, rather than a regulator only, has standing to apply to a court for the declaration that a contract term is unfair. At the Commonwealth level, this standing is already granted by the federal courts act 1996. However, this amendment is necessary to ensure that individuals can access state courts and tribunals under the applied Australian consumer law.

            These amendments—and I am grateful for the advice of Associate Professor Frank Zumbo in relation to these amendments—are designed to include a provision in this bill for safe harbours, thereby providing greater business certainty. Under these safe harbours, businesses and business associations can choose to approach the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
             ACCC
            </a>
            to seek approval or authorisation of particular contracts or contract terms. The ACCC would review the contract or contract term against the legislative set of criteria for the granting of the safe harbour, and these approvals or authorisations would be an exemption to the unfair contract terms provisions of the legislation. The legislative criteria to be applied by the ACCC in granting an authorisation would include the following requirements: that the contract term or terms reflect a reasonable balance between the rights and obligations of the parties to the contract; further, where the contract term or terms relate to the imposition of a fee or charge for the provision of a service, that the fee or charge is reasonably proportional to the justifiable cost or costs of providing the service; and that the contract term or terms are reasonably necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the larger party. Under this mechanism, the ACCC can authorise model contracts or model contract terms and, as a result, facilitate the development of fairer contracts or contract terms which can apply to whole industries in contract groups.

            I am grateful to Senator Bushby for his comments in his contribution to this. I think it is fair to say that Senator Bushby found the concept interesting and was attracted to the concept in terms of it being a way forward. I know that is not the coalition’s position at this stage, but I would urge honourable senators to consider this as a sensible way forward. It would actually work. If the government are not going to support it now, which I suspect they will not, will the government at least consider this, have this on the agenda, as a way forward in terms of a practical implementation of consumer laws?

             The government is not able to support Senator Xenophon’s amendments. The safe harbour regime as proposed has been looked at by other bodies, including the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
              Productivity Commission
             </a>
             . The advice I have been given is that that proposal has been rejected on the grounds that it would actually add to the complexity, with limited benefit to be derived. The safe harbour regime as proposed would impose a higher resource burden on the regulator and would place the regulator in a position of determining unfairness, which is not appropriate because that is the job of the courts. The safe harbour decisions would be open to legal challenge but not add a useful protection to any business, and the regulator would find it very difficult to offer a comprehensive view on a single type of standard form contract in the many different circumstances in which such propositions tend to be used.

              Very briefly, the coalition concurs with those remarks. It has stated that it sees that the safe harbour provisions, although there is some merit in the proposal, would lead to increased compliance costs associated with having the

               and the other concerns so there can be an ongoing discussion when consumer legislation is brought up again. I am disappointed that Senator Joyce last night was full of sympathy for my amendments but has no sympathy this morning! I will see if there is any sympathy from the coalition for my remaining two amendments.

              <p class="italic">

                Insurance Contracts Act 1984
               </i>
               , this Part applies to contracts of insurance.
              </p>
              <p>
               Under section 15 of the Insurance Contracts Act, insurance contracts are excluded from the operation of any act, Commonwealth, state or territory based, that provides relief in the form of a judicial review of harsh or unfair contracts. This amendment is designed to delete this exemption. To allow insurance contracts to remain exempt from this bill would undermine its intent, which is to provide safeguards for consumers against unfair contract terms.
              </p>
              <p>
               Insurance contracts can be incredibly confusing, lengthy and jargon filled and in most cases are not clearly understood by consumers. Indeed, it would be unfair to allow this exemption to remain to protect insurance contracts from being subject to unfair contract terms legislation. I commend these amendments. I do not see why the insurance industry should be exempt from legislation that is aimed at targeting unfair contract terms when one of the biggest sources of difficulties for consumers is the way that insurance contracts are drafted and interpreted, and consumers have to fight for their rights with a very unlevel playing field.

                The government does not support this amendment. As drafted, the national unfair contract term law does not apply to the insurance contracts. This is because section 15 of the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 provides that contracts for insurance cannot be made the subject of relief under any other Commonwealth, state or territory legislation. It is my understanding that Minister Bowen, the Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporate Law, will be issuing an options paper on the application of unfair contract terms shortly as related to insurance contracts.

                 Ninety-eight per cent of claims are paid in insurance; only 0.065 of one per cent end up going to the ombudsman. That seems to indicate that the system is working appropriately. If there was greater recognition that there were more problems in the insurance industry then we would be more inclined to support this amendment, but at this stage the coalition will not be supporting it.

                  Without unnecessarily delaying the debate, I welcome the government’s commitment to look at this. In relation to Senator Joyce’s comments, if the figure is 98 per cent, I think you will find that for certain categories of insurance contracts, particularly for personal injury policies or disability insurance, the proportion is much higher. I accept that, if it is a case of a motor vehicle accident or a property damage claim, those sorts of things are generally resolved very quickly, but where there are issues of interpretation to deal with personal accident policies I think you will find the proportion is much higher.

                  These amendments are designed to ensure recovery of damages for non-party consumers and provide that the court may order damages as it sees fit, including an award of damages. I think it is anomalous that it is unduly restricted in the current legislation framework. This is intended to deal with that anomaly.

                   The government will not be supporting the amendments. The bill as drafted allows a court to make a wide range of orders which it deems appropriate for the non-party consumers, but not an award of damages. The court cannot establish the amount of loss to parties which are not party to proceedings simply because evidence about their individual circumstances is not before that court. The provisions do not prevent an individual from seeking damages in their own individual court proceedings.

                    I am very sympathetic to Senator Xenophon that he has not had much support here today, but I would remind him that maybe in the future he might get a little bit more sympathy than he has got in the past. However, on this occasion, Senator Xenophon, I have to say that, although we are very sympathetic about your statements, we do not see that the broad powers that the court has to redress applicants will be assisted or deterred by the amendments. Therefore, in this instance I am very sorry to say that, although extremely sympathetic, we will not be supporting them.

                       I appreciate the government’s position and the opposition’s position. I think these are matters that will need to be revisited. I infer by Senator Carr’s comments earlier that Minister Bowen is looking at some of these matters in terms of insurance contracts. I still think this has been a lost opportunity. We could have gone further; we could have put in some further sensible reforms for the benefit of consumers. My concern is that this legislation will not give the degree of protection to consumers that it was intended to give in the first place.
