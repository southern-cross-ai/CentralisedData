        My question is to the minister representing the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Senator McLucas. Can the minister advise the Senate how the Australian government's budget is supporting older Australians to live better in a stronger, smarter and fairer Australia?

         I thank Senator Polley for her question. Our Labor government is continuing its strong record of supporting older Australians with a number of initiatives in this year's budget. This includes $112.4 million for a pilot program to support pensioners who are over age-pension age who want to downsize their home without it immediately affecting their pension. From 1 July 2014, eligible pensioners will be able to downsize their home and invest a minimum of 80 per cent of the excess proceeds, to a maximum of $200,000, in a special account. The funds invested in the special account and any returns would not be counted under the pension means test for 10 years or until a withdrawal is made. It is expected that around 30,000 pensioners could benefit from the exemption through the trial period between 2014 and 2017. This initiative will support older Australians to find the right housing option for them. It will ensure that there are not unnecessary pressures on the housing market and it will be fairer for older Australians, giving them greater choice and control over their retirement.
        </p>

         Initiatives like this build on our government's record of improving the lives of Australians. We have delivered the biggest ever dollar increase to the pension, worth more than $5,000 a year to a single maximum rate pensioner. We also introduced the seniors Work Bonus, worth up to $6,500 a year, to make sure age pensioners can keep more of their income while they are working. We have delivered another pension increase as part of the household assistance package, worth $350 a year for single pensioners and more than $530 a year for pensioner couples. After almost 12 long years of neglect under those opposite, pensioners know they can trust Laborâ€”

           Our Labor government is making it easier for older Australians to stay connected to family and friends and to access information by providing a further $9.9 million to upgrade the popular Broadband for Seniors kiosks across the country. More than 250,000 older Australians have already benefited from the Broadband for Seniors program and access more than 2,000 internet kiosks for seniors around the country. The Keeping Seniors Connected program will provide every Broadband for Seniors kiosk in the country, if they apply, with a new computer and touchscreen monitor. This initiative will also provide $2,000 in grant money to seniors kiosks to boost training and information sessions for older Australians, particularly on the importance of cybersecurity and personal security.

             The Gillard Labor government continues to support older Australians in the workforce. We are building a stronger, smarter and fairer future for all Australians, including older Australians. As part of the historic pension reforms in 2009, the Gillard government introduced a seniors Work Bonus scheme to ensure older Australians kept more of their income when they worked. The reform means that a single age pensioner with no other income can currently earn up to $10,452 a year from employment while still receiving the maximum rate of pension. Over the past 12 months around 147,000 age pensioners have been able to work while keeping more of their pension under the seniors Work Bonus. Since September 2009, the maximum rate of pension has increased by $207 a fortnight for singles and $236 a fortnight for couples combined. We are focused on delivering jobs and growth in our economy.
