            <p>
             First, Senator Pocock, you're right about the effect of drought on the Murrumbidgee. I was the water minister during the millennium drought—
            </p>
            <p>
             That was my fault? I assume that was a joke, Senator Ruston. That was a very stressful period for Canberrans, given the risk to the water supply for the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
              ACT
             </a>
             at the time. That—and the risk to Adelaide—was one of the reasons why critical human needs were given priority in the legislation and in the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. Obviously the first priority does have to be critical human needs.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think the question went to the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowy_Hydro" rel="nofollow">
              Snowy Hydro
             </a>
             , the effect of that project and how that project will be managed. We remain committed to delivering the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in a way that achieves the best possible social and economic outcomes for basin industries. It is the case that the growing impact of climate change will exacerbate the challenge of sustainably managing water resources. We recognise the interconnection of water use between energy, agriculture and the environment.
            </p>
            <p>
             The advice I have is that the government is willing to consider all options for improving the ACT's water resource availability, including the operations of the Snowy scheme. We are committed to ensuring that the operations of the Snowy scheme address both the energy and water priorities, including for the ACT. I also understand that recently the minister I'm representing, Minister Plibersek, announced the new agreement between the ACT,

               <p>
                That's a level of detail I might ask Minister Plibersek to provide you with further information about. Obviously water management is a very complex area of regulation, as you may know, with both federal and state, territory or local, as well as operator specific plans of operating in terms of the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowy_Hydro" rel="nofollow">
                 Snowy Hydro
                </a>
                . As a matter of principle, the Water Act recognises the primacy of critical human needs. As I explained, part of the historical context of that was the water scarcity experienced particularly by Adelaide and Canberra. Operating the Snowy in a way that recognises energy and water priorities is something that—

                 and other alpine rivers were agreed to more than 20 years ago and have not been reviewed since. These sit outside the basin reforms. Will the government commit to act to achieve better water management and adequate flows into the Upper Murrumbidgee?

                  Water rules have always been one of the reform challenges in water policies because, as you correctly identified, we have different jurisdictions with different arrangements for water. There's some capacity by the federal government through the Murray-Darling Basin Plan to implement those water rules, but historically water was managed, including in a legislative and regulatory sense, by jurisdictions. Part of the reform process that was undertaken post Mr Turnbull's, my and Mr Burke's roles as water ministers was to try to improve water rules. For example—and I know the National Party don't agree with this—we couldn't have water trading between parts of the river without changing water rules, and obviously with different patterns we needed to. In relation to the Murrumbidgee, I am not aware where that process is up to, but I'll seek advice.
