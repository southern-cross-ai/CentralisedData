       </p>
       <p>
        I will speak about the amendments briefly.
       </p>
       <p>
        These amendments will further strengthen the corporate and tax whistleblowing protections provided in the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enhancing Whistleblower Protections) Bill 2017. The amendments will address most of the recommendations of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee report into the bill. The cohort of staff who are eligible to receive a whistleblower disclosure will be narrowed to senior managers to reduce the compliance burden on companies.
       </p>
       <p>
        The emergency disclosure provision, which allows for disclosures to a journalist or a member of parliament, will be revised to align more closely with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Interest_Disclosure_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Public Interest Disclosure Act
        </a>
        2013. The definition of 'journalist' will be amended to extend protections to disclosures made to journalists employed by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Broadcasting Corporation
        </a>
        or the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Broadcasting_Service" rel="nofollow">
         Special Broadcasting Service
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        To ensure the regime operates as intended, disclosures solely about personal employment matters will be excluded from protection under the corporate regime. The amendments will further improve access to compensation for whistleblowers who suffer victimisation. For example, the amendments require a court to consider the period a person is likely to be without employment in circumstances where the detrimental conduct involved termination of employment.
       </p>
       <p>
        A statutory review of the new regime will be required five years after the commencement date of the bill. For the bill to effectively operate, the commencement date of the bill will be revised to the first day of the second quarter following royal assent. This will provide a lead-in period for businesses to adjust to the new laws.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lastly, the amendments will give effect to the increased financial penalties in the Treasury Laws Amendment (Strengthening Corporate and Financial Sector Penalties) Bill 2018 as it relates to offences under the corporate and tax whistleblower regime. The bill and the government amendments to the bill will not affect any existing rights and protections in respect of a constituent raising an issue with a member of parliament that may attract protection under parliamentary privilege. I commend these amendments to the Senate.

         Labor is pleased to support these amendments to the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enhancing Whistleblower Protections) Bill 2017. We consider that the government's original bill was very weak and failed to provide corporate whistleblowers with protections they actually need and deserve. Labor is pleased that the government finally agreed to strengthening this bill, which I know was the product of almost a year of pressure from Centre Alliance and, also, experts such as Professor
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJ" rel="nofollow">
          AJ
         </a>
         Brown, who joins us again today. I'm sure he's hoping the bill might actually pass through the Senate, because it's been a long couple of days getting through matters here in the Senate.
        </p>
        <p>
         I also want to acknowledge the importance of the committee that was formed through the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services. I particularly want to commend Labor's team on that committee—Ms Butler, Mr Keogh, Senator Ketter and myself—who, with great guidance in many ways from Professor Brown, was able to advance a road map. We'd have to say that the road map hasn't been completely followed by the government. This bill is contextually a significant step forward, but, nonetheless, it doesn't address all of the issues that were well aired in that inquiry.
        </p>
        <p>
         Clearly, the amendments do some significant work, including changing the definition of 'journalist' for emergency and public interest disclosure categories to cover journalists working for the ABC online. We do support that amendment but we remain concerned that the proposed definition may not extend to journalists working for other entities such as
         <i>
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian" rel="nofollow">
           The Guardian
          </a>
         </i>
         or
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conversation" rel="nofollow">
          The Conversation
         </a>
         . We have raised this issue with the government, but, at this point in time, it would seem that they are not going to address that concern.
        </p>
        <p>
         Importantly, the amendments will allow whistleblowers to make a claim for compensation when a body corporate breaches a duty it owes to the whistleblower to prevent a third party engaging in detrimental conduct towards them. This does represent a significant change in our conversations with whistleblowers. We hear time and time again how companies have let whistleblowers down and failed to protect them from reprisals, from victimisation and from colleagues within the same company with whom they've worked on many occasions. This duty will make it clear that companies must protect whistleblowers.
        </p>
        <p>
         The amendments also provide that a court making a compensation order must consider the period a person is likely to be without employment in circumstances where the detrimental conduct involved termination of employment. We have heard through the media and, certainly, in the course of the inquiry into the bill and the inquiry that preceded it of whistleblowers and from whistleblowers who are unable to find work for years after they blow the whistle on misconduct. This small amendment will go some way to ensuring that compensation that they receive adequately takes into account the detriment they have suffered and are likely to suffer in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
         We know, sadly, that this is a government that was very quick to put in place a strong regime for union whistleblowers but was incredibly slow to create the protections necessary for corporate whistleblowers. It's disappointing, but, sadly, not surprising anymore, that the government had to be dragged kicking and screaming to strengthen this bill. Time and time again we've seen them running a protection racket for big business. They resisted the banking royal commission for 600 days. They voted against the banking royal commission on 26 occasions. And just last week, in the House, the government voted against tougher penalties for corporate misconduct. While we acknowledge this is a step forward, this government has form. Last week they continued to show that they are the friends of the top end of town, and they continue to disappoint the Australian people. The protection racket that they're running has got to stop.
        </p>
        <p>
         But I want to close, if I can, positively by acknowledging a few amendments that Labor are particularly supportive of. We are very pleased to see the public interest disclosure included in these amendments. The government's previous single emergency disclosure would not have provided whistleblowers with adequate protection when going to the media. We also support the expanded definition of 'detriment', about which Senator Patrick made some considerable comment in his contribution in the second reading stage. Labor recognise that whistleblowers are suffering in a multitude of ways. These amendments do not—I clearly state: they do not—make the bill as strong as Labor would have liked, but we are very pleased to see that the bill has been improved.

            I'll speak to the amendment briefly. As I said yesterday in my speech in the second reading stage, we would like to see a rewards scheme put in place for whistleblowers. We'd like to see that as part of this legislation. Unfortunately, it's not going to be possible to have that drafted and put in in its entirety, so we would like to at least see a review as part of this legislation to make sure we do get any future government focused on a reward scheme. I'll just very quickly read some of the key recommendations from the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PJC" rel="nofollow">
             PJC
            </a>
            report on this:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            … following the imposition of a penalty against a wrongdoer by a Court (or other body that may impose such a penalty), a whistleblower protection body … or prescribed law enforcement agencies may give a 'reward' to any relevant whistleblower.
           </p>
           <p>
            …   …   …
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            … such a reward should be determined within such body's absolute discretion within a legislated range of percentages of the penalty imposed by the Court (or other body imposing the penalty) against the whistleblower's employer (or principal) in relation to the matters raised by the whistleblower or uncovered as a result of an investigation instigated from the whistleblowing and where the specific percentage allocated will be determined by the body taking into account stated relevant factors, such as:
           </p>
           <ul>
           </ul>
           <ul>
           </ul>
           <ul>
           </ul>
           <ul>
           </ul>
           <ul>
           </ul>
           <ul>
           </ul>
           <ul>
           </ul>
           <p>
            So the committee agreed on putting a reward in the report as a major recommendation. I felt it was one of the key recommendations of the committee. It's disappointing, as I said yesterday, that a number of those recommendations haven't been dealt with in this legislation.
           </p>
           <p>
            I understand, Minister, in your speech on the second reading today, you said that you are in the process of providing a response to those recommendations, so I look forward to that. But we would feel more comfortable with at least putting a clause into this legislation that this will be dealt with. We've had discussions with the government—with Treasury officials—on this issue in recent days. We wanted to have this within 12 months, but we're happy to put this in at 24 months, so two years down the track. I think that will, shall we say, sharpen the focus on actually getting this key recommendation implemented. We have an opportunity to at least put that in today, and I ask the Senate to consider the Greens amendment.

             Labor will not be supporting this amendment. I do want to acknowledge the importance of the report that the senator has been reading from, and I note it has the date of September 2017. The government should have well and truly responded to this very significant issue for the Australian people, but they haven't done so. In the absence of the government's response to that, I think that changes things somewhat, Senator Whish-Wilson. It's unlikely, in our view, that enough case law will develop in the next 12 months in order to conduct the kind of review you were foreshadowing in your comments. We also understand that the amendment as proposed, despite your expressed intention, is not supported by either the government or Centre Alliance.

             inquiry into whistleblowing considered how the introduction of a rewards system may assist whistleblowers and how it might work. I well remember those proposals and the briefing that we received on this issue from Professor Brown and many expert witnesses, and we considered the factors that a body administering a rewards scheme should consider when allocating a reward. Great work has already been done. Once again, it's a shame that the government didn't take the opportunity to respond to this report in full. In the absence of that, we are unable to support your amendment this morning, Senator Whish-Wilson.

              Centre Alliance won't be supporting the Greens amendment, for similar reasons to those espoused by Senator O'Neill. But I can assure Senator Whish-Wilson that, as soon as the bill has passed, my office will be contacting the government and we will be pestering—close to the point of stalking—the government to make sure that we continue down this pathway, this very good pathway, that we're on. I'm reminded of the saying: how do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time is the answer. So, whilst we agree with the sentiment of the Greens, we will not be supporting the amendment.

               Senator Patrick, we hope that the pestering doesn't become stalking, but let's see how we go. The government won't be supporting Senator Whish-Wilson's amendment. It would require a review to be undertaken two years after the bill receives royal assent. This in our opinion is too short a period to judge the effectiveness of the amendments. The amendments do not commence on royal assent but up to six months later, meaning the effective review period may be as little as 18 months. The amendments requiring some companies to implement whistleblower policies may have only applied for as little as 12 months. The policy requirement for public companies, large proprietary companies and registrable superannuation entities to have a whistleblower policy may not even apply when the review needs to start.
              </p>
              <p>
               The government has already tabled amendments, which passed, to introduce the review of the new whistleblower laws to be undertaken five years after the commencement of the bill. This implements the recommendation of the Senate Economics Committee report. A five-year period was chosen to allow time for proper consideration of the effectiveness of the new regime. The time frame suggested in the Greens amendment would not allow for this. The
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PJC" rel="nofollow">
                PJC
               </a>
               inquiry recommended a rewards system. The government is considering those recommendations and will respond in due course. It is duplicative, even unnecessary, to require another review that must consider the introduction of a rewards system in addition to the existing consideration that the government is giving to the PJC recommendations.

                I'd just like to get on record in terms of the minister's response that there is perhaps a little bit of confusion here. The five-year review that's been put into this legislation refers to what we're passing today, which I think all senators have acknowledged only partially reflects the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PJC" rel="nofollow">
                 PJC
                </a>
                report and the good work that was done by this chamber and the other place. Our review very specifically refers to a rewards scheme. We would have liked to have seen that included in the detail today, along with many of the other the recommendations in that review. We've actually had plenty of time to do this, let's be honest. Senator Patrick, I understand that you personally agree with a rewards scheme and the concept of it, and I'm sure you do too, Senator O'Neill. So let's not gild the lily here. This is an opportunity to make sure that, for any future government—maybe your government, Senator O'Neill, rather than the minister's government, but whichever government it is in a year or two's time—there is a specific date set aside that will at least compel a review into a rewards scheme. Hopefully there are other avenues by which we can do that, but we felt like this was at least a half-measure that would be effective in this legislation today.
