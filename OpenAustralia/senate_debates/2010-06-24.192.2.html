        and Water, Senator Wong. Can the government explain why it has abandoned its election promise to give $124 million to fund the Wimmera-Mallee pipeline by failing to provide the last $25 million in cash that it promised? Does the Labor government seriously expect the voters in the Wimmera-Mallee region to ever trust Labor again after they have been slapped with higher council rates to make up for the shortfall of money that the Labor government has stingily failed to hand over?

         Thank you to the senator for the question. My recollection is that we made a commitment to matching funding and we delivered that. We made a $99 million commitment to fast-track the Wimmera-Mallee pipeline—I think we have provided $98 million. Obviously, the project is essentially complete.

           As I said, we made a commitment to matching funding; that is my recollection.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_I" rel="nofollow">
            If I
           </a>
           am incorrect on that, I shall provide more information. My recollection is that we have in fact provided that matching funding and, hence, the commitment to $99 million, of which, as I said, $98 million has been paid. In relation to the election commitment, my recollection—this is some time ago, I have to admit—is that the government indicated that it would consider additional funding if required to complete the project on the basis of matching funding by the Victorian government. So, consistent with the election commitment, we have made that indication.
          </p>
          <p>
           I am also advised, looking at the advice here, that additional funding was not required as pipeline construction was completed well under budget and more than sufficient funds remain for channel-decommissioning works. I am happy to listen to what you have to say on this issue. Certainly it is the same as the federal member for Mallee’s assertion, although obviously it is a different party but the same position being articulated. I think it is important to get on the record what has actually occurred. We made an election commitment to fund the pipeline; we have done so.

            , I ask a supplementary question. Given that there is a shortfall of $25 million and that the council rates have gone up to make up for the shortfall, can the government explain why it still has enough money to splash out on 60 extra staff for the Prime Minister’s office but does not have enough extra money to give to the Wimmera-Mallee people for the pipeline?

             I think I have outlined for you the position that we have articulated. We made a commitment and we delivered on that commitment. I have also indicated to you that my recollection is that we as the government indicated that we were prepared to consider additional funding if required to complete the project on the basis of matching funding by the Victorian government. I do not know if there has been any further offer in relation to this issue by the Victorian government since that indication was given. I will certainly check on that. We have provided, of the $99 million, I think some $98 million, which has been paid. My recollection is that the project has been completed and opened. I think Senator Collins attended for the Prime Minister and me because I was not able to attend the opening—and I thank her for that.
