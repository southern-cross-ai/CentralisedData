        I rise this evening to speak about the partnership between manufacturing business Definium Technologies and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Tasmania" rel="nofollow">
         University of Tasmania
        </a>
        's Sense-T project. Last Friday, I had the pleasure of attending the launch of the new advanced sensor manufacturing facility in Launceston, which has come about as a result of a strategic partnership between Definium Technologies and the University of Tasmania. This partnership is a stellar example of the type of advanced manufacturing that will define the future capabilities that can be achieved in Tasmania. I have spoken in this place before about the success of Definium Technologies, but it is this new partnership which proves that the sky is the limit for technology and manufacturing in Tasmania.
       </p>
       <p>
        National and local manufacturing has taken a bit of a battering over the last few years, but things in Tasmania are starting to look brighter thanks to the mastermind behind Definium Technologies, Mike Cruse. Definium Technologies is a Launceston based company that produces
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        motherboards, which can be programmed to be used in any computing or technological product. This local company started in the back of Mr Cruse's garage and is going from strength to strength and putting Tasmania on the world stage. It truly is an exciting time. The digital revolution in Australia is certainly here and the opportunities it presents are endless.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is a load of exciting things coming up for Launceston around IT and this company typifies the success that can be achieved. At the moment, Definium Technologies is working on motherboards that will be used for temperature control in taxis in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas" rel="nofollow">

        and in audio therapeutic systems in Texas. So as you can see, they are really putting Tasmania and, more broadly, Australia on the map. But it is the partnership between Definium Technologies and the University of Tasmania's Sense-T program that I am really looking forward to. This partnership has paved the way for the new advanced manufacturing facility in Launceston which was launched last Friday. This facility will support the production of digital sensors, which would have previously been sourced from global high-tech giants such as Japan and China.
       </p>
       <p>
        This new facility was born out of both opportunity and demand created by the growing Sense-T research program, a collaboration between the Australian government—started initially by the former Labor government—
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
         CSIRO
        </a>
        , the University of Tasmania, and with bipartisan support from both governments. Even the state government is involved. This collaboration is the finest: funding provided by the Sense-T program, equipment provided by the University of Tasmania and the wealth of knowledge provided by Definium Technologies. This really is smart, forward-thinking manufacturing and innovation. This partnership is a testament to what can be achieved and is going to open up new opportunities for students studying in Tasmania. We have a small university compared to other campuses. I believe that the relationship between business and the university is a doorway to a stronger economy and a brighter future for everyone.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to acknowledge Mike Cruse for his creativity, for the birth of Definium Technologies and for proving that the glass is always half full rather than looking at any negatives. Mr Cruse typifies vision, creativity, hard work and entrepreneurship. What started as a one-man operation now has three full-time employees and two casuals, and there are plans to expand and employ more in the future. Mr Cruse is and will be a great mentor to others coming through with creative ideas, regardless of their age.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to pay tribute to Professor Brigid Heywood, a Deputy Vice-Chancellor at the University of Tasmania. She is a driving force at the university. It is so great to have the opportunity to work alongside her and to see the innovation that she brings to our state. And lastly, I pay tribute to the director of Sense-T, Dr Stephen Cahoon. His wealth of knowledge and experience in this field is going be so beneficial in moving forward. This really is about the digital revolution. This is showing what can be done from Tasmania and that where you are located is no barrier to success. I commend all of those in this partnership.
