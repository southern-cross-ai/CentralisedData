        I rise to take note of document No. 2, the Auditor-General's Report No. 45 of 2021–22, and I move:

       <p class="italic">
        That the Senate take note of the document.

        I welcome this report, an

         Australian National Audit Office

        performance audit on the effectiveness of the management of contractors within the

        . DVA has relied heavily on a non-

        workforce in recent years to manage the growth in demand for its services. Its use of labour-hire contractors has reduced from 38 per cent on 30 June 2021 to 30 per cent on 30 June 2022. I note the audit found that DVA has established largely fit-for-purpose policies and processes for the management of contractors.
       </p>
       <p>
        I understand the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANAO" rel="nofollow">
         ANAO
        </a>
        has made three recommendations relating to how DVA is implementing the Protective Security Policy Framework. Recommendation 1 suggests the policies and practices be updated to better reflect requirements of policy 12 of the PSPF—eligibility and suitability of personnel. DVA has committed to updates that ensure all personnel agree to comply with Australian government policies and protocols and that all future requests for citizenship waiver are delegated to DVA's chief security officer. Recommendation 2 regards governance updates relating to policy 13 of the PSPF—ongoing assessment of personnel. DVA has committed to updating policies and procedures to ensure better compliance with annual security checks for clearance-holders, and is putting in place processes for better compliance with eligibility waivers for security clearances. Recommendation 3 relates to policy 14 of the PSPF—separating personnel. DVA has already updated cessation procedures to ensure departing staff and contractors acknowledge enduring confidentiality requirements, and policy is being updated to ensure adverse security information related to employees and contractors is provided to new Commonwealth employers. DVA will update these policies by the end of September 2022 and report this to its audit and risk committee.
       </p>
       <p>
        I understand the report also identified that DVA has implemented an effective quality assurance program relating to security. I'm advised that this is being implemented and monitored, and will incorporate the recommendations of the audit. The annual PSPF maturity assessment is also underway, and we will be reviewing this before it is submitted. I'm pleased that the security of veterans' and families' information has not been exposed to any additional risk through the policy noncompliance identified by the ANAO. We're satisfied that DVA continues to manage the contractor workforce safely and in accordance with Commonwealth requirements, and that veterans and families are well supported. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
       </p>

        Leave granted; debate adjourned.
