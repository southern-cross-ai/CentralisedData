         I thank Senator Pratt for the question. She is one of the senators in this place who does not need to be convinced of the importance of acting on climate change, unlike those opposite. What we have seen from those opposite is nothing other than a continued strategy of delay.

           , it is not surprising that they get a bit loud on this issue, because the fact is that they know what their record was. They know they went to the last election promising action on climate change—they promised to introduce an emissions trading scheme—and now, they are so divided, the best they can do on these issues of national importance is delay. All they can do is delay. They do not even want to vote. It is extraordinary! What we have seen today in the Senate is the opposition—

                As I was saying, what we have seen today, for example, is legislation on the renewable energy target and the opposition voting to delay a vote on that until after the winter session. This is legislation that previously your shadow minister said you would support, but you want to delay it. Why do you want to delay it? I will tell you why you want to delay it. You want to delay it because previously you were supporting it but now of course we hear Senator Boswell others coming out and opposing it. So what is

                  What is the Leader of the Opposition’s position on this? What is his approach? More delay; more do nothing. He will not stand up to those in his own party room who do not want investment in solar, wave, wind, geothermal and the clean technologies of the future. You just want to delay again.

                   , I ask a supplementary question. Picking up on Senator Wong’s answer, I know that one of the key platforms that needs addressing is that of renewable energy. I know that the renewable emery sector has been planning on the basis of having a renewable energy target in place. Given the decision by the opposition to refer the renewable energy legislation to a Senate committee until 12 August, there appear to be, I think, negative effects on the renewable energy sector in terms of planning for the introduction of the renewable energy target this year. This industry needs certainty. This is why the renewable energy sector has been advocating for legislation to be passed as a matter of urgency. Are there any barriers preventing the opposition from voting on this legislation this month?

                    Yes, the barrier to passing the legislation is the division in the opposition party room. I would just remind them of what Mr Hunt said. I know that he is not the favourite of a number of senators, including Senator Minchin, but just last week he was telling journalists on the renewable energy legislation, ‘We like this legislation.’ He said, ‘We like this legislation.’ But what a fair weather friend Mr Hunt turned out to be. As soon as there is a whiff of dissent or controversy in the party room, they do not care about what is in the national interest, they do not care about the importance of investing in the new jobs in solar, in wave, in wind or in geothermal; all they care about is the division in their own party room. And what they are doing now is nothing. Delay and do nothing is their only answer.

                       . What I was saying is that climate change is already having a big impact in WA. I am being told that by Western Australians. Given this strong concern, can the minister outline to the chamber how the federal government has responded to the concerns of Australians and indeed Western Australians in the past? Has the action taken in the past by this parliament been adequate or indeed in line with community concerns? Has this parliament’s response been adequate?

                           Self-evidently, what we had for the vast majority of the years those opposite were in government is a failure to act on climate change because they did not believe it was real. I would just like to remind them that yesterday we went through the policy they went to the election with, the policy that they were elected with, which was to support emissions trading. But I would remind them that they might want to have a look at the booklet called

                           and it goes on to say, ‘Australia’s environment is particularly vulnerable to global climate change.’ It goes on to talk about the risk to the reef and to agriculture and says that Australia’s economy needs to prepare for a carbon constrained future. The question is why are they turning their back on what was even John Howard’s policy. And it is very simple: they went to the election—
