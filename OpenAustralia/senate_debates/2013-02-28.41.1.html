          This motion relates to the debate we have seen in this chamber about hospital funding. There has been a lot of hand-wringing and finger-pointing over this issue. We have heard the government claim that it has increased funding to the public hospital system and that is true. The pertinent point here, however, is that they have increased funding by less than what was promised.

          can give an analogy, if you negotiate a three per cent pay increase with an employer and at the end of the year you receive a one per cent pay increase, that is effectively a cut. This is a $1.5 billion cut over four years, and it comes on the back of a chronic underinvestment by state governments in the hospital system. The government's announcement to return money to Victoria is not good enough. It needs to do that to all states, particularly Queensland and

          , who have been hardest hit, and it needs to honour its own agreement and ensure that funding is done through the National Health Funding Pool.

            This is nothing more than a stunt by the Greens.

             The Greens
            </a>
            were Labor's minority government partner when these cuts were announced in MYEFO, when the Treasurer made the detailed determinations in November 2012 and when the retrospective cuts were made in December 2012. As the government's partner, they facilitated these cuts and failed to stand up for public hospitals in this country. Now they are crying crocodile tears. Despite the faux break-up, the Greens continue to provide confidence and support for this chaotic government, irrespective of the damage being done to the Australian community. As such, the Greens are culpable for these hospital cuts as a partner in the minority Gillard government. We do not support the Greens' duplicity on these cuts and these belated stunts to cover their tracks. It is just another attempt by the Greens to hide their dirty hands on this and many other issues.
