         This is a serious issue. We do take it seriously. I have just been asked a question which is asking me to estimate the meterage in 50,000 homes. Unsurprisingly, we do not have that estimate. What we have is a commitment from the minister and the government that, in all of those homes, the government will fund the removal of the foil insulation or the installation of safety switches. We are doing so because safety is of the highest priority, because we have received advice and because we are working assiduously to rectify the issues associated with this program.
        </p>
        <p>
         I appreciate that the opposition wants to make a range of points about this issue. Minister Combet has given an extensive statement to the House, outlining quite clearly the problems associated with the home insulation scheme and outlining the measures the government has taken and will take to remedy those. This is a very substantial program and, therefore, these sorts of rectification measures will take some time to roll out, but the government remains committed to doing so. The commitment in relation to foil is clear: the installation of safety switches or the removal of foil, and the government will fund same.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I suppose, given the nature of the program, I should not be surprised at the lack of an answer. Will the government ensure this foil is recycled, or will it simply go to landfill?

           As I have previously indicated, the minister has stated that he is working on the development of the inspection program as a matter of the highest priority, and that is in relation to the 150,000 of non-foil installation. He has also outlined some issues associated with the removal of foil insulation, and those issues are outlined in his ministerial statements. So, as soon as I have further information on the detail of the program for removal of the foil insulation and/or the installation of safety switches, I will obviously ensure this is provided to the Senate.

            , I ask a further supplementary question. Given that the average size of a home is 200 square metres, isnâ€™t it true that there could be up to 10 million square metres of foil insulation destined for landfill as a result of this debacle? Does the minister know, or will her department release, the carbon footprint of 10 million square metres of foil insulation? And, given that, how can this program even remotely be considered an environmental success?

             would attempt to use an issue such as carbon footprint to try and get some political mileage in this Senate. This is a serious issue. This government is taking it seriously. We are putting in place resources to rectify what is a significant problemâ€”

               As I said, it is unfortunate that the senator, who is part of why this chamber has voted against action on climate change so consistently, should seek to use an issue of carbon footprint, because, let us remember, if you want to talk about carbon footprint, it is the coalition or particularly those who currently run the coalition, who are people who do not believe that climate change is real, who are increasing Australiaâ€™s carbon footprint. In relation to foil, I have made it clear, as has Minister Combet through the ministerial statements which have been tabled in this parliament, what the governmentâ€™s intention is.
