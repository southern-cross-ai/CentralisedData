       <p>
        [by video link] I would like to speak briefly about our outgoing President, Senator Ryan. Senator Ryan is well known for his deep political convictions, and initially there was a question of how these might affect his conduct as President. Any misgivings proved to be totally unfounded. As President, he has been fair, reasonable, sensible and impartial. In being so, he set the standard for us all. He rose to the stature of his new office and put the dignity and responsibility of the office ahead of himself. We all know how easy it is to play the maverick, to grandstand and to win attention and praise from social media. But we also know how empty and meaningless that is, how it strokes the ego without doing anything to help the Australians we are here to serve. It is much harder to put that aside and do the work of parliament, but Senator Ryan did just that. In doing so, he set a standard to which we all should aspire. I thank him for his service and wish him very well in his future endeavours.
       </p>
       <p>
        Before concluding, I would like to congratulate Senator Brockman. I don't know our new President particularly well but I know he is well regarded by his colleagues and has been a presence in this place for longer than most. I'm sure that experience will serve him well and that we will all come to share his colleagues' regard for him. I wish him well and very much look forward to working together with him.
