         I can, as a matter of fact, Senator Green. Thank you for the question and your great interest in this topic. I should start by congratulating everybody in the Senate for the mature way in which the issue of the referendum legislation was dealt with last night. Congratulate yourselves on the passing of that legislation without any opposition in this place.
        </p>
        <p>
         But it is another historic day today, a significant day in the journey towards an Aboriginal and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
          Torres Strait Islander
         </a>
         Voice. We have the opportunity for Australia to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Peoples" rel="nofollow">
          First Peoples
         </a>
         of Australia in our Constitution. This will be a simple but powerful act. The proposition that is to be put to the Australian people has been built from the ground up through the work of the Uluru Statement from the Heart. This process is the culmination of years of discussion, consultation and hard work by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.
        </p>
        <p>
         As the Prime Minister said in his gracious and patient ask of Australia, I want to thank the chamber for the goodwill demonstrated last night in respect of the referendum machinery bill. This will be the first referendum in almost a quarter of a century, and a new generation of Australians will be able to have their say. The government believes that this referendum will be a unifying moment for Australia, and I'm certainly keen for that to be the case. It's about taking this country forward for everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
         We look forward to working with the Australian community to ensure that everyone can have their say in a respectful manner on this important opportunity to recognise our first Australians.

            Since we took office, we have wasted no time on this issue. Last year I asked JSCEM to investigate increasing enfranchisement and electoral participation, and I look forward to working across the parliament on meaningful reform following its report. Last year the government allocated $16.1 million over two years to the

            enrolment and participation in future electoral events as part of the referendum preparatory work. More recently, I approved regulatory changes making it easier for more Australians who are eligible to enrol to actually get on the roll. From 17 February, eligible Australians have been able to use their Medicare card and their Australian citizenship certificate numbers to enrol or update their enrolment. Early

               data from around the country shows that between 11 and 14 per cent of new enrolment applications are using those new methods of enrolment that I mentioned before. One outstanding initiative from the Gillard Labor government was the Federal Direct Enrolment Update program, which uses information from government agencies to assist with updating elector details and including eligible voters on the roll. Following trials of the new direct enrolment activities, which used new data sources, mailbag addresses and email notifications of new enrolments, the AEC advises that over 15,000

               were added to the electoral roll.
              </p>
              <p>
               Following these successful trials, the AEC advises me that these activities will be included as a permanent feature of our enrolment program. The estimated Indigenous enrolment ratesâ€”
