         , for his very strong interest in all things agriculture, but particularly Australia's kangaroo industry, which he had such a huge, huge interest in. Yes, Senator McKenzie, we are very concerned about the proposed legislation that has been lodged by a United States congressman which seeks to ban the import of kangaroo meat and products into the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
          US
         </a>
         . We believe that the commercial kangaroo industry in Australia is absolutely appropriate and highly regulated. It's highly sustainable, and our quotas are based on a science based approach. Our commercial industry has been going now for over 60 years and is considered one of the world's best wild harvest industries in totality. The management of the export of kangaroo products is based firmly on the principles of sustainability, and the industry is a huge provider of jobs, particularly jobs in rural and regional Australia. It's very often the case that those jobs are taken up by our
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
          Indigenous Australians
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Australian exports kangaroo products like meat, hides and skins to around 70 countries around the world, including places like Italy and the United States. Although the United States is not a huge direct importer of kangaroo meat, it is a huge importer of kangaroo leather products. These leather products are considered to be some of the highest-quality leather products in the world. We are aware of the potential risks that this legislation poses for the industry. Given the size of the US market and that global brands could be forced through pressure to move away from using this sustainably harvested product is of great concern to the government. That's why we have been working to gain the support of the industry, so that we can put pressure on the US.

            We know that the coronavirus has had a big impact on all of our rural and regional industries, and the kangaroo export business is no different. But they have been amazingly adaptable and resilient. Any ban by an international market will have large implications. It's not just because of our direct exports to the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
             US
            </a>
            , but because much of our kangaroo product goes via other markets and is manufactured into great leather goods, which are then imported into the US. It's estimated that the commercial kangaroo industry provides about $200 million per year to rural and regional Australian communities, and 3,000 people are employed in this industry. It is a hugely important industry, but the fact is that harvest programs are ethically designed to reduce the significant impact that overabundant kangaroo populations can have on our natural environment. As regional senators would understand, kangaroo populations regularly experience booms and busts.

               consumers can continue to buy Australia's high-quality, responsibly sourced kangaroo products. Upon hearing about the bill's introduction to the US in the House of Representatives, the government spoke to the Australian Ambassador to the US, former senator
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Sinodinos" rel="nofollow">
                Arthur Sinodinos
               </a>
               , and emphasised the importance of this trade, the value of this industry across the whole of Australia and making sure we understood this was actually a humane management of kangaroo populations. Australian diplomats have initiated contact with congressmen and plan to meet with them to outline Australia's significant concerns around this bill. There is a myth that persists that commercial kangaroo harvesting is a threat to the species. This is not true. The staff at our Washington embassy are working to advocate for our kangaroo industry's potential in sustainability and animal welfare areas and are setting the story straight.
