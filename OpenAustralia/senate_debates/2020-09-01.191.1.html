        Anita has been a volunteer at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth_Festival" rel="nofollow">
         Perth Festival
        </a>
        since 2012. In her years as a volunteer she's helped stuff envelopes, cleared space for an aerial performance and done pretty much everything in between. As she explained in an interview with ArtsHub:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It wasn't until retirement that I really had time to give more time to the things that interest me. And I can't act and I can't really sing other than in a community choir, but I love theatre and I love being involved in some way.

        Egyptian born Mohamed volunteers to help prepare meals, cares for the elderly and helps new arrivals to Australia. Last year he told
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SBS" rel="nofollow">
         SBS
        </a>
        :
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It's something that makes me feel that I have made a difference, even though it might only be a little difference and might not have a big impact. But if I have made somebody smile, it makes me satisfied that I have achieved something in my day.
       </p>
       <p>
        Anita and Mohamed are just two of the estimated 7.1 million Australians who did volunteer work through an organisation or group last year. Research done years ago estimated that the time donated by people like Anita and Mohamed contributes some $290 billion to the Australian economy. Volunteers help feed older Australians. They hand out emergency relief packages to families doing it tough. They help new migrants make connections. They clean up rubbish from our waterways and patrol our beaches to keep swimmers safe.
       </p>
       <p>
        But, like much of our Australian society, volunteering has been impacted by the pandemic. New research conducted by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANU" rel="nofollow">
         ANU
        </a>
        found that over 65 per cent of volunteers stopped volunteering between February and April this year. Researchers believe that this is the equivalent of 12 million fewer volunteer hours a week, and older volunteers in particular were more likely to stop volunteering. It's a problem for many organisations, because older Australians are more likely to offer their services and volunteer in the first place. Some volunteers are returning as conditions return to normal in some places around the country. But I've been hearing that many organisations are still finding themselves short of the people that they really need to do important work in the community. Volunteering rates were already in decline prior to the pandemic. The ABS asked about volunteering rates as part of the census, and there had been a decline between 2011 and2016. It's a shame, because Australia needs volunteers now more than ever.
       </p>
       <p>
        Research shows that volunteering helps build community cohesion. It also helps individuals' mental health. Beyond Blue's lead clinical adviser, Grant, told the ABC:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The two main benefits of volunteering that can have a big impact on maintaining good mental health are the way it keeps people socially connected, and how it provides a real sense of purpose.
       </p>
       <p>
        The federal government's Head to Health program encourages people to try volunteering as a method of self-care. That's not enough, though. The pandemic has thrown up new challenges for volunteers and the community organisations that depend on them. I am calling on the government to listen to volunteers and to make sure that they have the support that they need to continue giving to the community.
