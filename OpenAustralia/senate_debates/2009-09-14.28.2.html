        On 7 September, Senator Siewert asked me a question in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts. I have some additional further information to add to the answer provided, which I now table and seek leave to have incorporated into

       <p class="italic">
        On 7 September 2009 during question time, Senator Siewert asked me a question as Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts concerning impacts of the oil spill in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timor_Sea" rel="nofollow">
         Timor Sea
        </a>
        on wildlife.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I would like to clarify a point I made in response to Senator Siewert’s question. At that time, I indicated that the Western Australian Department of Fisheries was pursuing reports of affected wildlife off the Kimberley coast. I am advised that the WA Department of Fisheries was pursuing reports of fishing activity in oil affected waters after reports by an anonymous
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         West Australian
        </a>
        licensed fisherman of affected wildlife and water quality.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Responding to oil affected wildlife in WA state waters is the overall responsibility of the West Australian Oil Spill Response Team, which is led by the Environment and Science Coordinator with their
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Environment_and_Conservation" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Environment and Conservation
        </a>
        . WA Fisheries is a member of the WA Oil Spill Response Team.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I can also advise the Senate that the Commonwealth Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts continues to work closely with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Maritime_Safety_Authority" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Maritime Safety Authority
        </a>
        and relevant Commonwealth and state agencies to ensure that appropriate measures are in place to respond to any oil affected wildlife and the broader environment. A plan of action to help any wildlife that might be affected by the oil spill in Commonwealth waters, and to respond to possible impacts on Commonwealth reserves, has been developed by an expert in oiled wildlife response from the Queensland Department of Environment and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Management" rel="nofollow">
         Resource Management
        </a>
        . This expert coordinated the wildlife response to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moreton_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Moreton Bay
        </a>
        oil spill earlier this year. The plan also ensures that the appropriate response equipment is on site should it be needed.

        Last week this expert undertook aerial surveillance of the area, including the
