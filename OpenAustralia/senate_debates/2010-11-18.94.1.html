        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">

         I am more than happy to repeat my answer that I have given many times before on this. Let us be very clear on this. The cost-benefit analysis assertion is based on the fact that you are asserting that it is not financially viable.

             , I apologise. I should not allow myself to be distracted by the rabble over there. You are right, I apologise. The demand for a cost-benefit analysis is based on the assertion that it is going to not be financially viable. McKinsey’s, as I have repeated, are saying it is financially viable. The business case, which we will release shortly, says it is financially viable. There is not a cost-benefit analysis anywhere in the world that has come back and said that the benefits are not a positive. So, in actual fact, on the one hand we have a financially positive business case, and then we could spend a couple of million dollars of taxpayers’ money to prove that there are benefits across the entire economy. Those opposite who pretend that they are about fiscal responsibility would simply seek to waste taxpayers’ money. The

             and a range of other people that Senator Bernardi has referred to in his question, all make an argument that we should keep the copper open; that we should keep the copper that has served this country well for 50 to 70 years in some cases—let’s keep it in the ground. Let’s ignore the fact that we are now moving to the end of the copper era and moving to the fibre future. The copper in the ground at the moment in actual fact is degrading. It costs—

                    , I ask a further supplementary question. Minister, given your refusal to have a cost-benefit analysis conducted and your inability to detail the permanent savings that supposedly will be achieved by your $43 billion broadband experiment, isn’t this just another example that your ad hoc policy has been created by a listless government and demonstrates once again that you are completely out of your depth?

                     A listless government that has now passed the bill through the House of Representatives, ensured that taxpayers’ moneys are not wasted with a spurious cost-benefit analysis, and defeated those opposite just recently who tried to gag the debate on the bill, and not for the first time, for about the fourth time—if that is the bar you set for ‘listless’, I will happily live by it.
