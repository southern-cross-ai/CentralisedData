        My question is to the Minister for Human Services, Senator Payne. I refer to comments on consumer leases made by ASIC Deputy Chair, Mr Peter Kell, who said last month:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is not uncommon for consumers to pay three or four times more than the purchase price of the leased goods. In some cases it can be up to six times.
       </p>
       <p>
        Is the minister aware that consumer leasing businesses specifically target Centrelink clients and that these leases cause financial hardship for Centrelink clients, who are encouraged to make payments through Centrepay?

         In acknowledging issues that have been raised around the use of Centrepay by a number of providers, the government announced in May this year a series of changes and an expansion of services for which Centrepay could be used to include, for example, no-interest loans, low-interest loans, lay-by and a number of other things. The Assistant Treasurer, the Hon.

         , announced just last week that there will also be a review of the small amount credit contract laws that will consider in fact whether those laws should be extended to apply to regulated consumer leases. That is a suggestion that has also been made by a number of stakeholders in this area.
        </p>

         What the government has endeavoured to do in the changes it has made—and I have discussed this in the chamber and elsewhere with Senator Cameron previously—

         In estimates, Senator Fifield. The government is endeavouring to strike a balance between strengthening protections for customers and not interfering unduly with existing means of urgent access to necessity goods. One thing we have to be acutely aware of is that the broader products to which Senator Cameron refers are not as immediately widely available as we would like them to be before we can contemplate, in my view, the sorts of suggestions Senator Cameron is making. The alternatives to consumer leases for which we have expanded Centrepay are ones we hope that our customers will take up. Until they are available through on a much larger scale I do not want to close all use of Centrepay for regulated leases. We have gone out of our way to inform customers and providers who have a consumer lease about these alternatives. While fixed term consumer leases do typically involve higher costs than outright purchases, they are regulated and that provides an important level of protection.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I refer to the Assistant Treasurer who has 'absolutely agreed' that interest rates on consumer leases can be much higher than the already exorbitant rates payday lenders charge. Does the minister agree with the Assistant Treasurer's opinion that effective interest rates charged under consumer leases are beyond exorbitant?

             That is the problem, Senator Cormann, isn't it, when you can't be spontaneous? I did in fact acknowledge that earlier. I also referred in my previous answer to the Assistant Treasurer's remarks.

                     The question goes to whether the minister agrees with the Assistant Treasurer that the interest rates charged under consumer leases are beyond exorbitant. You should draw her attention to that question. She should try to answer it.

                       I would not say Senator Wong was tedious. I was saying in relation to tedium that I do not expect Senator Cameron to change the habits of a lifetime. I did say in my first answer what my views were about the products. Senator Cameron has also referred to the Assistant Treasurer's review. That is why we have incorporated those particular products into the small amount credit contract laws review.

                        , I ask a further supplementary question. Given the Assistant Treasurer's obvious concern over the true cost of consumer lease contracts, shouldn't consumer leasing businesses be excluded from Centrepay, like payday lenders?

                         Let me say for the third time, which may mean I will be accused of tedious repetition, that that is exactly why the small amount credit contract laws review has been announced by the Assistant Treasurer to include these products. It is a review that fulfils the statutory requirement under the credit act and it will also consider, as I said, whether the regulatory requirements for

                         s should be extended to regulated consumer leases. I have explained twice why I am not immediately excluding them. Senator Cameron disagrees. I have indicated that we are agreeing to disagree in the chamber previously. Senator Cameron simply does not accept that.
