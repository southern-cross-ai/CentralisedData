        The statement read as follows—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the Committee’s Ninth Report of 2007.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This report relates to a proposal by the Australian Customs Service to undertake a fit-out of new leased accommodation at Brisbane Airport.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        By way of background the Australian Customs Service currently occupies leased accommodation in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_CBD" rel="nofollow">
         Brisbane CBD
        </a>
        and at Brisbane Airport.  The lease on these properties is due to expire in mid-2009, and Customs is using the offer of a purpose built building to be constructed by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_Airport_Corporation" rel="nofollow">
         Brisbane Airport Corporation
        </a>
        within the precincts of the Brisbane Airport as an opportunity to rationalise staff at both the Brisbane CBD office and offices at the airport.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The new building will include a number of features not currently available at the existing office accommodation sites.  It will improve client services, and offer greater security and ease of access for customs offices to the airport.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        According to the evidence given by Customs officials during the course of the Committee Inquiry, the new office accommodation will enhance operational efficiency of the Australian Customs Service presence at Brisbane Airport and contribute to the greater overall effectiveness of the Customs enforcement role.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The new building also offers the scope to provide accommodation for additional staff over the period of the lease, the fit-out of which is included in the estimated project cost.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         The Committee
        </a>
        was informed during the Inquiry that extensive consultation with staff had occurred, and in general the responses from staff were favourable, although some issues relating to transport are yet to be resolved.  As part of this process, Customs had established a ‘transport working group’ to examine what measures could be taken to ensure adequate staff access to vehicle parking, for example.  Customs has also been in discussion with the Brisbane Airport Corporation in support of its negotiations with the company operating the ‘Airtrain’ service between the airport and the Brisbane CBD for an additional railway station at Brisbane Airport.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Similarly, Customs has explored the availability of child-care arrangements for staff transferred from the Brisbane CBD to the airport, and has been assured by the Brisbane Airport Corporation that facilities will be available in proximity to the new building, that will be operated on a commercial basis.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
         Mr President
        </a>
        , in overall terms, the Committee is satisfied that the proposed fit-out of the new accommodation will meet the current and future needs of the Australian Customs Service.  By rationalising existing accommodation into one single building, at an operational site, Customs would not need to renegotiate existing leases thereby avoiding the likelihood of an escalation of rental payments that in the context of the Brisbane CBD are at a premium.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The proposed works, estimated to cost $15.84 million are expected to commence in October of the current year, with a completion date scheduled for December 2008.  Customs will begin occupancy of the building from January 2009, with all staff being finally being relocated by June 2009.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In concluding Mr President, I would like to thank all those who contributed to this Inquiry, including my fellow Committee members, officials of the Australian Customs Service and for the assistance of the Committee Secretariat.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr President, I commend the Report to the Senate.
