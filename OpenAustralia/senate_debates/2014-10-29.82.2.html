         I thank Senator Ruston for her question and her interest in this issue. The government's higher education reform package will bring very significant benefits for Australian students. As we all know, no student will have to pay a cent up-front for their course and no-one will need to repay a cent until they are earning over $50,000 a year. What universities and other higher education providers will have to do is to compete for students and that will be to the benefit of students, frankly. For the first time, the Commonwealth will be supporting all Australian undergraduate students in all registered higher education institutions in their higher education diplomas, advanced diplomas and associate degrees as well as in bachelor degrees. For the first time, all of those students will be supported by the Commonwealth.
        </p>
        <p>
         The expansion of the demand-driven system in that way will benefit over 80,000 students a year by 2018. And another 80,000 students who are studying in vocational education and training will benefit through the abolition of the 20 per cent loan fee for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VET" rel="nofollow">

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HELP" rel="nofollow">
          HELP
         </a>
         . We are abolishing the 25 per cent loan fee for FEE-HELP as well which will benefit another 50,000 students. Of course, the Commonwealth scholarship scheme will provide what will be the largest scholarship support in Australia's history for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. These reforms mean that students will be able to get the education of the quality they want, a truly world-class education in the courses they want, with the support they want, at a price they are willing to pay. It is a complete mystery to me why those opposite want to deny Australian students that chance and that opportunity.

           I think it is important to put on the record what people like Belinda Robinson,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
            CEO

           , have said about the reforms.

          </p>
          <p>
           There is a certain irony there! It is simply not possible to maintain the standards that students expect or the international reputation that Australia's university system enjoys without full fee deregulation. Senator Lines might disparage Belinda Robinson, but she knows what she is talking about in relation to universities, unlike Senator Lines. As I said earlier, under the reforms an extra 80,000 students a year will be supported by the Commonwealth. In supporting all students in higher education diplomas, advanced diplomas and associate degrees for the first time, we will be supporting students in pathways into higher education and in courses that will actually provide them with skills for jobs. Those pathways will equip students to do well at university and reduce the dropout rates.

               I thank Senator Ruston again for the question in relation to the scholarships. The reforms will require higher education institutions to spend one dollar in every $5 of additional revenue on Commonwealth scholarships to help disadvantaged students. It will be the largest scholarship support for students in Australian history and it can be used for fees or to cover living costs for students. For example, the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
                University of Sydney
               </a>
               has announced that with fees at less than half what those opposite have been saying, they will offer scholarships for a third of their undergraduates. This will increase the number of students with scholarships at the University of Sydney from 700 to 9,000â€”at one university alone and those opposite will not support it. They will not allow the students to win those scholarships. They will not allow students to get the sorts of opportunities that they think should be given to a privileged few who are now not all supported by the Commonwealth. That is their position and it will fail.
