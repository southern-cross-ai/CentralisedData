            The Greens
           </a>
           won't stand in the way of yet another inquiry into violence against women, but we note that the inquiries that this chamber got up—thanks to the Greens moving it—in 2015 and 2017 have still largely remained not acted upon by this government. So, we're not confident that this inquiry would be any different. The frontline domestic violence services sector have made it perfectly clear this week that they don't want more talkfests and that they are sick of telling this government what they need in order to keep women safe, which is proper funding so that they don't have to turn people away. We hope this inquiry doesn't simply take the pressure off government to properly fund frontline services so that 40 per cent of calls don't go unanswered when women seek out legal help in particular. The government knows what needs to be done. It's just not doing it, because it doesn't give a damn. But we look forward to this inquiry once again forcing people to give evidence—to say the same thing that the government will ignore yet again.

              The opposition will be supporting this motion; however, our preference would be that it went to the Finance and
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Administration_Committee" rel="nofollow">
               Public Administration Committee
              </a>
              and not legal affairs. We believe legal affairs has a number of references and a very heavy workload. This work had previously been done by the Finance and Public Administration Committee, as Senator Waters said—previous inquiries, extensive and detailed inquiries, with a number of recommendations. Again, the Labor Party would agree that there are a number of recommendations before government, which can act on those recommendations now. Ample evidence has been taken in a number of committees and inquiries that have been held by the Senate. If this can assist in any way in focusing minds, then so be it, but we certainly would urge the government to take action, rather than wait for yet another inquiry before an overworked Senate committee, which has already provided recommendations to government.

                 oppose this. One Nation wants to protect women and men, and especially children. We make decisions based on facts and data. Child homicides from 2000 to 2012 included 284 deaths by a parent—76 per cent of the 284 deaths were by a custodial parent; 49 per cent by the custodial mother; and 26 per cent by the custodial father.
