         Thank you, Senator Ruston, for that important question. I can advise the honourable senator that the government has decided to recommend to His Excellency the Governor-General that the current letters patent for the

          Child Sexual Abuse
         </a>
         be amended so as to extend the reporting date of the royal commission to 15 December 2017. That is an extension of the current reporting date by two years. I am assured by the chairman of the royal commission, Justice
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McClellan" rel="nofollow">
          McClellan
         </a>
         , that this will be sufficient to enable the royal commission to complete its work.
        </p>
        <p>
         The extension of the royal commission will be at a cost of $125.8 million. That is in addition to the $377 million currently budgeted for, bringing the Commonwealth's total commitment to slightly above $500 million. Although this is a very significant amount of money, it is the view of the government, given the importance of the royal commission's work, that this outlay is justified. I am aware of a mediaâ€”

           I thought you might take this topic more seriously, Senator Cameron. I am aware of a media report recently that suggested that there was some doubt about the government's commitment to extending the royal commission. That report was completely inaccurate. I can tell honourable senators that I have met with Justice
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McClellan" rel="nofollow">
            McClellan
           </a>
           on two occasions since the beginning of this year, most recently on 3 July, and was able to reassure him that the government would look favourably upon his request to extend the sitting dates. Justice McClellan asked that that decision be made by the beginning of September. I was able to telephone him last night to confirm that the decision had been made.

             Because, Senator Ruston, the royal commission's work is of the utmost public importance. For decades, the victims of many heinous offences were silenced, their pain was minimised and the harm to them went unacknowledged. We now know much more about child sexual abuse than before the commission started its work. We can more easily identify cultural and systemic norms and practices which enabled the perpetuation of these most vile crimes. We know that victims have been harmed not only by the direct experience of abuse but also by institutional indifference and, too often, rejection of their stories. But there is more to be learned. There is more that needs to be learned, which is why the government has decided to accede to Justice

               Senator Ruston, the extension will give the commission the capacity to hear more stories from victims, conduct more public hearings and issue additional interim reports. Because of the extension, we expect that there will be an additional 30 public hearings, bringing the total number to 70. There will be the opportunity for an additional 3,000 private sessions, bringing the total number to 7,000. Effective use of 52 research projects, to be completed by December 2015, will be able to inform critical recommendations and, as well, the commission will have the ability to revisit institutions mentioned in earlier case studies to scrutinise changes carried out since the initial examination. All of this will build a much fuller and more complete picture of the scourge of institutional child abuse, but, most importantly, it will give those who need to tell their stories the opportunity to do so.
