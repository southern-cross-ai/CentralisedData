       <p>
        This is not my first speech; however, as a senator for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        and with deep connections to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         Western Sydney
        </a>
        , I felt this issue was too important not to speak on. I was delighted that, at the last New South Wales state election, there were bipartisan commitments to build Sydney
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_West" rel="nofollow">
         Metro West
        </a>
        . However, I'm disappointed that there's now doubt over the future of this critical project, doubt which has shaken the confidence of every Western Sydney resident and business, who are set to benefit from this once-in-a-generation project. But this is not a new story. In fact, it feels more like a recurring nightmare, where state and federal Labor governments bank on the votes of Western Sydney residents yet abandon them when they enter office. The people of Western Sydney should be a priority and they deserve adequate public transport. Both federal and state governments must build the critical infrastructure needed for the expected three million people who will call Western Sydney home by 2030.

        This once-in-a-century project, announced and funded by the previous New South Wales Liberal government, would have doubled the rail capacity between the Sydney and Parramatta CBDs. Currently, Parramatta is the fourth-busiest train station in Sydney, with just over 1.8 million people going through its turnstiles in June of this year. Strathfield is the seventh-busiest, with just over 1.1 million going through the station during that same month. If Metro West is cancelled or delayed, it will stall the growth and opportunity of Western Sydney and continue to force residents onto toll roads or into heavy traffic. Labor's cut-and-cancel culture will leave residents without the public transport infrastructure they urgently need to connect them to their homes, small businesses or workplaces. I call on the New South Wales Labor government to commit to their promiseâ€”
