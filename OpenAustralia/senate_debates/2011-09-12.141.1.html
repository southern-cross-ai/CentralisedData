        My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Senator Wong. Given that the current government has never made a contribution to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Fund" rel="nofollow">
         Future Fund
        </a>
        , when does the government anticipate making a contribution to the fund from a future Labor budget surplus?

         What I would say about the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Fund" rel="nofollow">
          Future Fund
         </a>
         , as we have confirmed in this discussion today, is that the assets held by the fund are about $70 billion—I think it is around $75 billion—and I suppose the opposition could fill their budget black hole by selling the entire of the Future Fund. That could be their approach to fiscal policy, given that they have yet to have a set of costings that add up.
        </p>
        <p>
         I make the point that we have traversed this is great detail. Those opposite continue to make assertions around the Future Fund that are not true.

           Given the $70 billion black hole those on the other side are saddled with, let me say that this government, with a clear and sound fiscal strategy, will be making a contribution well before the opposition ever could—

                 Given that we do not have the $70 billion black hole that those opposite have, our budgets will be in a much better position than theirs. But I would make this point, because I think it is an important one: those opposite seem to have forgotten something called the global financial crisis. It is extraordinary, isn't it? This economic event has caused major advanced economies to have levels of unemployment in excess of nine per cent, unlike Australia, where the unemployment figure has a five in front of it. It has occupied the policymakers and the leaders of the United States, Europe and all the major advanced economies and the developing economies. And yet they on that side seem to believe that it never happened. They never had a policy for it—

                     In answer to previous questions, I have already explained the accounting of the sale of non-financial assets. I have made the statement in this chamber on a number of occasions now that the government is not raiding the

                         I would refer the senator to my previous answers to Senator Cormann and Senator Joyce which make clear the government's position in relation to this matter. But I would say that if those opposite care so much about fiscal responsibility they can deal with their $70 billion black hole and they can explain why they voted to increase the government's liabilities when it comes to superannuation. You supported Senator Ronaldson's bill, which will increase public sector civilian and military superannuation liabilities—a decision that Senator Minchin was not prepared to come into this chamber and vote for. So you want to come in here and talk about unfunded liabilities, but you add to them yourselves by the way you vote. The reality is the opposition have no economic or fiscal credibility. They think that because they once sat near
