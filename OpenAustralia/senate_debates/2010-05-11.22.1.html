        My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Evans. Is the minister aware that some 67 illegal entrants are currently being housed at the Virginia Palms motel in Boondall in suburban Brisbane—in the Treasurer’s own electorate? It is an establishment described as:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … four star … property set amongst 10 acres of lush, tropical gardens. Renowned for quality and friendly personalised service, your stay with us will be enjoyable, relaxing and stress-free.
       </p>
       <p>
        Can the minister confirm that these people have been transferred to this location from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Christmas Island
        </a>
        ? Why are illegal entrants being accommodated in a luxury hotel in the middle of suburban Brisbane while thousands of Australians are homeless?

          No, I have ruled on this before, Senator Brown, and I have been consistent. I understand the context in which you raise it, but I have allowed it to stand before and I will allow it to stand on this occasion.

           On a further point to that point of order: it clearly says in the standing orders that argument shall not be brought into the use of a question. The least to be said about the use of the word ‘illegal’ in this context is that it is arguable. It is actually downright wrong, but I ask you again to look at the standing orders and give a considered reply to the Senate on that matter.

             I am disappointed that Senator Brandis would take this approach, given that he allegedly represents the progressive wing of the Liberal Party. If this is what the progressive wing of the Liberal Party has come to, they clearly are in desperate straits.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is true that we are accommodating some families who are seeking asylum in this country in that motel. Some people have been there for a number of weeks. The newsworthiness of this surprises me, given that it was on the front page of the
             <i>
              Courier-Mail
             </i>
             about three weeks ago. Clearly, Senator Brandis and the Liberal Party do not read the
             <i>
              Courier-Mail
             </i>
             . I confirm that we have been accommodating some asylum seekers, particularly vulnerable groups or families, in motel accommodation—consistent with a long history of the Howard government doing exactly the same. The Howard government accommodated asylum seekers in the Comfort Inn Asti in Darwin for many years. The Howard government accommodated asylum seekers in the Colonial inn in Brisbane. The Howard government accommodated asylum seekers in the Arkaba Hotel in Adelaide. And the Howard government accommodated asylum seekers in Quest apartments in various states. So it may come as a surprise to you, Senator Brandis, but this is long-established government policy for dealing with vulnerable groups and families.
            </p>
            <p>
             We make no apologies that we do not put children behind barbed wire; we actually try to find appropriate accommodation. In the Howard government’s latter years, you also took to trying to find more appropriate accommodation on some occasions. I am told that in 2004 the Howard government was spending approximately $80,000 per month to house a mother and child in the Arkaba Hotel in Adelaide. So, yes, consistent with past governments’ practice, where appropriate we have accommodated children and their accompanying families in motel accommodation.

              , I ask a supplementary question. Minister, given the comprehensive failure of the Rudd government to secure Australia’s borders from illegal entrants, what measures has it put in place to ensure the safety of local suburban Australian communities where it has chosen to accommodate illegal entrants?

We got to a very dark place in Australia in terms of the way we treated people. I thought we had an emerging consensus that we do not want to go back there, but clearly that is not the case.

               <p>
                In accordance with past governments’ practice, the appropriate health and security checks are conducted before people are accommodated in the community. The appropriate security arrangements are provided by Serco, the security provider. I understand there is also a security firm involved in perimeter security. All local police have been consulted about these matters. This is normal practice as it existed under the Howard government, and I do not regard those children as a threat.

                  I am not aware of the particular quotes that the senator refers to but I can say that Mr Logan is the departmental media spokesperson, employed in that role by the previous government and by this government; that he is a highly competent officer; and that he does do radio interviews and other media appearances to try to explain what is occurring. What he was doing was explaining the processes that have been in place for many years for housing people in hotel and motel accommodation. I am advised that advice was provided to the appropriate education and police authorities in Queensland about arrangements for housing of this particular group, that the normal arrangements with some of the relevant community organisations have been in place, and that large numbers of people have been informed of those arrangements where relevant. As I said, there was a story about a particular family on the front page of the

                  weeks ago. It is practice as normal and consistent with the previous government.
