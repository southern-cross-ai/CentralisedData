        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, Senator Kim Carr. On the eve of the 2010 federal election, Minister Albanese and

        Isn't it a fact that on 20 July last year Mr Thomson wrote to Minister Garrett making unsubstantiated allegations about the interaction between

           . I indicate that the answer I give has to be relevant to the question and the question, it would appear to me, seems to be covered by notice of motion No. 706. But I will try to be helpful to the senator and I do appreciate the fact that she has given us notice of her intention to ask this question. I can advise her that the funding for the Wyong youth skills and employment centre was announced in July 2010. Yes, it was an election commitment worth $2.7 million and the commitment was for a joint project between the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyong_Shire_Council" rel="nofollow">
            Wyong Shire Council
           </a>
           and
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
            Central Coast
           </a>
           Group Training. This commitment was reflected in the project guidelines.
          </p>
          <p>
           The centre is part of the Community Infrastructure Grants' Youth Commitment program. Those grants go to examples of the way in which the government is seeking to provide support to young people to make the most of opportunities that exist, particularly enhancing their opportunities for training, employment and engagement in the com­munity. In 2010 the government launched the National Strategy for Young Australians, which aimed to empower young people to develop their abilities. This is an undertaking consistent with that commitment. As part of the commitment, $10 million was awarded in five arts, business and community centres for young Australians. This is one of those.
          </p>
          <p>
           As to your specific suggestion of a change in program guidelines, senior officers of the department of schools are continuing to liaise and negotiate with both of the Wyong parties to attempt to fulfil the original election commitment. Senior

                 Craig Thomson

                to Minister Garrett dated 20 July. I specifically directed him to what was going to be in my question today and I would have thought that, under those circumstances where you do give such specific notice of a question, the issue of direct relevance becomes more important. I invite you, Mr President, to ask the minister to answer my question and be directly relevant, otherwise what is he hiding?

                 , on a point of order: the assertion made by the senator is that, because she writes to the minister telling him the question, he has to give her the answer that she wants. This is a nonsense. Senator Carr has been very relevant, directly trying to deal with the issues raised by the senator, directly relevant to the issues that are already on the

                 . Given the question has been allowed, Senator Carr has been enormously helpful on an issue that has been covered up hill and down dale in this parliament and at estimates for a long time. The bottom line is: just because the senator writes advising of the question does not mean the minister is required to give the answer that she wants.

                     <p>
                      Senator, Fierravanti-Wells, you have asked for a response that requires an opinion to be expressed by me, which is clearly outside the standing orders. What I can say is this: this opposition have pursued a vendetta against the member for Dobell, as we saw just this week in respect of his application for sick leave, where they sought to reject the opinion of a medical practitioner.

                       , I rise on a point of order. There is no part of what Senator Carr has just said that is remotely relevant to the question. He may have 36 seconds to go, but you may not allow a minister to engage in gratuitous abuse of the opposition that has no bearing on the question whatsoever in any part of his answer.

                         , on the point of order: given the question was allowed, it was a complete slur on a member of parliament in the other House. It was a complete slur designed to denigrate; and, therefore, the answer has been directly relevant as it deals with that slurring of a member. I am not sure that the question should have been allowed; but, if it is, the answer is directly relevant.
