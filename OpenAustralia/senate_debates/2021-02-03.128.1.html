        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Birmingham. Last night the member for Dawson took to Facebook in defence of the member for Hughes, accusing others and the 'fake news media' of trying to censor Mr Kelly. Does the Prime Minister agree?

         I haven't seen Mr Christensen's remarks, but I would make a couple of observations.
        </p>
        <p>
         Firstly, I would observe that, as is often the case when these sorts of highly-charged political debates occur, there are some who take an approach which seems to suggest that everything that's ever been uttered needs to be retracted or withdrawn. So let's be very clear that our government stands firmly by our vaccine strategy. Our government wants to make sure that that is the No. 1 focus of government policy delivery and of public dialogue in relation to building confidence around the vaccine strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
         As I have already told the chamber, and as Senator Colbeck has told the chamber, the Prime Minister met with Mr Kelly this morning. The Prime Minister made clear that neither he nor the government support any views that undermine the vaccine strategy, whether made by Mr Kelly or by anyone else in that regard. We want to make sure the overwhelming focus is on building public confidence to receive the vaccines that we are investing in and that we have secured for the Australian people. This strategy is crucial and a crucial part of the nation's health and economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Australia is incredibly well prepared because of the good work done last year to make sure we have a successful delivery of vaccines across the country.

           The point of order is direct relevance. I have been mindful of your previous rulings about glancing references, but we're at 23 seconds to go and nobody who is answering questions has addressed the question, which is whether or not the Prime Minister agrees with Mr Christensen saying that Mr Kelly is being censored.

            I'm listening carefully to the minister's answer and I think he is directly addressing the subject matter. I can't instruct him how to answer a question. As long as he's addressing the matter of information with respect to this vaccine, I think that's directly relevant to the question. Senator Birmingham to continue.

               Just whilst question time was proceeding, Senator Canavan tweeted in defence of Mr Kelly, saying:

              <p class="italic">
               I think we need more Craig Kelly's willing to say unpopular things because it is only by challenging ideas that we get better ideas.

              <p>
               Does Prime Minister Morrison agree with Senator Canavan's comments in relation to Mr Kelly, and, if he does not, will he make clear that Senator Canavan's comments do not represent the position of the Morrison government?

                It's always important to have people who will test and challenge views and opinions. However, it is equally important in relation to dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic that government and those speaking with the public advocate for the facts of the matter and follow the factual advice that is presented. Our government has been consistent from this time last year—indeed, slightly before it—in acting and following on the health advice provided to us. We have acted on the health advice at each step of the way. That health advice has served the nation well. We have acted on the health advice in relation to the vaccination strategy that has been developed and we will continue to follow that health advice in delivering upon that vaccination strategy.
