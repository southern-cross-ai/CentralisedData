         was an outstanding demonstration of the quality and depth of the Australian university system. Australia now has the third highest number of universities in the top 100 world wide—a fantastic result. It is remarkable when you consider that that is only behind the United States and the United Kingdom, which have many more universities than Australia.

           Senator Joyce, you may not be interested in regional education but this government is. That is why the numbers are up so much and that is why they are thriving. The National Party may not think education is important but 19 of Australia's 37 public universities are now in the top 500. It is a testament to the leadership, the staff and the students of those universities but it is also a reflection of a government that has invested in those universities—invested in their quality and invested in their research. We know that under the Howard government they stripped funds out of the universities. It is their favourite place to go when they are looking to fill their funding shortfalls, and we know they will go there again if they get the chance. We have had record investment in universities and it is paying off. We know that we have increased funding to universities for research, including infrastructure, by 60 per cent.

             Senator Joyce, have a look at the rural and regional figures. Why are they doing so well? It is because we funded them properly. Your disinterest on this issue does you no credit. Australia's future is as a smart country with a highly educated workforce. This is a fantastic result for the universities. It is a credit to them and a great credit to Australia and this government's investment in higher education.

                The ticket to a strong future is a better future in education. By opening up the doors of university education we are unlocking the potential of thousands more Australians who have been denied access in the past. One of the most pleasing things about yesterday's academic rankings is that the depth of the sector was revealed. It was not just about the elites, not just about the older universities in this country, not just about the sandstones; it was about our newer universities and our regional universities not only lifting participation but growing excellence.

                    , one of the pleasing things is not only that we have been able to increase the number of Australians accessing university education and the numbers graduating; we are actually increasing excellence in the sector at the same time. Some commentators in recent days have tried to say that you cannot do both. Well, I think these figures absolutely prove that you can grow participation and lift excellence at the same time.

                          Senator Mason, you are excused. You are the exception, which is why you did not gain favour under the former prime minister, because he was not interested in it either. A good university system is vital to this country's future. To grow that sector and to grow excellence you have to invest in it. The Labor Party is always committed to growing excellence and to growing the strength of that sector. The results yesterday show that we are delivering on that. Those opposite are a great threat to that because we know where they will fund their blackhole from. We know where they will start looking for the $70 billion. They will start in the university sector, where the Conservatives in Britain did and where they traditionally have. That is a real threat to our future.
