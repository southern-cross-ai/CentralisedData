         I thank Senator Cameron for his ongoing interest in this policy area. Today is a historic day. It represents the holy grail of telecom­muni­cations reform. It represents real change for the sector, with real competition resulting in a better deal for all consumers. This morning, Telstra and

           It will see Australians experience the

           sooner and faster. It will accelerate the government's delivery of superfast broadband to all Australians no matter where they live across our vast country. The signing of the docu­ments also represents a watershed in tele­communications industry reform, providing the impetus for the structural separation of Telstra—a critical reform that will finally enable real competition.

          <p>
           Just over 12 months ago, we signed the financial heads of agreements. Whilst it has taken a while to get to this position, we now have a legally binding agreement that will see Telstra progressively structurally separated by decommissioning its copper network and broadband

              HFC

             network and progressively transfer its customers to the NBN. Optus has also agreed to a fixed line network preference in favour of the NBN within the HFC footprint subject to certain minor exceptions. I said this morning that Optus had been supportive of the NBN from day one, and they have. This deal, which will also be subject to

               (Victoria—) (): As we all know, the opposition led by Mr Abbott is a policy-free zone. How do we know this? How do we know the opposition prefer spend over substance? Senator Minchin, who in his last question time deserves a mention, effectively confirmed to the press that he had advised Mr Abbott that the coalition was guilty of not supporting good policy. I have always known that Senator Minchin has had his moments of peace and clarity, and this must have been one of those times. Clearly, the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
                NBN
               </a>
               is a great example of good policy that should be supported. What I can say to you,
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
                Mr President

               , is that we on this side of the chamber do support good public policy. We will continue to advocate strongly for reforms, and this includes rolling out fast but fairly priced broadband to all Australians.
