        My question is to the Minister representing the Attorney-General, Senator Ludwig. The minister would be aware of the floods that devastated the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia

        n communities in the Gascoyne region of WA, including Carnarvon, in late December 2010 and early January this year. Can the minister explain why after seven weeks no payments have been made under the natural disaster recovery scheme to any affected residents? Those payments—a minimum of $1,000 for each adult, regardless of income, with $400 per child—would allow those people to start rebuilding their lives. Will the minister guarantee that this government’s failure to release these funds to affected

             Don’t you want to hear what these people are receiving out of the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements? Clearly, you do not want to hear that we are providing support. That would be right: the opposition just want to decry and make claims. Maybe they do not want these people to receive any support from the Commonwealth government.

             The assistance includes personal hardship and distress assistance, including the provision of emergency assistance, emergency accommodation, food, essential clothing, other personal items, payments of up to $388 per eligible adult and up to $194 per eligible child on the first day of assistance. There are also payments for temporary living expenses of between $110 and $150 per day for every adult for families in the metropolitan area. It also includes the restoration of essential public assets.

                In addition to those 17 local government areas, there is a range of payments that are available in that region. Further to the Disaster Income Recovery Subsidy, there is also a fortnightly payment equivalent of up to the maximum rate of Newstart or youth allowance.

                  and the relevant emergency departments in the states, we have arrangements in place. Perhaps they should understand this because they fail to grasp that there are natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements available. When states activate an area and advise the Commonwealth that there is an area that has suffered a natural disaster—

                   , on a point of order on relevance, the question from Senator Back is very clear: why are these payments not being made? Either the minister is deliberately misunderstanding the question or he is simply incapable of understanding it. We know the payments are available, but they are not being paid. Could you direct the minister to answer the question or sit him down if he cannot?

                    That was the most spurious point of order yet today, which is a record for the good senator. Senator Ludwig has been addressing the question specifically. If you have worded your questions poorly that is your problem. Take it to your tactics committee. Senator Ludwig could not be more on message and on point.

                      As I was explaining to the opposition, who fail to grasp what arrangements are in place, there are joint arrangements between the state and the Commonwealth. In this instance, they are administered by the state under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements. If we had been in a state parliament they may have been able to provide the exact figures. On behalf of the Attorney-General, I can seek the information—

                       , I ask a further supplementary question. The minister needs to understand that it is a federal government disaster recovery scheme. Can the minister assure the Senate that those families recovering from the natural disaster that has occurred over the last few days in Perth, in which 72 homes were destroyed and 32 damaged, will not suffer the same fate as those in the Gascoyne by missing out on vital federal funding?

It currently applies to the local government districts of Armadale, Canning, Chittering, Serpentine, Swan and one other. The natural disaster relief and recovery assistance includes emergency assistance for people who have suffered personal hardship. This includes the provision of emergency assistance such as accommodation, food, essential clothing and other personal items, and payments of up to $388 per eligible adult and up to $194 per eligible child.
