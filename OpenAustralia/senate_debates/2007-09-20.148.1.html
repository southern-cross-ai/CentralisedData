        My question is addressed to Senator Abetz, the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Will the minister update the Senate on the latest information about workplace agreement making in Australia? What does this information say about the Howard government’s modern and flexible industrial relations policies? Is the minister aware of any alternative policies?

         I congratulate Senator Bushby on an excellent first speech yesterday and say that he has followed up superbly today with an excellent question, that being his first one. I note from his maiden speech last night that the issue he is asking a question about today is a matter in which he is genuinely interested. Yesterday, the latest official report on agreement making in the Australian workplace was released. Like a number of reports before it, this report totally debunks the false claims being made by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
          ALP
         </a>
         and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACTU" rel="nofollow">
          ACTU
         </a>
         about, in particular, Australian workplace agreements.
        </p>
        <p>
         Let us compare what the Labor Party says has been happening with what is actually revealed in this document. Let us start with working hours. Those on the other side assert that people are working longer hours. In fact, that is wrong: average weekly hours worked are now at 37.3, a decline, albeit minimal, from 37.4. How about wages? The ALP and ACTU falsely claim that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWA" rel="nofollow">
          AWA
         </a>
         s are forcing down wages—wrong again. Average hourly total earnings for non-managerial employees on AWAs actually increased by 12.8 per cent; they did not decline. But what about wages under AWAs compared with under collective agreements? The rise under collective agreements was 4.1 per cent. So that is: AWAs at 12.8 per cent; collective agreements at 4.1 per cent. Of course, I could go on.
        </p>
        <p>
         What does all this say about the Howard government’s flexible modern workplace relations system? It says it is working for the benefit of Australian workers and their families, and it says that the false scare campaign against it is exactly that—false. Yet, despite all this, Labor still maintain the ridiculous position that they will rip up AWAs, the central feature of our modern industrial relations system. They will rip up these modern flexible arrangements which provide 8.7 per cent more for workers than under collective agreements. So why would Labor persist in defying common sense on this?
        </p>
        <p>
         I think we know the answer: it is the trade union movement. I came across a very interesting quote yesterday and I invite those opposite to guess who said it:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The trade union movement keeps the Parliamentary Labor Party in touch with the values and aspirations of working people. It is our greatest source of cohesion …
        </p>
        <p>
         And I might be able to say:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Without the union movement the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         would rely on a rainbow alliance of single-issue interest groups: environmentalists, peace activists, gays and civil libertarians—
        </p>
        <p>
         but I do not have to say that; the person whom I am quoting said that as well. With the Labor Party, if it is not the trade union movement, you get a rainbow coalition of ‘environmentalists, peace activists, gays and civil libertarians’. That is the choice in the Labor Party. Do you know who said it? Senior frontbencher Dr Craig Emerson, who would be the small business minister under a Rudd Labor government. I say to those listening: that is the scary prospect of a Rudd Labor government; whereas we on this side understand the needs of the 80 per cent of workers who are not in trade unions.

          , I ask a supplementary question. The minister has indicated that there have been significant improvements in industrial relations policy. Could he elaborate further on how these changes have contributed to an increase in the number of Australians in work?

           That is a very important supplementary question. Since the changes in March 2006 over 417,000 Australians now have a job—417,000 Australians. You can argue about how many were actually as a result of our changes, but as an absolute minimum some of those commentators who are as harsh as one might expect on us say that over half of them are as a result of the abolition of the unfair dismissal laws. Of course, the Labor Party would reintroduce that regime and see all those people who have gained employment as a result of us taking tough initiatives lose their jobs and lose the opportunities that have been provided to them. That is one of the great achievements of the Howard government—real wages growth, the lowest rate of industrial disputation and a 33-year low in unemployment. That is a huge social dividend for this country.
