       <p class="italic">
        Senator FIELDING:

       <p class="italic">
        My question is directed to Senator Carr, the Minister representing the Minister for Education. Given the government’s so-called
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_the_Education_Revolution" rel="nofollow">
         Building the Education Revolution
        </a>
        is supposed to be in full swing, can the minister explain why the government has been so incompetent in delivering this program and why Sandringham East Primary School is still waiting for construction to begin on its six classrooms, despite all plans having been drawn up and all approvals having been granted by the government in June last year? Given that construction will now take place during the school year, instead of during school holidays, does the government actually give a stuff about how this is going to disrupt this school and its classes?

         Mr President

        , I ask a further supplementary question. Given that Cheltenham Primary School is also waiting for the government to get its act together, can the minister confirm that it is not just a coincidence that these massive delays in construction at Sandringham East Primary School and Cheltenham Primary School have occurred to schools in a safe Liberal seat?

        Milne; Has the Rudd government had any talks with, or given any undertakings to, Tasmanian Premier

       </p>
       <p class="italic">

        The “response” referred to is the Joint Government Response to the second five year review of the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Longer term, the government is committed to RFAs as the primary mechanism for sustainable forestry management and will engage in talks with each of relevant states on renewing RFAs, as they approach their 20 year life period.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Milne: I would like to now ask the minister whether the Rudd government supports the ongoing logging of old-growth forests in Tasmania until 2037, and are they open to renegotiating the regional forest agreement to deliver on that promise?

       <p class="italic">
        In the Ministerial Statement, Preparing our forest industries for the future,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        of 24 June 2009 by The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry—The Hon. Tony Burke MP stated:

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        “Additionally, the Government notes the concerns raised by Dr Hawke in recommendation 38 in the review regarding the current mechanisms in the Act for forest management under Regional Forest Agreements (121724,3), and is committed to working with state governments to improve the review, audit and monitoring arrangements for RFAs, including their timely completion, clearer assessment of performance against environmental and sustainable forestry outcomes, and a greater focus on compliance of RFAs in the intervening years”.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Milne: Can the minister tell the Senate whether Premier Bartlett has misled the Tasmanian people by saying that he would immediately renegotiate the Tasmanian Regional Forest Agreement to provide for logging of old-growth forests in Tasmania for another 20 years if there had been no talks with the Commonwealth—or have there been talks with the Commonwealth?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Minister is not in a position to comment on this.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Sherry: Nevertheless, I cannot recall him mentioning forestry on that occasion. I will check—I will have a look at other public statements he has made. I am aware, obviously, that there is a Tasmanian state election on. I will come back to you.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Tasmanian Premier, David Bartlett, did not discuss forestry in his Labor Campaign Launch speech of 8 March 2010

        In a media release on 26 February 2010 Premier Bartlett is quoted:

        to renew the RFA and to provide industry with ongoing long term security through the provision of rolling agreement renewals following each five year review of the RFA. A further twenty-year evergreen RFA will provide industry with the security necessary for ongoing investment generating wealth for the Tasmanian economy into the future”
