        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Wong. Over the last month we've had a number of visits from foreign ministers and world leaders, particularly from China,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">

         I thank the senator for his question and say that Australians expect and deserve a government that advances the nation's interests in a mature and serious way, and we've been very pleased to welcome a great number of high-level international visitors here this year, including the Prime Minister of

And, of course, earlier this month Australia hosted a dozen world leaders from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN" rel="nofollow">
          ASEAN
         </a>
         and Timor-Leste at the special summit in Melbourne.
        </p>
        <p>
         Each visit is an opportunity to advance a more peaceful, stable and prosperous world, one in which we operate by rules, standards and norms, where each country's sovereignty is respected and where each country can pursue its own aspirations.

         special summit commemorated 50 years since Australia became ASEAN's first dialogue partner, another prescient decision by Labor Prime Minister Gough Whitlam. We agreed with ASEAN leaders a vision statement and a Melbourne declaration setting out practical cooperation and shared aspirations for the future, and there was a lot of discussion about how we boost economic engagement, accelerate the clean energy transition and increase maritime cooperation.

            Our relationship with China is important, and it is consequential. A stable relationship between us doesn't just happen; it needs ongoing work to advance our interests and to manage our differences. I was pleased to welcome foreign minister

            to Australia, the most senior visitor from China since 2017. We agreed to continue our constructive engagements on a range of issues, including education, defence and trade, and to expand climate and energy cooperation. I welcomed the progress of the removal of trade impediments and reiterated our desire for the removal of remaining impediments.

           <p>
            I reiterated Australia's shock at the sentencing of Dr Yang Jun and a range of other concerns, including the human rights of Uighurs, Tibetans and other minorities across China. I also expressed our deep concerns that Hong Kong's new legislation will further erode rights and freedoms, with potential impacts on individuals in Australia. Australians expect their government to pursue a mature and productive relationship in both countries' interests, and the Prime Minister looks forward to welcomingâ€”
