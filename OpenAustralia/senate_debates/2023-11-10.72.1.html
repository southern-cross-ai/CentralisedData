        When a baby turtle hatches from its egg on a beach in Queensland, as amazing and beautiful as it is, its future is pretty bleak. Only one in about 1,000 hatchlings will make it to maturity. The odds are not stacked in their favour, which is why the work the great team at

        Turtle Centre, on the Bundaberg coast of Queensland, is so critical. I was fortunate to visit recently to announce, in partnership with the Queensland government, a joint investment of $2.8 million for the continuation of the successful Nest to Ocean Turtle Protection Program.

        There's no greater champion for these little baby turtles than Mrs Judith Stutchbury, a teacher at Kalkie State School, just a few kilometres down the road from Mon Repos. I had the honour of meeting Mrs Stutchbury when she was awarded the Prime Minister's Prize for Excellence in Science Teaching in

        recently. Mrs Stutchbury is a Reef Guardian Schools teacher who educates her students about the importance of marine conservation and how their actions will make a difference. Her many initiatives include a Science Together convention for

        The year 2023 is significant for Reef Guardian Schools as it celebrates 20 years of providing teaching and learning opportunities that raise awareness, understanding and appreciation for the reef and its connected ecosystems. To the 235 Reef Guardian Schools across the country and to their wonderful teachers, including Mrs Stutchbury: congratulations and thank you for inspiring the next generation of reef champions and turtle protectors.
