        (1) Is the Government aware of the efforts to stop corruption across the world through new rules for the mandatory disclosure of payments made by extractive industry companies to governments.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) Has the department conducted any research or provided any advice on these laws; if so, can copies be provided.

        (3) Has the Minister been briefed on these developments and what steps is the department taking to determine whether Australia should follow suit.

        transparency requirements are complementary to, and not in conflict with, the EITI transparency requirements. Let us be clear, the extraction of oil, gas, and minerals is still failing to bring the benefits to ordinary citizens that it should, particularly in the poorer countries. Implementation of the EITI standard does not achieve enough in isolation. We need a range of different transparency, accountability and governance reforms'.
