        My question is to Senator Faulkner, the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I ask, in light of the extraordinary tragedy in Bihar state in India, where three million people are displaced by flooding of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosi_River" rel="nofollow">
         Kosi River
        </a>
        , with 250,000 houses swept away and estimates of up to 3,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands starving, what urgent and immediate aid has Australia offered and been able to deliver to this disaster area? What further aid is being considered by the government?

         I thank Senator Brown for his question. I certainly am aware of the situation that Senator Brown raises in his question and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
          UN
         </a>
         ICEFâ€™s estimates that some 2.7 million people in over 1,000 villages have been affected by these absolutely devastating floods, as Senator Brown has mentioned.
        </p>
        <p>
         On 28 August, the

         </a>
         visited the affected areas and announced emergency assistance of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
          US
         </a>
         $244 million and 125,000 tonnes of food grains for survivors. Army, air force and other defence personnel have been mobilised. About 155 camps have been established accommodating about 30,000 people. A primary focus here is to distribute food packets, including through air drops, and to provide clean water, sanitation and essential medicine. I can also confirm that engineers have commenced repair work on the broken dam, although this may well take some time, of course, to restore.
        </p>
        <p>
         I think it is important to remind the Senate that the policy of the Indian government is not to appeal for international assistance for relief. However, I think any support provided on humanitarian grounds would be accepted.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNDP" rel="nofollow">
          UNDP
         </a>
         in India has advised that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          United Nations
         </a>
         will not be appealing for support on behalf of the Indian government. However, my understanding is that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_NGOs" rel="nofollow">
          Indian NGOs
         </a>
         are meeting to discuss whether they will issue an international appeal. Of course, I can confirm that the Australian government is very concerned about these floods. It is important to note here that the Indian government and authorities have acted very quickly to rescue and support survivors.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is also important to note how quickly the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Cross" rel="nofollow">
          Red Cross
         </a>
         and UN agencies have responded with emergency supplies.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Red_Cross" rel="nofollow">

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNICEF" rel="nofollow">

         and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Development_Program" rel="nofollow">
          United Nations Development Program
         </a>
         are assisting the local authorities with relief efforts and coordination. UNICEF has conducted a rapid needs assessment in the three worst affected areas and is planning for a larger intervention. It is also important to note that Nepal has also been severely affected by the burst dam, with some 70,000 people displaced there, as I understand the situation.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the circumstances, with the approach of the Indian government, I can inform the Senate that Australia will always consider requests for assistance from affected countries. That is the most recent information that I have available for the Senate. But if there is anything further that I can add, Senator Brown, I would be very happy to do so.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for that answer. In view of the sheer size of this disaster, will the minister seek to see how Australia is placed to assist
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
           UN
          </a>
          ICEF or other agencies in rapidly getting assistance into the area? Will the government look at the prospect of Australia establishing an international disaster centre in this country to deal with the recurrent major disasters that we see in our region, such as the tsunami, earthquakes, cyclones and now this flood disaster in Bihar?

           I thank Senator Brown for the supplementary question. I am happy to ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs and any other relevant ministers for a view in relation to the international disaster centre. This is something that has been raised previously by Senator Brown. In relation to this specific tragedy in Bihar and Nepal, we need to take account of the views and the approach that the Indian government is taking and be respectful of that. Australia will consider requests from affected countries as appropriate. Senator Brown, I am more than happy to ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he can provide any more specific information on those matters for you.
