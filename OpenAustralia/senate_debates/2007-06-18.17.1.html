        I ask the Minister representing the Prime Minister, in the wake of the bloodshed in Melbourne this morning, why has the Prime Minister done essentially nothing since 1996 to reduce the growing number of semiautomatic handguns circulating in the Australian community, including in the criminal community? Will the Prime Minister call a gun summit with the state leaders to reduce the number of semiautomatic handguns in Australia as the number of semiautomatic long guns was reduced in the wake of the

         I have not had a full briefing on this morning’s incident in Melbourne, but obviously the government expresses its deep sorrow at what has occurred. Any violence anywhere in Australia is to be condemned and the victims supported. We extend commiserations to all those affected.
        </p>
        <p>
         I find the belligerence of Senator Brown’s question rather surprising given that, whatever people may say about the Prime Minister on all sides of politics, I think the one thing that the Prime Minister can be strongly commended for is the way in which, through such a strong reaction to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Arthur" rel="nofollow">
          Port Arthur
         </a>
         massacre, he brought some very tough gun laws into this country. I am advised that some 60,000 handguns were brought back in as a result of that. He did so at considerable political cost to himself, as Senator Brown would know. There was a reaction from certain parts of Australia condemning the Prime Minister for his very tough stand on gun laws as a result of the Port Arthur massacre. It was a very significant response and one that we want to maintain.
        </p>
        <p>
         Without having had a full briefing, I am sure that, as a result of this incident, the government will consult with state governments to see if there is further action that should be taken to strengthen Australia’s already reasonably strong anti-gun laws. One of the great differences between this country and the United States is that we have much tougher gun laws. For me personally as someone who has a great affection for the United States and has lived in that country, one of the saddest things about the United States is the impossibility of getting a consensus to have much tougher gun laws in that country. I think that is a tragedy for the United States. Fortunately, we have been able to move beyond that.
        </p>
        <p>
         I note Senator Brown’s concern. I respect his concern to ensure that Australians at a state, local and federal level are doing all they can to sensibly restrict access to handguns in particular, which are so dangerous.

           Mr President

          . Why has the Minister representing the Prime Minister not been briefed on this issue? Does the minister agree that the proportion of deaths due to short guns has increased from less than 20 per cent to more than 50 per cent since 1996? Is it going to take a Dunblane or a

           This was a crime committed in the state of Victoria today, prima facie a crime under the Victorian criminal law, and will be properly investigated and prosecuted by the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Police" rel="nofollow">
            Victoria Police
           </a>
           . I am sure that the Victorian government and the Victoria Police will keep the Australian government and the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Federal Police
           </a>
           fully informed on the matter. If, as a result of that investigation, there are any prosecutions and clearly a need to strengthen, firstly, a Victorian approach but, secondly, a national approach, then obviously we are open to consider such matters. But I do think Senator Brown ought to give much more reflection upon the strength of the Australian government’s position on this matter. We have taken a very strong position on guns in this country, we continue to take a very strong position and we are of course always open to strengthening Australia’s gun laws if that proves necessary.
