        asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, upon notice, on 31 January 2012:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        With reference to the Pontville Immigration Detention Centre:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) How many ambulance visits have there been to the detention centre since it was opened.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) How many ambulance visits have been necessitated for the treatment of detainees.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) Who bears the cost of ambulance visits to the detention centre.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) For what types of medical emergency were the ambulances required.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (5) In regard to the reported hunger strike:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) how many detainees have been on a hunger strike at any one time;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) how many have required hospitalisation or on-site medical treatment as a result of a hunger strike;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) on what date did the first hunger strike take place and how many participated in that hunger strike; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) what was the basis of the hunger strike.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (6) Given that it has been claimed that certain representations were made to detainees as to community detention and the processing of their applications, can the Minister confirm that no such representations were made by departmental officials or Serco staff; if so, what advice can be provided as to the source of misapprehensions under which the detainees suffered in relation to community detention and the expeditious processing of their applications.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (7) Are the detainees taken on day trips; if so:
       </p>

         The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) As at 07 February 2012, there have been 11 people transferred from Pontville Immigration Detention Centre (PVIDC) to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Hobart_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
          Royal Hobart Hospital
         </a>
         (RHH) by ambulance since the facility became operational on 01 September 2011. Of those, three were Serco staff.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) There have been 8 detainees transferred from PVIDC to RHH by ambulance since the facility became operational.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) The cost of ambulance visits to the centre is passed on by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_Provider" rel="nofollow">
          Service Provider

         and Medical Services' to the department.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) There were four types of medical emergencies that have required ambulance support:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (a) medical complaint
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) complaints of chest pains
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (c) cases of suspected pneumonia
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (d) clients collapsing due to various medical conditions
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (5) (a) The largest number of clients that have been classified as being on voluntary starvation over 24 hours at any one time is eight people in detention. These clients were all participating in separate voluntary starvation protests, for reasons personal to themselves.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         There are no recorded incidents of group voluntary starvation protest at PVIDC.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) No clients required hospitalisation as a result of voluntary starvation action. People who are classified as being on Voluntary Starvation are monitored by service provider agencies onsite at PVIDC, including daily interaction with health service providers. Health service providers engage with clients, may take observations of health indicators and may provide treatment for certain conditions such as dehydration. In this sense all clients on Voluntary Starvation received medical treatment or attention as part of monitoring their health and well-being.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (c) The first recorded incident of a person in detention being classified as participating in voluntary starvation over 24 hours occurred on 19 September 2011 with only one client involved in this incident.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (d) The reason a person in detention participates in a voluntary starvation protest is their own and often varies from person to person.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (6) All clients accommodated at the PVIDC had already received information about the Community Detention program prior to transfer.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Departmental Case Managers at PVIDC (as at all Immigration Detention Facilities) are responsible for facilitating the progression of clients towards resolution of their immigration status. This involves addressing any obstacles which may be delaying such outcomes. Other actions may also entail initiation and submission of appropriate referrals, including referral to the Community Detention program.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Many clients at PVIDC were referred for consideration under the Community Detention program prior to being transferred to the centre. Clients who arrived at PVIDC without Community Detention referrals in place have subsequently had referrals initiated if it was believed they would meet eligibility criteria.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Departmental procedures ensure Case Managers regularly review each client. Further, Case Managers meet with all clients regularly to address any client concerns and deliver updates on case progression.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (7) (a) There have been a total of 307 trips for people in detention.
