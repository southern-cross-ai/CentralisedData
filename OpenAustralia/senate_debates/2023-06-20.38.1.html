        I'd like to read out a post today from Surfrider Foundation Northern Beaches. I'm a surfer, and surfers all around the country represent all political demographics. They say:

        11 lease once and forever, and pass legislation that prevents fossil fuel mining off our coastline. No grandstanding, no wedging, just quiet cooperation to get this done legally, legislatively and above all—permanently.
       </p>
       <p>
        What they're referring to is a bill before the

        parliament, an act to amend the Petroleum (Offshore) Act 1982 and other legislation to prohibit the granting of development consent and the granting of permits and licences for the purposes of seabed petroleum exploration or recovery, or development intended to facilitate seabed exploration or recovery. This bill was introduced by the New South Wales Liberal Party, who, previously in government, promised to kill PEP-11, petroleum exploration permit 11, once and for all. What is state Labor going to do? Are they going to bring this bill on for debate? I urge them to do so—to pass this bill, ban petroleum exploration permit 11 in New South Wales once and for all and reflect the wishes of the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our current Prime Minister promised in opposition that a government he led would kill petroleum exploration permit 11—no ifs, no buts. Twelve months after the election, we've still seen no action from Mr Albanese. Remember this is the exact same petroleum exploration permit licence that Mr Scott Morrison, in the other place, used his extraordinary secret powers to also kill. It's time now to finish petroleum exploration permit 11, to look after the interests of community, to look after the environment and to take climate action when it's most needed at this critical time in history.
