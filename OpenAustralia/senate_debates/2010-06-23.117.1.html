         The coalition have given up our matter of public importance this afternoon. We understood the necessity for a condolence motion earlier today which took up a considerable amount of time that had been allotted for government business today. Also, it is in the interests of the coalition as well as other parties to finalise the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Amendment Bill and related legislation. The legislation has continued on through the committee stage for longer than I think was anticipated by all. There has been some very healthy and robust debate. We would like to assist in the facilitation of that legislation to pass through the chamber today in order that any amendments that are required to be considered by the House of Representatives arrive in a timely fashion. Otherwise, this matter will not be considered until tomorrow. We would like it to be noted that the coalition have been exceptionally cooperative again in assisting the government with the legislative process of this chamber by relinquishing one hour of our time.

          acknowledge Senator Parry’s generosity and his gesture of cooperation. The government certainly do appreciate that the condolence motion did take some time from the debate today and we appreciate the cooperation of the opposition in getting through the business program.

           I have spoken with Senator Milne about this, and there is a need to get this legislation through. I think it can be done by agreement—obviously, it can be because that is what we are agreeing to here. Therefore, we are not going to divide over it. We do not support the guillotine proposal, but we support the cooperation that is going to lead to this matter being handled swiftly and finalised.
