        In the spirit of festivity, as we come to the conclusion of another parliamentary year, I welcome two forthcoming events this December. The first is on 18 December, when the fabled Star Wars franchise obtains a reboot through new eyes, and, of course, a week later we get to spend time with our loved ones, relatives and in-laws at Christmas. Why Star Wars? There is an immense amount of optimism with respect to the arrival of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, underlining the impact the famed original trilogy has had, transforming the way we make, market and enjoy film.

C-3PO and R2-D2 started us on a journey that traversed hyperspace. The movie transcended a generation. I remember my two boys, Will and Henry, at a very young age being transfixed by their remote controlled

        A recent irony that dawned on me was that there are a whole range of topics that are touched on that are central both to the galaxy far, far away and to our own world, even in this chamber. We see backroom deals, executive authority, citizen engagement, defence legislation and other political topics. In fact, it is amazing how links from this mythical universe transverse the modern political lexicon.

        Locally in Australia more than 70,000 people—0.37 per cent—declared themselves members of the Jedi order in the 2001 census. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Bureau_of_Statistics" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Bureau of Statistics
        </a>
        issued an official press release in response to media interest on the subject. Debate aside on the intentions of those that declared themselves as Jedi, of interest is that this is one of the first examples of a concept going 'viral' on the internet in Australia. There is not a more obvious example of Lucas's franchise shaping than this, than the originally derisive nickname given to President Reagan's missile defence program, 'Star Wars'.

        Even the current Obama administration has not been without its
        <i>

        moments, either. In early 2013, the Obama administration responded to a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House" rel="nofollow">
         White House
        </a>
        petition calling on the president to 'secure resources and funding and begin construction of a death star' by his last year in office. Unfortunately for many
        <i>
         Star Wars
        </i>
        fans who signed the petition, this was not deemed a priority in Obama's final term. The memorable response from the White House read:

        The Administration does not support blowing up planets. Why would we spend countless taxpayer dollars on a

       <p>
        Puns aside, one of the subliminal messages in the movies is clear—democracy cannot exist without an active and engaged citizenry. Becoming involved in politics and being engaged in debate is the core of what drives the best in Australia's political system. I hope everyone enjoys the return of the fabled classic and when John Williams' magnificent score opens to the famous
        <i>
         Star Wars

        scroll, I am sure old fans and new alike will be ready to join the battle between the good and dark sides of the force.

        On a more serious note, the Christmas season is a time to reflect on a year gone by and to give thanks to the opportunities the year presented, to learn from the challenges and to thank people who have helped make the year so dynamic. In this respect, I would like to sincerely thank all the people you do not visibly see every day yet are the heartbeat of this chamber. They include all Senate staff, catering, cleaning and security. Your work here is truly appreciated and it is always nice to have friendly faces going about their work on a busy sitting day.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many of us here will have the fortune to go home to loved ones this Christmas period and have great merriment watching children and grandchildren enjoy the essence of Christmas. My thoughts are also with those who are not so fortunate and to those who, for whatever reason, are having a difficult time this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to close by wishing all senators a merry and safe Christmas and, as the minister responsible for food policy, sensibly enjoy the turkey, seafood and pudding, and whatever other delights are offered. I would like to finish with a passage from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Dickens" rel="nofollow">
         Charles Dickens
        </a>

        which beautifully captures the message of Christmas.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when it has come round—apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and origin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that—as a good time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know of in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one consent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people below them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys.
