         Thank you, Senator Williams, for the question. The last quarter's report for the National Disability Insurance Scheme was released today, and it contains good news. There are now 17,300 participants in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
          NDIS
         </a>
         who have support plans in place, and $952 million has been committed to people with disability so that they can choose the services that are best for them. This represents 94 per cent of the bilateral agreements with the jurisdictions, which is up from 85 per cent since the last quarterly report. I can also report that the cost of average packages, excluding residents in large institutions, is $33,597. This is lower than the last quarterly average of $34,907 and remains below the expected full scheme average of $36,750, so the scheme is operating within its funding envelope. I can also advise colleagues that satisfaction levels amongst participants in the scheme are high—the experience of participants is good and the scheme is making a difference in the lives of individuals. And the good news is that those individuals are now at the centre and in control of the supports that they receive.

           I will take Senator Conroy's interjection, but I will change it a little, to say: isn't it good that there was bipartisan support for the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
            NDIS
           </a>

              Western Sydney
             </a>
             —from the start of next month. This is an agreement that was signed between the Abbott and the Baird governments, and it is the first step for the NDIS beyond the existing trial sites. Western Sydney, as colleagues know, has a high need when it comes to early intervention services for children with disability. I want to acknowledge the advocacy of the member for Macquarie,

             ; the member for Lindsay, Fiona Scott; and a senator for Western Sydney, Senator Payne, who is also a very strong and passionate advocate. The government has invested $20 million this financial year to make this a possibility and preparations are well underway. Local area coordinators are already in place and are working with families.

               is a major undertaking, and that at full scheme there will be about 460,000 participants. I am currently working with my state and territory counterparts to negotiate schedules of how each state and territory will transition from the existing trials to full scheme. This year's budget clearly demonstrated the government's commitment to the NDIS both now and into the future. You will recall that we announced $143 million to build a new

               system for the full scheme and that we are committing nearly $700 million to the NDIS this year. I look forward to continuing the work with my state and territory colleagues on the agreements for full scheme, and I also want to take the opportunity to acknowledge the good work of the parliamentary NDIS oversight committee, chaired by Mr Mal Brough, which is operating on a non-partisan basis.
