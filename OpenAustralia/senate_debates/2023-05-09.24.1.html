         AI
        </a>
        , or artificial intelligence, is becoming a big part of our lives, but it can also have some negative effects. Here are some reasons why AI can be bad. Firstly, job losses: AI can do tasks that people used to do, which might lead to people losing their jobs. As companies use artificial intelligence to save money and be more efficient, some workers may struggle to find new jobs. Secondly, the bias: AI learns from data, and, if that data has biases, the artificial intelligence system can become biased too. This can make problems like discrimination even worse and unfair to certain groups of people. Thirdly, privacy: artificial intelligence can be used to spy on people and invade their privacy. With facial recognition and data analysis, governments and businesses can track what we do, which can make us feel less free and safe. Fourthly, fake news and deepfakes: AI can create realistic but fake videos and images, known as deepfakes. These can be used to spread false information, harm reputations or cause trouble in society. Fifthly, loss of control: if AI becomes too powerful and smart, it will become hard for humans to control. This could lead to accidents or even danger if AI decides its goals are more important than the ones that human beings believe theirs to be.

        In summary, while artificial intelligence has many benefits, it can also cause problems like job loss, bias, privacy invasion, fake news and loss of control. We need to be aware of these issues and work together to make AI safe and helpful for everyone. This speech was 100 per cent written by artificial intelligence. Maybe the Prime Minister is onto something, but, maybe by reducing our advisers, he is looking for AI to run the country. Let me tell you this, Prime Minister: if you're getting rid of our advisers and expecting that, it's not long before you're on the chopping block.
