         These are the amendments, as I understand, that are actually Greens amendments that Senator Macdonald chose to bring upon himself to move on our behalf, because he considered that the debate was not moving fast enough. This debate was in fact about extremely important issues that both Senator Xenophon and Senator Ludlam were raising and asking the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis, about because he had not been answering the questions—very relevant and important questions—that the senators had been asking about the
         <i>
          Alert Digest
         </i>
         from the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. That committee had circulated the issues that they had raised with the Attorney-General through the process and the
         <i>
          Alert Digest
         </i>
         had highlighted many of those issues. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee raised a large number of issues about this bill.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is deeply concerning that Senator Macdonald took it on himself to move our amendments, when we were in the process of asking questions that go to the heart of this bill. It is extremely concerning. I just wanted to put on the record that we were deeply concerned that Senator Macdonald moved our amendments. I have made my contribution, and I encourage other people to engage in the debate.

          I thank Senator Siewert for her thoughtful contribution. One of the reasons that this debate has spilled over today is that the Attorney-General unnecessarily detained the chamber for well over an hour refusing to provide a document—effectively, his response to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, which raised 19 separate concerns. Having had the opportunity now to review some of the concerns that they raise, I might come back to some of those later in the debate.
         </p>
         <p>
          We have, as Senator Siewert indicated, moved to debate on the first substantive amendment, which is the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Greens
          </a>
          amendment relating to the definition of 'computer' and the fact that this bill mandates an extraordinary expansion to how the law henceforth will understand to be the definition of a computer by expanding it to include the definition of a network or networks.
         </p>
         <p>
          A couple of days ago, on 24 September, there was a piece by Ben Grubb in the
          <i>
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Morning_Herald" rel="nofollow">
            Sydney Morning Herald
           </a>
          </i>
          entitled 'Fears
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
           ASIO
          </a>
          to monitor entire internet' that noted the fact that the Senate had begun debating this legislation. The fear that the article describes is—as many witnesses and submitters to the joint committee noted—that this deliberate expansive definition of 'computer' means that, effectively, with one single warrant ASIO could spy on any device connected to the internet anywhere in the world. I find it remarkable that, under the weight of this evidence, the Labor Party considers that that is okay.
         </p>
         <p>
          Having, I guess, to my satisfaction found that this was not a drafting error and was in fact intentional, I put the question to Senator Brandis last night, and I think just before the debate adjourned, Senator Brandis confirmed to Senator Macdonald and to me that it is in fact the intention the Australian government that a single—

                  I had hoped that we could commence today's debate in a rather more parliamentary spirit than it was left off yesterday, but evidently that is not to be. What I will do is extend to Senator Brandis the opportunity to confirm for us—because I certainly have no wish to mislead this place or other senators or the public who are following this debate closely—the maximum number of devices that a warrant could capture under the government's drafting of this bill.

                      So, Senator Brandis, my understanding of the answer that you provided to Senator Macdonald and then myself is that there is actually no upper limit, that there is no maximum number of devices or no cap, I suppose—which is what the
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
                       Australian Greens
                      </a>
                      amendment goes to directly. I think it is extraordinary that the government would draft an amendment that the Labor Party would then support—without criticism, as far as I can tell—that sets no upper limit on the number of devices that a single
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
                       ASIO
                      </a>
                      warrant could catch. So, not just in theory but practically, a single warrant could be sought and received to capture a single mobile phone handset or a local area network or an entire university campus or an entire township. I think you can see where this is going. There is no upper limit on the number of devices.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Senator Brandis has obviously responded fairly heatedly. I may be in error in my interpretation of the answer he provided to us yesterday. I would be delighted if my understanding is in error, because what the Greens have proposed and what this amendment seeks to do is to impose an upper limit. I get the argument as to why ASIO thinks it is reasonable that they should not need to apply for a warrant for every single device. Under the circumstances in which we operate today, in a particular residence there might be a dozen handsets, laptops, desktop computers, tablets and goodness knows what. So, understanding the purpose behind ASIO not wanting to have to apply for a warrant for every single device, we nonetheless have extremely serious concerns. It is not the Greens alone who are concerned about this. Leaving it uncapped, leaving it at the discretion of either ASIO or the minister to allow as many devices as ASIO sees fit, is extraordinary. It requires amendment. I hope I have government, opposition and crossbench support for that.

                       I share the same concerns with respect to the open-ended nature of the bill as it is currently written. It is not just the Greens who are of the opinion that this could give access to the entire internet on a single warrant. I do too and so does the

                       . They have raised this issue with me. There does need to be some sort of constraint on the scope of warrants issued under this section. It just cannot be allowed to stand. It is a licence to snoop on anybody at any time, anywhere.

                        I have a question. Senator Brandis unkindly suggested I was trying to filibuster the debate yesterday. I can assure him that that is something I do not want to do. I want to ask a very short question that may hopefully truncate this debate. I understand the answer given by the Attorney, that there is no upper limit in terms of the number of devices that can be accessed through a warrant. Will the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security at least be able to ascertain how many devices are caught by such a warrant? In other words, with respect to a particular warrant, will we at least be able to ascertain how many devices that warrant relates to, even in broad terms—whether it is 100, 1,000 or one million? Can we establish that? Is that ascertainable? I will rephrase the question as succinctly as I can for the Attorney. Will this power provide some mechanism to establish how many devices have been caught by a particular warrant? Is that something that can be the subject of scrutiny by IGIS, for instance? It would assist me greatly if we could establish that.

                         Senator Xenophon, the answer to your first question is that the warrant must describe that which can be accessed pursuant to the terms of the warrant. So this is an exercise in description. It is good practice that any warrant describes with particularity that which it captures. The answer to your second question is, yes, the IGIS can.

                          have just plucked out of thin air; this is a profoundly important expansion of surveillance powers. I understand that the minister is taking advice at the moment. I am keen, perhaps for the benefit of those listening to this debate for whom these concepts might be somewhat new, to hear whether the minister could describe, as succinctly as he likes, what exactly

                          would be empowered to do under a computer access warrant. What does applying for such a warrant allow ASIO to do, however we end up defining a computer or network of networks?

                                   Very briefly, I can indicate that I will not support the Greens amendments for these reasons. I think that the concerns raised are legitimate. I think that, from an operational point of view, simply limiting it to no more than 20 devices is problematic. If it were a higher number I would be more sympathetic. The fact that IGIS can ascertain the number of devices that have been caught under a particular warrant gives me some comfort, although I would like to see in the longer term greater transparency with respect to this so that IGIS is in a position to say that so many devices have been caught by a particular warrants after the event. I cannot see how that would in any way, from a security point of view, compromise an operation, but I think it is important for Australians to know how devices may be caught under particular warrants. I think 20 is simply too low from an operational point of view.

                                    I thank Senator Xenophon for that contribution. I am obviously very open to counterproposals. If you thought 50 was appropriate, if the Attorney-General through 200 was appropriate, the principle that I am after here is that it not simply be uncapped.
