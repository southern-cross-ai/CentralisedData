        My question is to the minister representing the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
         Climate Change
        </a>
        and

         Energy Efficiency
        </a>
        , Senator Ludwig. I refer the minister to the government's policy backdowns in relation to developing Australia as a low-emissions economy, such as the dumping of the carbon floor price and negotiations failing under the Contract for Closure program. Given that the regional structural assistance package of $200 million was part of the government assistance to regional communities to offset the impact of the world's biggest carbon tax, can the minister advise whether the full $200 million will still be paid to local communities, whose economies are struggling to adjust since the implementation of the carbon tax?

          McKenzie

         for her continued interest in the carbon price, particularly as it impacts in rural Australia. What we do know is that there is a $1.7 billion Land Sector Package, which is designed to assist the farming community through both the

          CFI
         </a>
         and also then to deal with reduction in carbon.
        </p>
        <p>
         In fact I have had the opportunity of visiting many farmers across
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         and Victoria who come out to find out how they can participate in the Carbon Farming Initiative, how they can participate in the carbon market and how they can continue to access available grants—both Filling the Research Gap and Action on the Ground—and also the communication package. All of that is good news for the farming community—unlike the doormats for the Liberal Party; they do not want to assist farmers—because they are on the front line when it comes to climate change.

            's question also went to linkage. It is about the floor price. Why? Because it is important that we actually have a system where we have a fixed-price move to an emissions trading system that works. What is very important is that it is an odd position: what they are not advocating and not telling the rural community is that if the opposition's policy were to get up—heaven forbid!—if they were then not to follow through and if they were to trash the carbon price then the

            would be undermined. The Carbon Farming Initiative, which they pretend to support in rural and regional Australia, would be undermined. But they come down here and support the opposition in resisting and continuing to decry setting a price on carbon. Why? Because we do want to have a clean energy future, whereas what they do is undermine it. But they are not honest with their rural constituents—

              has asked is a supplementary question to another portfolio—to a completely different portfolio! Right out of the climate change portfolio; she has now leapt across into regional and rural Australia to Mr Crean's portfolio. I do not represent Mr Crean's portfolio.
