            I have some information in response to Senator Siewert’s question, but I do not have any specific knowledge of the last two elements. I can confirm that on 15 May this year, as Senator Siewert said in the preamble to her question, a report was released byGreenpeace on the alleged theft and sale on the black market of whale meat by crew members of Japan’s factory ship, the
            <i>
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nisshin_Maru" rel="nofollow">
              Nisshin Maru
             </a>
            </i>
            . The report called on Japanese prosecutors to investigate what was alleged corruption. There was a public report on 20 June that two Greenpeace activists—both Japanese citizens who were named by Senator Siewert in her question—had been arrested.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am certainly aware that the two Japanese Greenpeace employees have been charged by Japanese authorities with respect to the alleged theft of whale meat. My understanding is that the two activists who were charged were in fact released on bail on 11 July. I would stress that this is a domestic law enforcement matter for the Japanese government, as I am sure senators are aware, to be dealt with under Japanese domestic law and in accordance with what are longstanding protocols, about which, as I think it would be known to senators, it would not be appropriate for the Australian government to comment further.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am asked by Senator Siewert specifically whether the Prime Minister has raised this matter with his counterparts. I am not aware of that.

             If I

            can provide any information on that, I will. I am also asked by Senator Siewert if Australia has investigated whether there has been any breach of international law or

            </a>
            convention. I think this is very unlikely, given the protocols that exist in relation to the way these matters are dealt with. But if there is any further information on that matter I will certainly provide it to you.

             , I ask a supplementary question. The whale meat scandal has exposed widespread theft of whale meat by the Japanese whaling crew this year in Japan. I wonder whether the Australian government has obtained advice on whether these revelations are a breach of Japan’s so-called research whaling program, which is allowable under
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Whaling_Commission" rel="nofollow">

              I think the matters contained in at least the latter part of your question would not ordinarily be handled by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, although he might have knowledge of them. My colleague the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts has primary responsibility in relation to the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IWC" rel="nofollow">
               IWC
              </a>
              . I simply cannot provide any information to you today on this matter. I will seek any advice I can in this instance not only from the Minister for Foreign Affairs but also from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts on the element in your supplementary question about the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Whaling_Commission" rel="nofollow">
               International Whaling Commission
              </a>
              . For the reasons I have outlined before, I think it is unlikely there has been a breach but, if I can provide information to the senator, I certainly will.
