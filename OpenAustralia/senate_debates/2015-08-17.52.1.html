        My question is to the Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Senator Cash. I refer the minister to the subclass 457 visa program—much maligned by some in the Labor Party and indeed the union movement. Will the minister advise the Senate of any recent take-up in Australia's temporary skilled visa program?

         I think all Australians know that the union and the Labor Party have run for many, many years now a concerted campaign—and a malicious one—against foreign workers. You can imagine then Australians' disbelief when it was revealed that a number of trade unions have sponsored 457 workers to the tune of at least 41. In fact

          can respond. Senator Lines's union, United Voice, currently sponsors no less than nine subclass 457 visa workers in their offices. Of course then we have the

            Senators may find it hard to believe on this side but workplace relations adviser is the most commonly sponsored occupation by the union movement. One would think that there are clearly not enough qualified workplace relations advisers in Australia in the Senate and they cannot be sponsored by the trade unions.
           </p>
           <p>
            Hold on: we have another occupation—that of copywriter. Who can forget the most famous 457 employer—over to you, Senator Cameron; you know where this one is going?

              Statistics tell a very interesting story because, under the Abbott government, the number of primary subclass 457 visa holders in Australia as at 31 July 2015 was 101,970. That in fact represents a decrease of 7.5 per cent since the election of the Abbott government.
             </p>
             <p>
              Senator Cameron will be very interested to know, because I am sure he would defend this, that under his government the number of 457 visa holders grew from 60,000 primary visa holders at the beginning of 2010 to approximately 110,000 in September 2013 when Labor lost office. So the next time anyone on the other side comes into this place and says, 'There is an increase in foreign workers under this government', you are wrong!
