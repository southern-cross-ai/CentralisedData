         I thank Senator Back for what is a very important question in relation to Australia's long-term security, because for the Turnbull government Australia's safety and security is our first priority. In February this year the Prime Minister and I released the defence white paper, the Integrated Investment Program—which is fully costed and fully funded—and the Defence Industry Policy Statement, which together are Australia's comprehensive and long-term plan for our future national security.
        </p>
        <p>
         Not only are we investing in the key capabilities that we need across Navy, Army and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Air Force
         </a>
         to ensure that our Defence Force remains at the technological cutting edge; we are also investing in the key enablers that support these platforms. We are investing in the sort of critical infrastructure that allows the ADF to do its job—the bases, the wharves, the airfields, the information and communications technology, and the science and technology. Much of that investment will indeed occur in regional Australia, which will boost local economies and help create jobs.
        </p>
        <p>
         To deliver our long-term strategy to create a more capable, potent and agile Defence Force, the Turnbull government is also increasing defence spending to two per cent of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">

            I certainly can, because what we have done over the last 12 months is make capability decisions that will shape Australia's long-term security for decades to come. We have short-listed the designs for our nine future frigates and 12 offshore patrol vessels. We have selected Austal to build up to 21 Pacific patrol boats. And after years of nothing being done by the other side the Turnbull government has selected

            of France as our international design partner for the future submarine.
           </p>
           <p>
            All of these surface vessels and our submarines will be built in Australia, creating long-term certainty for our shipbuilding industry and those who work within it, in stark contrast to those opposite, who did not commission a single vessel from an Australian shipyard in six years. We have also invested in 1,100 Hawkei vehicles from Thales, which we built in Bendigo, and we have invested $1.2 billion in a new pilot training system for the

                Senator Cormann is right: it is a very good question, because this is the sort of capability investment that will keep the Defence Force at the cutting edge for decades to come. Our future submarine, for example, will continue in operation well into the second half of this century, which is why it is so important that we build a regionally superior submarine that meets our unique capability requirements of operation. Likewise, our future frigates—which will be the new workhorse of the Navy—will be optimised for antisubmarine warfare. They will be key capability, considering that we will within the next few decades have half of the world's submarines operating in our region.
               </p>
               <p>
                The Hawkei vehicles, the light protected mobility vehicles, will provide improved protection for our soldiers and will include highly advanced communication systems which are designed to ensure that our forces have much better vital awareness of the battle space. It is the Turnbull government that has over the last year ensured that we are trusted to deliver the
