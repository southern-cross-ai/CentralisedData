        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
         Climate Change
        </a>
        and Energy, Minister Wong. Minister, the government's own community engagement review of renewable energy projects surveyed 250 landowners and community members who live in close proximity to renewable energy infrastructure or transmission projects. The results of that survey are a shocking wake-up call: 92 per cent of respondents are dissatisfied with the engagement of project developers, and 85 per cent said their concerns were not addressed in a timely manner. Farmers like Ben Duxson, who's here in the gallery today from central Victoria, have travelled to Canberra to express their concerns about the farm-destroying projects like
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VNI" rel="nofollow">
         VNI
        </a>
        West being promoted by this government. Minister, why has the government not listened to people like Ben and adjusted its plans to install 22,000 solar panels a day and a wind turbine every 18 hours in response to the immense opposition to these projects in rural and regional Australia?

         I acknowledge those who attended the rally and those who are here today in the gallery. But I would say to you, Senator Canavan, that you and your party spent nearly a decade refusing to ensure that this country had the infrastructure which was required to transition to renewable energy—to clean energy. You did. You, Mr Joyce and others had 10 years to fix this up, and all that happened because of your opposition is that more generating capacity exited the system. It's quite a remarkable achievement. At a time when demand was increasing, you actually presided over less supply. I know that is hard.

          Point of order on relevance: my question went to the concerns of farmers. The minister spent almost half the answer speaking about the previous government, not those concerns that were revealed in her own government's report.

            With respect, I do think it's relevant that, in fact, the energy system in Australia was reducing in terms of the capacity which was required because there was insufficient investment in generation. That is a real fact, and it's an economic fact. Having said that, I understand that Minister Bowen stood up on Friday in regional
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

            </a>
            and released the final report of the Australian Energy Infrastructure Commissioner, Mr Dyer, on the Community Engagement Review. Commissioner Dyer and his team have undertaken fine work. They've engaged with communities from across Australia about their experiences of energy development. This review will help ensure local landholders and regional communities are heard and receive real benefits from the renewable energy transformation. We know that, for far too long—

              It is the case that community engagement around infrastructure hasn't been up to scratch and we do need to make the reforms necessary to improve community engagement.

                Minister, Mr Glen Kelly is also here in the gallery. He operates a fifth-generation family farm just outside of Rockhampton. He has travelled here with thousands of others to attend the rally this morning. Glen faces the destruction of his local environment due to the construction of 50 massive wind turbines that are three times the height of the

                flag and the destruction of koala and sugar glider habitats. Why isn't the government listening to people like Glen about the impacts of these industrial projects in rural communities?

                   Order! Senator Davey, I should not have to call you twice, nor you, Senator McKim. I asked for order across the chamber. I'm sorry, Senator McKim—I meant Senator Whish-Wilson. Order across the chamber!

                    What I would say to Mr Kelly and his friends and colleagues—and what I would say to you, Senator Canavan—is: I remind you that the system under which these complaints are being made is the system that was in place under your government.

                              That's fine. At least you're upfront about it. Unfortunately Mr Morrison and Mr Dutton took a different view in not being upfront about it. I will make a second point. Let me read this quote.
