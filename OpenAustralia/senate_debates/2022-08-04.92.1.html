        SHOEBRIDGE () (): My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Farrell. The Prime Minister has said that the government has been working behind the scenes and engaging in quiet diplomacy regarding the extradition of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange" rel="nofollow">
         Julian Assange
        </a>
        . But quiet diplomacy can't be no diplomacy. What exactly is the government doing to secure the release of this Australian citizen, journalist and whistleblower?

         I thank Senator Shoebridge for his question and congratulate him on his election. I think this might be your first question, and it's on a very important topic and that relates to Mr
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange" rel="nofollow">
          Julian Assange
         </a>
         . The Australian government have been clear in our view that Mr Assange's case has dragged on for too long and that it should now be brought to a close. This is the view that we continue to convey to the governments of both the United Kingdom and the United States, along with our expectations that Mr Assange is entitled to due process, humane and fair treatment, access to proper medical care and access to his legal team.
        </p>
        <p>
         But, as the Prime Minister has pointed out, not all foreign affairs is best conducted with a loudhailer or a megaphone, as we saw from the previous government. It's also worth noting that the extradition case is between the United States and the United Kingdom, a legal system that we respect. Australia, of course, is not a party to Mr Assange's case, and, as the legal operations still stand, our government, I'm advised, cannot intervene in the legal matters of another country, just as we wouldn't want those countries to intervene in our legal process. We will continue to monitor the case closely and we continue to seek assurances from the United Kingdom government about Mr Assange's welfare and his treatment.

           Mr Assange's family has been seeking a meeting with Prime Minister Albanese. In fact, they're here in the building, and I acknowledge his father, John Shipton, and brother, Gabriel, who are in the chamber just behind us. Why won't the Prime Minister meet with the family and hear directly their concerns, which challenge what you say: concerns about Mr Assange's health, his safety and his future? Why won't you meet?

                     Thank you, Senator Shoebridge. I believe the minister is being relevant. I will continue to listen carefully, and, if he is not relevant, I will point that out to him. Minister.

                      I have met Mr Shipton. It was a very moving meeting, and I personally can't think what it would be like to have one of my children incarcerated like Mr Assange has been incarcerated. As I've said before, we don't control the legal systems of other countries. We're offering all the support that we can for Mr Shipton's son under the consular arrangements, and the Prime Minister has said he wants an end to these proceedings. I don't think he can be clearer thanâ€”

                        The Prime Minister has previously said, 'Enough is enough,' and you've repeated it here today, Senator. The government has previously called for the

                        to bring the matter to a close. By bringing matters to a close, do you mean allowing Mr Assange extradited to the USA, charged and convicted, sentenced to over a century in jail, and then perhaps seeking a prison transfer?
