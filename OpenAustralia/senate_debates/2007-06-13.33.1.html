        , the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. The minister may be aware of reports that unions are apparently compiling secret databases on their members. Given the government’s responsibility for the administration of workplace laws, can the minister provide the Senate with any information on attempts to manipulate public opinion by misrepresenting the effect of those laws?

This is the way it works—and I encourage those opposite to hear this out in silence because if they do they will be condemning it. This is the way it works. Firstly, the ACTU engages an outside database company, Magenta Linus, to supply them with union members’ enrolment status, address and even mobile phone number. Remember, we are talking here about all union members in marginal seats, many of whom would have no real allegiance to the union—people such as 17-year-olds who unwittingly joined when they started part-time work, let’s say, at their local supermarket. The union then passes information to a call centre which telephones the member and solicits even more information, such as their political allegiance, their voting intention at the coming election and their attitude to our
