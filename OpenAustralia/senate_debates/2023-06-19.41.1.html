        Today was a historic day, with the passing of the legislation that will enable a referendum on a voice to parliament. Like many Australians, this will be the very first referendum that I get to vote in, and I can't wait to vote 'yes'. The referendum will invite Australians to make a change to our Constitutionâ€”our nation's birth certificate; the document that lays out our collective intentions for the country that we are and the country that we hope to be.
       </p>
       <p>
        This referendum is about two things: recognition and listening. The legislation that we passed today is an opportunity for non-

        to meaningfully respond to the Uluru Statement from the Heart. The late Yunupingu described recognition as a gift not to Indigenous Australians but from them. The Uluru Statement, given by 250

        I personally come to this debate inspired by the stories of Aboriginal and

        Islander communities in regional Queensland. During my very first speech in this place I spoke of Aunty Ruth and Uncle Alf and all of the Yarrabah community who led a critical campaign on the path to a successful 1967 referendum. Tomorrow, the community of

        will meet to acknowledge the passing of Uncle Alfred Neal. I will have more to more to say about this, but I want to acknowledge his enormous contribution and the long path he has worn from 1967 to now. I also want to acknowledge all of the activists and leaders from the Torres Strait who have led us to this moment. I want to particularly acknowledge Mayor Mosby's work. He wore this around his neck as the
