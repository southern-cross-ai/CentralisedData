        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Birmingham. I refer to the answer the minister for urban infrastructure gave in the House yesterday about the commuter car park fund. Yesterday the minister claimed decisions were based on departmental advice, yet the Auditor-General found that not one of the 47 car parks was recommended by the department. Today Mr Morrison refused on nine occasions to say what involvement he had in deciding the car parks in target seats. At any point did Mr Morrison or his office see the list of top 20 marginal seats used to distribute funds?

         These are valuable projects for communities around Australia that the senator is asking questions about. They will provide benefits to people in a range of different communities. As is well known, they were the subject of an

           Evidence on the public record makes clear the Prime Minister's office was directly involved in deciding grants under the Community Sport Infrastructure Grants Program, revising projects on the infamous colour coded spreadsheet. Can the minister outline the role the Prime Minister's office played in funding car parks for political gain?

               It's on direct relevance. The Prime Minister was asked this nine times and did not answer. This minister did not answer. We are asking in this chamber what role the Prime Minister or his office played in funding these car parks.

                On the point of order, the minister was in order until, I think, he strayed upon alternative programs, because I believe to be directly relevant one needs to be relevant to the multiple programs that were mentioned in the question.

                 The question goes to rank hypocrisy, too, in terms of the approach of those opposite. The Prime Minister certainly played no greater role than I suspect the member for Maribyrnong did in announcing 24 such projects.

                   Today Mr Morrison claimed Australians had voted for his commuter car park fund, despite the majority of grants being approved before the election was called. This minister echoed those views recently on
                   <i>
                    Insiders
                   </i>
                   . Does this minister really expect Australians to accept the Morrison government using taxpayer money as Liberal Party money on the basis that rorts are okay if you're re-elected?

                    It seems it's okay for those on that side to throw mud about something this side of politics does in relation to funding community infrastructure and they'll call it that name. But when they were doing exactly the same thing in the lead-up to the last election it was valuable community infrastructure. It was okay for them to run around the country announcing car parks in different locations, but it's not okay for the coalition to do it!

                       I ask you to resume your seat, Senator Wong. A critique of the content of an answer and whether someone asserts it is an answer or otherwise is not a matter for here. That goes to the content of an answer. Points of order are for direct relevance. I genuinely could not hear a word of Senator Birmingham's quite loud voice, as I was constantly calling senators to order. Senator Birmingham, continue.

                           I take that point, Senator Wong, and I ruled on that point earlier. But, as I've previously ruled too, when the minister made a comment about the opposition at that point, while answering a question about his own comments that contains politically charged phrasesâ€”I think an answer of that nature is not out of order. I have consistently ruled very tightly when questions are tight, factual questions, as I did earlier this week. This was not one of those, and the minister is entitled to defend his own record and statements in a manner he sees fit when they're contained in the question.
