         I thank Senator Fifield for the question. I suspect it is probably better directed to the Manager of Government Business, Senator Ludwig, in terms of the detail, as he manages the program and seeks, as I understand it, to work very cooperatively with you, Senator Fifield, in your new role as Manager of Opposition Business. But the legislative agenda is reflected in the red. I see today the orders of the day are the social security bill, the Australian National Preventive Health Agency Bill and the national health amendment bill, and we obviously have the ongoing debate on the Governor-General’s opening speech. So,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
          Mr President
         </a>
         , I am not sure what Senator Fifield’s point is. No doubt, there is a cunning plan that will be revealed in the supplementary questions—the usual cunning plans! But, Senator, as you understand, legislation that is passed in the House of Representatives is then forwarded to the Senate for consideration. There are a number of bills that they are considering at the moment that we hope to get to the Senate and through the Senate in the next couple of weeks. There is an important piece of legislation for my portfolio, to do with student services, which will come into the House of Representatives, hopefully, in the next day or so.

             Well, I am just acknowledging that that is something that we achieved today, with the support of the opposition. So there is a full legislative agenda that will come before the parliament over the next couple of weeks, and we look forward to the cooperation of the opposition in ensuring that work is completed.

              could take such a casual interest in the agenda of the parliament and his government, but I do thank him for again confirming that the opposition to

                   On yesterday’s evidence, I thought the opposition had lost the will to live or had already packed up and gone on Christmas holidays. Far from it being the government that has lost energy and direction, I think it is the opposition that ought to look at its performance. We are absolutely committed to finalising the legislative agenda we have in the remaining two weeks of parliament.

                     The bills are all on the agenda. There are some very important pieces of legislation. The government yesterday scheduled, I think, two or three bills, which were passed by the Senate.

                      , I ask a further supplementary question. Is it not a fact that it costs around $1 million a day to run the Senate, and is this not further evidence of the government’s mismanagement and lack of leadership?

                        The suggestion seems to be that Senator Fifield is too tired to turn up and he would rather save the taxpayers the money it costs for him to attend parliament. What a ridiculous assertion.

                                . I welcome the opportunity to continue. The assertion that, somehow, parliament should not sit because the opposition is tired and is perhaps losing its will to live is quite ridiculous. There is legislation on the agenda for the parliament which has been provided to the opposition in advance. We are dealing with that quite adequately, as I understand it—with reasonable speed. I appreciate that from the opposition. We have a large number of bills we would like to bring back in if we could get some cooperation on them.
