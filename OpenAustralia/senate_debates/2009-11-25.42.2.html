        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Murdoch" rel="nofollow">

        during an interview with

        that if the government’s $43 billion

        is to be sold off to private investors as promised then the government will have to ‘be prepared to write off half the cost openly upfront so that investors buying it could have a chance of a return’? Is the government prepared to write off taxpayers’ billions upfront in order to attract future buyers? If not, isn’t it possible that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">

        will never be privatised or will have to be sold off by a future government at a fire sale price in order to rid itself of a debt laden white elephant?

         I thank Senator Macdonald for his question. I note that, despite the resignation of three fellow frontbenchers when they crossed the floor, you were not among them. We will see what develops in the afternoon, Senator Macdonald. The answer is yes, I am familiar with Mr Murdoch’s comments, but the Rudd Labor government believes that all Australians, including large and small businesses, no matter where they live or are located, deserve to have access to high-speed broadband. I note the recent comments by a whole range of commentators, including Mr Murdoch, about the demands, commercial viability and the importance of wireless technology into the future. What I want to reinforce is that the discussions, firstly with Telstra, continue to be constructive. We are working to deliver on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network" rel="nofollow">
          National Broadband Network
         </a>
         , notwithstanding those opposite who have sought to frustrate and block and have locked themselves into a 1990s or 2000 position.
        </p>
        <p>
         I remember one of the great, proud chants from those opposite when they were in government was that during that period of incredible microeconomic reform by the Hawke and Keating governments they said, ‘We stood shoulder to shoulder with the Hawke and Keating governments in voting for all of those tough economic reforms.’ The tragedy now is that you are not going to be able to say that some day in the distant future when you are in government, because you have sought to block the reform package that we have put forward in this sector. You will not be able to make that proud claim that you have made in the past because you have become Luddites; you have spurned your economic reformist credentials.

             fully supports the Australian government’s initiative to improve the availability of fast broadband services across Australia and considers that the proposed wholesale only approach will benefit consumers as it represents a significant improvement from the current market structure where Telstra, the incumbent, is both dominant and highly vertically and horizontally integrated.

                   I am fully aware of his comments. These mistakes have led to very serious implications for the development of competition in the telco industry. This was his company’s submission in June 2009, a few months ago.
