        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Health, Senator Colbeck. The Prime Minister has announced that Australia will enter its next phase out of the pandemic when 70 per cent of the adult population is vaccinated. On what date will this target be reached?

         [by video link] The government deliberately has not established a date for that to occur because that particular matter is in the hands of Australians. But what we will do is continue to encourage Australians to come out and get vaccinated. We will also continue to increase the number of avenues through which they can access a vaccination. As we have had access to more vaccine we have increased the number of avenues for Australians to get vaccinated—whether it be through the state clinics that we were operating, where we're supporting the states by provision of vaccines; whether it's through the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
          GP
         </a>
         respiratory clinics that are now providing vaccinations services; whether it is through the GPs, who are doing a magnificent job of providing vaccines for Australians; or by growing the number of access points across the country through pharmacies. We will continue to provide access to Australians to the vaccine and we will continue to increase the number of outlets available as we continue to grow the supply. We deliberately haven't put a date on that. We want Australians to come out and get vaccinated as soon as possible. The point of setting the targets, using the advice of the Doherty institute, is so that Australians understand the thresholds that are required for them to enjoy more freedoms and for the country to continue to work its way through this pandemic. It is not the right thing for us to attempt to set a date for this, but we will continue to do everything we can to encourage Australians to access a vaccine.

           Don't the 10 million people who are now in lockdown across Sydney and South-East Queensland, who have been let down by Mr Morrison's broken promises, deserve to know when this target will be reached? Isn't being upfront with 10 million Australians in lockdown the Australian way?

            [by video link] I don't at all accept the characterisation that has been placed on this matter by Senator Watt. Australians all understand the importance of beating this pandemic, of beating this virus, but they also understand that they have a choice to come out and get vaccinated. What we will continue to do is to encourage them to do so by providing them with good advice with respect to the vaccines. What we'll also continue to do is to increase the number of points that are available to them to access the vaccine. The important thing is to ensure that Australians understand the targets that are there to allow us more freedoms under the transition plan that's been announced, which has been worked on very co-operatively through national cabinet, and to provide opportunity for Australians to both access and—

              The Morrison government's own COVID response plan includes measures 'encouraging uptake through incentives'. Why is the Morrison government prepared to publicly consider discounts and frequent flyer points, when it has ruled out any other direct financial incentives?

                 We will continue to encourage Australians to come forward and take a vaccine. Part of the reason that we set out the four-point plan was so that Australians understood what the thresholds were to enjoy more freedoms. We will continue to support them by providing greater access to vaccines through both supply and access points, because we know that all Australians understand the importance of getting a vaccine so that we can all enjoy more freedoms and get out of this pandemic.
