          Mr Deputy President, I seek leave to make a brief statement.
         </p>

          Leave granted.
         </p>
         <p>
          Today is the day the Greens have joined Labor's mining tax cover-up. Today is the day the Greens have put themselves right in front of Treasurer Swan and have protected him from releasing information which the Senate has insisted for the last 18 months needed to be provided so the Senate would be in a position to properly scrutinise the credibility of the mining tax revenue estimates and to properly scrutinise the credibility of the costings of all of the promises Labor has attached to the mining tax.
         </p>
         <p>
          The government, of course, continues to refuse to release of the mining tax revenue assumptions. Why is that, Mr Deputy President? The reason for that is that the government clearly has something to hide.

            Thank you, Mr Deputy President. I will continue with my statement. The government clearly know that their mining tax revenue assumptions are dodgy. They clearly know that if their mining tax revenue assumptions were publicly released then they would not stand up to scrutiny. This is, of course, why the government continue to persist with their refusal to release that information.
           </p>
           <p>
            I remind the Senate in my brief statement of what the Greens said in relation to this about six months ago. Senator
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Brown" rel="nofollow">
             Bob Brown
            </a>
            was quoted as saying that the lack of infor­mation on the mining tax was increasingly unsatisfactory and:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            The time is coming where the Senate is going to have to flex its muscle. If the information is really commercial in-confidence, the Senate committee could meet in-camera, but what the Treasury is in fact saying is that bureaucrats are allowed to have crucial information but parliamentarians, who are being asked to vote on the relevant laws, are not. It is illogical and unacceptable.
