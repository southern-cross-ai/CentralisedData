        My question is directed to Senator Abetz, the Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation. Would the minister outline to senators how the Howard government is supporting and helping to grow Tasmania’s new, renewable and sustainable Tasmanian timber industry? Is the minister aware of any alternative policies?

         I thank Senator Watson for his question and note that he, along with all his Tasmanian Liberal Senate colleagues, and indeed Messrs Baker and Ferguson, the members for Braddon and Bass in the other place, is a very strong supporter of the Tasmanian forest industry, as was witnessed by the presence of all of us at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Hall" rel="nofollow">
          Albert Hall
         </a>
         in Launceston just before the last federal election. At that time, the Prime Minister announced very clearly our policy in relation to the forest industry. It was one based on balance, security for the industry and also providing extra investment. That position was, in fact, clearly enunciated by the motion which Senator Watson moved in this place yesterday and which, might I add, was passed yesterday.
        </p>
        <p>
         The sad thing to note is that it was only senators on this side of the chamber who supported this pro-forestry, pro-Tasmanian motion. It was only the Howard government that was committed to supporting the 10,000-plus timber industry workers in Tasmania. We all remember Labor’s job-destroying, anti-Tasmanian attempt to grab Green preferences which they took to the last election. It backfired on them very badly, as it should have.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since then, Labor has been trying to tell the Australian people that they have dumped the folly of Mr Latham’s policy—but the ghost of Latham still haunts the Labor Party. I do not know why he did it but yesterday Senator Watson very kindly gave the Labor Party the opportunity to shed the ghost of Latham and vote for our motion, but Labor not only failed to support our motion but deliberately voted against it.

         Last night the former failed member and now recycled Labor candidate for Braddon came out in the media and said Labor ‘stuffed up’.

           He did, and he was quoted in the
           <i>
            Australian
           </i>
           newspaper. Mr Adams, the Labor member for Lyons, said the Labor senators were asleep. We had the third excuse delivered by none other than Senator Kerry O’Brien on ABC radio this morning, saying it was a deliberate tactic. That was very smart. And look—he is nodding in agreement. I invite the Labor Party members from Tasmania to caucus and decide whether it was a stuff-up, whether they were asleep or whether in fact it was a deliberate tactic. The people of Tasmania have now seen why the Labor Party took its silly policy to the Tasmanian and Australian people at the last election. It was because they have no idea what they are doing on forestry. Mr Albanese’s and Mr Martin Ferguson’s views on forestry are diametrically opposed. That is why the Labor Party are flip-flopping over forestry.
          </p>
          <p>
           We on this side are absolutely clear. Our statement announced at

            Albert Hall
           </a>
           remains very strong; we are committed to it.

           , I am told that the electorate that you and I reside in may well have a by-election shortly. If that is the case, I say to the timber rich area of Franklin that they should vote for us for one simple reason, because we are the only party truly committed to the timber communities and to the timber workers of this country.
