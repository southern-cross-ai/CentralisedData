        This is not my first speech but it is my first question! My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Gallagher. Can the minister outline the findings of the Productivity Commission's inquiry

         5-year productivity inquiry
        </i>
        <i>
         : key to prosperity

         The report out today paints a dismal picture of recent productivity growth. Over the last decade growth has been the slowest than more than a century.

           Yes—no surprises there. Gross national income was $4,600 lower per person than what it could have been if productivity growth was in line with the long-term average. This is important because 80 per cent of income growth in the past three decades has come from productivity gains. We should not be surprised, sadly, that the past decade we've seen with real wages is largely due to the poor decade we've also had on productivity.
          </p>
          <p>
           The report said very clearly:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Almost all sustained increases in real wages are underpinned by improvements in labour productivity growth.
          </p>
          <p>
           Being more productive means Australians can consume higher-quality, and access new, goods and services.
          </p>
          <p>
           Getting productivity moving again is a huge challenge that has been neglected under those opposite. It's a challenge that we take seriously, which is why Labor's economic plan is so important. Investment into the productive side of the economy, the productivity agenda, is at the heart of our economic plan—childcare reforms, skills and advanced manufacturing, and, of course, the opportunities that are going to come in the energy sector. The report is yet another scathing assessment of the former government's failure to drive reform or grab the opportunities for jobs and growth they should have, and Australians have paid an enormous price for that.

               countries have experienced a productivity slowdown. However, we know that the productivity challenges we face have been made worse by a decade of wasted opportunities and wrong priorities by those opposite. And there is no starker example of this than the coalition's wasted decade on energy. Their 22 different energy policies over their term in government have seen the opportunities for investment, innovation and jobs go begging. We paid the price for that. This really was the Morrison government—a government that spent more, borrowed more and delivered less, including in the productivity agenda, which has been outlined in the public release today.
