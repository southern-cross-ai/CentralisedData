          And now the minister has the briefing note in front of him! Given that the Prime Minister has now told the Australian people that there will be no tax on super payments for the over-60s under a government she leads, can the minister also rule out increased Labor taxes on super savings through even further reduced concessional contribution caps or higher taxes on super earnings?

           , that those opposite, and Senator Cormann, will not give the same commitment. It is just amazing that those opposite are asking a question on superannuation, when the Leader of the Opposition has personally committed to increasing taxes on 3.6 million Australian low-paid workers. It is just outrageous. But it is even more extraordinary when those opposite have form on this issue. When it comes to superannuation and the whole principles that underpin our superannuation system—

            , I rise on a point of order in relation to the requirement for the minister to be directly relevant to the question. He is giving a speech on his perspective on coalition policy. I asked him a question about whether or not the government could rule out increases in super taxes on super earnings and further reductions in concessional contribution caps. It was a very specific question. I did not ask him any questions about coalition policies; I asked him a question about government policy and whether, given the Prime Minister's statements yesterday where she was able to rule out certain taxes, he can rule out further taxes.

              It was a very broad-ranging question and the point of order was probably the longest on record. But,
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
               Mr President
              </a>
              , when it comes to taxes on superannuation and when it comes to ruling things in or out, what I can rule out categorically is that this government will not tax 3.6 million Australian low-paid workers like those opposite are planning to do.

                Again what we have here is an attempt to play 'let's rule something in or rule something out'. I will tell you what: I think 3.6 million Australian low-paid workers earning below $37,000 a year are low-paid workers. I think workers who earn $37,000 a year are low paid. That is what I think. I cannot possibly understand an opposition that wants to increase tax on workers earning less than $37,000 a year.

                    , I ask a further supplementary question. Given the changes the Gillard government has made in recent budgets in increasing taxes on super savings, what is the rate of tax paid by an Australian taxpayer contributing more than $25,000 a year in pre-tax income through their superannuation?

I asked the minister about the tax rate paid by Australian taxpayers contributing more than $25,000 to their superannuation each year. The only answer that can be directly relevant to that question is a number. How much is it?
