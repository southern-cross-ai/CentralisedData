        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Minister Wong. The Albanese government has worked over the last two years to bring

         Thank you, Senator Ghosh. Senator Ghosh, as a very credentialled lawyer, could probably explain much more clearly than I the details of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
          US
         </a>
         legal system, but I will do my best. What I would say is that Mr Assange's case has dragged on for too long and he should return home to Australia. That has been the position I have articulated in this chamber and publicly and that the Prime Minister has articulated very clearly publicly. I am pleased to say that earlier today a plea arrangement between Mr Assange and the United States Department of Justice was finalised in Saipan. It ends a long-running judicial process in the United Kingdom, and Mr Assange is now on his way home to Australia and his family.
        </p>
        <p>
         These are obviously welcome developments, but this is not something that has happened just in the last 24 hours. It has taken a careful, patient and determined approach. It has been complex work and it has been considered work. The Prime Minister, the Attorney-General and I have consistently advocated for Mr Assange's case to be brought to a conclusion. Earlier today, Mr Assange's lawyer, Ms Jennifer Robinson, remarked on the Prime Minister's role in this, thanking him for his statesmanship, his principled leadership and his diplomacy, which made this outcome possible.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Prime Minister was foremost in Australia's efforts. He was ably supported by Australian officials, including by our ambassador to the United States, Mr Rudd, and by our high commissioner to the United Kingdom, Mr Stephen Smith, who have worked over many months to make today's outcome possible. I publicly express our appreciation to the United States and to the United Kingdom for their efforts to find a pathway that met the interests of all parties. We will continue to provide consular assistance to Mr Assange, and I want to recognise the efforts of

         and other government officials who have worked with Mr Assange and his legal team to ensure his smooth return to Australia this evening.

            Thank you, Senator Ghosh. For the last two years, the Australian government has engaged in careful, patient and determined efforts to achieve this outcome. We have used all appropriate channels to support this outcome. As I said, the Prime Minister has led these efforts and has personally raised Mr Assange's case with both President Biden and Prime Minister Sunak, and we acknowledge their engagement on this.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have been consistent and clear in this place that resolution would only be possible after legal processes had concluded. In fact, on a number of occasions—I note that Senator Shoebridge has left the chamber—when Senator Shoebridge was accusing me of not doing enough on this case, I made the point to him and to others in the Greens about how these matters had been resolved in a comparable case, as was the case here again. Obviously, we have approached this issue calmly and consistently.

               When it comes to securing good outcomes for Australians who find themselves in difficult legal circumstances or detained overseas, the approach we have taken is to pursue outcomes. We haven't taken the approach of seeking headlines or shouting from the rooftops. I know that there are some who seek to do that. We have taken the view that persistent diplomacy is the way we secure good outcomes.

               , Sean Turnell, Chau Van Kham and Ken Elliott have all returned to Australia in the past two years. I pay respect to former foreign minister Payne, who also engaged in persistent diplomacy on this. We use the appropriate tools of diplomacy and statecraft, and we know there is more to do. Australia will continue to support our compatriots who are detained overseas. Again, I recognise the good work that
