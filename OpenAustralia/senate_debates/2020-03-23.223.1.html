         I thought that a Labor member might request the call, but, regardless, I would just make a couple of observations about this and flag with you, President, that I will be asking that part (a) be put separately from parts (b), (c) and (d). That will be a request that I will be making of you. We don't believe it is appropriate to suspend effective until 11 August. There are other ways around this and we think that a suspension of effectively six months of the parliament is simply not warranted and justified under the current circumstances. Labor were very strong on this in the House of Representatives and in fact opposed this policy of the government, and Labor can speak for itself in this place, but the Greens, as we did in the other place, will be voting against this provision. We believe that the Senate timetable as previously agreed should be maintained and there are mechanisms available if sittings need to be postponed. That deals with clause (a).
        </p>
        <p>
         I also flag with you, President, that we will be moving amendments to parts (b) and (c) which insert in each part, after the words '
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition_in_the_Senate" rel="nofollow">
          Leader of the Opposition in the Senate
         </a>
         ', 'and the Leader of the Greens in the Senate'. We are the third party in this place. We are recognised as a party—that is, we have party status, recognised by the parliament—and we believe that our leader in the Senate, Senator Waters, ought to be involved in any discussions or mechanisms covered in part (b) and part (c) of this motion.

          I will put clause (a) first, then I will ask you to move your amendments to clauses (b) and (c), which are fairly simple. The question is that clause (a) of the motion moved by Senator Cormann be agreed to.

           I simply make the same request you have had made of you previously. I just note that Labor supported the government's position on this and that it was opposed by the Greens.

                 <p>
                  I will make a very brief statement before I call you for the last motion, Senator Cormann. As we depart and focus on our families, communities, fellow citizens and I'd say also our staff over the coming months, can I also ask us to consider one another because this is a particularly collegial place where many senators spend a great deal of time with one another working through some very contentious and difficult issues that don't often get public attention but do serve the public interest. That won't be happening for the foreseeable future. I would just ask that we all consider each other and particularly those who are subject to testing, self-isolation or, indeed, recovery from this particular illness over the coming months. I would particularly like to thank all senators, and particularly the staff of the Senate, for their cooperation in achieving the results we have today.
