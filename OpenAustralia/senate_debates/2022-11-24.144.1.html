        , Senator Watt. The Victorian Parliamentary Budget Office says the Suburban Rail Loop would cost $36.5 billion for stage 1 and $125 billion for the full project. At Senate estimates on 28 October infrastructure department officials gave evidence the funding available for the Suburban Rail Loop included:

        $11 billion from the state; $11 billion through some kind of value capture … and $2.2 billion from the Commonwealth.

       <p>
        The announced funding adds up to only $25 billion. In the

           I don't think that's a point of order, Senator Ayres! I might have misheard, but it seemed to me the question does not go to a ministerial portfolio. A question about the state government's sources of advice and how the state government came to a position is not a matter for a Commonwealth minister.

            On the point of order: Senator Van directly quoted evidence from departmental officials at Senate estimates. The question goes to assurances given to the Commonwealth. This is a government that has decided to give $2.2 billion to a project.

                We may need Senator Smith to run his eye over some of those questions to make sure they comply with standing orders, something that we know he takes very seriously. The Suburban Rail Loop is a once-in-a-generation infrastructure project. We're doing something that the former government never chose to do, which is to honour election commitments. Remember that funny, old tradition of honouring your election commitments? I know that it didn't happen under you mob, but we actually take these things seriously. We went to the people with an election commitment to spend—

                  We went to the election with a very clear commitment to spend $2.2 billion towards early works for the Suburban Rail Loop East. That was on the back of the fact that the Victorian government had prepared a detailed business and investment case for the Suburban Rail Loop, which was released last year and demonstrated a cost-benefit ratio of up to 1.7, meaning—

                       I know that the opposition chooses to ignore this, but we have repeatedly made the point that the business case provided by the Victorian government demonstrates a benefit cost ratio of up to 1.7, which means that $1.70 would be returned for every $1 invested.

                      <p>
                       It's interesting that the opposition is so hung up on projects, involvement with state governments and things like that, because it wasn't that long ago that former Prime Minister Turnbull—someone I know they all choose to forget and pretend was never a member of their party—announced that the Commonwealth would commit $5 billion to the

                       , which the Queensland government described as a bit of a surprise, and the money appeared plucked out of the sky. Again, if we're seriously going to be relying on the Liberal and National parties to lecture people about the appropriate spending of public money, we're going to have to be waiting a fair while.

                                         Here's a business case that's been provided by the Liberal Party and the National Party. I don't think it can be a prop, because it's a blank piece of paper. I'm not sure that that constitutes a prop. That's the extent of the business cases that we used to see from the Liberal and the National parties when it came to investing in projects. In contrast, the Victorian government has put forward a business case, which demonstrates this is a good project, and we have every intention of getting behind it.

                                            Senator Van knows full well, and I have already said, that our government has committed $2.2 billion towards this project. We know that the Victorian government has committed funding of its own. We know that this is a project that will take some time to complete. You know why it will take some time to complete? It's because the former government didn't want to invest in public transport infrastructure. So now we're getting on with the job of actually investing in this. It will take until 2035 to complete the project, and that will require future budget decisions.
