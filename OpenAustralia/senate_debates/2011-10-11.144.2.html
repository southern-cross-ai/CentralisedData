        I rise tonight to speak about a man who has spent the best part of his life representing the people of Launceston and surrounding areas in my home state of Tasmania. I feel honoured to call Ray Shipp a friend and I feel it is only appropriate that I say a few words about his 27 years in public office. A local boy, he grew up in Launceston where he and his father, Bill, built their driving school. Ray worked in the driver education business in Launceston, teaching new Australians and young people of Tasmania road safety and the correct attitude and responsibilities when driving. Ray spent many of the following years giving driving tips and road safety advice on local television and radio.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ray was a member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislative_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Legislative Council
        </a>
        for the seat of Launceston from 1968 to 1982. He then stood successfully for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launceston_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Launceston City Council
        </a>
        in 1985. He was re-elected at each election thereafter. Ray also held the position of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Mayor" rel="nofollow">
         Deputy Mayor
        </a>
        from 1994 to 1999. Ray's dedication to his council responsibilities has been unwavering. I cannot overemphasise or overstate the contribution Ray has made to our community. I also need to mention his wife, Gail. I know she has been Ray's biggest supporter over the years and I would like to place on the public record my thanks—and I am sure I speak on behalf of our local community in thanking her—for her wonderful support to allow Ray to make the contribution he has over so many years.
       </p>
       <p>
        It could be said that Ray is of the old school. He was and is a true gentleman. He has always been first and foremost a listener. Then, when he needed to make a contribution, it was always well thought out and relevant to the conversation, debate or discussion that he was participating in. His long career added to these discussions, as he has an example or story for almost every situation. His life experience enabled him to contribute and participate in the Launceston community with knowledge and experience like no other. He would often tell stories of his days teaching young people how to drive. He has seen many changes in legislation, both in local government and in his years as a legislative councillor. His council committee involvements include the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Planning" rel="nofollow">
         Strategic Planning
        </a>
        and Policy Committee, the Tender Review Committee, the Code of Conduct Panel and the Launceston Access Advisory Committee. Ray was also chairman of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/York_Park" rel="nofollow">
         York Park
        </a>
        committee at the time of the sporting precinct's first major development in the late 1990s. He also played an important role on a Legislative Council select committee to investigate all aspects of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamar_River" rel="nofollow">
         Tamar River
        </a>
        , which is a local icon in the city of Launceston.
       </p>
       <p>
        Martin Gilmour, the Editor of our local newspaper the
        <i>
         Examiner
        </i>
        , said recently:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The decision by Alderman Ray Shipp not to recontest his seat on the Launceston City Council marks the end of an era.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To spend more than 20 years on the council, in addition to 14 years as an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLC" rel="nofollow">
         MLC
        </a>
        for Launceston, is an extraordinary commitment to civic duty by any measure.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Many people regard Alderman Shipp as the council's unofficial historian and there is no doubt that this corporate knowledge has served the city well.
       </p>
       <p>
        I could not agree more with these comments.
       </p>
       <p>
        True to form, Ray's decision not to contest the next election was not based on any selfish motives, nor is he in ill health. Ray has decided to make way for someone new because he has, and always has had, the best interests of the people of Launceston at heart. Ray said it had occurred to him that if he was successful this election, the next time he was faced with the decision to stand or not, he would be almost 90 years of age. He said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I thought it was probably time to make way for another person from Launceston who may have their eyes on a council career.
       </p>
       <p>
        I truly believe that the elder individuals in our society, such as Ray, still have so much to offer the community. Their presence in the workforce is highly valued. Ray sets an example of how older Australians can continue to contribute to their communities well into their 70s and 80s. It is a well-known fact that we are now living about 25 years longer. The community benefits from retaining the older and more experienced individuals in the workforce but I also believe these individuals gain a great deal of purpose and satisfaction from contributing to society in an active way. It is no longer necessary to retire at 65 and wonder what to do for the next 20 years of life. Like Ray, we can continue to take an interest in our community and contribute for many years.
       </p>
       <p>
        You may be wondering why I have chosen to stand here tonight and speak about a local council alderman. I believe Ray Shipp is a shining example to all of us. Ray is a man who has devoted his life to the betterment of his city and surrounding area. He has given his time to the community and he has been a voice on important issues for the people of Launceston. In my opinion, Ray is a man who reminds us all that we are here for a very important purpose. We are all representatives. We are here to be the voice for the voiceless, to stand up for the marginalised and to always ensure that the best outcomes are achieved for our country and communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I said, Ray has made an outstanding contribution to our local community. He was never politically aligned during his time as a legislative councillor. He was an Independent—a true independent. In later years he joined the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Labor Party
        </a>
        but when he was first elected to the Launceston City Council, once again he stood as an Independent. For me, it has been an honour to know Ray, particularly so over the last decade on a more personal basis. He has always been a good supporter, someone who is prepared to talk quite frankly to you, to put his point of view. But always at the forefront of his mind and his argument was what was best for our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Those genuine gentlemen are not always as obvious in our community as I think they ought to be. He was renowned, as I said, for speaking up for our community, for being there, for being a very good listener, being able to contribute to the debate but to bring a common sense point of view to whatever debate he was participating in. I wish Ray every best wish for his retirement from the Launceston City Council. He may believe that he is 'retiring' and is not going to have a public life in future but I think he will find it very hard to totally retire. He has certainly earned his stripes and the community's respect. I hope he has many more years ahead to enjoy his children and grandchildren and takes the opportunity to spend time with Gale and to reward her with his presence and his undivided attention as he has been able to have her support in enabling him to make a contribution to public life.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of my colleagues said, 'Has something happened to Ray?' I said, 'No, I am making a contribution and acknowledging his contribution to our community. I can assure you he is in very good health.' Health is not a reason for him to consider retirement. He is one of those people who has come to the realisation that it is time to let someone else share some of the burden, some of the responsibility and leadership of our community. I acknowledge a job very well done and thank him for his contribution to our community. I also note his contribution in more recent years to the Australian Labor Party and its Tasmanian branch and, on a personal note, thank him for his guidance, his always very frank advice and his encouragement.
