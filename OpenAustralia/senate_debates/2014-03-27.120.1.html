        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Health, Senator Nash. I refer the minister to the Prime Minister's pre-election promise that 'No cuts to health means no cuts to mental health'. Given the burden of mental illness in rural and remote Australia, particularly
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , can the minister guarantee that there will be no cuts to front-line services and coordinated care?

         I thank the senator for her question. The government has been very clear that we will honour all our election commitments. We have said that consistently and we have been very clear in doing so. This government recognises the importance of mental health; indeed, that is why we have set up the

         Commission.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is vitally important for this nation that we get the economy back under control. We will repair the budget but we will do so in ways that are entirely consistent with our election commitments. Compared to those opposite,

            The government's vision is for a sustainable health system that delivers quality health outcomes for all Australians and that includes mental health. The

            might not like the answer that I am giving but I am being very clear in laying out what this government will deliver and, when it comes to mental health, we will be delivering to people across the nation. It seems to have escaped those on the other side that every taxpayer dollar spent is a dollar that taxpayers have earned.

                 , I ask a supplementary question. I refer to the Partners in Recovery program which provides coordinated clinical support to people with severely disabling persistent mental illness, including in regional areas. I also refer to her answer last Thursday where she refused to rule out any cuts to funding this important service. Given the minister has now had a week to read her briefing pack, will she now rule out any cuts to Partners in Recovery in order to provide certainty to the individuals and their families who rely on the program?

                  in Recovery program will be assessed in the context of both the national mental health commission and the review of mental health programs, as well as the review of Medicare Locals. We make no apology for delivering good policy outcomes for this nation. We are going to do that in a sensible, methodical and measured way. We are going to make sure—unlike the previous government—that when it comes to health we make informed decisions and that goes to the delivery of mental health services across the nation.
