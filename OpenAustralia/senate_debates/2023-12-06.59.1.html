        Over the past fortnight, I've had the privilege of hosting a young university student as an intern in my office. It was an opportunity for me to provide insights into the intricacies of parliamentary procedure while emphasising the importance of civic engagement.
       </p>
       <p>
        So I asked him what he has learnt, being on this side. He said he's gained a firsthand understanding of the depth of commitment and dedication exhibited by the staff across all departments within parliament. Witnessing the relentless efforts and sacrifices made by individuals who tirelessly work here within the House and the chamber has been an eye-opening experience for him. He acknowledged the immense workload and the sense of responsibility that comes with serving the nation. The realisation that people are willing to set aside personal time, often leaving family and friends, in order to contribute to the smooth functioning of our country has left a lasting impression on him.
       </p>
       <p>
        Understanding the symbiotic relationship between elected representatives, their staff, the staff of the parliament and the community at large, he recognised that an informed and participative public are the backbone of a thriving democracy. It is a reminder that fostering strong connections between elected representatives and the community is pivotal to ensuring that the voices and concerns of the people at the grassroots are heard and addressed effectively within

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        It has been a privilege to host this young student. I hope he goes back to university next year with a better understanding of the mechanisms of parliament and a renewed faith in our system.
