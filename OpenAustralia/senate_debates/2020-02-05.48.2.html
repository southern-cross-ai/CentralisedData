        My question is for the Minister for Youth and Sport, Senator Colbeck. I refer the minister to the now infamous colour-coded spreadsheet of applications under the corrupt sports rorts scheme, prepared by the former Minister McKenzie's office, focusing on marginal electorates held by the coalition as well as electorates to be targeted by the coalition. Has the minister seen the spreadsheet?

         Thank you, Senator Farrell, for the question. It gives me a very good opportunity to extol the virtues of a program that's provided important support to communities across Australia. It's provided support to 684 grant recipients for facilities that they wouldn't have if Senator McKenzie had not made—

            Senator Farrell, the specific question that you point out was proceeded by a substantial number of assertions. I believe the minister is being directly relevant by using the opportunity to address those assertions, as he is entitled to do. I've allowed you to restate that part of the question. Senator Colbeck, continue.

             As I said, this program will provide sporting facilities across Australia to 684 grant recipients that desperately need those projects. It's not a surprise that there was such strong demand for this. Over 2,000 applications were received, and almost a third of them were able to be funded by the decisions that Senator McKenzie made in that program. There was very, very strong demand, and I'm sure that, as we work towards opportunities in the future, there will be future—

                 , as you already noted in your previous ruling, the question included a number of assertions—false assertions, we would submit—which the minister, in a directly relevant fashion, is explaining. For example, the first assertion is about favouring marginal seats, when the Auditor-General's report clearly shows that the proportion of Labor seats under Senator McKenzie's decisions increased compared to the Sports Australia decisions.

                   join with Minister Cormann in absolutely rejecting the assertions made by Senator Farrell about the program. The Auditor-General made a number of recommendations with respect to this particular program, which the government has responded to. I'm very pleased with the work that Sport Australia has already done to address the issues that the Auditor specifically made with respect to the program. There were four recommendations in the report. The government initially noted the fourth recommendation, which was specifically relating back to government, and the other three were acted on and initiated.

                                      Senator Rennick, that's a matter for debate. I'm going to rule on this point of order from Senator Farrell. On the second point you raised, Senator Farrell, I can't peer into the minister's mind and know what he knows or your assertion about that. I was listening very carefully to the minister's answer. It was, indeed, a very specific question. I believe the minister was talking about 'documents related to the program'—a phrase I think I heard him use. I'm listening very carefully, but I do believe the track he is on at the moment is directly relevant, but, I remind: it was a very specific question.

                                       As I said, there are a range of documents that relate to this program. And I have to say, if Senator Farrell is talking about the document that was in the possession of the ABC, I haven't seen that document, because the ABC hasn't published it. I have seen excerpts of the document as published by the ABC, but I have not seen the document that the ABC has. I haven't seen that document.

I'm very pleased to advise the chamber that I have received advice from the Secretary of the
