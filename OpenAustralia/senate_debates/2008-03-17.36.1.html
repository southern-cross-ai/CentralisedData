         I can indicate the price at the bowser in my home city of Devonport because on Saturday I had to visit a petrol station to fill up. I was struck by the fact that the price was approximately $1.40 per unleaded litre. I do keep a very close eye on the petrol price in my local community for obvious reasons. This government is very well aware of the impact that petrol prices have on struggling Australian families.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to touch on some of the factors that have led to the generally higher petrol prices in recent times. While oil and petrol prices are largely determined by international factors, the Rudd government is committed to promoting competition and transparency in Australia’s petrol market. The

          , I rise on a point of order on relevance. Senator Johnston asked two very specific questions. The first one was: what is the current price? We have already been given an answer to that. Senator Johnston then asked the price as of 24 November. The minister either knows or does not know, but taking us on a discourse on all things that he can read out is irrelevant to the question.

           , I rise on a point of order. Senator Sherry is exactly on the question in the answer he is providing. Even Senator Abetz admitted that in his point of order. It is another frivolous point of order. Senator Sherry can answer the question as he sees fit and he is clearly right in the centre of the question in discussing petrol price movements, as was requested in the question.

              . As I have indicated, this government is very concerned about the impact of higher petrol prices, particularly on struggling families. I did mention the price of petrol in my local community, which I keep a very close eye on. I might add in the context of my local community that, particularly in rural and regional areas, which the National Party is notorious for forgetting about, there is not the same range of public transport options. In my case on the north-west coast of Tasmania, whilst there are public transport options available within the cities of Devonport and Burnie, there are not extensive public transport options between the cities and the local communities. So obviously in rural and regional areas in particular, such as the community I come from, these are very important issues.

                Petrol prices certainly have gone up, Senator Abetz. I just mentioned what the petrol price is in my local community on the north-west coast of Tasmania. Of course this government is concerned about this trend. It is particularly important coming up to the Easter period and the public holiday commencing on Friday, because the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
                 ACCC
                </a>
                is closely monitoring petrol prices over Easter. The ACCC—and this goes specifically to the issue of price movements which I have been asked about—monitors movements in domestic retail petrol prices compared with movements in international prices, as reflected in the stock price of Singapore Mogas 95 Unleaded, and it assesses the difference between these two price series over time. The methodology used by the ACCC was outlined in the ACCC’s report of the inquiry into petrol prices in Australia, which was released in December 2007. Thank you for the question.

                 , I ask a supplementary question. I am very surprised that the spokesperson for competition policy and consumer affairs does not know the answer to those simple questions. To assist him, the petrol price was $1.33 on 24 November and $1.40 was the average price across Australia on Sunday, 16 March 2007. When exactly can consumers expect to see a decline in petrol prices, as promised by Labor during the election campaign?
