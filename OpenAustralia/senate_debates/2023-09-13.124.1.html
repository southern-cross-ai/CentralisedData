        inquiry report on universal access to reproductive health care made 36 recommendations to address barriers to sexual, maternity and reproductive health care in Australia, and it was tabled in May this year. The government response to those recommendations of the report was due on 25 August. We're almost three weeks beyond that due date, with no explanation for the government's delay. Women's health should be a priority, and women are sick of waiting for policy reform. When will the government release its response to this report?

         I thank Senator Waters for the question. It's an important one, and it is an important report that the Senate inquiry handed down into access to sexual and reproductive health. As Senator Waters outlined, the report did highlight a number of areas that need improvement so that women could access affordable, timely and appropriate care, including close to where they live. The government is currently working through recommendations outlined in the report, and we will table our response as soon as those are finalised. There are a large number of recommendations in the report—36 in total. The Minister for Health and Aged Care and his assistant ministers are ensuring that we get the response right, working with our state and territory colleagues and consulting with the sector and across departments. We will table our response as soon as it is finalised.

         But I would also say we have already invested significant funding and begun work on several of the recommendations in the report. Over 60 per cent of the longer

         consultations are used by women—that's those consultations that are over 20 minutes under level C items and over 40 minutes under level D items. We have committed over $99.1 million to introduce a new MBS item for consultations of 60 minutes or more to support improved access and affordability for patients with chronic conditions and complex needs, including those with mental health conditions; family, domestic and sexual violence; chronic conditions as well as reproductive health needs and matters like menopause. We've also committed $26.4 million over four years to extend support for research and data collection activities that support women's and girls' health outcomes. We welcomed the TGA's decision to remove a number of restrictions on health professionals who prescribe and dispense

           Women experiencing menopause struggle to get adequate treatment, but this has been exacerbated this year with the discontinuation of several brands of hormone replacement therapy transdermal patches. What will the government do to ensure that women have access to the necessary menopause treatments and that they are affordable?

            I will see if there's anything more I can come back to Senator Waters with on the specifics of that, but I would say that Minister Kearney has been leading the work on this from the House of Representatives. I have seen a number of forums where she has attended and held sessions particularly on menopause and how to provide appropriate health services for women who are going through menopause. But that's not only for menopause; it's also for pelvic pain, endometriosis and a whole range of areas where we believe women's health and addressing women's health matters haven't been appropriately dealt with. I'll see if there is anything further I can add on the specifics of the treatments that you refer to, because I don't have any information about that. Making sure women going through menopause are able to access the appropriate health treatments is a priority for this government, and Mr Kearney is doing incredible work in that area.

              Women's pain is often minimised or not believed. In Australia, 1.8 million women live with chronic pain. Painaustralia is calling for 10 subsidised allied health visits per year to achieve effective multidisciplinary pain management. What is the government going to do to ensure that women suffering from chronic pain can get and afford the health care that they need?

               I do acknowledge the question from Senator Waters on women's health and on the fact that there are barriers affecting women and their access to health care and, indeed, when they are accessing health care, the way that those conditions are responded to. There is a lot of evidence around bias in addressing women's health matters, so I acknowledge that and the senator's longstanding interest in these matters. I would say again that, under the leadership of Minister Kearney, there has been a women's health advisory group brought together, who are putting forward a women's health plan. All of the matters that you've raised in your questions would be forming part of the discussions that have been held under that. Part of my job in ensuring that we are leading in terms of gender equality across the board also includes health, and I know that that has featured in some of the work that the Women's Economic Equality Taskforce have been looking at as well. There is a lot of work happening across government—
