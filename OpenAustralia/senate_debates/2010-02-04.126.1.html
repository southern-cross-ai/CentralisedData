        Yesterday in question time Senator Milne, I believe, asked me a question in relation to Green Loans. I have some additional information which I propose to read. The senator asked me about a cap on the number of Green Loans assessors. This is not correct. I am advised that the government did not set out to limit the number of assessors operating under the Green Loans Program or provide guarantees regarding the number of assessors who would be allowed to operate under the program. From the outset of the program the decision to undertake training and seek accreditation has been a commercial decision made by individual assessors.
       </p>
       <p>
        The senator also asked me some questions, as I recall, in relation to a company called Fieldforce. I have received advice that indicates as follows: Fieldforce is the single largest operator under the Green Loans Program. To accommodate this—

         Order! Would senators please refrain from conducting conversations in the aisles. If you want to have a conversation, would you please leave the chamber. Order, senators on my left! Sorry, Senator Wong, I could not hear you.

          Yes, thank you. I am a bit lost as to where I was. Fieldforce is the largest single operator under the Green Loans Program. To accommodate this they make bulk bookings, which are processed by the department once a week. These bookings are subject to a weekly limit in order to ensure there is adequate work for all assessors. These arrangements were put in place to minimise the impact on the department’s booking process that would occur if Fieldforce were to book their jobs every day. Fieldforce are required to generate this work themselves. They are not provided any guarantee or level of work through the department. Jobs are available to all assessors whether they are individuals or part of a company. Assessors employed by Fieldforce are bound by the same terms and conditions as every other assessor working under the program, including in relation to the promotional canvassing of other products and services and there is no special treatment or exception in this regard. Thank you.
