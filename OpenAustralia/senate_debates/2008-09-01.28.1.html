        includes a balance of mandatory provisions, where Centrelink must act, and some discretionary provisions (to ensure that there are adequate safeguards for individual families).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Underpinning the legislation is the power for the Minister to make guidelines by way of a legislative instrument. These will be supported by policy guidelines, which will be finalised in conjunction with relevant agencies and respective Ministers’ offices.

       <p class="italic">
        Special circumstances. There are provisions in the primary legislation and supported by policy guidelines, which allow Centrelink to determine whether a customer is experiencing special circumstances which mean they are unable to meet their participation requirements and a temporary exemption is therefore warranted. General exemptions include major personal crisis, major disruption to the person’s home, cultural business and sorry business. Centrelink must determine what evidence is required to support the customer’s claim and the exemption period.

       <ul>

         Transport previously available becomes unavailable, and no suitable alternative exists

        <b>
         Special Circumstances
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The special circumstances provisions of the legislation are designed as a further safeguard against unwarranted penalisation of parents or their children through the suspension or cancellation of income support payments.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Centrelink can use special circumstances to encourage or promote behavioural change in parents by restoring and back-paying suspended payments on the promise of future compliance. For example, special circumstances could be applied to lift a suspension immediately where Centrelink has negotiated action by a parent to enrol their child in school when the parent travels to town on the following Monday.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Another illustration of special circumstances would be in the event that, following the application of a suspension period, a school fails to formally notify Centrelink of a parent’s improved compliance. In these circumstances, Centrelink could lift the suspension while liaising with the school.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Other instances of special circumstances apply in relation to the restoration of payments. For example, there could be factors that were not drawn to Centrelink’s attention when the decision to suspend was made, but would have worked against the decision to suspend if known at the time.
