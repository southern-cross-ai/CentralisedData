       <p>
        I rise to give recognition to the Labour Movement Internship program, founded by former senator
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Evans" rel="nofollow">
         Chris Evans
        </a>
        way back in 1996. Chris Evans sustained this program even while he was government leader in this place. The program connects young people of diverse backgrounds with the labour movement, bringing those people into the labour movement and connecting them with political leaders, unions and institutions. It's funded by donations from unions, labour organisations, parliamentarians, and individuals who really want to support the next generation of labour activists coming through.
       </p>
       <p>
        It now has a community of some 150 politically active alumni, giving each new generation a rich understanding of the values and aspirations of the union movement and the Labor Party. It perhaps won't surprise you to know that way back in 1996, it's inaugural year, I was a participant in the Chris Evans labour movement work experience project, as it was then known. At the time, it was coordinated by the current Western Australian Premier,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Cook" rel="nofollow">
         Roger Cook
        </a>
        . I credit my time in the program with giving me a strong foundation in the institutions, networks and political groupings to make my way into a political career. As the program nears its 30th year, I want to thank former senator Evans for his continuous dedication to education and advocacy for the union movement. I want to thank Di and this year's cohorts for the great work they've done, and on behalf of myself I also say thank you.
