        I seek leave to amend business of the Senate notice of motion No. 5, standing in my name and the names of Senator Griff and Senator Kakoschke-Moore for today proposing a reference to the Community Affairs References Committee, by omitting '7 December 2017' and substituting '18 February 2018' and also by substituting paragraph (d) of the motion with the words: 'the adequacy of medication handling practices and drug administration methods specific to aged care delivered at Oakden'.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
