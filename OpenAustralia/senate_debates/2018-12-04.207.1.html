        I rise to put on the record two matters. I will commence with a significant development with regard to the Australian Association of National Advertisers. Millions of Australian women have flicked through magazines—and I'm sure that Senator Hume and Senator McKenzie would be amongst those who have done this—and pored over images of celebrities and models. Alongside those images were stories of advice and headlines promising we would achieve our 'sexiest body ever'. I also want to acknowledge Senator Claire Moore is here. I don't know if any of us would be seduced by such headlines, but they are nonetheless a part of the reality that we are often exposed to just by being women in the modern world who see this kind of literature around us.
       </p>
       <p>
        But, with the rise of social media and the persistence of digital connectivity, Australian women of all ages can endlessly scroll through curated images of toned models, celebrities and social media influencers. While social media can be great for connecting with loved ones, we know that it also facilitates the consumption of imagery that can be damaging for men's and women's body image. Mr Acting Deputy President Ketter, as the father of young men and women, I'm sure that you're very aware that this is an issue that impacts on families in a very significant way in our time. Men are met with images of chiselled torsos and strong sculpted limbs. You know it: it's called the 'Adonis ideal'. Women face a barrage of perfection—perfect hair, perfect teeth, perfect skin, perfect bodies and curves in all the 'right' places.
       </p>
       <p>
        The pressure to imitate these body types that often become idealised can be harmful to our mental, physical and emotional health, and it is well established that this can be associated with a development of body dissatisfaction and eating disorders, which affect over one million Australian men and women. Of all psychiatric illnesses—and I stress this—eating disorders have amongst the highest mortality rates. A lot of the time the portrayal of these 'ideal bodies' is often unattainable or only attainable through unhealthy practices thanks to digital alteration. You've seen it before: the model's waist has been tightened and it is disproportionate to the rest of their body. It is literally impossible to look like that and it has been often idealised, I think, across many generations in the Barbie doll body shape. Millions of Australian women have flipped through magazines and pored over images of celebrities and models. Alongside those images were stories, advice and headlines promising we would achieve those very sexy body images. With the rise of social media, we know that the challenge of this is going to cause more and more problems for us.
       </p>
       <p>
        The reason I want to make this speech today, though, is to applaud a significant change in some of the attitudes and to make a noise of applause in congratulations to the Australian Association of National Advertisers. It is with some joy that I can say the advertising industry has heard a number of calls that I and Labor, over the last decade, have been making with regard to action on this vital matter. Just a few weeks ago, the Australian Association of National Advertisers, the AANA, launched an updated code of ethics, with a practice note written to assist advertisers in their understanding of how the code of ethics applies to the portrayal of body image in advertising. This new note prohibits advertising that depicts unrealistic bodies. Advertising that provides an unrealistic body image by portraying body shapes or features that are unattainable through healthy practices, which is not justifiable in the context of the product or the service being advertised, may no longer be permissible.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a huge win in the pursuit of good mental health and positive body image. Practically, it means tightening a model's waist disproportionately to the rest of their body may be a breach of the code of ethics. Importantly, the code is technology-neutral, which means that this will apply to all advertisements, including on social media—a medium which advertisers are increasingly using thanks to the rise of influencers. If an ad is found in breach, it must be removed and never used again. This is an important step in addressing the root causes of body dissatisfaction and eating disorders. Whilst I welcome this move with open arms, I look forward to seeing the effect of this new code and will be keeping a very watchful eye on how its enforceability plays out in practice.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm also going to make another call for action. This time, it's for all those citizens who might be listening to or watching this broadcast. I offer encouragement that we all have a role to play in creating a healthy society. I'm calling on you to report ads that you feel are not complying with such a code of ethics. If you see them on Facebook or Instagram or in magazines, please make a complaint to the Ads Standards board. If you have difficulty in doing that, I encourage you to contact me and I'll be happy to put you in touch with them. Certainly, I'm going to be keeping my eyes open and on the lookout for facial features and body shapes that cannot be attained through healthy practices, because, thankfully, this is no longer permissible. Together we can do this. We are the community and we can reset the dial on prevailing community standards.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd also like to take the opportunity to acknowledge the significant leadership from the Labor team, led on this issue by

          Absolutely. Indeed, Senator Kate Lundy. These two women really made this an issue that we have considered. Sadly, there have not been adequate solutions. I note that Minister Hunt has made a number of comments around eating disorders. Last year, on 30 November, he made a landmark speech in which he indicated that there would be a significant advancement in the Medicare Benefits Schedule to provide an adequate form of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MBS" rel="nofollow">
           MBS
          </a>
          items to deal with the reality of eating disorders that affect so many in our community. I note that he promised to deliver that within a year. It's now past 30 November 2018. I called on the minister earlier this week and I once again call on him to honour that commitment he has made to the Australian public.
         </p>
         <p>
          I'd also like, in the time remaining to me, to recognise life membership of Cheryl Cassell and Joe de Bruyn—firstly Cheryl Cassell, our
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SDA" rel="nofollow">
           SDA
          </a>
          New South Wales branch president. Cheryl has recently retired from her job at Woolworths, in Nowra, after many years of working in the retail industry. She started working in the retail industry at Woolworths Riverwood in the 1960s and has served SDA members from the shop floor as a workplace delegate at Woolworths Nowra since 1987, over 31 years. She's been an SDA New South Wales branch counsellor for over 16 years, an SDA national counsellor and, more recently, the SDA New South Wales branch president. Cheryl has displayed the qualities of strength, dignity and perseverance that are so admirable in people who serve those around them. She's certainly known for her directness as well.
         </p>
         <p>
          Also presented with life membership of the SDA union was Joe de Bruyn. The national council of the SDA met a little while ago in Brisbane. The national council meeting was particularly significant in the life of their union as it marked the retirement of Joe de Bruyn, the national president. He was departing from all his offices of the SDA after 44 years of faithful service to the members of the SDA. He was national secretary for 36 years and national president for the last four years. Joe originally came to Sydney for a week—and left 16 years later, including after spending 12 years as both the SDA's New South Wales branch secretary and the national secretary, from 1984 to 1996. Even in semiretirement he's one of the busiest people you will ever meet, yet he still has time to listen to others.
         </p>
         <p>
          He's on the board of Rest Super and six of its subcommittees. He's a director on the board of another superannuation body linked to Rest and he's on the board of a not-for-profit centre. He's also the chairman of the board of trustees at a local university and, until a few weeks ago, was the national president of the SDA. His is a life of public service that deserves acknowledgement. Joe has always been fearless, standing up for his principles and for his members. He's an all-round generally outstanding person who continues to make a contribution to Australian public life.
         </p>
         <p>
          I thank you very much for the opportunity to put those remarks on the record.
