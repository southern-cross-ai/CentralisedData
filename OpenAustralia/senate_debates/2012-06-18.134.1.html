        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Senator Conroy. Is the minister aware of the concerns raised by Allan Hansard, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        of the Australian Recreational Fishing Foundation, which represents five million recreational fishers, when he says the marine bioregion closures will lock fishers out of Australia's oceans and many iconic fishing spots and that mums, dads and kids will be banned from trying to catch fish? The government has said it will compensate commercial fishermen for losses resulting from the marine bioregion closures. What form of compensation does the government intend to offer recreational fishermen, who are normally blue-collar workers, who have been let down badly by the Greens-Labor alliance that has locked them out of their traditional fishing areas?

         I thank Senator Boswell for his question, although I have to start by rejecting the premise of it. The Gillard government is committed to delivering a national network of marine reserves to protect our precious marine environment for future generations. The government has announced where these protected regions will be, and this provides certainty for industry. We have designed the reserves to avoid impact on fishers and regional communities as much as possible. We will be delivering an adjustment package in the vicinity of $100 million. That will be worked through on a case-by-case basis.
        </p>
        <p>
         These new reserves will not stop recreational fishers from doing what they love. The bottom line is that, for 96 per cent of the ocean from the shore out to 100 kilometres, access to recreational fishing remains unchanged. The job of the government now is to work with industry to get the management and adjustment policies in place and done right. The announced reserve plans will not come into effect until we have the right management arrangements and assistance measures in place.
        </p>
        <p>
         The minister understands and recognises the importance of the fishing industry right around Australia. The minister is a strong supporter of Australian fishers and Australian fisheries. Our fisheries are in top shape, they are well managed and the industry has a positive future. Our fishers are innovative, productive, compassionate—

          , I have a supplementary question. Is it the government's intention to compensate fishing tackle shops, charter fishing operators, marine dealers, fish processors, the outboard motor industry and any other associated marine industries for the loss of business that will result from the lockout of both commercial and recreational fishers?

           The government will deliver an assistance package in the vicinity of $100 million. That will be worked through on a case-by-case basis. This adjustment will flow before the reserves are activated. There will be a range of impacts on industry. Now that the final reserves have been announced, we can work out who will need what. The minister will build with industry a tailored package to meet each of those needs. We are going to work to help those who want and are able to change their business model. They might change where they fish, how they fish and the type of fish they catch. They may also want to leave the industry entirely. We will build a package that can suit each of these needs. We will provide direct business support—

             I think what is relevant here is the fact that the governments are committed to a compensation package on a case-by-case basis. But I would like to draw the chamber's and the President's attention to a flyer that has come to my attention called 'Save our marine life'. It reads:

There was nothing to do with some bit of paper that has come to Senator Conroy's attention. Will you please direct him to answer Senator Boswell's question.

I cannot possibly see how this can be relevant when I asked a question on what compensation will be paid to communities and I am told that some piece of paper refers to 'save our seas' or something like this.
