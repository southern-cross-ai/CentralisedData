            , since you called for order, Senator Wong hasn't ceased speaking. The opposition have had their bit of fun. All interjections are disorderly, as you rightly pointed out. You grant a degree of tolerance, but I think the tolerance is being stretched now.

             I don't particularly want to commence the first day back by threatening to name anyone, but this is question time, not a session of Gregorian chanting. The opposition will have time to make its point at three o'clock when we take note of answers, so I would ask that we hear Senator Chandler and her question in silence.

              <p>
               I thank Senator Chandler for her question and her ongoing commitment to a more efficient and more cost effective superannuation system in Australia. The Australian superannuation system manages around $3 trillion in retirement savings on behalf of around 16 million Australians. While the system has grown significantly, it does need to adapt to better meet the needs of Australians.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Your Future, Your Super package, announced in the 2020-21 budget, is the Morrison government's next step in modernising and improving the Australian superannuation system to ensure that it is working harder for all Australians. This is part of the government's plan to make the Australian super system more competitive, more transparent, more efficient and better governed and ensure that Australians can reap the full benefits of compulsory superannuation.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Treasury forecasts the Your Future, Your Super package will save Australians around $17.9 billion over the next decade in reduced fees and better performance of the super system. Young Australians entering the workforce could be up to $98,000 better off at retirement because of these reforms. At present, Australian households pay around $30 billion a year in superannuation fees, and that excludes insurance premiums. That's more than the $27 billion that households spend on energy bills and the $12 billion they pay on water bills. This government's measures to date have gone a long way to combating the inefficiencies and anomalies, but more must still be done. The question must be asked: will Labor again oppose the legislation that will make Australia's system more competitive, transparent and efficient?

                  It's not particularly amplifying, Senator Keneally, because I can't hear Senator Chandler clearly, and I would like to. Senator Chandler.

                   . Can the minister advise the Senate how Australians will benefit from an improved superannuation system?

                    Thank you, Senator Chandler. The reforms announced in the 2021 budget the Your Future, Your Super package will create efficiencies, reduce costs and reduce duplication through four measures. First, that's done by ensuring that superannuation follows you when you change jobs. This will stop the creation of unwanted multiple accounts that reduce retirement savings through duplicate fees and insurance premiums. Second, it's done by introducing a new and interactive online YourSuper comparison tool. This will empower members to make better decisions about who manages their retirement savings. The YourSuper tool will help members compare and select MySuper products that best meet their needs. Third, it's done by holding funds to account for underperformance by introducing an objective performance test. Funds that fail that test will be required to inform their members. If they fail in two consecutive years, they will be stopped from taking new members. And, fourth, it's done by increasing transparency and accountability, ensuring that trustees act in the best financial interests of members to maximise their retirement savings.

                       We in this government have steadily raised the bar on superannuation performance expectations and governance structures since we came to power. Our focus has squarely been on ensuring superannuation delivers for members, for consumers and for everyday Australians. The Your Future, Your Super package will protect members from poor outcomes and encourage funds to lower their costs. The Morrison government want, and they expect, superannuation to deliver more for Australians. The Your Future, Your Super reforms will do just that.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       It wasn't until we, on this side of the chamber, came to government that the superannuation system had a light shone on underperformance and inefficiencies. We know this because our changes to the super system to make it more competitive, transparent and efficient have had great effect: 800,000 Australians who were locked into a fund by their employers now have the choice to choose their own fund, $760 million was paid to 700,000 employees through our amnesty measures and $3.7 billion in unintended accounts have been consolidated.
