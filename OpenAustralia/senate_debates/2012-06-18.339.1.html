       <p class="italic">

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a)   what percentage is estimated to have been washed away; and
       </p>

        (b)   where are the pieces of wreck located.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2)   Given that reports by Christmas Island residents and the media state that oil has continued to leak from the vessel, contradicting evidence provided by the

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3)   Why did AMSA fail to make use of calm weather between 7 February and 29 February 2012, to further assess the vessel or pump out the remaining oil.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4)   Is the Minister aware that local residents are still being affected by fumes produced by the leaking oil; if so, what action is the Government taking to address these concerns.

         The Minister for Infrastructure and Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1)   It is not possible to estimate the percentage of the wreck that has been washed away as the wreck has deteriorated under heavy swell conditions.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island" rel="nofollow">
          Christmas Island
         </a>
         Harbour Master is surveying the wreck site to ascertain the location of the pieces. This is being completed as weather permits.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2)   The evidence supplied by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMSA" rel="nofollow">
          AMSA
         </a>
         at Senate Estimates was accurate and clearly stated "there might be some leakage of residual oil". The assessment of how much oil had leaked from the ship was made on visual observations over a period of weeks based on the position and condition of the wreck and the associated shoreline pollution.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3)   There were adverse swell conditions throughout that period and it was not possible to pump out the residual oil. The pollution response team inspected the vessel daily throughout this period and swell conditions prevented any remedial action being undertaken.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4)   In the recent adverse weather, the Department of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Regional Australia
         </a>
         ,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government" rel="nofollow">
          Local Government
         </a>
         , Arts and Sport (Regional Australia) on the island had reports of diesel fumes affecting some residents in the area neighbouring
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Fish_Cove" rel="nofollow">
          Flying Fish Cove
         </a>
         . Residents were advised to avoid the area and to seek medical assistance if required. The fumes dissipated within a few hours.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (5)   No oil pollution clean-up is occurring at present.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         As indicated in the answer to question (8), the operation for removal of the wreck by the contracted salvage operator has commenced.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         In addition, the Harbour Master has put in place arrangements to remove debris from the shore for port safety purposes, weather permitting.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Non-oiled rubbish that has been deposited on Flying Fish Cove beaches by the swell will be cleaned up soon, as the swell season comes to an end. I am advised that such rubbish clean-up occurs every year after swell season conditions abate.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (6)   No oil contaminated sand and rock was removed from the beach. Oiled debris was removed to a dedicated waste site in the landfill area, under Shire direction, and placed in shipping containers, ready for off-island disposal.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Currently there are four shipping containers of oiled debris stored at the landfill area, under Shire control, awaiting the opportunity to ship to a secure and authorised disposal site on mainland Australia.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Isabel Beach was assessed regularly for oiling until early March, and for debris since then. No oil has been found. All debris and rubbish found has been removed and the Shire will continue to do this should more rubbish be deposited. This is normal practice after swell season conditions.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         To date AMSA has spent $295,000 on the clean-up.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (7)   Soon after the vessel was wrecked there were reports of phosphate bags covering corals. Reports from recreational divers in the area are that these have dissipated in the recent heavy seas.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The impact of the phosphate bags on the corals is part of the long-term environmental monitoring program undertaken by the Western Australian Department of Fisheries on behalf of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Government
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (8)   Removal of the wreck is normally the responsibility of the owner. However, as the owner has not taken any practical action to commence a salvage or wreck removal operation, the Australian Government has stepped in to arrange the operation. The Australian Government will take action to recover costs from the owner.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The salvage operation will be undertaken by Titan Maritime Pty Ltd (Titan) and managed through a cooperative agreement between AMSA and Regional Australia.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Divers from Titan commenced surveying the site on 24 April 2012, to develop a salvage plan.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Once the salvage operation is completed the Government will take action to recover costs from the vessel's owner.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (9)   The wreck removal operation has had to await calmer weather conditions which follow the ending of the swell season in late April.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         A wreck removal contract has been signed with Titan, and, as indicated in the answer to question (8), a dive survey commenced on 24 April 2012. Titan has advised that they expect to provide a proposal for wreck removal approximately one week later.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The wreck removal process is weather-dependent and is expected to take several months.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Arrangements will be made to minimise disruption to port operations and any adverse impacts on the Christmas Island community from the wreck removal operation.
