        Day, as it is now known, which this year occurs on Friday, 25 November. Statistics continue to show that one in three women over the age of 15 experiences violence in their lifetime, and one in five experiences physical violence. It is widely known that domestic violence is not just physical violence. It also encompasses sexual, emotional and psychological forms of violence. According to findings of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Council" rel="nofollow">
         National Council
        </a>
        to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        ... a central element of domestic violence is that of an ongoing pattern of behaviour aimed at controlling one's partner through fear (for example, by using violent or threatening behaviour) ... the violent behaviour is part of a range of tactics used by the perpetrator to exercise power and control ... and can be both criminal and non-criminal in nature.
       </p>
       <p>
        The awful truth is that domestic violence also kills women. The most likely scenario for the homicide of an Australian woman is at home at the hands of an intimate partner. This might be something that Australians do not want to think about or do not want to concede is happening, but the reality is that violence against women is happening in the suburbs and towns each one of us lives in. Of 260 Australian homicides tracked by the National Homicide Monitoring Program of the Australian Institute of Criminology in 2007-08, 52 per cent were classified as domestic homicides.
       </p>
       <p>
        A third of women who were interviewed by the International Violence Against Women Survey felt their lives were in danger in the most recent incident of domestic violence. And research from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VicHealth" rel="nofollow">
         VicHealth
        </a>
        showed domestic violence is the leading risk factor contributing to death, disability and illness in Victorian women between the ages of 15 and 44—a higher risk than from smoking, from alcohol use, from high blood pressure or from heart disease.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not just the social devastation that pervades our communities; the evidence of the economic damage is also significant. In 2002-03, the cost of domestic violence to Australia was estimated at $8.1 billion, $3.5 billion of which was attributable to pain, suffering and premature mortality, according to Access Economics. Domestic and family violence is also the major cause of homelessness for women and their children. Victims will often cycle in and out the doors of homelessness services as they return home to try to reconcile with their partner.
       </p>
       <p>
        A World Health Organisation study on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Health" rel="nofollow">
         Women's Health
        </a>
        and Domestic Violence Against Women has found:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Each culture has its sayings and songs about the importance of home, and the comfort and security to be found there. Yet for many women, home is a place of pain and humiliation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … violence against women by their male partners is common, wide-spread and far-reaching in its impact. For too long hidden behind closed doors and avoided in public discourse, such violence can no longer be denied as part of everyday life for millions of women.
       </p>
       <p>
        White Ribbon is Australia's campaign to stop violence against women. White Ribbon Day targets all Australians, but especially men and boys, and asks them to swear an oath 'never to commit, excuse or remain silent about violence against women'.
       </p>

        Women's Council for Domestic and Family Violence Services describes White Ribbon as:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … the only national violence prevention campaign, and it is unique in that it aims to raise awareness among Australian men and boys about the roles they can play to prevent violence against women …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In swearing and wearing a white ribbon, men and boys can act as positive role models and advocates for change by challenging behaviours and attitudes that have allowed of violence against women to occur.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are currently around 1,600 White Ribbon ambassadors nationally, and about 130 of those are from my home state of Western Australian. The Leader of the Opposition,

        and Chief Justice Wayne Martin. There is no limit to the capacity of men to educate others and drive the cultural change towards total condemnation of all forms of violence against women. I would encourage more men to consider what positive change they can make by becoming an ambassador or signing up to take the oath, which in itself is a very strong message and a big commitment.
       </p>
       <p>
        The private nature of domestic relationships means that data collection of domestic violence is difficult and also that a great number of women who are victims are unlikely to report the abuse. Women are less likely to consider violence or abuse from their partner as criminal behaviour compared with violence or abuse from strangers. The coalition has, and has always maintained, a zero tolerance approach to violence against women. The coalition believes that keeping women and their families safe from violence is central to ensuring their security and prosperity. Violence devastates our social fabric and prevents women from achieving social and economic equality.
       </p>
       <p>
        The safety of women was a top priority for the former Howard government. Through the Women's Safety Agenda, the former Howard government committed $75.7 million over four years, from July 2005, to prevent, reduce and respond to domestic and family violence and sexual assault. The Women's Safety Agenda addressed four broad themes: prevention, health, justice and services. The initiatives included the national Violence Against Women—Australia Says No campaign and the national 24-hour helpline.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As Sex Discrimination Commissioner I am often asked what is the greatest challenge for women's human rights in Australia—the answer has to be violence against women. If women cannot expect to be safe in their own homes and communities, how can they expect equality in society?
       </p>
       <p>
        The idea that what happens behind the closed door of a family home or a private residence is the business of its occupants has long passed. The private realm is not outside the bounds of the law. This cultural change has begun, but the stark reality is that domestic violence destroys lives, families and communities, and there is still much work to be done to change attitudes and behaviours. The coalition fully supports White Ribbon and all the work that it is undertaking.

        On another topic, I had the privilege of representing the Leader of the Opposition at the Australian Netball Awards of 2011 on Saturday night in Melbourne. The dinner, aptly themed 'Our time to shine', was a special night for netball where

        recognised past and present achievements both on and off the court. I have spoken of the exceptional achievements of the Australian Diamonds and Netball Australia previously in this chamber, but I would like to reaffirm that it was an outstanding year for Australian netball with the Diamonds claiming their 10th World Netball Championship title, defending the Constellation Cup and heading into 2012 as the No. 1 team in the world. That is right—the Australian Diamonds are the No. 1 netball team in the world. This is an achievement that all Australians should be proud of.
