        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. Responding to the latest
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPCC" rel="nofollow">
         IPCC

        synthesis report yesterday, the UN Secretary-General,

        , said there should be no new coal, oil or gas projects and no expansions of existing coal, oil or gas reserves. Why does Labor want to open the 116 new coal and gas projects in the pipeline?

         I thank Senator Waters for her question. The Australian government of course welcomes the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPCC" rel="nofollow">
          IPCC

         report. I think even you, Senator Waters, would acknowledge that there's been a significant change, in terms of the issues of climate change which the IPCC were dealing with in their report, between our government and the former government and, in particular, the greater commitments that we have made as a government to addressing the issues of climate change and starting the process of increasing the speed at which our economy is decarbonised. That, unfortunately, is not an easy thing to do. You can't snap your fingers and suddenly go from a fossil fuel supported economy to a renewable economy. You just can't do it. I wish you could. I wish I could do that by clicking my fingers. But we can't do it. This government is moving down the path of decarbonisation, but we're doing it in a sensible way. We're trying to bring the community with us, and I think we're doing that. We brought them with us—

        <p>
         Well, they voted for us at the last election, Senator McKim! They voted for us. You don't like it, but they voted for us as a government. They voted for our policies, not your policies, and they certainly didn't vote for the opposition's policies.

           have both called for cuts to public subsidies for fossil fuels, which, incidentally, would save your budget $11 billion every year. Will the government end fossil fuel subsidies to help tackle the economic and climate crises?

                        The short answer is no, we're not going to return those donations any more than you have returned donations from companies which also have investments in fossil fuels and donate to the Greens. I understand that your organisation has refused to return those. Nor do you return donations from companies engaged in gambling.

The Albanese government has a clear agenda to create the jobs of the future by taking advantage of the transition to renewable energy and investing in skills and training. How is the government's commitment to action on climate change supporting the jobs and skills of the future?

                              Thank you, Senator Grogan. You, of course, have a very long history in supporting all of these issues, even before you arrived in this place. Right now, this parliament is faced with a very simple choice. For the first time in a decade we can seize the opportunity to reduce emissions from Australia's big emitters or we can squander that opportunity yet again. Reforms to the safeguard mechanism are crucial to meeting our legislated emissions reduction target, the target that most honourable senators voted for in this place last year. When this parliament voted for a 43 per cent emissions reduction target for our country, the very senators who then argued for a higher target are now the ones who would have it be even lower. Without the changes that the safeguard mechanism involves, our nation is looking at a 35 per cent emissions reduction target by 2030, which is eight per cent lower than what was legislated by this parliament last year. Those honourable senators who said the target should be higher now have a choice to make, because, if they vote against these reforms, they are voting for a lower outcome than what was legislated just last year. Those senators would be voting against a 43 per cent emissions reduction target and against net zero by 2050.
                             </p>

                              We all have the opportunity here to take 205 million tonnes of carbon out of the air by 2030, the equivalent of two-thirds of the cars on Australia's roads. We have the chance to drive change among the 215 biggest emitters in the country, who represent 28 per cent of Australia's overall emissions. Yesterday's

Given that the jobs and skills of the future depend on industry and business having certainty and confidence, can the minister outline how a predictable trajectory for emissions reduction will give that certainty and confidence?

                                 Thanks again, Senator Grogan. The government's safeguard mechanism reforms that all senators will have the opportunity to vote on in the next couple of weeks are the next step to ensure that Australian industry remains competitive in a decarbonising global economy while reducing its emissions. What this means for Australians is jobs: clean, green and renewable jobs of the future—and jobs in green steel manufacturing, green hydrogen, offshore wind and other associated industries. If we get the policy settings right for business to decarbonise, we will achieve this ambition.
                                </p>

                                 and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry support these reforms, and 80 per cent of facilities are already covered by corporate net zero commitments. It's interesting that the parties who say they support big business aren't backing in those business groups on this point. Business knows that reducing emissions is essential to their long-term competitiveness in a global net zero economy, and that's why they're supporting the safeguard mechanism change.

                                     I'd be pretty embarrassed about that too! And, of course, it's also due to a decade of inaction from those on the other side.

                                     Now the Greens are faced with the same choice 14 years later, and I say to the Greens senators: do you really want to find yourself sitting next to Senator Rennick, Senator Antic, Senator Canavan, Senator Hanson, Senator Roberts and all of those other people who say that climate change isn't real?
