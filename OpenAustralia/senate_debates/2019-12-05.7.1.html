        If the Senate is agreeable I would like to ask a series of questions of the minister, which I hope I can do expediently, to get some issues on the record—issues that I think the minister is pretty aware I have some concerns about and would like a better understanding of—and then I'll move my amendment. I think that will probably be the quickest way. I don't want to hold up the place—I'm aware that there's a lot to get through today—but I do think this is an important matter, and there are a number of points that I'd like to make sure we address.
       </p>

        I want to ask a couple of questions about complaints. Through you,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair" rel="nofollow">

        , I ask the minister: what work is the government doing to reduce legislative barriers that prevent the publication of complaints and their resolutions?

         As part of the process that we're going through with this piece of legislation—it is actually, as you would understand, the full establishment of the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission—I've written to the advisory committee that supports the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission, asking them to advise me and the commission what additional powers might be required. That can go to things like reporting. I'm happy to have some conversations with you as that report comes back to me; it's due very soon. I understand your desire to see transparency, particularly around reporting, and I support that process. It's important to the government that people who have issues that they want to report through the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission can do that, and can do it in a way that provides them satisfaction as to the fact that their complaints have been addressed and resolved in a way that's satisfactory to them.

          I thank the minister for his answer. You said you're expecting the report to come back fairly soon. What time frame are you talking about, and what's your intended process from there? Will that information become public or will you then go through a process of discussing it with various stakeholders?

           I'll be briefed on that next week, when I meet with the advisory committee; I'll get an initial briefing then. The report will come to me subsequent to that. It will go through some consultation with stakeholders; I think that's an important part of the process. But I am also really cognisant of the fact that we do have a royal commission going on. The commission said to us in their interim report that they didn't want ad hoc changes made to the act. In fact, they may come back to us with a recommendation for a whole new act. They would prefer that any changes occur in that context. So I'm cognisant of respecting that process. It may be that we share those recommendations that come back from the advisory committee with the royal commission.

            I appreciate what you've said about the amendments to the act, and I suspect, yes, there will need to be a whole new act. But there may be processes that you could put in place that don't require changes to the act that would improve transparency and accountability. Would you be prepared to look at changes that could be made either through delegated instruments or just the process, if changes to the act are not advisable, given the process that's going to happen next year through the royal commission?

             I suppose that will depend a little bit on what comes back through the report that comes to me from the advisory committee. I will consider all of those things. I think we have demonstrated, as we did with the changes we made to the regulations around restraint, that, if there are things that we see that we can and should act on, we are prepared to consider those things.

              I've got a series of questions, obviously, around these issues, which I will try to get through very quickly. Could I ask the government: what would be the issues with the complaints process addressing My Aged Care, the ACAT process and the RAS process?

               The process for the quality and safety commissioner is designed to deal with complaints relating specifically to the provision of care, not to the assessment process. They are separate elements. The commission is intended to operate as a single point of contact for the regulation of quality of care in aged-care services. It's not intended to regulate the process by which consumers access Commonwealth subsidised or funded aged-care services. There are existing arrangements in place for those. So they're separate.

                We take this opportunity to convey that Labor is sympathetic to those in this place who want to provide solutions to the many issues that exist across the aged-care sector, but, in saying this, Labor isn't in a position to support the Greens amendments. The interim report of the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">
                 Royal Commission
                </a>
                into Aged Care Quality and Safety conveyed a strong message from the commissioners. They said they would 'recommend comprehensive reform and major transformation of the aged-care system in Australia', but they also stated that they would 'chart a new direction for the sector', hopefully 'bringing a clear sense of purpose and of quality'. What mechanisms will be required to address the recommendations in the final report are not known, but I think it would be folly to try to pre-empt too much of the commissioners' directions now. So it is our strong view that any reform should now be done with a clear intention and it should be done in a holistic way.
               </p>
               <p>
                We have not been consulted in the lead-up to these amendments being drafted. It's therefore difficult for Labor to support these amendments given the absence of any consultation. It's also difficult because we are concerned that the necessary consultation with the aged-care sector and consumers may not have occurred.

                 that consultation with consumers has occurred. In fact, this comes directly out of consumers and the inquiry into the first phase of these changes. While I agree that fundamental changes to the act shouldn't be made in the run-up to the royal commission, let's be honest here. It's not reporting until late next year. It will take some time—let's face it—in the run-up to the next election for any action to be taken. I am not casting aspersions on the government, or anybody else for that matter; that's simply the reality of the way regulation works and making sure we've got an act that meets the recommendations from the royal commission in the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                 We're talking about changes that will help people now. Anybody who is involved in the aged-care system knows that My Aged Care is extremely complicated, very hard to navigate and means there isn't a single point of contact for the aged-care system. It makes sense to enable the commission to address these particular issues; otherwise they simply aren't addressed. It's a fallacy to say there's a single point of entry. So please don't come the one about: 'You haven't consulted with us about it.' As to the sector, consumers have asked for this. They've been complaining about My Aged Care a lot, as I addressed in my second reading contribution. So say you don't support them but don't use the excuse of not being consulted. Since when has the ALP consulted anybody else when they've brought in amendments? The fact is this is what consumers would like to see: a genuine single point of entry.

                  Senator Siewert, I think that you will see this system look very different over the ensuing period. I make the point again that the role of the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commissioner is to oversee aged-care providers. The
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACAT" rel="nofollow">
                   ACAT
                  </a>
                  process, the assessment process, is completely different. It's currently delivered by a number of providers, including state governments. As part of our response to the royal commission report, we said that we were going to move to a process of a single national provider. That work has now commenced. So that process is going to change—and I think the oversight mechanism around that will probably have to be modified as part of that reform. The whole delivery of aged care is at the point where it's starting to change quite significantly.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The point that I would make is: the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commissioner's role is to oversee the quality of service delivery—not assessment. The assessment process is about to change significantly. So we need to make sure that we identify the differences and, as the reform of the assessment process continues, there will have to be appropriate oversight processes for that.

                      I don't have the final documentation on the serious incident response scheme. It is due to me very soon—and by that I mean probably early in the new year. Once that's available to me, I'm happy to have a conversation with various parties about that.

                            Until I am briefed by the advisory council to the commission, I really can't answer that question definitively. From my perspective, this process will be quite open. It's not something that I'm looking to contest. I am genuinely looking to ensure that senior Australians receive high-quality and safe aged-care services. That is my motive in this process.

                             ask about the continuous quality improvement framework? Is this being developed alongside the Serious Incident Response Scheme? Is it separate, or is there little work being done on it?

                               I take your point, but it was not obvious to us, during the Senate inquiry into this process, that that was happening, which is why we recommended that it happen.

                                The Serious Incident Response Scheme will include issues of sexual assault. There are still some things, as I understand, being considered around the parameters of that, but it will include issues relating to sexual assault.

                                 Thank you. Sorry, I should have asked this: going back very briefly to the continuous quality improvement framework, can I ask the minister to take that on notice and perhaps get back to us on where that's at?

                                   Thank you. As you know, one of the other amendments I've moved as part of our amendments on sheet 8811 revised addresses the issues of advocates and access to premises and information.

                                   ask the government to confirm whether the term 'persons assisting' refers only to employees of the commission and does not include advocates or community visitors?

                                    It doesn't only include employees, but it would normally only include people with specialist skills—which I know is going to raise another question.

                                      Generally, it depends on the specific skills that are required. It could include a financial adviser. It could include someone with specialist nursing or health skills. That's the advice that I have. If you want me to take the specifics of that on notice and get back to you to save us some time, I'm happy to do that.

                                         Thank you. One of the issues that advocates are finding through this process is that they find they can't get access to appropriate information. Is there a process being undertaken, or what is the government doing, to ensure that aged-care providers don't withhold information from advocates? Are you looking at any sanctions where that is in fact happening?

                                          I think that I would suggest that that is a particular matter that's probably best addressed through an approach to the royal commission and seeing what recommendations they may bring back to us. I understand it's an issue that's been raised, but, rather than make a specific point on that at this stage, I think that's probably something best addressed through the royal commission process, which will come back to us with a whole range of recommendations, I expect, on those sorts of issues.

                                           Has this matter been raised with the government previously? I'm aware that access to facilities has been raised repeatedly by advocates, because advocates are still being refused. The issue around information is particularly important because they can't always do their job if they can't get access to information. I understand what you are saying about the royal commission, but is there anything that you have looked at that you can do in the meantime, because, as I have already articulated, it's some time before we are going to see the changes via the royal commission?

                                            I recognise this is a very difficult issue. Access to that sort of information and even premises is a difficult issue because appropriate permissions are obviously required and there are also privacy issues that come into these things. Rather than looking to make specific changes through this process, I go back to the point that even the opposition made a moment ago: we're best to address these sorts of things through a consolidated and considered process, particularly off the back of the royal commission, acknowledging that it is an issue.

                                             To a certain extent, I take your point. My concern is very much about the issues that are happening right now and how we can ensure that in the interim there are actions taken to ensure that advocates can do their job, particularly in light of what we're hearing coming out of the royal commission. It's not fair to make people wait for the next 18 months. I know the royal commission is going to take time; I'm not having a go at that at all. What I'm saying is people need protection now, not in 18 months time.

                                             The Carnell-Paterson review found the commission should have a systemic advocacy function, and this was highlighted previously when the commission was first set up. As this isn't being addressed in this bill, has the government got plans to actually address the systemic advocacy point?

It's to happen on 1 January this year, and that is why it is important, so that's not specifically relevant to that. It may come up in some of the other processes we have already discussed.

                                               I know it's not part of this bill. The point is there are a lot of things that are not part of this bill that should be part of this bill. I'm asking: is that on the government's agenda, and will it be part of the next lot of changes? This process could go a lot more easily if Senator Cormann hadn't walked over and asked the minister to stop answering my questions. I realise we want to get this bill through, but this is important. It's aged care, and the government knows very well what the findings out of the royal commission have been, which are horrifying. There are people in the sector who want to see changes now, not changes made some time down the track. So I can keep asking questions or the minister can answer the very legitimate questions I'm asking. I'm not trying to roll this out any longer than is necessary. I articulated to the government a while ago that I would have a series of questions to ask here. I would appreciate them being answered. I'm trying to get this done as quickly as possible. So, if the minister could answer my questions, that would be appreciated. Is the government considering a function of systemic advocacy for the commission, or is it off the agenda?
