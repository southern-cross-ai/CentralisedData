        On 30 November last year the Senate resolved to establish a select committee on Australia's disaster resilience. As of Tuesday 12 September, the committee has received over 138 submissions from organisations and everyday Australians, many of whom are still living with impacts of bushfires and floods. As I speak,

        . Australia and the rest of the world are experiencing an increase in disasters fuelled by a rapidly changing climate. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Home Affairs
        </a>
        told the committee the cost of natural disasters is estimated to increase from an average of $18.2 billion in 2016 to $73 billion in 2060. Findings from the recent royal commission into natural disasters show that extreme weather increases rates of stress, depression anxiety and, of course,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTSD" rel="nofollow">

        .

       <p>
        I think most Australians would agree that, as a nation, we are resilient. There is no doubt about that. But you can only have so much resilience. Bushfires and floods are not new to us. We are tough. In the face of danger and threats to our communities, many of us go above and beyond to help each other or even put our lives on the line. The committee heard many of these stories, often bringing tears to our eyes. But we need to be more resilient and we need to be more prepared, and this is not just a job for the governments but for all Australians, unfortunately. We all have to contribute.
       </p>
       <p>
        The big message to the committee from communities impacted by these increasing natural disasters is: without the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        , things would have been much, much, much worse. A number of submissions said that the ADF should not be the main agency for disaster relief, while others, including the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government_Association" rel="nofollow">
         Local Government Association
        </a>
        of Queensland, argue that the ADF should complement existing capabilities. Defence has stated that it will, of course respond to government direction, but that deployment to natural disasters will undermine its capacity to fulfil its primary mission of defending Australia and its interests. Defence also went on to state the establishment of a forceâ€”

         Senator Lambie, the time allocated for the debate has expired. If you were to seek leave, you could return to speak to this on the next sitting Thursday. I'm advised by the Clerk that you could also seek leave to incorporate the rest of your speech. I just ask you for an indication of your preference.
