        My questions is to Senator Conroy, the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment. Can the minister explain why Minister Burke supported handing over environmental approval power from the Commonwealth to the states through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
         COAG
        </a>
        process last year when he knew at that very time that the

         New South Wales
        </a>
        government had not complied with the National Partnership Agreement on Coal Seam Gas and Large Coal Mining Development, requiring New South Wales to consider independent Commonwealth advice on groundwater? Why did he do it when he knew that New South Wales were not even meeting their existing environmental responsibilities?

         I reject the premise of your question, Senator Milne. Minister Burke and I have answered questions on this extensively. The protections that are included and the considerations that the minister used utterly show that your question is without foundation. We have gone through a process that is thorough and we have consulted extensively. We will continue to work closely with the states and we will continue to make independent judgements, as the minister is charged to do on a variety of issues. I fundamentally reject your premise in the way that you have defined your question.

          was not complying? And now, overnight, he has become concerned about the impacts of coal seam gas on communities and the environment after he himself approved three huge coal seam gas mines and ports within six months of becoming environment minister. Does the minister's concern extend beyond the New South Wales electorates in

             That there are political considerations around electorates. I just fundamentally reject this. In August 2011 the Australian government initiated the national agenda for reform of environmental regulation through
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
              COAG
             </a>
             . At the time, Minister Burke announced the government's response to the independent review of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_Protection_and_Biodiversity_Conservation_Act" rel="nofollow">
              Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act
             </a>
             —or

              EPBC
             </a>
             , as it is more commonly known—and this included working collaboratively with the states and territories. This is exactly what I said previously.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Australian government position was that agreements should simplify the regulatory environment, make regulation more efficient and ensure that existing protections for matters of national environmental significance were not compromised. While discussions with all jurisdictions were constructive, significant challenges emerged in developing agreements that could offer certainty and consistency for business while providing the assurance that high environmental standards would be met and maintained.

               that negotiations would not be progressed, given the significant challenges that emerged in developing agreements. COAG committed to continue to work to streamline environmental regulation that delivers strong environmental outcomes and better conditions for business. The government remains committed to delivering an improved system that protects the environment and is more efficient, including by improving administrative practice and working with states and territories to improve assessment, bilateral agreement outcomes and to increase the use of strategic assessments.
