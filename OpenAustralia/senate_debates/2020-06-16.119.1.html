        (vi) without this change there are real and significant fears held by the community that the Royal Commission will miss the many stories and experiences that form the whole picture of what has happened to disabled people in this country, and to ensure that disabled people see justice and deep systemic changes needed to prevent instances of violence, abuse, neglect, and exploitation from happening in the future; and

           The government recognises the importance of witnesses' being able to give evidence safely and in confidence at royal commissions and of the need to balance this key concern with the principle of open proceedings. Receiving advice on these issues, the government is carefully considering options as to how we can best achieve that certainty. A decision by the government will be made shortly.
