       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) recognises that freedom of expression and association underpin democratic societies and affirms concerns that the election took place in an environment where not all political parties, civil society organisations and media could operate freely;

       <p class="italic">
        (d) expresses its disappointment that Cambodian people have been unable to freely choose their representatives and recognises that the development of strong democratic practices and institutions, including a free press and civil society, is crucial to Cambodia's long-term prosperity;

       <p class="italic">
        (e) reiterates that, as a longstanding friend of Cambodia, Australia must continue to urge the Cambodian Government to take steps to allow free and open political debate without violence and intimidation;

        (f) acknowledges the Australian Cambodian community for its tireless advocacy in support of human rights and democracy in Cambodia;

        (g) calls on the Cambodian Government to immediately release opposition leader Kem Sokha;

           Australia has serious concerns with the 2018 national election process, and is disappointed that Cambodians were unable to freely choose their representatives. Foreign minister Bishop raised Australia's strong concerns with Cambodia's foreign minister on 4 August and issued a statement on 30 July. Australia also chose not to send election observers. We've repeatedly raised our concerns privately and publicly, including at the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Human_Rights_Council" rel="nofollow">

           . We will continue to encourage Cambodia to take steps to allow free and open political debate without violence and intimidation. We are considering all options in response to the political situation in Cambodia.

              will support this motion. It's, again, interesting what the government defines as a contentious foreign policy motion. It seems if they agree with it, they're happy for it to be discussed. But let's be clear about this: the Greens support this motion. It is so disappointing—in fact, it's shameful—that, after Cambodia's recent sham elections, we still aren't seeing any action from this government. Other countries have taken a stand. Indeed, eminent Australians right across Australia—people like

              Not long ago, this Senate passed a motion urging
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hun_Sen" rel="nofollow">
               Hun Sen
              </a>
              to allow his citizens democratic rights. That was a Greens' motion. We now know that he hasn't allowed democracy in his country. It's time for sanctions against Hun Sen and his cronies—not just mealy-mouthed words of concern. Let's end that shameful refugee deal and let's stand up for the Cambodian people.
