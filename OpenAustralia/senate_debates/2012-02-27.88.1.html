        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Evans. I refer the minister to comments made by fund manager Pengana Emerging Companies, who said last week:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A strongly led government regardless of who is actually in power must be preferable to the current state of flux.
       </p>
       <p>
        Given the events of the past week, is it not the case that the only way Australia can again be led by a strong, stable and competent government is if we give the Australian people what they want—a fresh election to remove this weak, incompetent, divided and dysfunctional Labor Party?

          I am sure whoever that fund manager was is a really important person but, quite frankly, trying to find somebody who is a fund manager and quote them as if that has some sort of authority is pretty pathetic. The reality is that the government is getting on with the job. This government has successfully managed the economy. We have created more than 700,000 new jobs. We have an economy that is the envy of the world. Whenever you travel internationally, people want to know how we did it. How was it that our response to the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GFC" rel="nofollow">
           GFC
          </a>
          allowed us to come through in such strong condition? They want to know how our stimulus plan was so successful in ensuring that Australians kept their jobs and kept working. They want to know why we were so successful at achieving growth in employment while the rest of the world was experiencing unemployment rates of 10, 12 and 14 per cent. This government has been successful at managing the economy, allowing the economy to grow and providing jobs and opportunities for Australians. What we know is that this is in stark contrast to the opposition, who have no policies. They can only criticise. They can only oppose everything that is done. But we are getting on with the job. We have actually put a price on carbon. It comes in on 1 July. It is a major economic and environmental reform that will see this country set up to take advantage of a clean energy future. It will transform our economy for the long-term benefit of Australians. We are getting on with those things.

           The Senate
          </a>
          will get the chance to debate the mining tax in the next few weeks. This will allow the Liberal Party to make a decision about whether they are going to give the revenue from the mining tax not to the Australian people but to the miners. They will have to slash the education and health budgets to give the money back. I will have a quiet bet with you, Senator Ryan, that you change that policy before the election.

             What I do know is that this government is getting on with continuing to support growth in the Australian economy and supporting jobs. This question is from the Liberal Party, who actually opposed us funding the reconstruction of Queensland following the natural disasters. They came into the parliament and opposed the reconstruction effort, because they oppose everything. They did not think we should rebuild Queensland bridges and roads. They did not think that was a good idea. The National Party sat silent again when these important debates were on.
            </p>
            <p>
             This government is delivering jobs and supporting Queensland reconstruction. It is ensuring we have a price on carbon and that we get the benefits of the mining boom spread throughout our economy. All the opposition do is oppose and have negative attitudes to every proposition that is put before this parliament. They have nothing to offer the Australian people. This government is getting on with the task at hand.

              , I ask a further supplementary question. I could refer the minister to the wealth of material from last week but I will refer him now to comments made by Tribeca Investment Partners, who said, 'It is probably hard to find an organisation in Australia that is more poorly run than the Australian government.' Given this, and given the comments that have come from his own side of the chamber over the past week, why should the Australian people have to tolerate their government being the worst run organisation in Australia and why don't you let them elect a better one?

               What I do know is that fund managers and investment firms understand that there is only one side of politics committed to producing a surplus. There is only one side that has a responsible economic program, and that is the Labor government. We do not have a $70 billion black hole. We are not going to have to slash health or education so we can give back money to the mining companies who have record profits. That is your economics. That is the voodoo economics that

                 Apparently Senator Cormann, as part of the economic team of the Liberal Party is 'growing a cake'. All I know is that he has to find $70 billion in cuts to education and health and he has to give money back to the mining companies. And they are going to take away the savings from the private health insurance rebate change as well. None of their economics adds up. They have no plans and they have no-one who is literate in economics.
