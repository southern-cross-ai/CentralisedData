        My question is to Senator Nash, the Minister representing the Minister for Health. I refer to the Prime Minister's statement earlier today:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We made certain commitments in last year's budget and those commitments carry over into this year's budget.
       </p>
       <p>
        Can the minister confirm that the Abbott government has locked in $60 billion worth of cuts to health and hospitals over the next decade?

         What I can confirm is that this is a fair, measured and responsible budget. What I can confirm is that this is a budget that is going to lead people to jobs and prosperity. What I can confirm is that this is a budget that is going to give people hope for the future and it is going to give them a positive way forward, across this country, unlike previous Labor budgets that we have seen in the past.
        </p>
        <p>
         I might refer those opposite to Budget Paper No. 1. Those opposite may not have noticed yet, but overall the health budget increases year on year—indeed, to more than $7.6 billion over the forward estimates. And isn't it ironic that it is those on the other side, including the failed former finance minister, that are responsible—

           , I rise on a point of order going to direct relevance. The question asked for confirmation of whether $60 billion worth of cuts to health and hospitals over the next decade are locked in—not the general background to the budget, not the general health budget, but the cuts of $60 billion.

             . Indeed, I was getting to that part of my answer before I was interrupted by those on the other side. As the senator mentioned, the 10-year funding outlook from the Labor government was absolutely made-up money. It never existed; it was never there. They are talking about cuts from money that they were never going to deliver, and they were never going to deliver it because they left us a trajectory of $667 billion worth of debt. That is money we were never going to get to. That is why we focus on making sure that we address the positives. In the forward estimates from this government, overall, the total budget for health funding is going to increase—$7.6 billion.

              , I ask a supplementary question. Can the minister confirm that a further $2 billion has been cut from health, including from preventative health care, drug and alcohol rehabilitation, and mental health services? Which specific services will be cut?

               Again I reiterate that this is a fair, responsible and measured budget. In relation to the senator's question, we have made sensible decisions that do two things: they move to fix the economic mess that the previous Labor government left us, at the same time ensuring better health outcomes for the Australian people. Now, those on the other side know it.

                         As I have said from the outset, this budget is about ensuring we have better outcomes for health, and that includes for rural and regional areas. Indeed, isn't it interesting that those on the other side continue to be negative? You never hear a positive word from them. They are not asking about the positive things that are happening in regional areas—

                           , I raise a point of order going to direct relevance. The minister was asked a simple question of detail about what was in the budget: how much has been cut from the Rural Health Outreach Fund and which services will be affected? It is a straight question. I would ask you to ask her to be relevant to the question.
