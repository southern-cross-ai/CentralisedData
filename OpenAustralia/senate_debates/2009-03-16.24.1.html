        My question is to the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator Carr. Given the Science Meets Parliament events taking place around
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">

         I thank Senator Collins for the question. Science has enormous power to improve our lives and fulfil our aspirations. It can give us better health, cleaner energy, smarter technologies and new industries. It can help us answer the big challenges of our time, from food scarcity to climate change.

           This may not interest you, since you have so little interest in science, but the government is determined, irrespective of your ignorance, to extend and strengthen Australia’s scientific capabilities. We have introduced
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HECS" rel="nofollow">
            HECS
           </a>
           remissions and refunds to get more undergraduates studying maths and science; we have doubled the number of Australian postgraduate awards to support young researchers in science and other disciplines, and it is also our ambition to increase the value of these awards over time; and we have created the Australian Laureate Fellowships for senior researchers and 1,000 Future Fellowships for researchers in mid-career. In 2008 we allocated an extra $1.58 billion for teaching and research facilities in Australian universities to support the study of science and other disciplines. We also want every Australian child to develop an interest in science and basic scientific skills. Our Nation Building and Jobs Plan includes $1 billion to build up to 500 science laboratories or language learning centres in secondary schools. Just last week we announced a new project to improve science education for Indigenous students in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
            Far North Queensland

           . In doing these things we understand just how important science is for Australia’s future.

             gives researchers, businesses and government agencies the chance to work collaboratively on scientific, technical, social and environmental problems of national significance. The first 15 CRCs were established 18 years ago, in March 1991, by the late
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Button" rel="nofollow">
              John Button
             </a>
             . Since then, Australia has benefited from the work of 168 CRCs, including the 48 that are operating today. The program has been widely emulated overseas. Last year the government issued new guidelines to refocus the CRC Program on public good and the needs of end users. That was to overturn the policy positions the previous government had to undermine the CRC program. Applications for the 11th round of CRC funding close this week. This is a great program, an iconic program, and a program which all Australians should be proud of.

                 Even Senator Abetz should understand that simple proposition. No one country can provide all the answers, not even a country with a scientific tradition as strong as ours. That is why we need more international collaboration. The government has opened important Australian research fellowships and awards to overseas applicants. We want the world’s best and brightest to work in this country, regardless of nationality. We have extended the International Science Linkages program and removed restrictions on the use of the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Research_Council" rel="nofollow">
                  Australian Research Council
                 </a>
                 funding for travel by international collaborators. We have also stepped up Australia’s involvement in the square-kilometre array radio telescope, arguably the biggest international research project. Participating in global science networks and partnerships will help us deliver better science outcomes for Australia and the world.
