        My question is to the Minister for Employment, Senator Cash. I refer to the instrument signed by the minister on 6 November 2014, in her former capacity as the Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, which removed labour market testing under four bilateral free trade deals. Last week the minister told the Senate:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The policy of the government is very clear … where there is an Australian ready, willing and able to undertake work, that Australian should be employed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Can the minister explain how her statement is consistent with the removal of labour market testing?

         I thank Senator Cameron for the question. You know when Senator Cameron has had a bad day, don't you? He must be hurting over the imposition of law and order on the building and construction industry, which occurred today—a significant economic reform for this government. In relation to the question, I do remember at the time, in relation in particular to the China free trade agreement, which was one of the agreements that this government signed, the opposition from those opposite in relation to ensuring that businesses in Australia are as competitive as this government can make them. But I also, Senator Cameron, remember the irony of the time in relation to the

                   Those opposite would know that, in relation to foreign labour and access to it, our free trade agreements are consistent with world trade obligations. But they are also similar, if not identical, to free trade agreements that the Labor Party signed when they were in office.

                      I disagree with you that she has not gone near the question, because she is now addressing matters to the question but has not specifically answered the detail of your question; however, the minister is certainly addressing the question.

                       As I was saying, in relation to ensuring that Australian businesses do have opportunities under free trade agreements, it is this side of the chamber that has ensured that those free trade agreements are signed up. And, in relation to access to foreign labour under free trade agreements, what we do is ensure that those clauses are consistent with our other international obligations.

                          As I said when I was addressing that amendment last night, those of us on this side of the chamber and the Turnbull government firmly believe Australians first. We have always maintained that, when there is an Australian ready, willing and able to undertake a job, they should always be looked to first. But we also believe that, where a business needs to access labour and they are unable to, unlike those on the other side, we are not prepared to stand by and let that business close down.

                              As I was saying, those of us on this side of the chamber believe that, where a business is unable to access labour, the last thing we want to see is that business close down, because a business that closes down employs no-one. But the Prime Minister and all of us on this side of the chamber have always been consistent in our comments; we do believe that you should look locally first.

                                 Well, Senator Cameron, we are not. And the passage this morning of the Australian building and construction legislation shows that we are committed to ensuring that we grow our economy. We support our third-largest industry in Australia that employs over 1 million Australians and in which over 300,000 small businesses rely on this industry for their own success. The fact that we have stood up for those businesses and for those industries whilst those opposite did exactly what
