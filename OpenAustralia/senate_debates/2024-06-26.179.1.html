         I'm not sure under which part of the portfolio this comes, but I think it relates to the Governor-General's salary and the bill that this Senate passed this morning. The point I was making there was that it is misleading to suggest that a salary is increasing from the figure that you have used, Senator Roberts, to that high figure, because what it does not take into account is the other income streams that were available to former Governors-General. So this is an adjustment, yes, but it's an adjustment being made because the incoming Governor-General does not have a military pension that will supplement the income stream and because the Governor-General's salary has been traditionally linked to the salary of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice" rel="nofollow">
          Chief Justice
         </a>
         of the High Court. That salary is determined by the Remuneration Tribunal.
        </p>
        <p>
         I think the point you were making this morning in debate and the point that Senator Waters, surprisingly, was making in debate was this was some significant pay increase in the order of 43 per cent, when that is not correct. Former Governors-Generals have had two income streams, particularly if they've been in receipt of a pension. This legislation we passed today was to ensure that a commensurate salary be provided for an incoming Governor-General who only has one income stream. So it is not accurate to say that a position has had an increase of that order. It is simply not correct. It is misleading, it is disingenuous and it's seeking a popular headline, which I agree is easy to get if people don't understand the detail that underpins that decision.

           The answer is 43.2 per cent. Governor-General Jeffery's salary was $365,000.

            I don't have those figures at hand, but I do understand that the salary that has been agreed to and passed by this chamber this morning and by the House earlier in the week is in line with the salary that the current Governor-General has been earning with the income streams available to him. It might be slightly adjusted for the fact that it lasts over five years, because, once the Governor-General commences in the role, no further adjustments can be made to salary. But it is in line with what His Excellency Governor-General Hurley is earning at this point in time.

               I can assure Senator Roberts that, no, I did not mislead the parliament and I have been clear—indeed, I was clear in the last answer that I gave—that there is some adjustment for future increases based on the fact that the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice" rel="nofollow">
                Chief Justice
               </a>
               has a salary determined annually by the Remuneration Tribunal.

                The Governor
               </a>
               -General's salary cannot be increased by that, so there is work done, based on some analysis about what that should appropriately be. But, no, it's not based on today's inflation forecast, and it's incorrect to continue to say that it has nothing to do with the fact that His Excellency currently is in receipt of a military pension in addition to the salary that he draws as Governor-General. The simple reality is that the legislation that passed this chamber addresses the fact that there is one income stream, and this allows them to be paid in accordance with what's currently being paid.
