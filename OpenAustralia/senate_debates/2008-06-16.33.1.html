        My question is to the Minister representing the Attorney-General, Senator Ludwig. I refer the minister to allegations concerning threats and demands made by the member for Robertson at Iguanas nightclub on Friday, 6 June. Has the Attorney-General considered whether any offence against Commonwealth law may have been committed by the member for Robertson? Has the Attorney-General referred the matter to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_Public_Prosecutions" rel="nofollow">
         Director of Public Prosecutions
        </a>
        with a view to considering whether grounds exist for a prosecution to be brought, in particular under section 139.2 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code?

         I thank the honourable senator for his question. As the honourable senator would be aware, this is a matter that is currently being investigated by the

          , I ask a supplementary question. Given that section 139.2 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code makes it an offence punishable by 12 years imprisonment for a member of either house of the Commonwealth parliament to make an unwarranted demand with menaces directly or indirectly related to any influence the member of parliament may have with the intention of causing a loss to a person and given what is already known of this incident, as acknowledged by both the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister, does the minister not consider it is now appropriate for a reference to the

           As the honourable senator would know, these matters are currently seized by the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
            New South Wales
           </a>
           authorities and as such, as I have said, it would be inappropriate to comment on it any further. If there is anything that I can add to that, I will seek the Attorney-Generalâ€™s advice and provide it subsequently.
