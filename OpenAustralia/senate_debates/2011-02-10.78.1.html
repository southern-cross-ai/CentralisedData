          . My question is to Senator Ludwig. Under the government’s proposed flood tax, people who have received the disaster recovery payment are exempted from paying the tax. What has been the increase in the number of applicants for the disaster recovery payment other than in the areas affected by Cyclone Yasi since the announcement of the flood tax?

           I thank Senator Humphries for his question in relation to the flood levy. I see the opposition are starting to warm to it, and we certainly call on them to support it. Australians understand that there is a lot of work ahead to rebuild the flood affected areas of Queensland, that the reconstruction will be difficult and that it will take years to rebuild. This disaster will have significant impacts on the budget—there is no doubting that. The scale of this disaster means that we have had to make difficult decisions. The federal government estimates we will need $5.6 billion to rebuild flood affected regions, with more than $5 billion going on rebuilding essential infrastructure. The natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements provide for the Australian government payment of $1,000 to people who have been affected by the flooding and has been sought by people from Emerald right across South-East Queensland to Brisbane and the like. Approximately 328,000 Australian government disaster recovery payments—the $1,000 for eligible adults and the $400 for children—have been made across Australia, totalling $388 million. It is also worth putting on the record that, in relation to supporting disaster recovery income subsidies, there has been 32,000—

            , a point of order directed to relevance: the minister has three seconds to go in his answer. In response to the point of order taken in relation to the last opposition question, when the point was that the minister was asked for a number, you upheld Senator Conroy’s argument that the minister still had some time to go. It is fair enough that a minister can address a question generally, it is fair enough that there can be a degree of preamble, but when the sessional order requires direct relevance and the question asks for a number it cannot be right, Mr President, that at the very end of the answer the minister still has not approached the question. It is not enough for you to say, with respect, Mr President, ‘He still has some time left.’ He has hardly any time left and he has not addressed the question yet.

                I thank the opposition for their question. The natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements, as I have outlined, include two parts. Approximately 328,717 Australian government disaster recovery payments totalling approximately $388 million have been made across Australia. What that contemplates, firstly, is that those are the payments that have been made to date for those areas across—

                  There were two parts to the question: the second part related to the estimated total. This is a demand driven program. Those people who make an application and meet the eligibility criteria receive the payment, which can be $1,000 for individuals and $400 for children in the family. What we now have, unfortunately, is the opposition playing politics with a payment for individuals who have been flood affected right across Queensland. Of course, what that payment is designed to do—

Centrelink has longstanding arrangements to ensure the accuracy of payments, that the eligibility criteria are met and that people are provided assistance based on eligibility criteria. Right across South-East Queensland, which has suffered the devastation that has been shown on television and reported in the press, there are many households and families who have lost possessions and lost belongings. These payments are designed to ensure that they can get back on their feet as soon as possible.
