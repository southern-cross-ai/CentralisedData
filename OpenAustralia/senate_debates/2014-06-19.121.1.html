        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development, Senator Johnston. I refer to the government's decision to freeze Federal Assistance Grants and rip $925 million from local councils over the next four years. Is the minister aware of comments by the Municipal Association of Victoria president, Councillor Bill McArthur, that these cuts will be a:
       </p>

        … black hole in Victorian council budgets, with much of it in rural communities.

        Is the Municipal Association of Victoria right?

         The 2013-14 budget saw $2.2 billion allocated to local governments under the Financial Assistance Grant program. This includes an accelerated payment of $1.1 billion, which was paid in June 2013. The remaining $1.1 billion will be distributed in 2013-14. In the 2014-15 budget, the government announced that the indexation applied to the Financial Assistance Grant program would be paused for three years. This savings measure delivered $900 million. As a result, the national financial assistance pool will be an estimated $9.3 billion over the forward estimates. This will continue to fluctuate due to changes in the population estimates by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Bureau_of_Statistics" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         The situation is that we will accelerate the payment of $1.1 billion to June this year and distribute the remaining $1.1 billion, as I have said, this year for the Financial Assistance Grant pool. Funding increases through the Roads to Recovery program provides an additional $350 million in 2015-16. The

          Black Spot Program
         </a>
         , much of which I talked about yesterday, provides an additional $200 million in 2015-16. This will significantly impact and offset the effect on local governments from the freeze on the Financial Assistance Grant program. They are paid equally in quarterly instalments to state and territory governments for immediate distribution to local government bodies. That immediate distribution helps them greatly. The fourth quarterly payment to local government—

              As I was explaining yesterday, the Roads to Recovery program is what is going to adjust this situation. We have advanced much money in this budget, in stark contrast to what went on under the previous Labor government. In re-introducing the fuel indexation for fuel, we are enhancing regional infrastructure and delivering new road infrastructure projects. We are reducing indexation to assist in funding by raising approximately $2.2 billion. This money is going into regional infrastructure. Regional infrastructure is something that the previous government—

Should it be Home and Community Care, libraries, emergency management, roads in regional areas or Meals on Wheels to the elderly? That is an easy one! Have a crack.

                               health as a priority. As we have reinforced through the budget, we are committed to the delivery of effective and efficient health services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. In 2014-15, more than $920 million will be spent on the provision of Indigenous health programs. Overall funding levels for Indigenous health will continue to grow over the next four years. From 2014-15 to 2017-18, the government will invest $3.1 billion in Indigenous-specific health programs, an increase of over $500 million from under the previous Labor government in 2009-10 to 2012-13.

                               This government is committed to the development of more sustainable and viable services. Through the budget, we will expand activity in the key areas of child and maternal health and chronic disease prevention and management. These are priority areas to close the gap. We are expanding programs that have demonstrated their effectiveness in improving health outcomes. There is Better Start to Life, with an investment of $94 million to expand efforts to improve child and maternal health, and the expansion of Healthy for Life, with $36 million to an additional 32 Aboriginal community controlled health organisations to improve management of chronic disease. From 1 July 2014, the Indigenous Australians Health Program will be established, consolidating four existing funding streams into one, giving more flexibility and improving outcomes. Unlike the previous government, we are going to take the decisions to direct funding towards efficient and effective health services that ensure real outcomes.

                                   people. I recently announced the development of an implementation plan for the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Plan before the end of the year. We will be developing a targeted on-the-ground implementation plan in order to translate those good intentions into actions. It is only through targeted and strategic action on the ground that real outcomes can be realised. I would like to acknowledge the important work that has gone into the health plan by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, stakeholders, peak groups and representative organisations, who contributed to the framework. I look forward to working with those stakeholders so that we can ensure we turn that very good framework into real action and real outcomes on the ground.
