        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. Minister, over the last few days we've seen widespread media reports that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcia_Langton" rel="nofollow">
         Marcia Langton
        </a>
        , who is leading the 'yes' campaign, has attacked fellow Australians who intend to vote no in the upcoming referendum. As reported in the
        <i>
         Bunbury Herald
        </i>
        <i>
         ,
        </i>
        and subsequently in the national media, Marcia Langton described their position as being 'base racism' or 'sheer stupidity'. Minister, will you join with me in condemning that type of attack and acknowledge that on 14 October, many Australians will vote no for good and sensible reasons?

         Thank you to Senator Cash for the question. I'd make a few points. The first is that Marcia Langdon is a respected academic who was appointed by, from memory, your government to work on the proposed Voice to Parliament. I would also make this point that everyone comes to this debate with their own experience, but I would encourage all of us to come to this conversation in the spirit of respect and empathy and to represent people's contributions faithfully. If the question is, '
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_I" rel="nofollow">
          Do I
         </a>
         agree with the accusation of racism?', no, I don't. I think this is an important moment for the nation. It's an important moment for the nation because our
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          First Nations
         </a>
         Australians have come to us and asked us to listen. The request from First Nations Australians comes at the end of a long process, and I think it is incumbent upon all of us to engage openly and honestly. Every Australian has a vote, and every Australian is entitled to their own opinion, but people aren't entitled to their own facts. The national conversation should be based on fact, not fear. Those of us in this—
        </p>
        <p>
         People can look at this conversation right now and see which of us is behaving respectfully for different opinions, Senator Cash. We set the tone here in this chamber. We have a responsibility to engage honestly and to call out misinformation and dishonesty and division wherever we see it. I would hope this could be a moment of unity. We owe it to those who've been involved in years of work, from those at the First Nations constitutional dialogues to the Uluru Statement from the Heart to the legislation passed here in the chamber and the referendum itself. I'd urge fact, not fear, to be the basis of this discussion.

           Minister, will you join me in acknowledging that many Australians who are considering voting no in the upcoming referendum—and that actually includes a large number of Labor voters—are doing so because they feel, on a good and principled basis, that the proposal divides Australia on the basis of race?

            I would start by saying that every Australian gets a vote and every Australian will come to this and make their own decision about how they want to vote in the upcoming referendum. I and those of us on this side and some even on that side would urge Australians to listen to what is being proposed and to listen to Aboriginal and
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
             Torres Strait Islander
            </a>
            people in what is a modest ask—an ask for a committee, which will be legislated, including with the input of those opposite, to try and ensure we get better outcomes for our

             First Nations
            </a>
            peoples. What I would say is that, again, it was disappointing to see there are some in this debate who are talking about running on fear. And I would say to Australians—

                Well, I will use my words, actually. And I will respect, as all of us should, that Australians will come to different views about this, and they're entitled to. All of us are entitled to; we all have a vote. I would say that I would urge that the way in which we conduct this debate be respectful, that the debate recognises the different life experiences that we all bring to this discussion, that it would recognise that there are different views, and that we pause at least—and this is what I would ask of Australians—to listen to what is being asked for.
