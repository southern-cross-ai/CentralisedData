              in response to a petition seeking a review to enable reclassification of service by Rifle Company Butterworth from 1970 to 1989. As illustrated, this matter has been reviewed a number of times, including several of an independent nature. These reviews, several in the context of medal recognition, have concluded that service at Butterworth during this period is not considered warlike.
