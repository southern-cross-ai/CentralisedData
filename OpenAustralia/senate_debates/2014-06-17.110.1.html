           The government extends its sympathies to the family and friends of Mr Seemanpillai. The Australia Asylum Seekers Assistance Scheme service provider has been in ongoing contact with the family and friends of Mr Seemanpillai regarding funeral arrangements. An offer of repatriation was made; however, the family preferred that a funeral take place in Australia. I understand that the funeral service will take place on Wednesday 18 June at noon at St Mary of the Angels Basilica in Geelong and that the funeral costs are covered through the Asylum Seeker Assistance Scheme.

           The issuing of documents for nationals of other countries is a matter for those countries. To make a visa application valid, travel documents are required. Family members need to hold valid visas to enter Australia. Any application for a visa is assessed by the department against relevant criteria. The Minister for Immigration has no power to intervene in the granting of a visa in the circumstances that relate to the case of Mr Seemanpillai's brother.

              I take a special interest in this case, because Leo was a gentleman who resided in Geelong. The minister does have the power to intervene here and to introduce a special purpose visa. I think something should be known about a decision that Leo made, and that is the decision to become an organ donor. We have this debate in the abstract. What we should also know is that, because of the decision that he made, there are now Australians who have a kidney where they previously did not have one, and they have functioning lungs, because he has donated his lungs to ordinary Australians. He has donated a cornea so that Australians can live the life that he was denied. The very least we can do is give the opportunity for his family to come to this country to grieve and say goodbye to their son, who has given his life so that others in Australia can have the opportunities that he was denied.
