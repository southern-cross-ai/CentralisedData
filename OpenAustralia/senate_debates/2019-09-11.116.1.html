        (i) since my last motion on this issue in the Senate, there have been a further 6 women killed by violence in Australia, taking the overall national toll for 2019 to 35, as reported by Counting Dead Women Australia from Destroy The Joint, and a further death of a young woman in Queensland is still under investigation,

       <p class="italic">
        (v) in 2017, young women aged between 15-34 accounted for more than half of reported sexual assaults,

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii) legislate for 10 days paid domestic and family violence leave so that women do not have to choose between paying the bills and seeking safety,

           This is a serious issue and it has been stated previously by the government that violence against women and children is an issue this government is responding to with the largest ever investment, of $340 million, into the Fourth Action Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children. We have finalised the fourth action plan, recognising that the policy and funding to reduce family and domestic violence is a shared responsibility between the states, territories and, of course, the federal government. The Morrison government is absolutely committed to continuing the work with the community, the corporate sector, academia and across government to improve the safety of women and children.

              Centre Alliance supports this motion, but I've asked for it to be split because we have concerns about paragraph (b)(iii). We absolutely support providing domestic violence leave to those who need it, but we are concerned that requiring small businesses to provide 10 days of paid leave could be a significant impost on those businesses which many would struggle to manage.

                    Leave is not granted. This is not an opportunity for debate. This happens a lot. It is not up to me to grant or not grant leave. What I'm going to do now is put the substantive motion without (b)(iii), because the motion can stand on its own without (b)(iii), and then we'll vote on whether to incorporate (b)(iii) as part of the final resolution.

                       But is there precedent for splitting subparagraphs of motions? I'm happy for you to consider it and deal with this today. It's just that we could end up in the situation of having a lot of division of motions if we go down that path.

                        I have always been advisedâ€”and I'm happy to be corrected by the Clerk now or laterâ€”that, as long as it makes sense and we don't have an incoherent motion where there are words missing or calls missing, we can put parts of a motion separately. The way I read this, Senator Patrick has asked to consider (b)(iii) separately, which may be a substantive issue, but the motion would still make sense without (b)(iii) in it. It just means that (b)(iv), b(v) and (b)(vi) would become (b)(iii), (b)(iv) and (b)(v). If I'm incorrect about that advice to the chamber, I will come back. The Clerk is happily nodding to me.

                              Senator Waters, please! This is not an opportunity for debate. In the past this motion has been voted on. There has not been a division, but it is not correct to assert the motion has not been voted on and a senator is asking for it to be voted on for the first time. That is incorrect. They get decided on the voices; they just don't go to a division. They have the same force of the Senate. This may or may not go to a division, but I think it is an unfair reflection on any senator who asks for a motion to be split to be making an assertion about what they may express. This is formal business where we don't debate. There are other opportunities for debate. I will respect the will of the Senate, which is that a senator is allowed to vote on a clause separately. My ruling hereâ€”and I will advise the chamber if I am wrongâ€”is that (b)(iii) can be excised and voted on separately, because it does not affect the sense of the motion, even if it is a substantive issue. First, I will put the motion, absent clause (b)(iii). The effect of that would be that (b)(iv), (v) and (vi) become (b)(iii), (iv) and (v) if (b)(iii) is not supported. The question is that the motion, with (b)(iii) excised, be agreed to.
                             </p>

                              Question agreed to.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              Now the question is to include (b)(iii) in the resolution.
