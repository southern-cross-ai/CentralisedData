        There were articles in the

        yesterday in which it was reported that I denied ‘receiving any funds from Metcash when challenged over the election donations’. This is one part of a misrepresentation or probably a misunderstanding. I was not, to my knowledge, challenged over election donations. The tenor of the question relayed to me by my media officer was whether I had accepted payments for my personal benefit. I have never taken a corrupt payment in my life, and I said that. When, 24 hours later, further questions went to the issue of campaign donations I repeated that I had not received any donation from Metcash.
       </p>
       <p>
        I repeat: I have not received any donation from Metcash. The campaign donation referred to went directly from Metcash to the then Queensland branch of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Party_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         National Party of Australia
        </a>
        . I am informed by the party that it banked the donation in its central campaign account in July 2007.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another misrepresentation was suggested in the article, quoting an unnamed political observer that I ‘should have been more upfront in disclosing a conflict of interest’ in referring the matter concerning Metcash and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
         ACCC
        </a>
        to the Senate. There is no conflict of interest. This matter is governed by a standing order of the Senate, specifically standing order 27(5), which states:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A senator shall not sit on a committee if the senator has a conflict of interest in relation to the inquiry of the committee.
       </p>
       <p>
        This matter has been considered by the Senate before and the President indicated that the standing order applies to situations where a senator has a private interest in the subject of the committee’s inquiry which conflicts with the duty of the senator to participate conscientiously in the conduct of the inquiry.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my case it is clear that I do not have a private interest. My interest as a senator pursuing my duties in this case is a career-long commitment to increase retail competition. Any donations facilitated by me for my party are by way of electoral donations and not personal ones. I note that the Liberal and Labor parties have also received donations from retail concerns, and that should similarly not raise questions as to a conflict of interest for their senators. In pursuing my duties as a senator and in the interests of my constituents it would be remiss of me if I failed to refer this matter to a committee or to participate in the work of that committee.
