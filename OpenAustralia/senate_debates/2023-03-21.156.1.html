        The previous four ABS provisional mortality statistics data releases revealed 15.1 per cent, 16 per cent, 17 per cent and 17.3 per cent increases in excess deaths above the baseline average. Clearly something serious—I would say 'catastrophic'—is occurring in Australia and in other parts of the world. And yet, strangely, the censorship industrial complex—namely, the mainstream media and the health departments in this country—is almost entirely unconcerned about investigating this dramatic increase in excess deaths and why they may be taking place. ABS data released in 31 March 2021 dealing with data throughout 2020, the first year of the pandemic, reads as follows:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p>
        Basically, the mortality rate didn't significantly rise in 2020 but drastically rose throughout 2022 after most of the population were injected with an mRNA shot for COVID. To put it another way, Australia had 141,116 recorded deaths in 2020 and 174,717 recorded deaths in 2022, an increase of 33,601 deaths. That's over the baseline average.
       </p>
       <p>
        I recall a lot of noise from the media and health departments in 2020 about every single COVID case and the associated deaths in the entire country. So I'm curious as to why the censorship industrial complex is so uninterested in the number of excess deaths that we're currently seeing post the vaccine rollout. One would have thought that this would be a cause for great alarm.
       </p>
       <p>
        COVID-19 was associated with 8,824 deaths from January 2022 through to November 2022, which doesn't necessarily mean in each case people died from it but that in some instances they died with it, meaning another 14,062 of the excess deaths were not associated with the virus. What could possibly be driving this increase that isn't COVID that was around that time in 2022?
       </p>
       <p>
        This trend is not isolated to Australia. Last year the Scottish parliament announced an inquiry into excess deaths in Scotland since the start of the pandemic, citing an 11 per cent increase in excess deaths. Many European countries have also seen dramatic increases since the start of 2020 that simply cannot be dismissed as 'long COVID'. Eurostat, the official statistical office of the European Union, recently published an article which read:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Excess mortality in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU" rel="nofollow">
         EU
        </a>
        in December 2022 soared to +19% of the average number of deaths for the same period in 2016-2019, the highest recorded value in 2022.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to Eurostat, Germany saw a 37.3 per cent increase in deaths compared to their 2016 to 2019 average. For France it was 24.5 per cent. In the Netherlands it was 22.7 per cent. In Ireland it was 25.4 per cent. Again, the censorship industrial complex and the health departments seem largely unperturbed by what, to me, looks like a global catastrophe. Over the in

        , the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDC" rel="nofollow">
         CDC
        </a>
        's data revealed 300,000 excess deaths above the baseline average which were not actually attributable to COVID-19.
       </p>
       <p>
        Given the hysteria and fear propaganda we experienced two to three years ago, surely such incredibly high excess deaths across the world would spark some interest? Is it due to long COVID? Is it due to climate change? Maybe it's systemic racism and white supremacy! Who knows? If there was some way of determining a common factor between all of these deaths, like, for example, if they received a particular medical treatment, that would provide some clarity as to what's causing this phenomenon and perhaps help us save some lives. Of course, there is a way of determining this and getting to the bottom of what's happening. It's just that your health bureaucrats, politicians and blinkered corporate media handmaiden journalists don't want you to know.
