          I will start the question again. Minister, how is the government continuing to deliver on its pledge to reduce taxes for working families? Are there any imminent initiatives Australian families can expect for income tax relief and to ease cost-of-living pressures?

           Thank you, Senator Bishop, for that very important question. The government have cut income tax. We have cut income tax in all three of our budgets. The government know that many families are feeling the pinch, and that is despite Australia’s strong economic performance. That is why it is important to know that from next Thursday our third round of tax cuts will cut in to help with cost-of-living pressures. To give you an example, for a worker on an income of $50,000 a year, the tax cut starting on 1 July is worth—

            I would have thought those opposite would like to know about the tax cuts starting on 1 July. For a worker on $50,000 a year, there will be a tax cut, starting on 1 July, of $450 a year. These tax cuts will provide some extra help and make a difference to families on a tight budget. They mean that someone earning $50,000 is paying $1,750 less tax than they were when this Labor government came to office—that is, a reduction in tax of $1,750. It means that the worker on $50,000 a year has seen their tax bill cut by 20 per cent in three years under this Labor government.
           </p>
           <p>
            To give a couple of other examples: a worker on $35,000 has received a cumulative tax cut of $1,500 a year and a worker on $40,000 has received a cumulative tax cut of $1,800 a year. These are very, very significant income tax cuts that are being delivered by this Labor government. Our tax cuts put more incentive into the system—

              As I was saying, the Gillard Labor government recognise that it has been important to assist low- and middle-income earners—and not just workers, who are earning an income, but age pensioners. We have delivered the most significant increase in the age pension in over 100 years.

                    Yes, I am proud of the fact that this Labor government have delivered income tax cuts, as I have outlined, and I am very, very proud that this Labor government have delivered an increase in the age pension over and above the normal indexation measures it provides, because we know that those opposite did not deliver 1c extra in the age pension when they were in government for almost 12 long years—not one cent, Senator Abetz.
