        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Cormann. Former Minister for Defence
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Pyne" rel="nofollow">
         Christopher Pyne
        </a>
        announced he had taken a position with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EY" rel="nofollow">
         EY
        </a>
        stating that he was 'looking forward to providing strategic advice to Ernst &amp; Young as the firm looks forward to expanding its footprint in the defence industry'. In response, the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, Senator Birmingham, warned that 'everybody should adhere to that code of conduct, and that includes Christopher'. I note the statement made by Minister Cormann to the Senate earlier today. When did the Prime Minister write to his secretary asking him to investigate Mr Pyne's employment with Ernst &amp; Young?

         As Senator Kitching quite rightly outlines, the Prime Minister has written to Dr Parkinson in the terms I advised to the chamber earlier. In fact, he wrote to him on 3 July.

           . Senator Abetz has said: 'People do expect a standard from the ministers, and then former ministers, to ensure that that which they have learned and gleaned from their ministerial roles are not imported into other roles on which they can potentially gain financially.' Has the Prime Minister or his office discussed Mr Pyne's employment with
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EY" rel="nofollow">
            EY
           </a>

            I am aware of a public statement that former minister Pyne issued in relation to some of these other matters. But I will take them on notice. As I have indicated to the Senate, the Prime Minister has written to Dr Parkinson seeking advice on these matters, as appropriate. And, as I have indicated to the chamber, we will provide an update on these matters in due course.
