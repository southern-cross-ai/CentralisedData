        , following a practice that has occurred since 2001. The Australian Research Council Act 2001 stipulates that the act should be amended each year to incorporate the amount appropriated for the Australian Research Council and to bring up to date the details of the funds administered. This measure provides for an increase in spending of approximately $889.6 million over four financial years, applies indexation against the existing schemes and creates an additional out year.

       <p>
        The funding supports three initiatives in particular: the Research in Bionic Vision Science and Technology Initiative, the Super Science Fellowships scheme and continued funding for National

        Australia. The Super Science Fellowships scheme consists of 100 three-year early-career fellowships which will be awarded to some of Australia’s most promising young researchers. They will focus on the areas of space and astronomy, marine and climate, and future industries, all of which are very important to our economy.

        in Bionic Vision Science and Technology Initiative is looking at things like the bionic eye, which we have heard something of recently. As I understand, it is one of the few initiatives to come out of the 2020 conference that was conducted here in Canberra with some of Australia’s best and brightest, allegedly.

        has an important role in maintaining Australia’s research and skills base in the social and economic benefits that ICT capacity can bring. The opposition is more than happy to support these initiatives that are very important to the development of industry in the country and looks forward to seeing results.

It is important that we continue to support the ongoing operations of the Australian Research Council and the three specific initiatives that will build Australia’s research capacity and promote research excellence. We are a nation that is seeking to support innovation in our research and development and I commend the bill to the Senate.
