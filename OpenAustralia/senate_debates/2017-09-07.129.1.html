        My question is to Senator Michaelia Cash, the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, the Hon.

        . Let me congratulate the minister on scrapping 457 visas in relation to the maritime industry, which I was instrumental in bringing about to protect Australian maritime jobs. However, it would seem that now, in lieu of the 457 visas, the department is issuing subclass 400 visas to applicants from countries such as Mexico, Scandinavia, Ukraine, Poland and the Philippines, to name a few. The subclass 400 visas have no foundational framework, as with the previous 457 visas. There is no labour market testing in regard to that visa and there are no criminal checks, no health checks and no checking of the qualifications of the applicant by the relevant authority. The visa can be issued within 24 hours. My question is: in view of those facts, what action does the minister intend to take to ensure such visas are no longer issued in the maritime industry?

         I thank Senator Hanson for her question. In relation to the subclass 400 visa, interestingly, it was actually created by the former Labor government. The regulation establishing the visa was made on 14 March 2013, and it was signed off by the member for Gorton, Mr Brendan O'Connor, when he was the immigration minister. In relation to the subclass 400 visa, what it does—and it is fundamentally different to the 457 visa—is allow only for short-term, non-ongoing, highly specialised work. Under the policy the standard period of stay is three months or less, and 92 per cent of visas are generally granted for stays of less than three months. The visa itself, though, does allow for a maximum period of stay of up to six months—however, that is only in exceptional circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
         In terms of the visa itself, you will be aware that on 31 July we announced a review of the visa system to ensure that it is genuinely responsive to Australia's economic, social and security interests. This review includes consideration of the role and future requirements of the subclass 400 visa. Public input into this review is invited, and the period of consultation remains open until 15 September 2017. In that regard, Senator Hanson, if you do have interested parties—and clearly you do—who would like to make input to the review, clearly they are allowed to, and certainly we're able to provide you with information in relation to how they can go ahead and do that.

           Is the minister aware that, as of July 2017, there have been numerous applications from people in countries such as those I have named that are taking jobs from Australians? There are approximately 250 unemployed Australians in the maritime industry. In one case in point, they are having to leave Australia to go to Ukraine to find a job. Yet we have a fellow from Ukraine who actually has a job.

           <p>
            Thank you, Senator Hanson. In relation to the grants of this visa under this government, visa grants in the subclass 400 visa category are only granted after very, very careful consideration. In fact, the number of subclass 400 visas granted has actually fallen by around 7,000. So there's been a decrease in the number of grants by around 7,000 in the last financial year.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for the applications themselves, each application is assessed on its own merit. While labour market testing is not a legislative requirement, there are a number of things the department may request. Given time constraints, I won't go through them now, but certainly I can provide you with additional information on how these visas are assessed as well as the grant process.

               Again, thank you, Senator Hanson, for the question. Unfortunately, Senator Hanson, certainly in relation to that particular issue, often a number of union claims are made that actually don't reflect the nature of what is occurring under the visa. As I said, each application is assessed on its own merits. There may be instances where applications by members of a core group of highly specialised overseas workers meet the subclass 400—

                   Thank you, and I was just getting to the reasons that the visas are granted in that particular industry. In that industry, where a vessel is internationally flagged, for example, the company may have senior foreign crew members who have extensive experience or proprietary knowledge of that particular vessel. But, again, the overall premise of this government has always been that you must employ Australians first; however, there may sometimes be a case where foreign labour is required, and I've always—
