        I wish to speak tonight about the federal government's announcement of the successful regional
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        n projects that received federal grants under round 1 of the Regional Development Australia Fund. The first round of funds invested in 35 projects nationwide valued at $150 million. The Regional Development Australia Fund will account for $1 billion worth of funding over the next five years. This is part of the government's record $4.3 billion commitment towards regional investments, which will include health and hospitals, skills, higher education and infrastructure.
       </p>
       <p>
        South Australia was a big winner out of the first round and I would like to thank Minister Simon Crean along with his staff, the department, and the independent panel for doing such a great job with these grants. All the projects were worthy of receiving funding. These are projects that make sense because they are focused on the economic and social future of regional areas. All of these projects will benefit the whole community. Not only will the community receive the infrastructure they have been asking for, but the community will benefit from an increase in local jobs. Funds like the Regional Development Australia Fund are positive initiatives that this Labor government is continuing to engage in.
       </p>

        The beneficiaries of the projects specifically in my duty electorate of Grey, which covers most of the state, are the people from the

        s of each of the organisations receiving a grant and all were ecstatic, highlighting the benefits for each of their respective communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will start with the Flinders region of South Australia, which is north of Adelaide. They will receive a federal government grant of about $915,000 to purchase and install renewable solar power systems at 10 locations across the region. The grant funding will purchase 84 solar lights to be installed in local playgrounds, monuments, walking and bike trails, and sporting areas in Quorn, Hawker, Orroroo and Carrieton. For existing and potential new residents, this will add value to public precincts, making them safer, more attractive and more amenable to community pursuits. I understand this will encourage more community-run events and community networking. This is obviously significant in regional areas, where there is a very strong orientation in the community to participating in community events. Facilitating the strong community ethos with safer public facilities will encourage more use of those facilities. The project also showcases the region's commitment to environmental sustainability. Another beneficiary is the town of Port Lincoln, which is directly west of Adelaide with the Gulf of St Vincent, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorke_Peninsula" rel="nofollow">
         Yorke Peninsula
        </a>
        and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Gulf" rel="nofollow">
         Spencer Gulf
        </a>
        between the two. Port Lincoln will get a boost with a federal government grant of $4.5 million to construct a new purpose-built terminal at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Lincoln_Airport" rel="nofollow">
         Port Lincoln Airport
        </a>
        costing $12.66 million. Obviously this will facilitate more flights for this expanding town. The construction when completed will comprise a new purpose-built terminal building and car park with the terminal to initially cater for 220 people during peak periods. This will maintain a competitive airline environment. I believe it will increase the number of inbound passengers, which will have a flow-on benefit to many sectors including business, medical, government and tourism. It will also allow critical, time sensitive freight to be moved promptly.
       </p>
       <p>
        There will also be a valuable social gain through better access to government services including health and education and links to leisure activities. The upgrade will support economic growth and employment for the region's economy and local industries such as agriculture, seafood, tourism and mining. Importantly, approximately 20 jobs will be directly created at the airport's handling passenger and baggage security area as well as six to 10 jobs within the cafeteria. We have seen many areas of Australia take advantage of such investments where their industries have been able to thrive and create differing outlets of opportunity, diversifying the regional make-up of the area.

        website, Mayor of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_Council" rel="nofollow">
         District Council
        </a>
        of Lower Eyre Peninsula, Julie Low, stated, 'This $4.5 million is just absolutely wonderful.' The reception and the professionalism that the various councils put in for these grants are quite remarkable to see.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Port Pirie, just north of Adelaide, the Men's Shed and Community Complex will be revamped to expand its services to the community. The complex will receive $1.1 million from the grant and the project is expected to be completed by mid-2012. This complex fills an important gap in the area as there are no other facilities to provide access to skills training and employment experience. Many disadvantaged people in the region will have continued support, with the complex providing quality accredited training in retail, metal trades, hospitality and horticultural industries. It is my understanding that the construction of the complex and the fit-out will help train and employ job seekers. I congratulate Uniting Care Wesley Port Pirie Inc. for their great work in the community and the remarkable program they are continuing to provide.
       </p>
       <p>
        CEO Anthea Pavy stated that 'the whole community is excited about this' and that 'the facility will be of great benefit to people's personal and professional development'. Ms Pavy added that 200 to 300 people go through the facility a week and the expansion will see a substantial increase but will retain a close community feel.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Streaky Bay, which is north-west of Port Lincoln, will receive government funding of $1.72 million towards the $2.85 million refurbishment of the Streaky Bay Oval Precinct to support participation in recreation and sporting activities. The expected completion date is mid-2013. The growth in the council district can be attributed to the lifestyle change that many Australians are seeking. The project will importantly support skilled workers in this area.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APY" rel="nofollow">
         APY
        </a>
        Lands, the arts community in far north-west South Australia will benefit from $2.84 million federal funding for the Ananguku Arts and Culture Aboriginal Corporation, an Aboriginal owned and governed peak body for the arts. Currently, some arts centres are prevented from taking on new artists because of limited painting space. The new centres are expected to increase investment by public and private institutions in Aboriginal fine arts as well as support increased tourism. This project will directly benefit more than 640 artists and their extended families that comprise the 3,000 local Indigenous people who live on the APY Lands, as well as an additional 500 non-local residents and workers. It is anticipated that income from paintings will increase by 10 per cent across the APY region of 102,502 square kilometres. This is a great outcome, as people will be able to reap the benefits from increased income and will be able to put that money back into their local economy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I commend all organisations that were involved in the grant applications, along with the local communities who clearly had a very great interest and demand for these projects. Your hard work and activism was well worth the sometimes difficult nature of making an idea a reality. Going through all these valuable projects, it is quite apparent that successful grant applicants have a driving community behind them so that the community is entirely involved and drives the application forward.
       </p>
       <p>
        Each project will add value to the communities through the social benefits that they provide. The simple equation is that local jobs will complete these projects, and the region will reap all the benefits from them, whether that is from direct or indirect employment or simply retaining or attracting people to live in the region. I once again offer my congratulations to recipients of the grants and their local communities. I look forward to visiting the projects on their completion. I know this Labor government will continue to work hard in the area of regional development, and all of regional Australia is especially looking forward to the next round of the grants.
