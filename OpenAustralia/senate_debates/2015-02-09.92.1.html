        My question is to the Assistant Minister for

         Social Services
        </a>
        , Senator Fifield. I refer to the extraordinary open letter signed by more than 60 homeless service providers today, pointing out that, while the government budget is on a four yearly cycle, every front-line homeless support service in the country faces layoffs and closures because the government is refusing to commit to their continued funding. Will the government commit to a four-year National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness? And if not, why not?

         I think it is important to point out that the previous Labor government not only terminated the NPAH funding beyond 30 June 2014, but it also failed to provide for homelessness funding in the forward estimates.

             . As I was saying, there was no provision for NPAH funding in the Pre-Election Economic and Fiscal Outlook in August 2013 issued by the former Treasurer. In contrast, the coalition government has provided $115 million for the 2014-15 National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness, which was matched by the states and territories. It is also important to point out that the states and territories are responsible for determining priorities, and retain the flexibility to decide which services should be funded. Mr President, in the short term, future arrangements for the National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness will be considered in the context of the 2015-16 budget, while longer-term arrangements for housing assistance and homelessness services will be considered in the context of the white paper.

              I thank the senator for his answer and I rise on a supplementary question. Senator Fifield, in the context of the $115 million you identified, I presume you are awareâ€”through you,
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
               Mr President
              </a>
              â€”that that amounted to a cut of $44 million. Will the government be restoring that cut, made as part of the extraordinary cuts to the housing and homelessness portfolio? And will the government immediately reinstate the $21 million it cut from peak bodies like Homelessness Australia just three days before Christmas?

                , I rise on a further supplementary question: due to the failure of the minister to commit to funding, and the government's evident indifference to the plight of homeless Australians, can we take it that Minister Scott Morrison intends to bring the same spirit of compassion and humanity to the social services portfolio that he brought to the immigration portfolio?

                 , I can answer that question in one word: absolutely! But I will expand upon it for you, Senator Ludlam. Minister Morrison, as Minister for Immigration, showed the ultimate compassion and the ultimate decencyâ€”because his ceaseless and absolute objective was to stop people dying at sea. And I am so pleased to be able to advise all of my colleagues in this place that Minister Morrison was successful. Because of Minister Morrison's efforts, there are hundreds if not thousands of people who would otherwise have lost their lives at sea. It is a matter of great pride in this government that the people smugglers have effectively been put out of business. Minister Morrison is a man of great compassion and great decency. He wants to see Australians in work. He wants to see people who are facing extra challenges for reasons beyond their control getting the help they deserve.
