           The government's current bargaining policy offers a pay rise that is reasonable and responsible in the current environment. Despite assertions, agencies have been successfully bargaining with their employees in line with the bargaining policy, and 11 out of 12 agreements have been voted up since the federal election. Nevertheless, the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPSU" rel="nofollow">
            CPSU
           </a>
           still refuses the government's reasonable pay offer, meaning that some public servants have not had a pay rise for almost three years. Unfortunately, the union remains more interested in organising and promoting industrial action than ensuring their members receive a pay rise.
