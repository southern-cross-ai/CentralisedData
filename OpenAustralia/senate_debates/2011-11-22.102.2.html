       <p class="italic">
        On 30 September 2010 the Senate referred the following matter to the Senate Rural Affairs and Transport References Committee (the Committee) for inquiry and report by 17 November 2010:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) pilot experience requirements and the consequence of any reduction in flight hour requirements on safety;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) the United States of America's Federal Aviation Administration Extension Act of 2010, which requires a minimum of 1500 hours before a pilot is able to operate on regular public transport services and whether a similar mandatory requirement should be applied in Australia;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) current industry practices to recruit pilots, including pay-for-training schemes and the impact such schemes may have on safety;

        Aviation safety — Our most important priority
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In December 2009 the Australian Government released the National Aviation White Paper, Flight Path to the Future, Australia ' s first ever comprehensive national aviation policy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Paper" rel="nofollow">
         The White Paper
        </a>
        confirmed that aviation safety is the Government's first and foremost priority in aviation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        is committed to enhancing aviation safety and maintaining Australia's internationally regarded high quality aviation safety standards and performance.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This commitment was reiterated in the Ministerial Statement on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Safety" rel="nofollow">
         Air Safety
        </a>
        tabled by the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport on 4 July 2011.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Many of the aviation safety initiatives outlined in the Aviation White Paper cover issues examined by the Senate Committee's report.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In particular, the Government has acted on the safety funding and regulatory reform issues outlined in the Committee's recommendations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In the May 2010 Budget the Government announced an additional $89.9 million in funding for the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CASA" rel="nofollow">
         CASA
        </a>
        ) over four years.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This additional funding is being used to fund almost 100 new and ongoing staff in key surveillance roles, and to invest in the development and maintenance of safety standards and regulatory development.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The additional funding is also providing for expanded and ongoing training for CASA staff and to make sure there are sufficient resources to properly regulate Australian administered airspace, which covers almost eleven per cent of the earth's surface.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This funding represented an unprecedented 30 per cent increase in CASA funding and provides some long term stability in the Authority's funding base.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The CASA Board has recently confirmed that with the additional funding provided by the Government that CASA is now adequately funded to meet the challenges and performance expected of a world class aviation safety regulator.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In March 2010 the Government established a dedicated regulatory drafting taskforce involving specialists from CASA and the Office of Legislative Drafting and Publishing. The Taskforce was established to target the completion of the long outstanding maintenance, operations and flight crew licensing regulations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Taskforce has already made substantial progress in completing the maintenance regulations and is currently drafting several of the air transport operations and licensing regulations specifically referred to in the Committee's recommendations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Draft regulations will be made available for public comment before they are finalised. The regulations will provide improvements to areas such as regular public transport operations, flying training, flight crew licensing and training and checking operations.

       <p class="italic">
        These draft regulations are expected to be available for public comment by the end of November 2011.

       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 2
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that for non-jet operations which employ low-experience first officers, operators be required to provide enhanced supervision and mentoring schemes to offset such lack of experience.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        CASA is reviewing existing criteria in relation to induction and line training requirements for flight crew deemed to have low experience levels. This will be done in consultation with industry stakeholders and any changes to these criteria would be applicable for all pilots conducting regular public transport (RPT) operations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The new draft Operations regulations currently being developed by CASA will also detail the responsibilities of aircraft operators before they assign new or low experienced crew members to a flight.

       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 4
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that Civil Aviation Safety Regulation (CASR) Part 61 ensure that all prospective regular public transport (RPT) pilots be required to complete substantial course-based training in multi-crew operations and resource management (non-technical skills) and human factors training prior to, or in reasonable proximity to, initial endorsement training; the committee recommends that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) expedite, and assign the highest priority to, the implementation of CASR Part 61.

        Recommendation 5
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) ensure that Part 61 of the Civil Aviation Safety Regulations currently being reviewed place sufficient weight on multi-engine aeroplane experience as opposed to the current recognition of glider and ultra-light experience.

        The Government notes this recommendation which was already being progressed through the established aviation safety regulatory reform program.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        CASA has confirmed that the proposed CASR Part 61 ' Flight Crew Licensing ' prescribes minimum aeronautical experience requirements that meet or exceed the experience standards specified in Annex 1 to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_International_Civil_Aviation" rel="nofollow">
         Convention on International Civil Aviation

        ) for each aircraft category rating on a flight crew licence.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Furthermore, the new regulations would require that the total experience requirements specified for an integrated course of training be conducted in a recognised aeroplane, that is, an aeroplane that is registered by CASA, by another ICAO contracting state or is operated by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">

       <p class="italic">
        Aeronautical experience accumulated in gliders or ultra-light aircraft may be used to satisfy part of the requirements specified for a licence, although competency-based training ensures an applicant has been assessed as competent to perform a task to the standards specified for the licence in a recognised aeroplane .

       <p class="italic">
        These draft regulations are expected to be available for public comment by the end of November 2011.

       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 6
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) be required to undertake a risk assessment of current simulator training to assess whether the extent, aims and scope of such training is being utilised to achieve optimum safety outcomes rather than minimum compliance objectives.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government does not support this recommendation as CASA has confirmed that the existing legislative and oversight regulatory framework already covers this type of training activity. The conduct of aircraft endorsement and recurrent training in an approved simulator is already subject to CASA oversight and CASA currently assesses and approves the relevant training programs used by RPT operators.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        CASA is currently considering implementing regulatory changes that will increase the use of simulators for flight training and checking activities, including the conduct of certain emergency procedures, which can be more safely and effectively conducted in a simulator than in the actual aircraft. This work is being undertaken with regard to risk assessment requirements and cost benefit considerations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is expected that CASA will be putting out for public comment an updated proposal on simulator training by the end of November 2011.
