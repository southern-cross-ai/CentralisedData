        legal sector, which is under hugely increased demand, as you know, needed $229 million in the budget to ensure they can continue to deliver their critical services, including assisting women and children escaping domestic violence. The $15 million in your budget is shamefully inadequate and is an insult to our people and the sector. Will the federal government increase funding for Aboriginal and

         Thanks, Senator Thorpe. I'll answer this question in a couple of ways. The legal services that you're talking about are, of course, covered by the broader National Legal Assistance Partnership agreement that the government has. We do as a government recognise the pressures that legal assistance services are under, whether it be Aboriginal legal services or more broadly. We definitely support and note the importance of strengthening this sector because, of course, legal assistance is essential to ensuring access to justice and equality before the law. That is exactly why the Albanese government announced in this budget $44.1 million of urgent funding for 2024-25 to help legal assistance providers address current resource and workforce issues until the new National Legal Assistance Partnership agreement commences on 1 July 2025.
        </p>
        <p>
         The National Legal Assistance Partnership between the Commonwealth and all states and territories is a five-year agreement to fund vital legal assistance services for the most vulnerable Australians. As I understand it, one of the ways in which that funding will be used will be to index the wages of the very hardworking staff in those legal services, many of whom I know personally. That's the first way in which we're dealing with the issues that you've raised, Senator Thorpe. The second way, of course, is through the ongoing funding that we're providing for Indigenous justice initiatives. Achieving justice targets under the National Agreement on Closing the Gap is a key priority for the Albanese government, and it is vitalâ€”

             Senator Thorpe, I've already spent the bulk of this answer talking about the additional funding that we're providing to legal assistance services, including Aboriginal legal services. Under the National Legal Assistance Partnership, overall we're providing more than $2.4 billion over five years for legal assistance services across Australia.

                                          My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Senator Watt. The Prime Minister has said that helping Australians with cost-of-living relief is the government's No. 1 priority. I note that Tuesday's budget included tax cuts for every Australian taxpayer, provided new energy relief, invested in affordable housing, delivered cuts to student debt, strengthened Medicare and delivered cheaper medicines to Australians. How does the Albanese Labor government's budget help Australians earn more and keep more of what they earn, and why is it important that Australians receive the cost-of-living support that was outlined in the budget?

                                           Thank you, Senator Ghosh, for arguably the best question of the week, I think. There have been some other good questions, but that's an absolute cracker. This budget is responsible and restrained, which eases cost-of-living pressures, puts downward pressure on inflation and invests in a future made in Australia.
                                          </p>

                                           Tonight, of course, it is the opposition's turn to set out their plan for Australia. We've seen a lot of noes from Mr Dutton and the opposition, but Australians now want to know what he will say yes to. We know what the Albanese government is for. We're for more cost-of-living help, including energy bill relief for every household and a tax cut for every taxpayer. But where does Mr Dutton stand on that? Will he back that in tonight? It is really hard to know where Mr Dutton and the coalition stand on these issues, given the reactions of their colleagues over the last few days.

For starters, under Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, all 13.6 million Australian taxpayers will get a tax cut. But we know that, under Mr Dutton and the Liberals, those tax cuts would be taken away. It wasn't that long ago that Senator Hume, as the shadow finance minister, was saying about the tax cuts, 'We'll have to go back to the drawing board.' Well, tonight's the night for the drawing board to come out of the closet! Tonight's the night. Under Labor, wages growth is up, which is helping Australians earn more and keep more of what they earn. We know Mr Dutton wants to strip back workers' rights and force Australians to work longer for less.

I don't see what the issue is with giving every household $300 off their power bills. It's one of the great misnomers that the coalition are better economic managers.'

                                                   Senator Ghosh, I actually am surprised you had to ask that question, because those barriers are sitting right in front of youâ€”from about there right through to about there. That's where all the barriers are for the cost-of-living question.

                                                   Our plan to combat the cost of living is putting downward pressure on inflation and helping working Australians right now. I've spent the last few months, as I know many of my colleagues, including Senator Ghosh, have been, going around the country meeting with workers, with farmers and with business owners, and searching far and wide for one single idea of what Mr Dutton stands for.

                                                   I was in Armidale recently, in the electorate of Mr Joyce, where the mayor of the town in his own electorate is backing a number of renewable projects in the region. But could I find any hint of a plan from Mr Dutton? None whatsoever. Last week I was at the beef exhibition, with every member of the National Party and a few of my own colleagues in Rockhampton, and I bumped into Mr Dutton in a brand-new checked blazer from Mitchell Ogilvie in Brisbaneâ€”all $5,000 worthâ€”but could I find evidence of a plan? No. Tonight is the night. Tell us what your plan is.
