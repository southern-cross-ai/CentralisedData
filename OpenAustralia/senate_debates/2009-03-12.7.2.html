        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That the order of general business for consideration today be as follows:
        <dl>
         <dt>
          (a)
         </dt>
         <dd>
          general business order of the day no. 67 (Protecting Children from Junk Food Advertising (Broadcasting Amendment) Bill 2008); and
         </dd>
         <dt>
          (b)
         </dt>
         <dd>
          orders of the day relating to government documents.
         </dd>
        </dl>
       </p>
       <p>
        Question agreed to.
       </p>
       <p>
        by leave—I will make a short statement prior to seeking to amend government business notice of motion No. 1. There are two matters. Firstly, there has been a request, from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_Fielding" rel="nofollow">
         Senator Fielding
        </a>
        , for an amendment to allow a one-hour dinner adjournment. The government does not object to that. It appears that the minor parties and the Independents might require that hour. I do not think it will significantly affect the time on Monday and Tuesday. I have only just found out about that now, so I have not had an opportunity to refer that to the opposition.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_I" rel="nofollow">
         If I
        </a>
        take their nodding as I speak as being an indication that they are in agreement with that I will move the amended motion.
       </p>
       <p>
        Secondly, in relation to the hours motion, that hours motion will then reflect both Monday and Tuesday night late, if I could use that shorthand expression. As I understand it, there was a miscommunication about that. I am happy to move the motion as stated—that is, for both Monday and Tuesday—if the opposition are satisfied with that. I offer the additional rider that of course between now and Monday if there is a view that we might want to change or swap the hours around for the Tuesday then the government will not stand in the way of negotiation to be able to accommodate the opposition, the Greens and two Independents. It is about trying to achieve the legislative timetable for the second week, and the government understand that we will only achieve that through the cooperation of all parties in the Senate. So I add that and I suspect people will hold me to it. I seek leave to amend government business notice of motion No. 1 before seeking to have the motion taken as a formal motion.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.

         and others. In relation to the hours, we agree to the motion as it stands now proceeding. We certainly take the word of the Manager of Government Business in the Senate that, if we wish to review that, we will come back into the chamber on Monday and do so. We will be vigilantly watching the legislation and the details that will be involved. I indicate that we are very light on today. It was sought that there be an extension of hours even today, and I am pleased we did not agree to that because it would have been an absolute waste of today. Again we put the government on notice that if the chamber and the business of the chamber are not managed correctly we will certainly not agree to an extension of hours. But we will let the motion stand at this stage.

          by leave—As the chamber is aware, the Greens have promoted the idea of the Senate sitting an extra week rather than serially readjusting and lengthening its hours. But it is at the expense of private member’s time that we are acceding to this arrangement. I might also flag with the chamber generally that hopefully I have asked for the private member’s legislation relating to the banning of junk food advertisements in children’s

           by leave—In relation to the hour for a dinner break, I have raised this a number of times. I do not mind sitting long hours but it is just that you need a break, so I appreciate the government and the opposition agreeing to that. I think that we should be working longer hours rather than have taxpayers pay for another sitting week. If we can get through it there is a preference to sit longer hours rather than get everybody back here at taxpayers’ expense for another week. I think sitting longer hours does make sense.
