           The coalition government is focused on getting Australians into jobs, and our employment services programs play a vital part in achieving this outcome. The government's jobactive program began on 1 July 2015 and plays a critical role in ensuring that Australians can be placed in jobs. There have been over one million job placements through jobactive since the program began. To build on this strong record, the government has established an Employment Services Expert Advisory Panel to advise on the development of a future employment services model beyond 2020, chaired by Sandra McPhee. The coalition government also strongly believes in mutual obligation and is strengthening penalties to the small group of jobseekers who are persistently and wilfully non-compliant, whilst increasing support for jobseekers who genuinely try to meet their requirements.

              Labor will oppose this motion. We acknowledge the concerns raised in this motion and have been speaking about these issues for many years. This is particularly true in relation to safety of the government's core of jobactive programs such as Youth Jobs PaTH and Work for the Dole. However, given the fact there are currently inquiries before the Senate Education and Employment References Committee that are looking at issues particularly relating to safety in work, including the exploitation of general and specialist cleaners working in retail chains for contracting and subcontracting cleaning companies, and the prevention, investigation and prosecution of industrial deaths in Australia, we do not believe it is necessary to establish yet another inquiry. As such, the proposed inquiry is ill timed. Labor does not support the government punishing people for being out of work instead of preparing them for a job.
