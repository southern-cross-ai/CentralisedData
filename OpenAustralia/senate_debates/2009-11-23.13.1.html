        My question is to Senator Sherry, Assistant Treasurer. Can the Assistant Treasurer detail to the Senate the latest forecast for the Australian economy from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development? What does the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
         OECD
        </a>
        <i>
         Economic Outlook,
        </i>
        which was released late last week, say about Australia’s world leading performance in the face of the worst global recession for 75 years? Does the OECD expect Australia to maintain its position as one of the best performing economies in the world, with stronger growth, lower debt and lower deficits than the major advanced economies? Does the OECD
        <i>
         Economic Outlook
        </i>
        recognise the important role the Rudd government’s fiscal stimulus package has played and continues to play in the recovery from the global financial crisis and the ensuing global recession?

        <p>
         Thank you, Senator Bishop, for your interest. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
          OECD
         </a>
         has released its
         <i>
          Economic Outlook
         </i>
         and it is an especially good report card for Australia, which is again at the head of the class on a global performance comparative. The report is further evidence that Australia is outperforming the rest of the advanced world with stronger growth, lower debt and lower deficits than the major advanced economies. Australia is one of only three member countries expected to record positive growth in 2009. Just three countries will have positive economic growth; Australia is one of them.
        </p>
        <p>
         The forecasts for Australia’s growth are 0.8 per cent in 2009, 2.4 per cent in 2010 and 3.5 per cent in 2011. This compares with the OECD-wide forecast showing member economies will go backwards by an average of 3.5 per cent in 2009 before growing by 1.9 per cent in 2010. So they go backwards; Australia, at 0.8 per cent and 2.4 per cent, is well ahead of the average. The OECD expects unemployment in Australia to peak at 6.3 per cent—substantially lower than the average OECD performance of 9.1 per cent. I have reminded senators that unemployment in the United States has now reached 10.2 per cent. They are some of the reasons for Australia’s world leading performance.
        </p>
        <p>
         The report notes Australia has been less affected by the crisis than other countries, with growth supported by expansive fiscal and monetary policy. Indeed, the Rudd Labor government stimulus package has protected jobs and positioned Australia as the best performing economy in the developed world. The package has saved some 200,000 jobs. Australians should be very proud of the way in which the entire Australian community, particularly the business community, has responded in these difficult times. There are many challenges.

Does it also express a view on Australia’s finances, as they relate to the job-saving, recession-busting stimulus package?

                    Again, if those opposite are so interested in the issue of government debt, they should ask me a question about it.
