         Leader of the Government in the Senate

        , representing the Prime Minister. The Finkel review said that if we did absolutely nothing, if we went on with business as usual, renewable energy would make up 35 per cent of our energy mix by 2030. Can the minister confirm that under this government's plan the renewable energy mix will fall as low as 28 per cent of the total energy mix, meaning we will have less renewable energy under your plan than if we did absolutely nothing?

           The range estimated under the National Energy Guarantee for renewables is in the range of 28 per cent to 36 per cent. It is expressed as a range. It's a range in which you shouldn't—if I may say so, with respect—take the bottom figure, because it is expressed as a range. It is, in fact, up to 36 per cent. Senator
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Di_Natale" rel="nofollow">
            Di Natale
           </a>
           , the reason we express the range in that way is that there needs to be flexibility in the mix over the years, because these figures are projected up to 2030.
          </p>
          <p>
           What I can predict here is that renewables will be, as we both know, a growing proportion of the national energy mix. But it is also the case that coal and other carbon based sources will also continue to be a significant part of the national energy mix because we are preoccupied with two objectives and two objects above all others—they are, to have the price to consumers as low as possible and to have supply as reliable as possible. The reduction in the price to consumers under the National Energy Guarantee is projected to be between $110 to $115 to the average household per annum. Under Dr Finkel's plan, it was projected to be approximately $90 per annum. So consumers will save more under the government's National Energy Guarantee while, at the same time, they can be confident of the reliability of supply and also confident that we will keep our Paris targets.

             Thank you, Attorney-General. The Renewable Energy Target currently has industry growing at 8.8 per cent a year until 2020. But when the government's policy takes over, the industry will collapse to growth at between 0.4 per cent to 1.2 per cent a year for the entire decade after 2020. Will the government confirm this and will the government confirm that it intends to sacrifice the jobs, investment and the protection of our environment under his plan?

              Not only do I not accept it, I reject it outright. I absolutely reject it because, as I told you in my answer to your initial question, the renewable energy mix will continue to grow in that range of between 28 per cent and 36 per cent of the energy mix.

              , while I am on my feet, might I take the opportunity to congratulate you because you and the Greens, I must say, have got the Labor Party on the run. You have completely got the

               Australian Labor Party

              on the run. We have the government with a clear policy, which will have tangible and meaningful reductions to household electricity prices. We have the Greens, who are committed to an ideologically based policy which has no ambition whatsoever to reduce the price of electricity supply to households. And you have got the Australian Labor Party, a policy-free zone on this issue, chasing after you. A great political victory for you, Senator Di Natale.

                Earlier today, the government didn't comply with the Senate's order to produce the modelling to justify their claim that bills will be reduced by $115 a year. Is this because that number was plucked from the one place where the sun doesn't shine?
