        I rise to put on the record my sincere thanks to the ambassador of Ukraine, His Excellency Vasyl Myroshnychenko, for visiting my home state of Tasmania. The ambassador was the guest of honour at a reception hosted by the

        , and he met with members of the Tasmanian-Ukrainian community at an event hosted by the Association of Ukrainians in Tasmania. I was present at both those events. I also had the pleasure of having dinner with the ambassador, joined by the President of the

        of Ukrainian Organisations, Stefan Romaniw, and my husband, Robert, who is of Ukrainian descent. I'm especially grateful that Mr Myroshnychenko took the time to visit our beautiful state when he has the difficult job of appealing for help to defend the survival of his country. I also thank the ambassador for agreeing to speak at the official launch of the Australia-Ukraine Parliamentary Friendship Group, which I am hosting as chair, with deputy chair Senator Van. Many members and senators have already replied positively to our invitation, so it should be a great event.

        The illegal invasion of Ukraine by Russia has brought Australia and Ukraine closer together. It has strengthened the connection of Australians with the Ukrainian diaspora in Australia. I appreciate the extraordinary efforts of many Australians to connect with the Ukrainian community, to help and support Ukrainian refugees arriving in Australia and to contribute to the humanitarian aid in Ukraine itself. It gives me a great sense of pride that Australia is the largest non-
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        contributor of aid to Ukraine, both lethal and non-lethal. Even though Ukraine is half a world away, Australia rightly recognises that Russia cannot be allowed to succeed in its plans. If the global community had not come to Ukraine's aid, then the security, sovereignty and territorial integrity of every country would be at risk.
