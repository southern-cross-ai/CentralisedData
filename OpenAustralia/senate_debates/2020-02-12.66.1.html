        My question is to the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, Senator Birmingham. Tourism, of course, brings millions of dollars into the Australian economy each year, with over 9.3 million tourists visiting each year alone, bringing an investment of $12.3 billion; yet, because of these extreme fires, tourists have been leaving many of our favourite spots in droves, while businesses have had to lay off staff, businesses have had loss of income and communities continue to suffer. Isn't it true that the only assistance that your government has offered to these businesses in bushfire affected regions who are suffering because of this huge downturn in tourism is a concessional loan, which puts business into more debt, or recovery grants, which are only available to those who have been directly affected? Minister, does it take a burnt shopfront before your government will step in and help?

         I thank Senator Hanson-Young for her question. Indeed, the government shares her concern for many businesses across Australia who are doing it tough at present in the tourism sector, not just because of the bushfire impact. If Senator Hanson-Young consulted out across the tourism industry right around Australia she would find there are tourism businesses well outside of bushfire affected areas who faced consequences from the bushfires as a result of much of the misinformation and lies that were spreading on the internet or reported internationally about where the fire impacts were had. Equally, the coronavirus has had an impact, and is having an impact now, not just on travel in Australia but on global travel. So we have a circumstance where tourism businesses right around the country are doing it tough: those who are internationally facing and rely more upon global tourism markets, who are feeling particular pressures, and those directly in fire affected regions, such as

          Kangaroo Island
         </a>
         in our home state, Senator Hanson-Young,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         and Victoria—particularly those coastal communities, some of which I've visited, who rely upon the period of six weeks or so over Christmas for the bulk of their cash flow.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government has provided for up to $500,000 in concessional loans, which you referenced in part, Senator Hanson-Young. Those concessional loans can assist businesses in a range of different ways in terms of how they structure themselves, including accessing capital during these tough times. Those concessional loans come at zero interest for the first two years and apply at half of the bond rate thereafter. So these are highly concessional loans to help businesses who may not have the types of insurance products that some others do have to be able to see themselves through these tough times. Importantly, they also complement the efforts we're making to try to lift tourism, again notwithstanding—

           My supplementary question hopefully can get a bit more of a direct answer from the minister. Will the government reconsider the consequence of pushing small business in fire affected communities into more debt, review the eligibility of the recovery grants and put more money on the table this year?

            The government has announced a $76 million package of support for the tourism industry, which is the largest single injection into the tourism industry, on top of a record budget for
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism_Australia" rel="nofollow">
             Tourism Australia
            </a>
            . I acknowledge the work of state and territory governments of all political persuasions who are pursuing additional policies, programs and campaigns in terms of promoting their tourism industries.
           </p>
           <p>
            The government has been very clear all along that the $2 billion we have committed to support bushfire recovery is an initial investment and we will look at other ways in which we can provide for recovery and other support across communities. But I would caution Senator Hanson-Young and the Greens in terms of thinking that cash payments need be the ultimate answer to everything. In addition to the plans we spoke of before, the government has made decisions for those businesses in fire affected regions about the lodgement of business activity statements which will provide for deferred payment around tax matters—

               I am happy to be able to bring together a couple of questions I have faced. I have already addressed in this chamber the $10 million for feasibility and business case studies into, yes, a coal-fired generation facility—potentially a high-efficiency one, in Queensland. And I would note that a pumped hydro facility is also being funded out of that same $10 million. It does stand somewhat in contrast, though, to the $2 billion that we have committed towards the fire affected communities and recovery and support for them.
              </p>
              <p>
               I think it is very clear that this government's work in terms of supporting fire affected communities—whether it is the deployment of the defence forces or the financial support and programs being supplied—not just in tourism but in mental health, wildlife recovery and a range of areas, is firmly delivering all they need. And we have been very clear that there is more and there will be more.
