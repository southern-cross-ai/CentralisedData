        Before the 2022 election, the current Prime Minister said the Labor government would refer matters to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Infrastructure Australia
        </a>
        before making commitments to nationally significant infrastructure. He actually said that in his budget-in-reply speech prior to becoming Prime Minister. Then, at the election and in the October 2022 budget, the government committed $2.2 billion to the Melbourne Suburban Rail Loop project. This was without a business case or any oversight or advice from Infrastructure Australia. This was an attempt to prop up his Labor mate
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Andrews" rel="nofollow">
         Daniel Andrews
        </a>
        ahead of the November 2022 Victorian election.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Suburban Rail Loop has been widely criticised, not just by the Victorian Auditor-General but even by economists, such as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Richardson" rel="nofollow">
         Chris Richardson
        </a>
        , and by
        <i>
         7.30
        </i>
        on the ABC last night. It is a project where the first stage, costing $35 billion, is currently unfunded but works by the Victorian government have commenced. The Victorian Auditor-General has been very critical of the project and just last week issued a report critical of cost blowouts. The Victorian Parliamentary Budget Office has suggested that the cost of the Suburban Rail Loop could be in excess of $125 billion. Other estimates have it reaching up to $200 billion, such as the estimate by respected economist Chris Richardson, who also said that if the Commonwealth is cancelling projects, as we've seen in the last couple of weeks, this is the 'biggest and baddest' and that it is the project he would have started with. If you're going to be cancelling infrastructure projects in this country, this is the project that Chris Richardson would have started with. The government, however, committed $2.2 billion to this project to get it started, despite knowing that the Victorian government would have to come back cap in hand to acquire another $9 billion to at least make its completion possible. Last night, on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC's" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        <i>

        report experts, including the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grattan_Institute" rel="nofollow">
         Grattan Institute
        </a>
        , called for the program to be scrapped.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite these calls from Richardson, from the Grattan Institute, from auditors-general, from the public and from Labor premiers up and down the east coast, who would rather that projects in their home states hadn't been cancelled than that billions of dollars were funnelled into this soon-to-be white elephant, the Victorian government is looking to sign another $3 billion to $4 billion contract for construction, when we know what the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMF" rel="nofollow">
         IMF
        </a>
        said about collaboration with states and territories. The Victorian government, as of October estimates, has still been withholding information from Infrastructure Australia about the Suburban Rail Loop project. Minister, under the government's reform of Infrastructure Australia, is it the government's intention that, instead of doing its own assessment of the Suburban Rail Loop, the agency would merely be endorsing the business case undertaken by the Victorian government agency?

         Thanks, Senator McKenzie. As you know, our financial commitment to Suburban Rail Loop was an election commitment, and that's one that we've been clear on wanting to deliver. We've said we're committed to delivering on all our election commitments. The minister has been clear that she expects the Victorian government to take the business case for Suburban Rail Loop to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Infrastructure Australia

           Infrastructure Australia

          , rather than doing its own assessment, to endorse the assessments done on projects by state and territory governments. I just need clarification around your answer, because, prior to this bill getting here, Infrastructure Australia was going to do its own assessment. I'm just wondering if that will change. Will you be endorsing Victoria's assessment or conducting your own assessment?

                recommended that the government expand Infrastructure Australia powers to include social and economic infrastructure, and that includes things like sporting arenas, hospitals and parks. The government rejected that recommendation of the independent review. However, since you were elected, you have made significant billion-dollar commitments—upwards of $400 million in stadia and $2.5 billion towards the Olympic stadium and venues—that won't be subject to Infrastructure Australia's assessment. Meanwhile, you're cancelling and delaying critical road and rail projects. Why is the government opposed to Infrastructure Australia investigating and reviewing the business cases of nationally significant social infrastructure projects?

                 , the government considers that Infrastructure Australia's focus should be on nationally significant projects relating to transport, water, communications and energy infrastructure. From time to time, it may be appropriate for Infrastructure Australia to consider social infrastructure implications where it is part of a broader network analysis or place-based project advice. The government can request this work through the statement of expectations. We believe this approach minimises any duplication of the functions of regional and urban policies and programs within the government.

                   There are robust processes in place around the Olympic infrastructure investment through the intergovernmental agreement we have with the Queensland state government. As part of that, there will also be a joint business case around the Brisbane Live arena, so that work is underway.

                    We're doing a Senate inquiry into the intergovernmental agreement, and my question was about the fact that the Prime Minister made a commitment to Australians prior to the election that significant licks of cash—of their cash—that were going into infrastructure would be assessed by an independent body as to need and cost benefit. What I'm hearing the government say today is that $2.5 billion for the Brisbane Live arena won't be subject to that, nor will the $240 million for Macquarie Point Stadium in Tasmania. I note Senator Duniam is in the chamber and may have some questions of his own. Why is the government opposed to

                    <p>
                     As I mentioned before, we have robust processes in place for how the government is funding working with the Queensland state government in terms of the intergovernmental agreement in regard to Olympic infrastructure. That is robust in nature, and we are absolutely determined to ensure that we deliver good value for money for Australian taxpayers with our investment in Olympic infrastructure.

                      I do note the Greens amendment and I am foreshadowing an amendment to their amendment so that it does actually capture the commitments this government has made since coming to power, because it seems that the deal you have done with the Greens ensures that your government doesn't have to put the Brisbane Live arena or the Macquarie $240 million through

                          The government recently announced $7.4 billion in cancelled infrastructure projects as a result of the 90-day infrastructure review that took 200 days. Fifty projects across Australia were cancelled, but the review conducted by former secretary Mike Mrdak recommended that 82 projects be cancelled. Minister King has refused to release the list of projects recommended for cancellation by Mr Mrdak's review. This raises serious questions as to whether the 50 projects the government has cancelled are actually the same projects that were recommended to be cancelled and whether there wasn't a little swiftie done in the minister's office between the projects recommended for cancellation by Mike Mrdak and those that were actually cancelled by the government. The fact that projects cancelled by the government include projects that were already under construction, which were meant to be out of scope of the independent review—projects such as the M7-M12 interchange in

                          —adds further weight to the concerns of politicisation of the independent review's findings. Why won't the government be transparent and release the full list of projects recommended to be delivered?
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          We know that Mr Mrdak, in that review, did a full assessment of the full pipeline of projects not yet under construction. He recommended a number be cancelled. I know Mike Mrdak and I'm pretty sure he would've been quite specific about which projects needed to be cancelled. He recommended some projects be delayed and further work be undertaken before fully committing to them. He also recommended that some projects receive additional funding. Why won't the government release the lists that Mike Mrdak handed the minister so it can be transparent around the decisions taken by Minister King?

                           The government considered the review and then worked with states and territories to agree on which projects should be priorities. The states provided confidential information on the basis it wouldn't be published. That's the reasoning behind the government decision.

                            The request of the Senate to Minister King—and I know Minister Watt will be addressing this later today in his appearance before the chamber—wasn't for those confidential discussions. I fully appreciate that they should stay confidential between the Commonwealth and the state. The request of the Senate was for the original lists. Minister King has released publicly and in full a number of independent reviews she has undertaken. There's the maritime strategic fleet review, the independent review of Inland Rail, the independent review of national partnership agreements—I could go on and on. She's been very transparent and released the whole report and the government response, yet on this one she's refused. I'm not interested in the private negotiations between Commonwealth and state. I am interested in the full independent review and, in particular, the list of projects that the government was handed by the independent reviewers.

                             I can't really add to my previous answer, Senator McKenzie, which is that the states provided confidential information on the basis that it wouldn't be published. That's the reasoning for the government decision. The reviewers also recommended not releasing the full review that they undertook.

The deal you've done with the Greens on social infrastructure today means that those significant infrastructure projects—in the billions and billions of dollars of taxpayer money—will have no independent oversight, will not have the ruler run over them by Infrastructure Australia, as was promised by the Prime Minister when he was the Leader of the Opposition seeking to hold government.

                                                 I completely refute the assertions that you've made there. The government has robust processes in place. I know you're obsessed with the Suburban Rail Loop. I thought that, when Dan Andrews retired, it might have meant you'd find a new hobby horse.

                                                 have said that outer suburban transport in Melbourne is a priority. As we said, there would be no further investment from the federal government until that is done. We made an election commitment with regard to the Suburban Rail Loop. We're determined to deliver on it.

                                                  This amendment actually goes to ensuring that the government tables annual reports. It'll result in significant change and public accountability, which Infrastructure Australia needs to subject itself to. It was an actual recommendation from the review that the government has refused to adopt. And so, in the principle of us assisting Minister King to be the minister she should be, if an independent review recommends a certain pathway forward to increase transparency and accountability, we're going to help the government be their best selves when it comes to this.

                                                    What we've seen from this government—this city-centric Labor-Greens government—is that they don't like to get out in the regions, sit down and speak to our communities. We saw it with the water bill last week. Minister Plibersek was found wanting.

The big thing about leadership is you make the decision but you've got to be accountable and responsible for your decision-making. You have to face up to the people that your decisions hurt and you have to explain to them why you're doing it, but this government ducks for cover each and every time. That's why, for the opposition, for the Liberal and the National parties, it's incredibly important that at least one of those commissioners has an understanding, appreciation and experience of rural and regional Australia.

If consultation with affected communities and landholders is inadequate or non-existent, projects can be delayed, potentially for years. We're seeing that now with the rollout of transmission lines and renewable projects in rural and regional communities, because you don't do the consultation. You assume you can just roll into town and everyone's going to bow down and say, 'Thank you, Ma'am; thank you, Sir. Thank you for your attention,' while you destroy their lives and their livelihoods.

                                                      You need genuine consultation. It's very important for Infrastructure Australia, including at the level of the commissioners, to have an understanding of the regions and how to engage with them. It's also important that Infrastructure Australia, from the commissioners down, understand business case assessments and that they will need to factor in different reasons for large regional projects when comparing investment priorities for projects in heavily congested areas like capital cities. How do you say a major project, like sealing the Tanami, stacks up against something in a suburb when you're only going to use population as your base variable? I'm looking forward to the support of the Senate to ensure that someone, amongst those commissioners, has experience in the regions.

                                                      The opposition does not seek to frustrate the government's decision to replace a board with commissioners, even though it's not clear this reform will make material improvements to the organisation. We recognise that the independent review proposed three alternative models for governance of Infrastructure Australia. One of those models was to retain a board model, although streamline it. The panel's preferred model was to adopt the commissioner model before the Senate today. What we seek to do is strengthen the bill to ensure regional perspectives are not lost to the peak governing forum of the body.

                                                      In this context, I note there will be an advisory council established to provide advice to the Infrastructure Australia commissioners. This advisory council has not been referenced in the bill, and therefore parliament will not have oversight as to how the members of the advisory council will be chosen. There is no guarantee anyone from the advisory council will be from a regional area or have connections to the regions. We're not allowed to comment on that, because it's not part of the bill. That's why we've chosen the amendment that I'm moving now.

The government's going to have its fingers all over Infrastructure Australia—deep state, right down into the heart of Infrastructure Australia. You'll be lucky to have a regular person's perspective or expertise on how to deliver a project or how to consult with communities, because it's going to be filled with government bureaucrats. There's no guarantee the regions will have a voice, and so it's all the more important that at least one commissioner has substantial connection to the regions. The amendment doesn't tie the government's hands to require at least one commissioner to live in the regions. It understands you can take the girl out of the country but you can't take the country out of the girl. It is a world view. It is a perspective that is engrained in you from a very early age. It doesn't matter what side of the chamber you sit on. If you come from the regions, there is a recognition and an appreciation of certain things in life that I don't believe you can get through any other life experience.
