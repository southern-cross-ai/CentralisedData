        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Payne. Will the minister update the Senate on the importance of Australia's relationship with South-East Asia and the ways in which the government is strengthening our relationship with

         I thank Senator Scarr for his question. The government's strong view is that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN" rel="nofollow">
          ASEAN
         </a>
         is at the heart of Australia's vision for an open, inclusive and resilient Indo-Pacific region in which sovereign states are able to make independent choices. It's a vision which is closely aligned with the principles set out in the
         <i>
          ASEAN outlook
         </i>
         <i>
          on
         </i>
         <i>
          the Indo-Pacific
         </i>
         . And we've continued to deepen our engagement with our South-
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asian" rel="nofollow">
          East Asian
         </a>
         neighbours. Indeed, at the ASEAN-Australia summit last month, the Prime Minister announced a major investment of over $500 million in economic development and security measures to support South-East Asia's recovery from COVID-19. It's a package which is aligned with ASEAN's priorities under the
         <i>
          ASEAN outlook
         </i>
         maritime, connectivity, sustainable development, economic cooperation. We welcome the agreement also to increase the tempo of our leaders' meetings to annual summits because that opens up a new chapter in the ASEAN-Australia strategic partnership.
        </p>
        <p>
         We've also signed a strategic partnership with Thailand, we've facilitated the entry into force of the comprehensive economic partnership agreement with Indonesia and we've agreed on a plan of action with Vietnam to deliver on our strategic partnership. I also met with Vietnam's Ambassador to Australia last week and took the opportunity to particularly thank Vietnam for their leadership of ASEAN during a very difficult year, concerning the impact of COVID-19 in particular. Also, last week, I met virtually with my Malaysian counterpart on Friday, Minister Hishammuddin Hussein, and thanked Malaysia for their role as our ASEAN country coordinator.
        </p>
        <p>
         ASEAN is clearly more important than ever as we deal with the health and economic challenges that COVID-19 has brought upon us. It is galvanising the region's response to the pandemic and, in particular, playing a central role in how our region will emerge from the crisis. A strong ASEAN is critical to the recovery and the future prosperity of Australia and the region. That's why we stand together in the challenges we face.

            Again I thank Senator Scarr. There have been constraints imposed on us by the COVID-19 pandemic, but we have of course continued our strong political engagement and dialogue with our partners in the region. As well as the Prime Minister's recent virtual attendance at the

             East Asia Summit
            </a>
            , the government, under the leadership of the trade minister, Minister Birmingham, has signed the Regional Comprehensive Partnership Agreement with 14 Indo-Pacific countries. I've met together with all of my ASEAN counterparts four times since June, including a special ASEAN-Australia foreign ministers meeting on 30 June to discuss our shared COVID-19 response, as well as of course the annual East Asia Summit Foreign Ministers' Meeting and the ASEAN related meetings, both in September.
           </p>
           <p>
            Notwithstanding limited travel this year, I visited Singapore in October, affirming the strength of our relationship; and Brunei in February. Our continued engagement across government demonstrates our strong commitment to this region.

               We know that a prosperous and resilient Mekong is an important part of a strong South-East Asia region, and that's why we'll invest in a new $232 million Mekong-Australia program to support economic integration and development in the Mekong subregion. That package announced by the Prime Minister includes investments for economic integration and development, high-quality infrastructure and support for our region's emerging security needs and for the development of maritime resources. The key elements include providing scholarships for emerging leaders, creating even more valuable people-to-people links, strengthening cybersecurity and critical technology capabilities, new funding to boost jobs and growth as part of the Vietnam-Australia Enhanced Economic Engagement Strategy and opening a new liaison office in
