        The Queensland Labor government continues to fail in administering the state, particularly regional Queensland: it's an 'E' by any measure. I rise with deep concern about the scandal-ridden Queensland government's dereliction of duty in so many basic functions but, most seriously, hospital ramping at Bundaberg, Toowoomba and across the state, with ambulance officers increasingly desperate for support.

        On 17 December, one of the busiest Fridays of the year, as people roll out of work to celebrate before Christmas, pubs and clubs should be optimistic about increased takings after a very lean past 18 months. But now the Labor Premier talks about rewarding people with fewer restrictions. However, there's no reward for pubs, clubs, hotels and cafes, which have been smashed at every turn. They were the first to be closed during snap lockdowns, forced to destroy food with no compensation. They struggled to find staff to work in venues and now, just when there's a glimmer of hope that normality will return, small business owners are expected to man every entrance and have their staff be the policemen for public health requirements.

        Queenslanders are rolling up their sleeves in droves, but our coffee shop workers and bar staff have to check vaccination status and our underresourced police service is expected to respond to complaints. The lack of consistency is that you can travel on public transport, buy a sausage at Bunnings or groceries without being checked. And this imposition of restrictions will have the greatest impact on our Indigenous communities and on others who, while vaccinated, are deeply concerned at the state overreaching its mandate on keeping us safe. Even returning home, for a family or a frequent business traveller, will be financially impossible as the Queensland Labor government insist on tests at $150 per person.
