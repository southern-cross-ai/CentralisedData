        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Productivity Commission

        's draft report into workplace relations, which called for cuts to penalty rates for workers on Sundays. Does the minister agree with the Prime Minister's view that there is a case for looking again at this issue?

         review of the Fair Work laws is something that we promised the Australian people. We believed that there had to be a proper, full review of the framework of our industrial relations system. The good news is that the Productivity Commission was of the view that it needed repair, not replacement, and that is of course the policy that we adopted going into the election. We also adopted the longstanding policy in this country that all matters in relation to wage setting should be determined by the independent umpire, namely, the Fair Work Commission. Interestingly enough, that is exactly what the Productivity Commission, in its draft recommendation—and I accept that it is only a draft at this stage—said that this matter should be put before the Fair Work Commission for their consideration.
        </p>
        <p>
         Having said that, it is only a draft recommendation and undoubtedly the unions that helped to get you, Senator, into this place, will have views to put to the Productivity Commission. Then, after we have final recommendations from the Productivity Commission, we will determine that which we believe should be taken to the Australian people for a mandate in 2016. When the Productivity Commission—and, might I add, the three commissioners that were appointed—

                 In very brief terms, the answer to that question is no, but we as a government want to see high wages and productive jobs in our economy. But we also want to see more jobs in the Australian economy. So what the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
                  Productivity Commission
                 </a>
                 have said, in draft recommendations—and these were commissioners appointed by the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
                  Australian Labor Party
                 </a>
                 , with all sorts of compliments on their appointment—is that in a very few particular sectors there might be an appropriate case to be made not to government but to the independent umpire, the Fair Work Commission, to make a determination on this matter. In relation to overtime there are no suggested changes. There are no changes in relation to a whole host of matters in the draft recommendations, but I stress again that these are only draft recommendations.

                  , I ask a further supplementary question. I refer to the comments made by Liberal Senator Dean Smith, who says that young people and women are more likely to be those engaged in casual or part-time work where penalty rates apply. Why does the Abbott government believe that female and young workers deserve a pay cut?
