        n progressive labour and feminist movement, Michelle Hogan. Michelle died this month, and a loving family and community mourns her passing. She was a unionist, a feminist and a community organiser, a woman whose life's work was dedicated to advancing the cause of equality. She was a long-term supporter of the Anna Stewart Memorial Project, of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APHEDA" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and of the May Day Collective. She served as a

        councillor and was a member of the Port Adelaide National Trust. She was also the chair of the Working Women's Centre of South Australia, which provides advocacy and representation to vulnerable working women.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a board member for 20 years, Michelle led the centre as chair for the last five years—including through the uncertainty and upheaval of the COVID-19 pandemic. During this distressing time for so many people in insecure work, she never faltered. She never faltered in ensuring the centre continued to support people who find themselves in precarious situations. She also steadfastly prioritised the safety and welfare of her dedicated staff, to whom she was a mentor, a confidante and a friend. Michelle's enduring contribution to the feminist and union movement cannot be overstated, and we will feel the benefits of her legacy for many decades to come.
       </p>
       <p>
        On a personal note: when I was a young person engaging in politics and in the trade union movement for the very first time, I was privileged to be surrounded by a movement of incredible and courageous women—feminists and trade unionists who worked when I started working in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trades_Hall" rel="nofollow">
         Trades Hall
        </a>
        for various unions, including the UTLC, the United Trades and Labor Council. Michelle was one of the women in this movement. As a young progressive Labor woman, these women made me feel as if I had found my place in the world—progressive women who, in their different ways, worked for a more just community and for a better world.
       </p>
       <p>
        I extend my deepest condolences to Michelle's partner of 30 years, Rob, to her family, to her many friends and to all in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         South Australian
        </a>
        union and women's movements. I also acknowledge her friends in this chamber, including Senator Barbara Pocock, who made a moving contribution last week, and Senator Grogan, who is with me today. My thoughts are also with the staff and management committee of the Working Women's Centre. You've lost a leader, a friend and a comrade.
       </p>

        Michelle practised her values in all she did. She recognised feminism has to be applied to have value. She dedicated over four decades of her life to fighting for fairer working conditions, to a greater work-life balance and to helping women find their own voice. She also understood that working women deserve emotional sustenance alongside material sustenance, with so many since her passing quoting that famous song:

       <p class="italic">
        From birth until life closes

       <p class="italic">
        Hearts starve as well as bodies

       <p class="italic">

       <p>
        Vale, Michelle Hogan.
