         Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986
        </i>
        made by this Schedule applies in relation to proceedings:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) that commence on or after the commencement of this item; or
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) that commenced before the commencement of this item, and that had not been completed by that commencement.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I indicated in my second reading contribution, these amendments seek to amend the bill to provide for an LGBTIQA+ human rights commissioner.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greens" rel="nofollow">
         The Greens
        </a>
        have been approached by a variety of organisations and community groups, from across the broader law reform community but especially from the LGBTIQA+ community, who have been asking for this for decades. We've been approached by Just.Equal Australia, who raised the very real issue that the reform in the bill just does not go far enough, and that's why we're moving for the well-overdue appointment of a standalone LGBTIQA+ human rights commissioner. Again, I want to acknowledge the work of my colleague in the other place Stephen Bates, the member for Brisbane, in helping to pull together these amendments and drive forward with this.
       </p>
       <p>
        This amendment cannot wait. The reason that the Labor government is opposing this amendment now is that they say, 'It doesn't fit neatly in the bill.' Well, tell that to the thousands and thousands of members of the LGBTIQA+ community who want a commissioner who is unambiguously on their side to advance their rights and to protect their interests when the next attack comes. This is a community that went through the appalling marriage equality plebiscite, and thank goodness they won it. Thank goodness we, together, won that, but there were the attacks that came in that plebiscite, and we've seen the platforming of hateful transphobic views from Liberal Party members and other right-wing politicians and commentariats.
       </p>
       <p>
        The LGBTIQA+ community deserves a commissioner. It deserves a part of the Human Rights Commission institution that is unambiguously on its side. It would have made a material difference in the public debate in the past three or four or five years had this been on the statute books, and there is no reason, apart from bloody-mindedness on the part of the Labor government, for it to wait another day. The model we're proposing here is far from revolutionary.
       </p>
       <p>
        The model proposed for this commissioner has similar functions to the existing human rights commissioners, but with that special focus on the LGBTIQA+ community. That includes raising awareness of human rights impacts, research and education, and examining existing and proposed laws to assess their likely impact on LGBTIQA+ people and the community. That's exactly what we need. It may well be that in the next 12 months we have another go at religious discrimination laws, and of course we should be thinking ahead and putting in place the commissioner who can help the community through that, can be an advocate for the community through that and can help this parliament, at the end of the day, get the laws right, if that comes again to this chamber.
       </p>
       <p>
        The lack of such a commissioner is such an obvious oversight, and we can remedy it today. The numbers are in the house today, if only Labor had the decency and the imagination to get on board and support it. The need is clear and, in fact, there have been previous statements from the Labor Party indicating they support this reform. Well, now's the time to test that, because now's the time to see if those statements carry any weight. Do you support it or not? We'll see how you vote.

           I thank Senator Shoebridge for his contribution. We certainly understand the strong sentiment that has been expressed by members of the community over a long period of time now about a dedicated LGBTIQA+ commissioner, but we are of the view, as I mentioned in summing up, that this bill is not the vehicle to create such a position. The government recognises that it's important to consider how the commission can best operate to promote and protect the human rights of all members of the Australian community, including LGBTIQA+ people.
          </p>
          <p>
           There is no doubt that there will be further discussion on this proposal, as well as other opportunities to strengthen the work of the commission in the future, but the critical issue that this bill will address is restoring the international standing of our commission by urgently addressing the specific issues around transparent and merit based appointments raised by the global alliance to support the commission's reaccreditation. That is what the focus of this bill is today. As I mentioned before, it is not possible to make such changes as this and for it to go back to the House of Representatives.

            On behalf of the opposition, I advise that we will be opposing this amendment. The
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Human_Rights_Commission" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Human Rights Commission
            </a>
            Legislation Amendment (Selection and Appointment) Bill 2022 was introduced to clarify the recruitment arrangements for the president and commissioners of the Australian Human Rights Commission, the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AHRC" rel="nofollow">
             AHRC
            </a>
            , in order to satisfy the requirements of a global alliance of national human rights institutions. This bill responds to a technical process issue raised by that same body's Sub-Committee on Accreditation in relation to aspects of the appointments process for the Australian Human Rights Commission and potential length of tenure of commissioners. LGBTIQA+ rights are already addressed in the work of the AHRC commissioners, including in particular the

             Well, of course the coalition won't support this amendment, and that's one of the reasons they got thrown out of government. That's one of the reasons we have a new parliament with a majority in this chamber and a majority in the other chamber that is meant to be unambiguously committed to supporting the rights of the LGBTIQA+ community. That's one of the reasons the coalition is in opposition. And the only rationale given by the government for not supporting this urgent, necessary and fundamentally right amendment is that 'this bill is not the vehicle'. I don't think the LGBTIQA+ community cares which vehicle is used. It could be Uber, it could be a taxi, it could be a bike, it could be this bill. The vehicle isn't relevant. What's relevant here is getting the substantive amendment through, getting the commissioner in place. For the community to hear that response from the government, when they know they've got the numbers here right now to achieve the reform, and the answer is, 'Computer says no', well, that's a deeply disappointing outcome.
            </p>
            <p>
             As I said before, of course the coalition, with their current mindset—not all, but an uncomfortable chunk of the coalition—that refuses to show decency to this community, are going to say no. But why is Labor joining with them? Why is Labor joining with the coalition to say no to this? We haven't heard an answer—well, no persuasive answer—and it's a deeply unfortunate precedent to set in this new parliament. I thought things had changed.

              around the status of the commission and the commissioners. They've also raised concerns in the past about the fact that Australia, even as a signatory to the

                As this amendment is alluding to, there is concern amongst various parts of our community that the Human Rights Commissioner, with a broad remit, doesn't cover the detailed support for elements of our community, and the same concern has been raised by people of religious communities in Australia. Within the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICCPR" rel="nofollow">
                 ICCPR
                </a>
                , article 2 includes protection of people against discrimination because of their religious faith. Article 18 is specifically around having freedom of thought, conscience and religion, including the ability to practise that with their community. Article 19 says that everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference. Article 22 says that they shall have the right of freedom of association with others. And article 27 may in fact be applicable to communities here now. For example, the latest census says that even the Christian community is now a minority. Article 27 says that, in states where ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities exist, members of such minorities shall not be denied the right in community with other members to enjoy their own culture or profess and practise their own religion. As the government considers its response to those encouragements from the international community and the

                to specifically legislate for religious freedom and protection from discrimination, will it also consider the appointment of a religious freedom commissioner?

                   I don't think it is appropriate for me to comment on that particular case but I certainly am aware of the commentary around the abandoned appointment of Mr Thorburn.

                    Does the government accept, in the conclusions found by the Senate Select Committee on the Exposure Draft of the Marriage Amendment (Same-Sex Marriage) Bill back in 2017, that, in order for Australia to remain a plural democracy where different views are respected and legal, action is required to protect both people who have different views on gender and people who have different views in terms of their religious faith?

                      Minister, will the government ensure there is an LGBTIQA+ commissioner in place for that community before the next round of sometimes divisive and marginalising commentary happens associated with religious discrimination? Will you ensure the commissioner is in place before this parliament goes down that path again?

I know the Attorney-General is committed to continuing discussions on this important matter and how best the Human Rights Commission can ensure that people from LGBTIQA+ communities are protected.
