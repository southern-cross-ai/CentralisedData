        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">

         I thank Senator Wong for that important question. We are committed to improving the lives of

          Indigenous Australians

         so that this generation, the next generation and generations henceforth can have the same expectations and opportunities as any other Australian. We are committed to taking effective action to close the gap. Indeed, the Minister for Indigenous Australians,

          Ken Wyatt

         , the member for Hasluck, is working very hard to address those issues.
        </p>
        <p>
         These are not straightforward issues. Governments of both political persuasions, at the state and the federal level, have made genuine efforts since the first royal commission report and recommendations were released some decades ago. But, as my friend and colleague in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         , the state Labor Indigenous affairs minister and Treasurer,

          Ben Wyatt
         </a>
         , said on Sunday at an event I was at with him in Perth, this has been a difficult issue for a very long time and, if there were easy and straightforward resolutions, they would have long been applied because there has been a lot of goodwill and a lot of effort put in place in an entirely non-partisan fashion by governments of both political persuasions, both at the state and federal level.
        </p>
        <p>
         Yes, we are committed to continue to explore ways that we can do better. We must do better—we absolutely must do better—when it comes to this important issue. Going forward, you'd be aware of the announcement by the Prime Minister in relation to the reform of national governance arrangements. The National Cabinet is replacing the

            The government is doing what it can to help make progress in relation to closing the gap across a whole range of indicators. As I was about to say, once a year the National Cabinet, the Council on Federal Financial Relations and the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Local_Government_Association" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Local Government Association
            </a>
            will meet as the National Federation Reform Council, with a focus on priority national federation issues, including and in particular closing the gap and women's safety. Task forces will be established to continue work on these priority issues, but there are no straightforward solutions here. If there were straightforward, easy solutions, they would have been implemented by now. We've got to continue to work hard to find better ways to make genuine progress in relation to what is a very important and legitimate issue.

Let me say to Senator Wong that, however legitimate the issue, however legitimate the cause, in the context of a pandemic, in the context of the many sacrifices that millions of Australians were asked to make in recent months in order to save lives and save livelihoods, it absolutely was reckless and irresponsible to conduct mass protests of this nature at this point in time.
