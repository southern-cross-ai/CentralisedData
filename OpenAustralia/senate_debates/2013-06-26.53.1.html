             As I was saying, this action is not being taken in isolation. By the end of this year, around one billion people around the world will live in a city, province or country with a price on carbon. This includes provinces in China, our largest trading partner. Last week, the first of China's seven pilot emissions trading schemes kicked off in Shenzhen. The scheme will cover 600 companies responsible for 40 per cent of the city's emissions. The start of the scheme was not marked by the city being wiped off the map. Nor has the Shenzhen stock market crashed. In fact, at the end of the first day of the scheme, it closed not down but up.
            </p>
            <p>
             For years the opposition has claimed that the rest of the world is not acting on climate change, and on more than 50 occasions they have said that China would never act. What we know is that a leader of the opposition is on the record as saying: 'China is never going to hit themselves with an emissions trading scheme.' Well, that is wrong. It is absolutely wrong, and we can see action taking place in China now. The fact is that the rest of the world is acting. With one billion people living in a place now with an emissions trading scheme in effect, this shows that the world is acting not only to contend with climate change but, of course, acting in line with Labor's approach. It is about time that those opposite started acknowledging the fact that this is part of a global movement to tackle climate change. It is the responsible thing to do, and, of course, that is why it is left to the Labor government to take this important action.

                  In my State of the Union address, I urged Congress to come up with a bipartisan, market-based solution to climate change, like the one that Republican and Democratic senators worked on together a few years ago. And I still want to see that happen. I'm willing to work with anyone to make that happen.

                   , I have a further supplementary question. Can the minister advise how emissions can be reduced in alternative ways, and what might the costs be of such policies?

                    is working down the same path that Labor has. We are now approaching this in the only economically responsible way to reduce it, which is through a price on carbon. But we know these facts are an anathema to those opposite.

                    To achieve the same emissions reductions as our package the opposition would slug households $1,300 per year. Today, it has been revealed that they have dug another budget hole. Apparently Mr Abbott will repeal the carbon price immediately, and under the Liberals' plan the vast majority of industry assistance for the coming financial year will have already been paid out, yet the polluters will no longer be obliged to surrender their permits for their pollution. That is a $10 billion hit to their budget. They need to explain where that shortfall is coming from, otherwise they will be further exposed for their dishonesty in relation to their climate change policies.
