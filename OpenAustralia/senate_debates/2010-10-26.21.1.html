        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Senator Conroy. I refer the minister to Senator Wong’s statement of 11 August 2010 on ABC Radio 891 regarding the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, when she said, ‘The cap will ultimately be set by the independent authority.’ Will the minister back Senator Wong’s statement and confirm that is going to be the case?

         Senator Bernardi should revisit the legislation I was referring to in my last answer, which sets out, categorically, the process by which this is ultimately determined—it is a vote of the parliament. That is the bill you voted for. That is the bill Senator Joyce voted for. And that is exactly the process which will be followed. We will comply with your legislation and our amended legislation, which you supported. You voted for it you, you voted for it, you voted for it and you voted for it. Every single one of you voted for it. So do not come in here and suddenly try to play games about the process. This was a bipartisan process, which you were signed up to. So do not come in here and cry your crocodile tears—

             , I rise on a point of order going to relevance. The minister was asked whether he supported a statement quoted to him by one of his colleagues. He has not been directly relevant to that. What he is saying now has nothing to do with it at all, and he ought to be brought to the question.

               The process is exactly as I have described—exactly as the legislation describes. And I am very comfortable to make the point that I always support Senator Wong. Let us be clear. Do not come in here and try to pretend and verbal and create a completely misleading impression of what the legislation says. We have made it very clear, just to go to the advice. Broadly, the advice outlines that the Water Act gives effect to relevant international agreements; provides for the establishment of environmentally sustainable limits on the quantities of water that may be taken; and provides for the use of the Murray-Darling Basin water resources in a way that optimises economic, social and environmental outcomes—

                , I have a supplementary question. Why is the minister not prepared to back Senator Wong and her statements of 11 August, and her statement the following day on 12 August on the same radio station. It said:
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                ... this is a Government that is prepared to back the independent Authority in its determination on what the rivers need.
               </p>
               <p>
                Minister, will you abide by the independent authority’s assessment of a cap on water?

                <p>
                 Perhaps when you already have a prewritten supplementary question it is hard to make an adjustment on the run. Senator Bernardi is proving that to be the case, because it is quite clear that I supported Senator Wong in the last answer. It was quite clear. It is there in
                 <i>
                  Hansard
                 </i>
                 . It will be spelled out in
                 <i>
                  Hansard
                 </i>
                 quite simply. But I repeat that the reason I was going through the legal advice, the reason I was quoting the legal advice, was to remind Senator Bernardi that we will comply with the law that you created, that we supported, that we amended and that you supported. That law requires that the Water Act, subject to the environmentally sustainable limits, maximises the net economic returns to the Australian community. The international agreements which underpin the Water Act themselves recognise the importance of social and economic factors.

                  I ask a further supplementary question. How can the minister explain the government’s pre-election declarations of support for the Murray-Darling Basin Authority that have now been proven to be misleading, which has been confirmed by Minister Burke’s statement in the other place last Wednesday that he reserves the right to ‘demand that they change aspects of it’.

                    The minister’s failure to confirm what Senator Wong promised pre-election, has exposed the government as being able to make any number of reckless points pre-election, and I would like the minister to explain how they can justify that?

                       Senator Bernardi, you can interject all you want; the question is based on a false premise. You are attempting to verbal Senator Wong and verbal Minister Burke. Again, I will go back to the act, specifically to inform you about the act. The act specifically states that giving effect to those agreements the plan should promote the use and management of basin water resources in a way that optimises economic, social and environmental outcomes.
