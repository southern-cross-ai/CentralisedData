         I thank Senator Scarr for his question and for his interest.
        </p>
        <p>
         The coalition government is determined to ensure that our closest neighbours have access to safe, effective and affordable COVID-19 vaccines. Today we announced that Australia will contribute $80 million to the Gavi Covax Facility Advance Market Commitment, or the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC" rel="nofollow">
          AMC
         </a>
         . The Covax Facility pools the purchasing power and risk for participating countries. It's going to help fast-track manufacturing and prepare the largest and most diverse portfolio of potential COVID-19 vaccines under development.
        </p>
        <p>
         Importantly, when vaccines have completed full clinical trials and been assessed as safe and effective by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organisation" rel="nofollow">
          World Health Organisation
         </a>
         they will be made available to eligible countries in our region. Australia is very proud to work with key partners in support of the AMC's aim of mobilising one billion vaccine doses for developing countries in the acute phase of the pandemic. In making this investment, Australia joins contributors including the United Kingdom, Canada, Italy and Norway.
        </p>
        <p>
         We know that international investment in vaccine manufacturing and procurement is stronger when nations work together. I was very pleased during my recent visit to Washington to discuss Australia's commitment to supporting our region with the Gavi chair, Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala. This investment builds on our efforts to secure safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines for Australians. We know that our own security and prosperity are closely linked to that of our closest neighbours. When it comes to this pandemic, we are standing and will continue to stand together.

As we committed to when we announced our partnerships for recovery to respond to COVID-19, Australia's development assistance is focused on responding to our region's most pressing needs in the recovery from the pandemic.
