        My question is to the Minister for Trade and Tourism, Senator Farrell. The tourism industry directly employed over 666,000 Australians in the June quarter of this year, many of them being small-business operators. Under Labor's extreme

            <p>
             Thank you. The point of order goes to whether the question is in order given where the bill is. I have not intervened to date because I understand that the policy and politics of the issue is in the matter that the Senate has historically questioned and continues to question, even when legislation is before the Senate, notwithstanding the standing orders. I may have misheard Senator Henderson, but I thought she directly went to the legislation, in which case I would assert it is out of order in the current terms. But the way I would deal with it—because I understand the issue, Senator Birmingham—is that, if that is the case, I would invite her to rephrase.

              President, just before you rule on the point of order, I do note that, on Tuesday of this week, the government themselves asked a question related to this legislation. I further note that you and previous Presidents have ruled broadly in relation to these questions about anticipation of Senate business, and I would encourage you to uphold your ruling and previous rulings about that breadth of questioning that is available to senators.

              <p>
               I'll take some advice, Senator Birmingham, because I thought the question was not confined to Senator Farrell's area, but I'll take advice. In relation to the point of order, I'm advised that, if the question went generally to policy issues, then it would be reasonable to ask Senator Farrell to answer it. But the question, in my view, did go to details, because it sought a comparison under an aspect of the proposed bill that related one type of business to another type of business. I can invite Senator Farrell to answer the broad policy nature of that question.
              </p>
              <p>
               Sorry, Senator Henderson; I've got Senator Wong on her feet, and then I'll come to you.

                      argued previously about the broad interpretation taken in relation to this. The senator's question relates to policies and reforms of the government. She's asking about those policies, reforms and changes. She has not referenced specific legislation either in her first go at the question or in her rewording of the question.

                       In response to the Leader of the Opposition, I think that the difficulty here is that the senator repeated precisely the words, 'these changes', to which I responded. It's clearly the case that 'these changes' mean the legislation which is before the chamber. As such, I would submit that the question needs to be rephrased to be compliant with standing order 73.

As I said in my first answer, if the question is around the broad policy, it's at the invitation of Senator Farrell to answer. I remain with that response, but I am happy to take further advice after question time. Senator Henderson, did you have a point of order?

                            I thank Senator Henderson for her question. I totally reject your description of this legislation as 'extreme'. The Labor Party went to the last election saying we were going to lift the wages of Australians and, in particular, low-paid Australians—and that's what this legislation does.

                            , I would be delighted with this legislation because I would know that for the first time in 10 years low-paid workers will have an opportunity to lift their wages. We know from what the former

                              I rise on a point of order, on direct relevance. I was asking the minister to answer the question in relation to the two businesses: could they be compelled into multi-employer bargaining? Could the minister please directly address that.

                                On the point of order, the question actually put a hypothetical, which also was not in order, but, given what we'd already gone through to try and get to a question previously, I didn't take a point of order on that. But it would be unsurprising if the minister answered in slightly broader terms, given you've put a hypothetical to him.
