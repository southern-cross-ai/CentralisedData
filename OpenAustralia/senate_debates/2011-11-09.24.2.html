         The government have been completely upfront with Australians about there being an impact on prices as a result of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPI" rel="nofollow">
          CPI
         </a>
         increase of 0.7 per cent that the carbon price will give effect to—an amount which is significantly less than the impact on the CPI of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
          GST
         </a>
         , which I am asked about, when it was first put in place. These factors are what have driven the calculation of the government's assistance package, which we have gone through ad nauseam in this place. They include the fact that nine out of 10 households will receive some assistance through tax cuts and/or payment increases. Almost six million households—that is, two out of three—will get tax cuts or increased payments that will cover their entire average price impact.

            I have been clear that there will be an increase in prices. We have indicated that. The Treasury modelling indicates that. We have been clear: food will increase by less than 0.5 per cent—on average $1 per week; electricity, $3.30 per week—on average 10 per cent; and gas, around $1.50 per week—on average nine per cent. The government will also be providing tax cuts: a tripling of the tax-free threshold—also to be opposed by the opposition, also to be wound back by the opposition, just as the opposition will be opposing and winding back the increase to pensions, the increase to disability support pensions—

              Senator Brandis, I cannot instruct the minister how to answer the question. You may well phrase your question in a particular way and expect a particular answer. But I cannot instruct the minister to answer in the way in which you may wish the answer to be constructed. I believe the minister was answering the question and I ask the minister to continue. The minister has five seconds remaining to answer the question and I ask the minister to address the question.

                 In relation to the question about the quantum, I do not have that information. I will see if I can find whether or not any of that is available. I suspect that the answer will be that the government will update its budget figures—which will include tax-take in the usual way—in the midyear review, which is due before the end of the year. That midyear review will reflect the state of the government's policies and will include the legislative package which was passed by the Senate. I will see if I can provide any further information on that. In relation to the Treasury modelling, it has been very clear on the price impact of a 0.7 per cent
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPI" rel="nofollow">
                  CPI
                 </a>
                 increase and that has been the basis of the very substantial household assistance package, which will increase pensions and reduce taxes—which the opposition are opposed to.

                  was clearly not modelled, how can the government argue it is giving sufficient compensation to consumers? Will the government's advertising campaign, designed to sell the public a tax that it does not want, point out the additional costs to consumers of this tax on a tax together with the increased marginal rate on income taxes?

                   In relation to the income tax rates, they are clearly set out in the clean energy package. They were set out by the government when we announced the tax cuts that we will make—the tripling of the tax-free threshold. The effect on some of the headline income tax rates was also transparently released. What it shows is that anybody in this country earning under $80,000 a year will, under our tax reform package, which is part of the clean energy package, get a tax cut—a tax cut which those opposite are opposed to. This action stands in stark contrast to the opposition, who will be imposing some $1,300 more in tax on electorates and on their voters to pay for their direct action policy. That is the difference between those opposite and us. We will cut taxes. They will have to raise them or slash health services to fund their policy.
