        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Carr. I refer to the report by the rural R&amp;D corporations which showed there was a return of $11 for every $1 spent on agriculture research. Given the enormous benefits which flow to the agriculture sector from this research, can the government explain why it has taken a backward step and cut spending on science and innovation as a proportion of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
         GDP
        </a>
        ? Does the government actually expect Australian farmers to be competitive on the global stage when the level of Commonwealth funding is shrinking?

          Senator Fielding
         </a>
         , I must say I am a little puzzled by your suggestion that this government is not committed to science and innovation. We have had the biggest increase in expenditure on science and innovation for 25 years. I just find that proposition that you put to me extraordinary and, in the context of last year’s budget, it is frankly nonsensical. What I can say is that, in terms of the importance of research and development, this is a government that is committed to driving productivity and, in terms of the agriculture, forestry and fishery sector, we have actually seen an average increase of some 2.2 per cent. The research and development corporations are estimated to have spent around $460 million on research and development in 2008-09 and the Australian government has contributed $207 million.
        </p>
        <p>
         Under the previous government—I am sure Senator Fielding would be interested in this—industry levies and Commonwealth matched funding to the research and development corporations in 2006 was $442 million. In 2007 it was $439 million, in 2008-09 it was $451 million and in 2009-10 it is estimated to be $444.68 million. Levies collected from industry vary, as you would be aware, Senator Fielding, because of the various impacts on changes in production which are caused by drought, other climactic conditions and commodity prices. But the level of government support—as I thought, Senator Fielding, you would appreciate—is actually increasing when it comes to the issues of science and innovation, which is something that I am personally very proud of.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Given that this country has been built on the back of the agriculture sector and given the vital role that agriculture still plays in our economy, what is the government planning on doing about the fact that 50 per cent of Australia’s agricultural scientists and academics will retire over the next five years?

            Again, this is a nonsensical proposition that is being put to the government. What you saw is that the previous government committed only $13.89 million on other discretionary research and development programs in the period 2007-08. The Rudd government has committed $30 million in 2008-09 and $41.6 million in 2009-10. What we have on the other side of the chamber is the view that is expressed by Mr Abbott: playing politics on important issues is the order of the day. What he says is, ‘Our job is to ferociously criticise and, where necessary, oppose the government, and if in doubt our job is to oppose.’ That is the policy position of the previous government, the current opposition.

                   has put to us this afternoon. What I can say, though, is that what we have is a sharp contrast between the performance of this government and the performance of the previous government. What we have is an opposition that is actually in the business of opposing for the sake of opposing. They are not in the business of discussing food security, water supply, research and innovation, or building for the future of this country in any way. What you have is an opposition that really is all about trying to oppose for the sake of it. Senator Fielding, I think you should have a look at the record. You should look at the facts and you should actually ask yourself why you are lining up so often with this opposition.
