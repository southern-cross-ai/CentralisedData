         The Minister for Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFAT" rel="nofollow">
          DFAT
         </a>
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1)   As at 31 March 2011 DFAT had 2,493 A-Based employees and 1625 Locally Engaged Staff (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LES" rel="nofollow">
          LES
         </a>
         ).
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2)   As at 31 March 2011 DFAT had 29 employees who had self identified as having a disability (LES are not asked to report on their disability status).
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3)   DFAT's Disability Action Strategy 2011 – 2015 (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAS" rel="nofollow">
          DAS
         </a>
         ) stipulates that all job advertisements are to encourage people with disability to apply for positions in the department; and that recruitment information is to be made available in disability-friendly formats. Similarly, all recruitment processes are to cater for applicants with disability by including reasonable adjustments. When a candidate identifies as requiring reasonable adjustment through the recruitment process, a further form is completed and adjustments are made in accordance with the request made (e.g. additional time for the face-to-face interview).
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4)   Under the DAS, retention strategies include: making reasonable adjustments where appropriate; engaging the services of a disability service provider to assist with adjustments where required; providing training to supervisors and managers to assist in working with people with disability; and establishing a Disability Employees Network to assist with the development of policies that assist in the retention of people with disabilities.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (5)   All staff are required to have an annual performance management plan, reviewable every six months, that includes a skills/training plan. Under the DAS, the department is also engaging an external consultant to assist with identifying training and development opportunities for employees with disability. The Department is also actively encouraging mentoring for employees with disability.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (6)   There are no specific targets for recruitment and retention as the department's priority is to develop policies and programs that enable DFAT to be an employer of choice for employees with disability. This is much broader than simple recruitment or retention targets. It is about developing a workplace culture in which employees with disability are treated with respect and there is no discrimination.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (7)   The DAS outlines in detail the policies, programs and services available to support staff with a disability. In addition, all staff with disability have access to the Workplace Diversity Unit which provides guidance and advice to employees with disability and their supervisors and teams. Training is provided as required. Disability services providers are engaged as necessary to assist the department in managing people with disability.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (8)   DFAT is preparing to launch, as a pilot program in the

AusAID consults with employees with disability on the purchase of goods or services that directly impact on their ability to do their job.
        </p>

         (5)   Career pathway development and planning is undertaken through the agency's performance management system. All staff are required to participate in performance assessment and planning.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
