        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. After a year in office, under the Albanese Labor government the number of Australians in work remains at record highs. For the first time ever, the number of employed people in Australia has reached 14 million. That's despite a slowing global economy. Can the minister provide the Senate with an update on the latest labour force data, released just yesterday by the ABS, and tell us what it says about the performance of the Australian economy under the Albanese Labor government?

         Thank you, Senator Sheldon, for that question. Many Labor senators, like Senator Sheldon—those on this side—have spent a great deal of their working life advocating for working people and ensuring that working Australians have access to secure, well-paid jobs. So, I'm pleased to take the question from Senator Sheldon. And he's right: yesterday's ABS labour force figures were very good news for Australians, for Australian families and for those wanting to enter the workforce, revealing that the number of employed Australians has reached 14 million—14 million Australians in work. That is a record-breaking figure, accompanied by a reduction in the unemployment rate, which is down to 3.6 per cent.
        </p>
        <p>
         That is an achievement for the Australian people, it is an achievement for the Australian economy, and it reflects the resilience of the economy, which is such a priority for the Albanese Labor government—a government which supports job creation. Since coming into office we have seen 465,000 jobs created under the Albanese government. Importantly, what we are committed to on this side is not a deliberate low-wage policy. We are committed to delivering secure and well-paid jobs. We've also prioritised gender equity in the workplace, and the figures show more women in full-time employment than ever before.
        </p>
        <p>
         The results we've witnessed in the labour force aren't a coincidence. They are influenced by our government's commitment to empowering workers and ensuring their rights and protections, including the policies to address gender pay inequity, paid family and domestic violence leave, a pay increase for aged-care workers, and affordable early childhood education. And, as you know, we are actively working on further reforms to safeguard the rights of working people.

           The Albanese Labor government is clearly taking action to help all Australians have access to secure and well-paid jobs. Can the minister please explain to the Senate how the government's policies contribute to continued resilience in the labour market and the Australian economy more broadly?

            Thank you, Senator Sheldon. Senator Sheldon is right to ask about resilience because we know that we have challenges ahead, as a consequence of higher interest rates and interest in the global economy. We see markets and economies around the world managing and entering into recession—Europe and
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
             New Zealand
            </a>
            , for example. We know we have to continue to build on our successes and we have to lay foundations for more secure and well-paid jobs in the future. That's why the government is investing in key sectors to stimulate jobs growth and to drive the economic prosperity of the nation. That's why we're investing in renewable energy, infrastructure and advanced manufacturing. That's why we'll continue to drive the development of innovative industries and technologies, access to education and skills training programs to equip Australian workers today with the necessary tools to thrive in an evolving job market in the future.

              Unlike the Liberals and Nationals, the Albanese government has taken action to get wages moving. This Labor government is working to create a more prosperous future for all that includes fairer wages and better working protections. Can the minister highlight the key differences in approach between the Albanese government and the 'no-alition' opposite?
