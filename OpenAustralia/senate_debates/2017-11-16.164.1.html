        My colleague Senator McKim has already spoken on this document and moved a motion that the Senate take note of it. I'd like to also emphasise the very unfortunate decline in the performance of the Department of Immigration and Border Protection in regard to not just its well-documented human rights abuses—and let's not mince words here; that is what is being done under the auspices of this department—but also, frankly, its financial approach, which is incredibly wasteful and has seen extremely critical reports from the Auditor-General and others. It may be a coincidence; it might not. I suspect not. I don't wish to reflect negatively on all employees of the department. Many, I know, do the best they can. But, in regard to the culture and the direction of that department, which obviously the minister has to take ultimate responsibility for, it does seem to be clear that there is a belief that they are above the law, and that is something that should concern every Australian. Whatever view they might have about any individual aspect of immigration policy, to have a section of the government think they can operate above the law and basically turn themselves into a quasi-military operation, a militarised operation, should be extremely concerning to anybody that cares about civil liberties and freedoms for everyday Australians, let alone all the other many millions and millions of migrants, both permanent and temporary, that we share our country with and that make such a massive economic contribution to our nation, and have done so for decades.

        When I was a senator in this chamber previously, over 10 years ago, as senators may recall, there were scandalous situations involving an Australian citizen,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivian_Solon" rel="nofollow">
         Vivian Solon
        </a>
        , and a permanent resident,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornelia_Rau" rel="nofollow">
         Cornelia Rau
        </a>
        , both of whom were illegally detained by the immigration department. One of them was illegally deported, even though they were an Australian citizen. There was a Senate inquiry at the time; Senator Collins may recall that. It was so flagrantly outrageous and it showed a department out of control. It was so obvious that the minister at the time, Senator Vanstone, acknowledged openly in this chamber that there was a problem with departmental culture. Somehow or other, that seemed to have just happened without any knowledge from the relevant ministers at the time. The people who had caused the cultural problem also thought they were the ones who should be able to fix it up—nonetheless, at least acknowledging that things had got out of control, with a culture of being punitive. Ignoring the law and having the compliance regime put above everything else had got out of control. By no means was everything fixed up, but at least there was a recognition that there were problems, and some steps were taken to try to ameliorate it.
       </p>
       <p>
        If you compare that to what is happening now, it is just chalk and cheese. It is 20 times worse now under the current minister and the current department and its leadership. The culture is quite deliberately focused on being punitive and seeing immigration as a threat and a security issue, when immigration has been such a key part of the prosperity, freedom and diversity of this nation. It is a key part of what it is today. To have that fundamental part of the Australian fabric and the Australian economy being compromised and put at risk by this ridiculous, compliance focused, punitive department with disdain for the law is a serious problem. It is manifest most obviously in the horrendous treatment and the deliberately inflicted harm and suffering of the people on

        </a>
        and on Nauru. I join with my colleague Senator McKim, and all my Greens colleagues, Greens members, campaigners and the rights movements around Australia in condemning that unequivocally.
       </p>
       <p>
        It has been pleasing to see some movement in the Senate this week and in recent times from the Labor Party in recognising and at least supporting motions that we should accept the offer from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        , at least with regard to the people on Manus Island. Whatever the attitude people have about the wider policy issues involved, we need to just get them out of that situation. We have a country that is willing to take them. The government, all along, have said, 'We are looking for other resettlement options.' Well, they have a resettlement option right there in front of them and yet they are still not taking it. That, more than anything else, demonstrates that it has never been the intention. The intention has been to deliberately make an example of these people and deliberately inflict suffering on them for political purposes and, I might also say, at massive expense to the taxpayer. It is money that could be spent for the benefit of the entire community. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

        Leave granted; debate adjourned.
