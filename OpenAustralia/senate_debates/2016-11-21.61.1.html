         It was my great pleasure to announce earlier today an arrangement with the Gumatj people of northeast
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnhem_Land" rel="nofollow">
          Arnhem Land
         </a>
         over a township lease for a community called Gunyangara. It is of significant importance because of the innovation around that township lease. We were able to have innovation around the township lease because we co-constructed it. Both the Gumatj people and the Commonwealth government decided in the fight of land rights and concerns that any lease would take that away from your control, but that some balance was needed. So in this particular place we no longer have an executive director of township leasing. We actually have a community controlled Gumatj organisation that will take that role. It is quite innovative.
        </p>
        <p>
         It was a process I will not forget. I was sitting under this large Syzygium, enjoying a cup of coffee that was actually made by the Gumatj cafe and served to me by a young Gumatj woman. In the background was the Gumatj nursery right next to the Gumatj furniture factory, just down the road from the Gumatj butcher. These are communities that are on community owned land and they are working in a very good way.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is important as well that we ensure that if we have Commonwealth property,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         government property and other people's property on their land we are making proper payments. This gives effect to ensuring that the Gumatj people will have a revenue flow to add to their own economic development of the area.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have found a very careful balance. We know that land rights are so important to our first people. But also this is one of the fundamental ways in which we can assist them in developing the land in the way that they would like to develop it.

           Can the minister further outline how this township lease will benefit local Indigenous landowners and what opportunities for jobs, business development and home ownership it will deliver to the community?

            I thank the senator for the question. This process will in fact support much better land administration because it will allow the granting of an individual house site, for example, if somebody wants to own their own house. It also will involve the capacity for people to lease a block of land within the township to start a business.
           </p>
           <p>
            But the most important part of the process is that we have provided a line of credit of $2 million to the Gumatj on the basis that the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
             Northern Territory
            </a>
            government and the Commonwealth government have guaranteed the payments for that. We already know that the payments are guaranteed, so their line of credit is guaranteed. So they can now invest in their own land and their own country in the same way that anybody else would. We have also provided some assistance around ensuring that people who go there to work have some accommodation. This has been a package that has certainly been supported by the Gumatj people.

               As this place knows, we are committed to doing things with Indigenous communities and Indigenous individuals. This outcome is because we did that. It is something that we have strived unsuccessfully since 2006 to effect. Of course the innovation has come from people like Balupalu, Djawa and
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galarrwuy_Yunupingu" rel="nofollow">
                Galarrwuy Yunupingu
               </a>
               , who were sitting under the tree with me and saying, 'These are the sorts of things we need to do.'
              </p>
              <p>
               The impetus that this has been provided to support using their land in their way has set up a new process. I would say to whoever would like to discuss this process that it is not about saying, 'Would you like an executive-director-of-township-leasing approach or a Gumatj approach?' It is not that. It is about saying that people from their own community can have their own innovative approach to allow them to have that balance between the safety of their land rights they fought so hard to have and the economic development enjoyed by every other Australian.
