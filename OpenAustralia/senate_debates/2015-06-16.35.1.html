         I thank Senator Back for his question and for his ongoing interest in protecting Australia's borders. I can advise the Senate that it has now been 324 days since there was a successful people smuggling venture to Australia. You might ask yourself why. The answer is this: it is because those of us on this side instituted—

           They said it could not be done—absolutely. They said it could not be done, and we have proved them incorrect. What we have done on this side of the chamber is stop the boats. We have stopped the 50,000 people that came here under the former government's policies from coming to Australia. We have also stopped the deaths at sea—almost 1200 people drowned at sea under the policies of the former government.

           Perhaps one of the greatest achievements of this government has been getting children out of detention. Do you remember how many children arrived under the former government? In excess of 8400 children. In July 2013, 1992 children were in detention. Imagine my surprise, colleagues, when last week there was a small protest outside of my office—people protesting children in detention. They delivered teddy bears to my office. Imagine my surprise, though, when
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_Lines" rel="nofollow">
            Senator Lines

           from Labor turned up at my office with a teddy bear! A senator from that side of the chamber that was responsible for putting children into detention came to my office and protested about this government's stance on getting children out of detention. Senator Lines, does your hypocrisy know no bounds?

             There are significant flow-on benefits to the Australian public in having strong borders. We heard from Senator Cormann previously that not only have we stopped the boats, but we are now also paying down Labor's debt and deficit. In relation to that, those on the other side were responsible for an almost $12 billion budget blow-out because of the way they controlled Australia's borders. As a result of the policies on this side, we have already re-invested into the budget $2.5 billion, and that is just the start. We have announced savings in the 2015-16 budget of an additional $½ billion. While those on that side are spending taxpayers' money with absolutely no regard at all, we on this side are putting in place responsible policies that are returning savings.

               It is a very timely question from Senator Back, given that next month is the Labor Party's national conference. The Labor Party faces a dilemma. They need to decide at their national conference: do they support the proven policies of the coalition government that have stopped the boats? Or will they do as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has done and refused to commit to maintaining the strong policies that have put the people smugglers out of business? Ms Plibersek was repeatedly asked—eight times in fact—whether Labor would commit to keeping the coalition government's strong border protection policies, which we know have stopped the boats, have stopped the deaths at sea, have returned money to the budget and have seen children released from detention. Time and time again, Ms Plibersek refused to commit. Only time will tell, and we on this side—
