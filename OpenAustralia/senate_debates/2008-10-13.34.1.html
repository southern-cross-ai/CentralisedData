       <p class="italic">
        These Orders incorporate the current edition of the Guidelines and Conditions for Export Sales and Nomination of Merino Rams as Export Semen Donors into the principal Orders.  Clause 7 of Annexure A to the Guidelines gives the Australian Association of Stud Merino Breeders Limited an absolute discretion to refuse entry for the sale of any rams, without liability for compensation.  This is a very broad discretion the exercise of which may adversely affect the business of sheep breeders.  No criteria or grounds have been specified as prerequisites for the exercise of the discretion.

         Instruments Nos. CASA 389/08 and CASA 390/08

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Both of these instruments, which commence on 1 August 2008, are intended to apply in the place of CASA 445/07 which expired on 31 July 2008.  As with CASA 445/07 the two instruments appear to provide for the cabin attendant to passenger ratio of one cabin attendant for every 50 passengers carried on Boeing 737-800 series aircraft.  The exemption from Civil Aviation Order 20.16.3 originally provided for in CASA 445/07 is now contained in two instruments, with CASA 389/08 providing for aircraft that carry 50 or fewer passengers and CASA 390/08 for aircraft carrying more than 50 passengers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Instrument No. CASA 445/07 was subject to a notice of disallowance that was not withdrawn by the Committee until 26 August 2008.  Section 47 of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 prevents the making of a legislative instrument that is the same in substance as an instrument that is subject to disallowance.  The Explanatory Statements that accompany these instruments make no reference to the notice of disallowance on CASA 445/07, nor whether legal advice was sought as to the implications of making the instruments while the notice was still active.  The Committee has written to the Minister seeking advice on this matter.

         The State

        of Design AD is to be regarded as if it were an Australian AD.  The Explanatory Statement that accompanies each instrument indicates that there is a wider proposal to amend Part 39 of the Civil Aviation Safety Regulations 1998 to authorise all State of Design ADs.  The Minister advised that under the proposed general amendments, non-
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_State" rel="nofollow">
         Australian State
        </a>
        of Design ADs will no longer be subject to Parliamentary scrutiny, while ADs generated and issued by CASA (either as the Australian State of Design or because of any safety issues identified by CASA) will continue to be considered legislative instruments and subject to Parliamentary scrutiny.  Such a distinction, based simply on country of origin of design, seems arbitrary and an invitation to inconsistency. Its effect seems to be to remove a large number of instruments from continuing parliamentary oversight. The Committee has written to the Minister seeking further information on this matter.

         Wool Services Privatisation (Research Body) Declaration 2008

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This instrument determines that Australian Wool Innovation Ltd (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWI" rel="nofollow">
         AWI
        </a>
        ) is the research body for the purposes of the Wool Services Privatisation Act 2000.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Explanatory Statement that accompanies this instrument advises that AWI was declared to be the research body in December 2000 but that its status lapsed in October 2006 when, due to an administrative error, the declaration was repealed by operation of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003.  Accordingly, this present instrument is expressed to commence retrospectively from 1 October 2006.  The Explanatory Statement also notes that AWI has continued to receive funding between 1 October 2006 and the date of this instrument.  It appears that the intention of this instrument, in part, is to retrospectively validate the receipt of those funds.  The use of a retrospective legislative instrument as a remedy in these circumstances may not be appropriate.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee sought advice from the Minister as to whether this is the intention of the instrument.  The Minister advised that the declaration is a precondition to entering into a contract but that it appears to be an administrative formality rather than a substantive requirement. The Committee has written to the Minister seeking clarification of this distinction.

          MIGRATION AMENDMENT (NOTIFICATION REVIEW) BILL 2008

         <b>
          Purpose of the Bill
         </b>
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The bill amends the Migration Act 1958 to make modifications to the notification regime that will assist in providing greater certainty in effective notification pending a broader review.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The amendments will reduce the Commonwealth’s exposure to risk. A failure or error in notification can have serious consequences that may result in the denial of access to review rights, inappropriate and potentially unlawful detention and possible removal of non-citizens who are not unlawful at the time of removal.  As highlighted starkly in the Commonwealth Ombudsman’s “Report into referred Immigration cases: notification issues” of June 2007, the complexities and difficulties in administering notification under the Act directly contributed to the unlawful detention of people.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The bill amends the Migration Act 1958 to:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Provide, in cases where other notification provisions would not apply to a minor, that where the Minister (or

         </li>
         <li>
          Provide that substantial compliance with the required contents of a notification document is sufficient unless the visa applicant is able to show the error or omission in the document causes them substantial prejudice;  and
         </li>
         <li>
          Provide that the deemed time of notification provisions will operate despite non-compliance with a procedural requirement for giving a document to an individual, where the individual has actually received the document, unless the individual is able to show they received the document at a later date, in which case they will be taken to have received the document at that date.
         </li>
        </ul>

          Reasons for Urgency
         </b>
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Non-compliance with the procedural requirements for notification means that statutory duties remain unperformed, with consequences for both the duration of bridging visas and the time limits for the exercise of merits and judicial review rights.  Strict judicial oversight of the complex notification provisions has caused uncertainty and has created large legacy caseloads which have proved difficult, if not impossible to address through litigation or administrative reforms.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         If the bill is not passed in the 2008 Spring sittings these measures, which go some way to addressing notification issues, will remain unresolved.

        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Public confidence in the Business (Long Stay) visa program has diminished and media attention continues to focus on cases of exploitation and abuse of overseas workers. The Government is reviewing all aspects of the program to improve its integrity. The measures introduced by this bill are necessary to foster a climate for longer term reforms which will seek to deliver necessary skills from an increasingly competitive global labour market with a minimum of regulation while effectively limiting abuse of the program.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         If the bill is not passed in the 2008 Spring sittings, the necessary reforms will not occur in a timely way and confidence in the Business (Long Stay) program will further diminish.
