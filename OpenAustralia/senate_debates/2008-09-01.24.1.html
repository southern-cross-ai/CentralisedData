        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Faulkner. What is the government’s response to calls by Pacific nations to suspend Fiji from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Islands_Forum" rel="nofollow">
         Pacific Islands Forum
        </a>
        ? Is it the government’s view that the suspension of Fiji from the Pacific Islands Forum will increase the likelihood of elections being held in Fiji sooner rather than later?

         I will provide Senator Payne with what information I have on this matter, and if it does not fully satisfy her I will obviously ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he can add any further information. I can say that the government is gravely concerned about the situation in Fiji, particularly recent statements by the Fiji interim government that it does not intend to honour its commitment to hold an election by March 2009. At their meeting in Niue on 21 August,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Islands_Forum" rel="nofollow">
          Pacific Islands Forum
         </a>
         leaders responded firmly on these issues, as you know, condemning the statements and making it clear that they expect the interim government to meet its election commitment.
        </p>
        <p>
         Leaders also expressed serious concern that the interim government did not attend the forum. Mr Bainimarama has shown his contempt, I think, for the region by not attending and explaining himself. The forum leaders’ resolutions followed a successful visit to Fiji by the forum’s Ministerial Contact Group in July. That group confirmed that an election by March 2009 is still possible providing there is political will on the part of the interim government. Forum leaders have directed the Ministerial Contact Group to continue to monitor the situation, including by possibly making another visit to Fiji. The group will report to leaders before the end of 2008 and make recommendations on further measures. Forum leaders will then consider convening a special leaders meeting this year to consider further measures, including the possibility of suspending Fiji from the forum.
        </p>
        <p>
         The forum has shown that abuse of democracy in the region is unacceptable and will not be tolerated. Australia urges the interim government to heed the concerns and expectations of its Pacific island neighbours and to work with the forum to ensure that an election is held by March 2009.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for that information. Can the minister also advise the Senate of the government’s awareness of the status of the much-vaunted electoral reform process, the development of the so-called People’s Charter, and whether there is any engagement by Australia or other donors or any of Fiji’s Pacific Island Forum colleagues in support of that process ?

           The information I have is that the People’s Charter process appears to be distracting the interim government from returning Fiji to democracy and the rule of law. I can say that Australia will not be providing financial support to assist what we believe is a flawed charter process. Australia’s position is consistent with that of the forum: we support an independent and inclusive dialogue in Fiji that is complementary to the interim government’s election commitment, that is supported by all key stakeholders and that is conducted without preconditions, threats, ultimatums or predetermined outcomes. Australia, along with other forum countries, is willing to assist in appropriate ways the independent, Commonwealth led, political dialogue process and, of course, all political parties in Fiji have agreed to participate in those talks.
