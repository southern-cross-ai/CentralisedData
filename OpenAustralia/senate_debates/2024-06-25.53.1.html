         Climate Change
        </a>
        and Energy, Senator Wong. Given how important affordable energy is to Australian households and business today, can the minister please outline the progress being achieved under the government's reliable renewables plan, and can the minister please provide details on the Albanese Labor government's plan to help Australians with their power bills right now?

         I thank Senator Pratt for her question, and I say to her that the only plan supported by experts to deliver the clean, cheap, reliable and resilient energy system Australia needs is Albanese government's reliable renewables plan. Under that, under Labor, we've had an increase in renewables in the national grid of around 25 per cent, we've had record investment in batteries and storage, we had over 330,000 rooftop solar installations last year alone and we've green-lit more than 50 renewable projects—enough to power three million homes. And, of course, from 1 July, the Albanese Labor government is taking $300 off the power bills for every household.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, as senators know, this stands in stark contrast to Mr Dutton and his nuclear reactors. He won't tell us what it will cost taxpayers. He won't say how much it will push up bills. Perhaps it's because his nuclear reactors are the most expensive option and they are decades away. Analysis by the Smart Energy Council estimates building the coalition's seven nuclear reactors could cost as much as $600 billion of taxpayer money. Who would have thought
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Dutton" rel="nofollow">
          Peter Dutton
         </a>
         was such a tax-and-spend socialist? That's $600 billion of taxpayers' money. This nuclear fantasy has to be one of the riskiest, most ill-thought-out policies ever put forward by a party of government—one of the worst we have ever seen.
        </p>
        <p>
         Now, we all know that we've got work to do after Australia suffered a decade of denial and delay and incompetent inaction under the Liberal and National Parties. Twenty-four out of 28 coal-fired power stations announced their closure under you, and you did nothing.

           We know the government's energy price relief will make a big difference to people right across the country. Can the minister please now detail the importance of providing certainty in the energy transition and the impact on Australians' energy bills of risky, unrealistic and uncosted alternatives?

           <p>
            Thank you, Senator Pratt. The Albanese government's energy plan is the best way to deliver cheaper, cleaner and more reliable energy. What we know about Minister Dutton's plan is it's too slow to keep the lights on, too expensive to build and too risky for Australia's energy needs. Since we have come to office, renewable generation in the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Electricity_Market" rel="nofollow">
             National Electricity Market
            </a>
            has increased by 25 per cent. That's a result of certainty for investors and industry. Even Senator Birmingham said last week, 'There is absolutely a place for large-scale renewables; it's an important part of the mix.' Of course, the day before, Mr Littleproud had said the opposite.
           </p>
           <p>
            As I said, 24 out of 28 coal-fired power stations announced their closure under you, and you did nothing, and you still haven't learned. You're putting forward a policy too slow to keep the lights on, too expensive to build and too risky for Australia's energy needs.

                    Matt Kean said, 'It would take far too long and be far too expensive.' Can the minister please explain to the Senate why renewables are the best way to achieve a more reliable, affordable and cleaner energy future for Australia?

                     I know how much those opposite like to be reminded about what Matt Kean has said, so I will just say that Mr Kean is right: reliable renewables are the best and cheapest way to secure Australia's energy future. Meanwhile what we have is Mr Dutton refusing to tell Australians how much it will cost to build nuclear reactors and refusing to tell Australians how much more their bill will be as a consequence of this policy. He also won't tell Australians how he's actually going to power the country in the decades it's going to take for these taxpayer funded reactors to be built. The only thing he will say—I love this!—is this: 'But it will be a big bill. It will be a big bill. No question about that—it will be a big bill.' That's the transparency with the Australian people of the alternative prime minister of Australia: 'It will be a big bill.'
