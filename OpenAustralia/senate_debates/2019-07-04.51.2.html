           The government congratulates the recent achievements of Australian women across a range of international sports. As a government we're investing significant resources in supporting rapid growth in women's sport across Australia. Recently, the Morrison government announced an investment of $150 million to support the development of female change rooms at sporting grounds and swimming facilities. This will drastically improve the state of women's sporting facilities across the country.
          </p>
          <p>
           In addition, our government is backing the bid to host the

           Women's World Cup in 2023 and we have made investments to boost women's participation in women's tennis and netball. Finally, through the Women Leaders in Sport program, we are providing support across the sports' sector in order to develop opportunities for women to reach their leadership potential.
