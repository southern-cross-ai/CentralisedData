        , Senator Canavan. Following reports today that there is strong community support for new coal-fired power stations, can you confirm that the government is considering the construction of a new coal-fired power station to put downward pressure on electricity prices and maintain the reliability of the network?

         I thank Senator Williams for his question. I, too, would like to echo the government's sentiments supporting and thinking about those people facing Cyclone Debbie in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
          North Queensland
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         The government is focused on doing everything we can to create jobs and bring down the cost of living for Australians and to improve the environmental sustainability of our energy network. We need cheap sources of power to create jobs. We need cheap sources of power to keep downward pressure on people's electricity bills. Coal remains one of the cheapest forms of power. That is why the government is open to considering new coal-fired power stations around our country.
        </p>
        <p>
         They are already working in our country, of course. They produce 70 per cent of the electricity on our eastern seaboard and 60 per cent nationally, and they are working right around the world too. Indeed, for the latest coal-fired power technology, ultrasupercritical coal-fired power, which burns coal at higher temperatures and has roughly 20 per cent to 30 per cent lower emissions, there are 123 of these units operating right around the world. And there are just over another 100 in planning for construction or operation very soon as well.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is working. I was in Japan in the last fortnight at the Isogo ultrasupercritical coal-fired power station. They had virtually no pollution at all. They had no particulate dust matter being emitted to a decimal point of parts per million of air. Their nitrous oxide results were only 0.06 grams per kilowatt hour, and their sulfur oxide was only 0.01 grams per kilowatt hour as well. It is a clean coal-fired power station. It does all of this while reducing its emissions from its previous plant by 17 per cent as well.
        </p>
        <p>
         What is wrong with clean coal? It creates jobs, it provides reliable power and it cuts emissions as well. It ticks all the boxes. That is why the government is focused on providing power that creates jobs in our economy and brings down prices.

           Noting that many countries around the world are building clean-coal power stations, can the minister inform the Senate of the contribution clean-coal technology could make to the affordability and reliability of Australia's energy mix?

            The senator is exactly right: many countries, as I said in my answer to the previous question, are building these latest coal-fired power stations around the world. If we were to replace our own coal-fired fleet with this latest technology, it would reduce our emissions in our coal-fired sector by about 21 per cent to 27 per cent. India has also made the decision to make sure all of its new coal-fired power stations are supercritical or above. It is also retrofitting some of its older coal-fired power stations with supercritical technology.

                    There is a cabal in this place that is combining to try to shut down coal-fired power stations in Australia. We know that members of the Greens have always had that view. But last week the Labor Party also supported a motion in this place saying that coal is on the decline and that we should walk away from coal-fired power and walk away from 70 per cent of our electricity supply.
