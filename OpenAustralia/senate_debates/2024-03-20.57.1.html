        It gives me great pleasure to rise today to do a little trip down memory lane, if the Senate will indulge me. On 16 November 2017, in here, I made a contribution on the outcome of the marriage equality plebiscite. The marvellous outcome had been announced only a day earlier. Sadly, we had to be put through that terrible time, in my opinionâ€”that couple of months going through to the plebiscite. We should never have had to have done that. But we know how the result turned out and how fantastic it was.
       </p>
       <p>
        In that contribution, I spoke about what the outcome meant to people like my right-hand man, Ben, from my office and his partner, James. I said the following:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For Ben in my office, the result yesterday and this bill mean that people want his relationship to matter. They want it to be equal and they want people like Benny and his partner, James, to have the opportunity to get married.
       </p>
       <p>
        Well, fast forward seven years and Ben and James just did that a couple of weeks ago. Ben and James got married in Perth on 8 March, surrounded by 200 of their nearest and dearest and me. It was just the most amazing day that I can say I've had at a wedding. For so many people, and for Fiona and me, it was our first same-sex marriage. My goodness me, what a beautiful day it was. The speeches were fantastic. There were the tears, the families, the grandparents and the loved ones. I can honestly say that I've been to a few weddings in my 64 years, but that, Benny, was my favourite. I'm so proud that I actually got to vote and make a difference so that same-sex couples can get married in this nation. Love is love.
