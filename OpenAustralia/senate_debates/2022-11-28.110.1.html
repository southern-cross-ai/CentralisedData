        My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Gallagher. Minister, I refer to the Prime Minister's comments on 2 September 2022. When asked whether there would be a new mining tax, he said, 'No, that's not on the agenda.' Minister, can you guarantee that Labor will not implement any new mining tax?

         I thank the senator for the question. I don't know everything that the Prime Minister said going back to 2 September, but I know he has been consistent in his language in that regard. That is what he's been saying. That is certainly the position of the government. But can I just say that we are a mature and responsible government that's dealing with very significant increases in prices for energy and an energy system that is creaking and collapsing under the weight of a decade of inaction from those opposite—22 failed energy policies, never landed one of them; the power was going to go out pretty much the day we took office. Since then we've had supply shortages, we've got cost escalation, and the member for Hume hid an increase in prices. So, we are dealing with and trying to clean up the complete and total shambles we inherited.

             I did answer the question up front. The government has no plans for a mining tax. The Prime Minister has been very clear on that. The Treasurer has been clear on that. But, for the information of those opposite, the government is in the area of energy—which I think has been linked to questions around tax increases—cleaning up a complete and total mess that you left us. That's the reality. Everyone knows it. That's the work that we are doing and that we will continue to do whilst we are in government.

               Minister, I refer to revelations on 11 November 2022 that your cabinet was considering implementing a mining tax. Does this mean the Prime Minister is considering breaking his promise?

                  We deliver on our commitments and we deliver on our promises. It's why we've delivered an increase in the minimum wage; it's why we held the Jobs and Skills Summit; it's why we're cleaning up the aged-care mess; it's why we passed the climate change bill; it's why we're debating the National Anti-Corruption Commission legislation later this week; it's why we passed laws for cheaper child care; it's why the budget had making medicines cheaper; and it's why we passed paid domestic and family violence leave. It's because we are a government that delivers on our commitments—every single one of them.
