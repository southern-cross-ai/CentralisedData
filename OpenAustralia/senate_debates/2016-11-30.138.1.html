        My question is to the cabinet secretary representing the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, Senator Sinodinos. Can the cabinet secretary outline what the Turnbull government is doing to open new markets for Australian businesses, particularly small- and medium-sized enterprises?

         I thank Senator Paterson for his question and for his interest in free trade. He is a convinced free-trader. We need more of them in this place! From the day we took office in 2013 the government has worked hard to gain preferential market access with our largest trading partners to benefit Australian businesses. At their core, the free trade agreements are designed to open up new markets or make us more competitive in the existing ones.
        </p>
        <p>
         Exports have played a crucial role in Australia's 25 years record of unbroken economic growth and the Liberal-National coalition's free trade agreements have ensured our exports continue to grow. The Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement has provided real benefit for a lot of great Australian businesses who will now have preferential market access secured under the Japan agreement and has taken our relationship with Japan to a new level.
        </p>
        <p>
         The China-Australia Free Trade Agreement tells a similar story for Australian businesses, with entire industries increasing their exports by 200 per cent. In the first six months of the China agreement coming into force we have seen lobster and crayfish exports up 218 per cent, milk powder up 196 per cent, mangoes up 165 per cent, fresh grapes up 118 per cent and fresh cherries up 127 per cent. It sounds like a day at the markets!
        </p>
        <p>
         The benefits of the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement are undeniable. And that is not to mention the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement, which covers more than $34 billion of trade annually between our two nations, and this number is set to grow with tariffs to come off 99.8 per cent of all Australian exports to Korea, Senator Sterle. The coalition government has a proud record when it comes to free trade.

            Yes, the work goes on, Senator Patterson. You are absolutely correct, through you,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">

            . The Turnbull coalition government—for it is a coalition government, and the National Party have benefited greatly from those free trade agreements, solid free traders—are working towards agreements with the European Union and Indonesia, and engaging with the United Kingdom post Brexit. We will continue to build support for an Australia-EU free trade agreement and reinforce the strength of Australia's relationship with the EU and its member states. The Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment met with the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commissioner" rel="nofollow">
             European Commissioner

            , and joined the Minister for Foreign Affairs in addressing the European parliament. The EU is our second-largest trading partner and our largest source of foreign investment. It is our largest two-way trade-in-services partner. A free trade agreement will drive economic growth and create jobs as European businesses look to Australia as a gateway to Asia.

When we oppose free trade agreements we are cutting off our nose to spite our face. We are a great trading nation. We can feed a large part of the world. We can do great things with our advanced manufacturing industries, building on our naval shipbuilding plan, and there are—

                 The National Party are great supporters—I will take that interjection—of free trade because they know the benefits to our rural and regional areas and to the Australian bush, and they are doing a great job of prosecuting them.

                 and others who have sought to wind-up the Labor Party on things like ChAFTA and stop those agreements coming into force. We will continue to prosecute the case for free trade. It is in our interest to do so.
