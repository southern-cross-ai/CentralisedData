        My question is to the Minister representing the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Agriculture, Senator Canavan. I refer to the statement of the Deputy Prime Minister, who said that the relocation of the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority to his own electorate would be carefully considered, managed responsibly and undertaken in consultation with staff, clients and stakeholders. Why is the minister ignoring the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Farmers'_Federation" rel="nofollow">
         National Farmers' Federation
        </a>
        , which in June voted against the relocation of the authority, and the concerns of Agribusiness Association of Australia, CropLife Australia and Animal Medicines Australia?

         I thank Senator Cameron for his question. It is actually a convenient segue from what I was just talking about—about how we believe in supporting the regions, on this side of politics; we believe in growing regional Australia; and we believe in creating new opportunities for those people who live in smaller towns, who might not have the benefits of those of us in larger cities.
        </p>
        <p>
         This town here, where some of those organisations Senator Cameron mentioned reside, benefited greatly from that government investment, that government involvement in creating those investments in those agencies, and that is what we want to try to do in other towns as well.

           . This is a segue from the question. The question was: why is the minister ignoring all of these organisations who rely on this organisation? He has not gone near that, and I want to know why he is ignoring the Farmers' Federation, Agribusiness et cetera.

             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Farmers'_Federation" rel="nofollow">
              National Farmers' Federation

             and other stakeholder groups, but I am here and the government is here to represent the people that elect us. We are all here as representatives of the people, not of particular organisations, not of particular stakeholders or sectional groups. We are here to represent the people we represent. I am proud, down here in our little corner of the National Party, to represent regional Australia. Many senators in the Liberal Party as well represent regional Australia, and many of our crossbenchers, and some Labor senators—unfortunately, fewer than before the election—represent regional areas. I am proud that we represent those people. I am proud that we have a plan to try to create more opportunity for them.
            </p>
            <p>
             So, while I accept that others will have different views on this issue and that others may disagree, as is their right to do, with our decision on these matters, we have made this decision. We have made it publicly. We took it to the election and the government was re-elected, and we have every intention of making sure that we meet our commitments to the Australian people that we made. One of these that is very important is growing our regional towns and communities, particularly by providing the seed capital, if you like, through government investment and government placements of staff, so that the broader economy can be created in our regional and country towns.

              I ask a supplementary question. I refer to the Deputy Prime Minister's comments yesterday that the cost-benefit analysis is complete; and in some areas it is indeterminate, in some areas it is saying it is of benefit and in other areas it is saying it is not of benefit. Why won't the Deputy Prime Minister front up to the Australian people about the cost of the relocation and its implications for the future of APVMA itself and its staff?

              <p>
               As I said in answer to the prior question, this has been a very public process the government has gone through to announce these potential relocations. We have gone through lots of consultation, as the senator indicates, and the responses of the various groups involved. The government has done a lot of work looking into the costs of this particular change, but of course as the government we will make a decision based on those costs and benefits, and we have made that decision—

                   . We have been very up-front with the Australian people about our plans. We have just gone to an election where those plans were put in front of the Australian people. I know these particular policies are very well supported in the regional communities that I represent, and we have every intention of making sure we meet those commitments. We have had a look and investigated the costs and benefits, and we have made a decision for the benefits of the broader Australian people, as we are here to do.
