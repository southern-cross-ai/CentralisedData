        WHISH-WILSON () (): My question is to Senator Wong, Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Water. Last year your government announced its commitment to a zero extinctions target for Australian native flora and fauna. During this announcement, Minister Plibersek proclaimed, 'I will not shy away from difficult problems or accept environmental decline and extinction as inevitable.' Minister, the ancient endangered maugean skate has been with us since the dinosaurs. It is found only in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macquarie_Harbour" rel="nofollow">
         Macquarie Harbour
        </a>
        , on the west coast of Tasmania, but has seen a 47 per cent decline in its tiny population between 2014 and 2021, since the expansion of industrial salmon farming in the harbour. Scientists researching the skate tell us it is possibly one extreme weather event away from extinction. Given the El Niño forecasts for marine heatwaves in the coming months in Tasmania, what is your government doing to immediately safeguard the skate from an extinction event this summer?

         I think I got a question last week from Senator Duniam which was probably the other side of this discussion, and I appreciate, as with so many issues in Tasmania, they're very strongly held views on either side of a very clear line. I appreciate that your focus is on one aspect of these matters in relation to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macquarie_Harbour" rel="nofollow">
          Macquarie Harbour
         </a>
         . Obviously, I got a question last week in relation to the Tasmanian salmon industry, and I would refer you to my answer to Senator Duniam about the industry.
        </p>
        <p>
         I'm advised that the Department of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
          Climate Change
         </a>
         , Energy, the Environment and Water will soon begin consultation about salmon farming in Macquarie Harbour. The consultation is as a result of applications made under the national environment laws by three groups who argue that salmon farming is having an unacceptable impact on the maugean skate—as you said, an endangered fish. I'd make the point that the environmental laws which require these applications to be considered were passed by the Howard government in, I think, early 2000.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, Ms Plibersek has announced a $2.1 million commitment to establish a captive breeding program to help the maugean skate. Obviously, there will be an opportunity in the consultation to consider the work of the joint Tasmanian and federal government maugean skate recovery team, the decision of the Tasmanian government's
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPA" rel="nofollow">

           Minister, the government's own conservation advice states that increasing water oxygenation through immediately destocking industrial salmon farming is the most critical action required to save the endangered skate from extinction. Why is Minister Plibersek consulting, ignoring the science and shying away from this difficult problem by not immediately pausing salmon farming in

              Well, I don't accept—and I'd refer you back to the status of the current applications and the commitment that Minister Plibersek has made to consultation. After the consultation period ends, the department will take some time to carefully consider the information received. The minister has indicated that salmon farming in
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macquarie_Harbour" rel="nofollow">
               Macquarie Harbour
              </a>
              does not have to pause while this occurs; I infer that that is a decision open to her. I also infer, from what you have said, that that's not something with which you agree, but that is obviously the decision that the minister has made.

                 I think we've made clear that we do support the aquaculture industry, including the Tasmanian salmon industry, but we've also said that the industry needs to continue to demonstrate that it can operate in a sustainable and responsible manner. I note that, just as some on one side of the debate will say that any environmental regulation is anti job, on the other side of the debate, you have some, on your side of the debate, who've seemed to assert—
