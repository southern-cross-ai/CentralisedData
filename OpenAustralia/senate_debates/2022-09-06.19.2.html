        There are many great causes and charitable organisations that we come across in these jobs. I do want to put on the record that Mr Scott Maggs, who is a longstanding friend of mine, has made a material difference to the lives of many by instituting a system of skin checks for people, which is something that they can easily control. Scott got onto this idea after a good friend of ours, Wes Bonny, unfortunately passed way from melanoma in his early 20s. One of the things that could have saved Wes's life was this idea of proactively going and getting your skin checked, perhaps once every six months or once a year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Scott has done an incredible job, on his own steam, of establishing an organisation called Skin Check Champions, where people can go and have their skin checked. If you look at his testimonials, he has saved dozens and dozens of people from having very difficult health outcomes, just by virtue of them having gone and got the check. As I say, in our role we meet so many terrific people who do so many great things for the community. I do think the brilliance of the Skin Check Champions idea and concept is that it is easy to understand, it is easy to do, and Scott has done a great job by doing it. Scott is also known, strangely, as Jimmy Niggles. I've never understood that alter ego, but it's good to have a few strange people in your life. Well done, Scott, you've done a great job. You've changed a lot of people's lives for the better.
