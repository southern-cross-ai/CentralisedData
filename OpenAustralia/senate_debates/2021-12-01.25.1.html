         already exists under the previous administration act but that the government has failed to appoint positions to this board for a number of years. The last appointments expired in 2015. Do you agree with this, and can you explain to the chamber why there have been no appointments to this board now for the last six years?

             I absolutely agreed with setting up this board as the appropriate model of governance. Every other Commonwealth entity of this type has a similar governance arrangement to that we are proposing in this bill. I think it will give the right level of oversight, accountability and transparency and also ensure that the role of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
              CEO
             </a>
             of the

              MA
             </a>
             can focus on the day-to-day duties and leave that largely governance oversight to the appropriate mechanism in the board.
            </p>
            <p>
             As to why vacant positions on the advisory board that have existed in the past have not been filled, obviously that's been a decision of government. As you know, currently there's a nine-person advisory board. It had no legislative powers to direct any course of action. So it being in existence or not didn't actually result in any direct kinds of specific actions out of the CEO. The course we've taken is appropriate. It's taken some time to get agreement to the changes that we have proposed. They're before the Senate now and, rightfully, we're looking for the Senate to support them.

               As I said in my previous answer, there are two reasons. There was a decision of government, specifically, by current and previous agriculture ministers. As I said, the advisory board had no legislative powers to direct any course of action. The
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APV" rel="nofollow">
                APV

                MA
               </a>
               already has the ability to consult with stakeholders without that advisory board. As such, while the advisory board created considerable costs, it actually didn't necessarily serve that regulatory function and the government made the decision to cease the board on this basis. That is why we're now putting in the actual governance board that we are—because, as I said earlier, it was a decision of government and the advisory board, as it stood, couldn't direct in the way that you may think it might have been able to, Senator Whish-Wilson.

                [by video link] Well, it may have been able to if it had actually been set up. Minister, you mentioned it was a decision of government. I want to raise again the concerns that were raised by the Labor Party and the Greens during the 2019 inquiry into the bill by the rural and regional affairs committee:

                Governance Board will not have the power to independently set the APVMA's strategic direction, drive its operational performance, set an appropriate risk management framework and ensure greater accountability. Under the proposed legislation the Minister will continue to have the power to direct the APVMA and will be provided with the power to direct the board in the performance of its functions.

                Is this still is case with the bill before us today? Will the minister be able to direct the APVMA governance board once it's set up?

But what's the point of appointing a board with various levels of expertise if the minister can still direct it—for example, in relation to its strategic direction, its operational performance, its risk management framework and its accountability?

You may be aware, minister, there were very strong criticisms in relation to Minister Littleproud's first principles review into this issue, and that review has led to this legislation today. What assurances can you give that the construction of this board, that constitutes the advice, will be independent of industry? By that I mean the chemical industry, that makes these veterinary and other chemicals that are applying for registration.

                         doesn't use the very best regulatory science on which to base its decision about the safe and sustainable regulation of agricultural and veterinary chemicals in this country. Internationally, Australia is known for basing its decision around these matters on science, and that underpins so much of our successful trading relationships, particularly in agricultural products. I've already answered the question, with respect to the skill set of the board.

                          [by video link] I raised it in my second reading speech as well, Minister. Expert groups such as the National Toxics Network, which is basically made up of scientists, believe Australia has a very lax system of control of agricultural chemicals and we're out of lock step with other countries such as the

                         <p>
                          For example, there's new information coming to light—I always leave these things to the scientific process, Minister. I don't criticise scientists. I think it's their job, through a scientific process, to be constantly critiquing each other's—hopefully—independent research. You may be aware that last Friday, only a couple of days ago, there was a new report out of the EU. It highlights that only two out of 11 herbicide studies given to EU regulators are now deemed reliable. So nine out of 11 studies that were used for the regulation of these chemicals, on further review under the scientific process, have been shown to be unreliable in terms of looking at the impacts on human health. I can send the chamber a copy of that report.

                          were there, I would seek to table it. My point is that the scientific process is ongoing, and it is a factual point—a point of significant controversy both in Australia and elsewhere—that industry contributes to and pays for research studies into its own products.

                          My question is on the theme I just raised. I meant very seriously what I said in my second reading speech about farmers being the most at-risk cohort in human health from the use of pesticides and herbicides. Of course, pesticides and herbicides can have broader environmental impacts when they get into rivers and streams, and they potentially impact soil health—something I was very familiar with as a grapegrower myself. Have there been any studies done looking at farmers as a cohort and cancer rates in farming communities versus other controls in other parts of our community? Have there been any health impact studies on farmers, who use these chemicals more than anyone else?

                            [by video link] Minister, I'd ask you to reconsider your response. The question I'm asking is absolutely critical, pivotal and fundamental to this bill that we have before us today. No-one is impacted more by potential health impacts from the use of herbicides and pesticides than farmers. They're used in weed control by local governments and there are other cohorts who use them, but farmers are essentially the key people using these products. So if there's a lax system, or a suboptimal or substandard system for registering products that could potentially be dangerous to human health, then that is exactly what we're debating today. So I would ask that you reconsider and I will ask the question again. Have there been any studies done on cancer rates in farmers versus controls or in other community cohorts?

They're the users of these products. On the other side, of course, we have the producers who manufacture them and who want to get them to market and make as much money as possible. Then in between we have scientists and other experts. My point that I will finish on is: it's not the
