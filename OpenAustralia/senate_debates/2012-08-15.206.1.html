         The strategy for recruitment and retention of suitably skilled procurement professionals engaged by DSG is to recruit personnel with some procurement skills and provide access to appropriate professional training, on the job training and coaching to increase skill levels to a suitable level. Retention of fully qualified procurement staff is an ongoing issue due to the competitive remuneration available in the private sector. The further introduction of Shared Service Reform allows DPCB the opportunity to fully develop staff skill levels and to provide better career structures for procurement staff wishing to seek advancement in their field of expertise without needing to leave the Group or Defence.
