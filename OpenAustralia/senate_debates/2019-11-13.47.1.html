         I thank Senator Hughes very much for her question. Of course, I know this brings together issues very important and dear to your heart in terms of support for rural and regional Australian communities and, of course, support for all Australian schoolchildren to be able to access a quality education. The Morrison government firmly believes that every Australian child, no matter where they live and no matter their circumstances, should have access to a world-class education be that early education, school education or tertiary education. That's why we continue to provide record funding for early childhood education and child care, some $8.6 billion this year growing through to $9.9 billion by 2021-22. It's why we're providing record funding for Australian schools, some $310 billion over the next 10 years, an increase of 62 per cent per student. And it's why we're providing record funding for Australian universities, some $17.7 billion in this year alone.
        </p>
        <p>
         We know that in these difficult times of drought Australian communities stand together and support one another, Australian schools lend a hand and support one another and, as a government, we stand firmly in support of those communities and those schools as well. It's why we've worked to provide additional special circumstances funding in a number of targeted ways over the course of this year. It's by initially providing some $4 million in special circumstances funding particularly for schools affected by floods in north Queensland, but earlier this month now extending that, providing $10 million in special circumstances funding to support schools facing financial hardship as a result of the ongoing drought conditions affecting much of Australia—and particularly much of

         where you come from, Senator Hughes. This is important support for schools, for the families and for those students in terms of providing additional practical assistance that complements the types of drought measures that Senator McKenzie was outlining to the chamber earlier and is all part of the comprehensive approach our government is taking to responding to the drought.

            As we know, communities, families, schools and their students are all affected by drought and those school communities themselves play a very valuable part in supporting students and families in helping them through the stresses and the tough times that come with these circumstances. Some schools offer fee concessions, discounts; others have had to step up financial assistance counselling or counselling services to individual students. The funding that we are providing is intended to help ensure that schools remain financially viable, that students who need it are supported with additional counselling services, that assistance is there for families in drought affected areas in terms of fee relief where they need it—all of which complements other programs such as the Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme, which provides targeted assistance to support families in rural and regional Australia. We're applying this program in a way where we're seeking applications from schools in drought affected areas to make sure the dollars flow to those who need it most.

               In addition to the childcare subsidy our government provides, families and services in rural and regional remote areas benefit from the Community Child Care Fund, part of our government's childcare safety net. The Community Child Care Fund program will deliver a total of $327 million over five years to around 980 services, of which some $224 million has been allocated to more than 480 services in regional and remote parts of Australia. Earlier this month the Morrison government announced that a further $5 million is being made available from the Community Child Care Fund, especially in targeted support for early learning centres that cater for children aged from zero to five who attend centres in drought affected areas. Where a service is experiencing decreased demand or financial pressure due to drought conditions it's eligible to apply for a special circumstances grant of up to $10,000 under a streamlined process to ensure funds are quickly available on the ground, enabling them to better support their families.
