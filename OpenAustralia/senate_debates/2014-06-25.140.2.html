        In my inimitable way, I have actually put off putting pen to paper until the eleventh hour for this speech, as in my mind the process was akin to drafting my own obituary. I have received so many offers from different quarters who wanted to take the opportunity to assist me to ensure that I canvassed certain matters of interest. I suspect that I have probably failed them in their quest, but I know with certainty that this is no obituary and no goodbye.

        I am honoured to follow the trailblazing footsteps of Dame Ivy Wedgwood, the first Liberal woman to be elected in the Senate from Victoria in 1950 and the first woman to chair a Senate committee. Together with Dame Elizabeth Couchman, the then president of the

        , she negotiated a tough deal with

         Sir Robert Menzies
        </a>

        in 1945 demanding that women were equally represented throughout all structures of the party. This structure continues today and provides a pathway for women to engage with politics.

        position held by Dame Ivy Wedgwood has been held by only a further three Liberal senators, all women, including two cabinet ministers: Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, Dr Kay Patterson and myself. I have to say that it saddens me that on 1 July this tradition will be broken and for the first time in 64 years Victoria will not be represented by a Liberal woman in the Senate.

        What I did not know when starting out was the breadth of knowledge and expertise I would develop along the way. I owe my understanding of pelagic fisheries the Senator Colbeck. For those of you who have not been paying attention, I seek leave to table an exhibit for those who need to visualise what I am talking about—a small fish! I might give this to the attendants.

          I actually will put it back in the water! As the daughter of a market gardener, I can now hold my own on the subjects of fenthion, genetic modification, spores, bumblebee pollination, fruit flies, salination, pineapples—thanks Bozzie—and irrigation channels, and the list goes on.

          I have been very fortunate from day one to participate in committees of my choosing and one of those is the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee. I have had the benefit of first serving under the eminent former deputy chair, Dr Russell Trood, and presiding as chair of the references committee. Whilst the committee has been engaged in a number of inquiries, the inquiry into
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS" rel="nofollow">
           HMAS
          </a>
          <i>
           Success
          </i>
          and improper behaviour to women was galvanising. Evidence presented during the inquiry reinforced the need for the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Defence Force
          </a>
          to revisit its culture and its practices to ensure a level playing field for all men and women. It has been encouraging to see this addressed, but I have been mortified by the recent reports of abuse at HMAS
          <i>
           Leeuwin
          </i>
          .
         </p>
         <p>
          The opportunity to participate in the parliamentary and ADF exchange programs enabled me to directly experience the extraordinary service, professionalism and distinction of our Defence men and women. Visiting Afghanistan and the waters to the north of Australia and taking part in the biennial
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIMPAC" rel="nofollow">
           RIMPAC
          </a>
          exercise have only reinforced my respect. So it is with a heavy heart that I say we should expect and demand more. There should be zero tolerance for any substandard behaviour. The ADF needs to get its entire house in order. The appalling behaviour of only a few diminishes the reputation of the whole. Bad behaviour must be stamped out.
         </p>
         <p>
          It is imperative that as a leading
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World" rel="nofollow">
           First World
          </a>
          nation in the Asia-Pacific region we further our relationship with our nearest neighbours for mutual gain. The integration of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFAT" rel="nofollow">
           DFAT
          </a>
          with former agency AusAID is a very principled decision by Foreign Minister Bishop and one that I fully support. It is important that foreign policy, trade, aid and defence strategy be determined in concert with each other and not as independent silos, with a common goal of creating a secure, prosperous and stable region.
         </p>
         <p>
          The effectiveness of our aid program and the way that we ensure bang for our buck has been a keen interest of mine, as you all know, for the last six years. Taxpayers have every right to know how their money is spent and with what outcome. I commend Foreign Minister Bishop. She has already proved that talent and ambition for our nation opens up so many opportunities, and the next decade will be an exciting one for Australia.
         </p>
         <p>
          It would be remiss of me to comment on matters of an international nature without recognising the leadership, initiative and determination that Prime Minister Abbott has demonstrated on the international stage. Foreign diplomacy is a subject that many study for years but don't get right. Like many, I have been so impressed by the way the Prime Minister has engaged with his counterparts from Davos to
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Dhabi" rel="nofollow">
           Abu Dhabi
          </a>
          , Normandy to Tokyo, Washington to
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Moresby" rel="nofollow">
           Port Moresby
          </a>
          . It is history that will judge his international forays by outcomes, and he, together with my friend and Victorian colleague the Hon.
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Robb" rel="nofollow">
           Andrew Robb
          </a>
          , has concluded two free trade agreements, with another seven advanced, all in the first nine months.
         </p>
         <p>
          I think we would all agree that leadership is not a job for the faint-hearted. Having first met the Prime Minister over 25 years ago, I have known him outside the rigours of parliament. He is a man who carries the mantle of leadership with gravity and responsibility. He has shirked the easier road of populism, and I commend him for making tough decisions so early in this government in order to set the nation back on a fiscally responsible path.
         </p>
         <p>
          In the very early days of this government, behind the scenes, and together with the Hon.
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Bishop" rel="nofollow">
           Julie Bishop
          </a>
          , he sought to liaise with his counterparts in the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UAE" rel="nofollow">
           UAE
          </a>
          , where a Victorian,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Joyce" rel="nofollow">
           Matt Joyce
          </a>
          , had been arrested and detained for over four years. It would be fair to say that the arrest and detention of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Joyce" rel="nofollow">
           Matthew Joyce
          </a>
          and Marcus Lee was a matter that I had been very passionate about. Matt was facing a 10-year prison sentence in a Dubai cell, with a $25 million fine. It is always difficult to provide support for Australians caught up in legal proceedings in foreign jurisdictions, whilst respecting the autonomy of the nation and its court system. I was convinced of their innocence. The matter was complex, and I sought assistance discreetly behind the scenes, but to no available. I used the parliament to advocate for two Australians who had no voice. I was threatened. I was bullied. But I have to say—and those who know me will not be surprised to hear—that it only strengthened my resolve.
         </p>
         <p>
          I want to put on the record my gratitude to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs for their direct entreaties that saw Matt Joyce fly home shortly after the Abbott government assumed office. Their actions enabled an innocent Australian man to walk free and resume his life with his young family—and a man, I hasten to add, whom I have never met. There is no way in which I can adequately express my appreciation to them for facilitating his freedom.
         </p>
         <p>
          I consider my position in the Senate as a privileged one that has allowed me to advocate on behalf of many. I am the 528th person to have been elected to the Senate since Federation. This is an honour that is bestowed upon so few, and one that I will always be grateful for. I thank the people of Victoria and the Liberal Party for the opportunity.
         </p>
         <p>
          Serving as the chief whip in opposition and in government, I have worked closely with senators on all sides of the chamber, and I appreciate the professionalism and good humour we have shared. It is not to say that there has not been a little argy-bargy going on behind the scenes to keep us all on our toes. I would particularly like to thank Senator McEwen and her deputy whips, Senator Xenophon, Senator Madigan and Senator Siewert. We all know that I have taken a few swipes at the Greens in my time, yet Senator Siewert has never allowed partisan politics to interfere with the running of this chamber—and I thank you, Rachel.
         </p>
         <p>
          In the lead-up to the 2010 Victorian state election, I was concerned that the Liberal Party would preference the Greens over Labor, just as they preferenced
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Bandt" rel="nofollow">
           Adam Bandt
          </a>
          for the seat of Melbourne in the previous federal election. I respect the right of the Greens to advocate their ideological platform but I took umbrage at the thought that the Liberal Party would compromise its values and principles by trying to outflank the Left from the left. It would be fair to say that I took some heat in calling the Liberal Party hierarchy out on it publicly—and I think I still have the scorch marks to attest to that! It was a very tense six weeks. But, as history now records, this decision turned the tide of discontent, and the state coalition was rewarded with office, for standing up for the proud Menzies tradition. It was the right thing to do. It was also a decision that was strongly applauded by party members, who, after all, are the ones who provide those of us on this side of the chamber the opportunity to serve.
         </p>
         <p>
          Being the patron senator for Bruce, Chisholm and Deakin has been a lot of hard work but most rewarding. Working the outer eastern corridor of Melbourne as if it were one giant seat has shown me that the members in the other chamber have it easy. I am so pleased that some of them are in the chamber today to hear this. The local volunteers worked with me to advance the cause and, in six years, we have won back the seat of Deakin. We now have a talented representative in Michael Sukkar—and I am so pleased to see you in the chamber tonight, Michael.
         </p>
         <p>
          In Bruce and Chisholm, the organisation has been regenerated and revitalised. A highlight for me has been working with such committed and interesting people, who would be millionaires if they were able to bill their time. In the interest of time, I note the great work of the electorate executives under the chairmanships of Jeanette Milnes, Tom Daniel, Noel Pink, Ian Hansen and Clyde Aitken. They are wonderful people and they have earned my enormous respect. I have to say that you get to know each other well when on your hands and knees, rolling out banner wrap at midnight.
         </p>
         <p>
          My political travails have been shared with my very good and loyal friend, former party state president and treasurer, Russell Hannan—who is in the gallery this afternoon. Former party state presidents never retire. It is in their

Michael, you have never wavered in your support; you actually take hits on my behalf; we are great friends, but more importantly you are a wonderful father. Thank you.

         </p>
         <p>
          I have shared the highs and lows for over 15 years now with Senator Ronaldson—and I am hoping I actually look a bit better than he does 15 years on. And I am going to use the fact that this is a valedictory to call him 'Ronno' because he is a true friend. He is a man of enormous integrity and talent. I am very blessed to call you a friend, and we all know that real friends in this place are a very rare commodity. I thank you.
         </p>
         <p>
          My offices in Burwood and Canberra tick over like a steam train: smooth and quiet on the surface with furious activity below to keep it all going, with, seemingly, breakdowns only when I am around. My heartfelt thanks to Suzanne, Harriet, Amanda, Sybille—who is manning the phones in Melbourne—Bevan, Karen, as well as Kate and Emily, who were with me before the election. I have to say that I am looking forward to that lunch on Monday, but I could not have done it without you, and I thank you. To my former chief of staff, Brad Rowswell, I say: I think you are a star, but I am very mindful that if I say that you will not be able to get out the door when you leave. He is talented, decent and irreverent—a winning combination.
         </p>
         <p>
          As whip, I work closely with so many professionals who ensure that the Senate practices and procedures are observed. My thanks to the inexhaustible Dr Rosemary Laing, Brien Hallett,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Reed" rel="nofollow">
           Chris Reed
          </a>
          , Bronwyn Notzon, Richard Pye, the table office, the committees' secretaries, the attendants—particularly John who continues to humour my repetitive jokes—Hansard reporters and security—the people who actually keep this place physically up and running. Ian and Peter, who look after us all so well in Senate transport, and the many Comcar drivers all make a difference. It will be a Comcar driver who delivers me home and who will be my last contact with the myriad support personnel who make this place tick.
         </p>
         <p>
          In closing, I turn to the most important people in my life: my family. My contribution to public service has only been made possible with their love, support and understanding. My 90-year-old mother still holds sway over her son and two daughters, and I am so fortunate to have had her guidance and that of my father who died before my Senate foray. To be honest, I think he would have thought I was absolutely nuts. In my first speech I spoke of the importance of my family and what they mean to me. My crowning glory is neither my time here nor my contribution to the political landscape, but rather my sons, Jack and Simon. They are intelligent, decent and compassionate young men who make Michael and I very proud every day. They continue to inspire me. Put simply, I could not have served here in the Senate without their support. We laugh together and we cry together, but most importantly we treasure our lives together. My only advice to them is: never fear failure, because you will never know what could be if you do not at least try. Whilst success is sweet, regret is a lost opportunity. Thanks.

           , many standards have been set in the last two weeks in senators giving their valedictory speeches. There was the standard of a short statement, going for about 40 or 45 minutes. Yesterday there was the standard set by my good friend Senator Ursula Stephens, which was the singing of a beautiful Irish song. To not be outdone, I brought into the chamber today the lyrics of Meatloaf,
           <i>
            Bat out of Hell
           </i>
           . But I am not going to sing!

            I know many are disappointed, but I am not going to go down that path. But, seriously, as third on the Labor Senate ticket, both in the 2007 and 2013 general elections, I personally held no expectations beyond fair odds of any chance of being successful. It was not my good looks or larrikin personality that got me elected in 2007; it was the Kevin 07 campaign, the Your Rights at Work campaign and the support from Senator Hogg, Senator Moore and many other Queensland senators and other Queensland MPs. And let us not forget the Queensland members of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
             Queensland Labor Party
            </a>
            .
           </p>
           <p>
            Sadly, the Kevin 13 campaign did not have enough energy to bring me into the third position home last year. Notwithstanding that, it was an achievement to have won the third spot in 2007—an achievement not reached in 29 years—to win the unwinnable third Senate spot in Queensland.
           </p>
           <p>
            Before coming to the Senate, some person with words of wisdom said to me: 'Your life is about to change.' Those words of wisdom came from you,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
             Mr President
            </a>
            . And certainly my life did change. But one thing did not change: they may have taken the boy out of Queensland but they never, ever took the Queensland out of the boy. I remain humbled and privileged, despite the amazing opportunity provided to me, to represent my state of Queensland as one of 12 senators. I do not think there can be any greater privilege provided to anyone in this country.
           </p>
           <p>
            Like many other senators who have spoken in this chamber before have said, not only in valedictory speeches but on other occasions, the main work is committee work. I was extremely privileged to have served on a copious number of committees. Firstly, on the economics committee where I was provided with the opportunity to be involved in the inquiry into the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_Pollution_Reduction_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
             Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme
            </a>
            and also the Senate select committee's inquiry into climate policy, followed by the community affairs committee, and the legal and constitutional affairs committee. I chaired the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances and I was also a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I chaired the Defence Subcommittee. I was Deputy Chair of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee" rel="nofollow">
             Joint Committee
            </a>
            on the Australian Commission for
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_Enforcement" rel="nofollow">
             Law Enforcement
            </a>
            Integrity and a member of the Joint Committee on Law Enforcement. At some stage I wondered when I would get the time to serve on some of these committees. At one stage, I was actually on nine committees in total.
           </p>
           <p>
            Resulting from my involvement in these committees, two memorable trips remain etched in my memory. The first inquiry, while a member of the community affairs committee, was the petrol sniffing inquiry. Despite having travelled to Cherbourg, which is approximately 3.5 hours west of Brisbane, with local Aunty Honor Cleary, on several occasions and experiencing the community of Woorabinda—which is west of Rockhampton, in Queensland—in my time as an industrial officer with the Queensland Police Union, nothing ever prepared me for the understanding of the remote Indigenous communities in the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
             Northern Territory
            </a>
            throughout this particular inquiry.
           </p>
           <p>
            Despite whatever persuasion of government, we must never rest until the gap is closed in this country. I believe that as Australians we are responsible for the living standards of our first Australians so it is only proper that we pursue our responsibilities to ensure their lives are lifted to the same level which we enjoy. I know that Senator Peris, my good friend, will not rest until this happens.
           </p>
           <p>
            Secondly, as chair of the Defence Subcommittee, I was extremely privileged to lead a delegation to Afghanistan and experience firsthand the professionalism and dedication our men and women provide each and every day in dangerous and arduous conditions. Wherever they serve in the world, this is a commitment they are sworn to office with and a commitment they carry out very proudly. These men and women are the salt of the earth for the selfless commitment they make in defending and representing our country.
           </p>
           <p>
            I remember the trip quite well, in particular in
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarin_Kowt" rel="nofollow">
             Tarin Kowt
            </a>
            , flying up to a forward operational base, a
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOB" rel="nofollow">
             FOB
            </a>
            , in a
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hawk" rel="nofollow">
             Black Hawk
            </a>
            helicopter to a local community and meeting with locals and hearing about the particular issues they were faced with. I do not think there was any greater privilege than being in that circumstance and understanding and appreciating the trust and commitment that those community leaders had for our brave men and women in the FOB in that location.
           </p>
           <p>
            The other memorable event was going to the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul, and standing there watching an Afghan soldier writing on the whiteboard. You might think there is nothing unusual about that, but this particular gentleman had not been able to write or read six weeks earlier. It was the professional training our Australian troops provided this particular gentleman with that enabled him to write in his own language, Pashtun, and teach his fellow Afghan soldiers.
           </p>
           <p>
            Also I delved deep into parliamentary Defence programs in Amberley
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
             RAAF
            </a>
            Border Protection Command up in Darwin with Talisman Sabre and RIMPAK. Like Senator Kroger, I thoroughly enjoyed those opportunities and I would encourage everyone regardless of your time, to take at least one opportunity to be involved in the parliamentary Defence programs.
           </p>
           <p>
            Labor in office delivered so much in government—the apology, paid parental leave, the

            , repealing unjust industrial relations laws and introducing balanced legislation based on a fair go for all consistent with the egalitarian society Australia was built on. And like you, Mr President, during the global financial crisis and after it, I was privileged to go along to a number of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BER" rel="nofollow">

            , openings. I did not open anywhere near as many as you did. I think I got to around about 139, ranging from Charleville to Bundaberg in my five duty seats of Longman, Dickson, Brisbane, Forde and Wright. It was always a privilege to be involved in those openings and see the good work that we provided to those schools, schools that provided science rooms and halls and, on many occasions, libraries for the first time ever.
           </p>
           <p>
            I just want to reflect on one matter in my first speech with regard to climate change. Towards the end, I said this:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            With full respect, I bring the challenge to you, fellow senators, that we combine our skills to be part of the generation that took the opportunity to change the direction of climate change, and not the last generation that was responsible for the demise of our nation and the world.
           </p>
           <p>
            Please do not judge me as a tree-hugging Green—I am not—but I think we need to appreciate our environment and we need to appreciate the fact that there is climate change. Certainly during the carbon pollution reduction scheme inquiry and also the climate change inquiry, I heard plenty of evidence that indicated that climate change is real. So the only real concern I had as a result of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPRS" rel="nofollow">
             CPRS
            </a>
            bills was the fact that the Greens voted with the coalition to defeat the CPRS bills, and that was a disappointment to me.
           </p>
           <p>
            I wish opposition leader

            , and Senator Wong here in the Senate, all the best in returning Labor to government in 2016, and I thank also the whips and the staff. They have been an amazing help and assistance too. Regardless of whether we are in government or in opposition, they are always there to help us and it has been a privilege to be involved with them. Additionally, I would like to wish all the best to Senators Parry and Marshall in your forthcoming roles. No doubt they will be discussed when the Senate resumes a fortnight from now. And also to all fellow senators, regardless of whatever party you are involved in, it has been a privilege to have been here with you in this chamber and during our many, many dealings in committee work and our exchanges across the chamber. There is no malice in that. It is something that we do here and I think that in some respects there is a bit of humour and at times we should remember that.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would like to thank the Queensland Labor Party—the secretary,

            , and past organiser, Chris Forrester, for their support in my being able to have this fantastic privilege to represent Queensland in this chamber. I would also like to thank the trade union movement. The trade union movement should be recognised for the good work they do. It is important that workers have a voice to protect them from unjust workplace laws and unsafe acts. I was privileged to be involved in my capacity to assist the Services Union in this chamber along with a number of other members and senators including
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shayne_Neumann" rel="nofollow">

            from Queensland to make sure that they achieved the pay equity case. I wish Neil Henderson, the secretary of that union, and Jen Thomas, the very best for the future.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the other things that I took seriously was my involvement with the multicultural community, and I guess in some respects that comes from my background as a trade union official dealing with the most multicultural workplace,

            . I engage with as many organisations and ethnic communities as possible—the Lebanese, Taiwanese, Chinese, African and countless others. My good friends, Nabil and Awatef, were two of the first people I met at a Lebanese function on Anzac Day in 2006 and there are the Obeid family—no relation to that Obeid in

            ; I am told that the name is like 'Smith', another example of how we should not stereotype one's name—and also Sharon Orapeleng, the past president of the Queensland African Community Council, of which I am a proud member, to name just a few. It is great to be involved in their communities.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would like to digress to a story about migrants. There was an opportunity where a Congolese gentleman, approximately the same age as my son, came into my office one day around 2009. We will call him Simon. He came to me and he said: 'Mark, I need your help. My two children are back home in the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Congo" rel="nofollow">
             Republic of Congo
            </a>
            . I can't get them to Australia.' He told me this story which still touches me. He spoke about his activities as a human rights activist, going out into his country trying to record and accumulate data around what happened in the atrocities in the Republic of Congo. He was out on this particular day and while he was returning home he was stopped by one of his relatives, who said: 'Don't go home. Your home has been burnt down. Your wife's been murdered but we've protected your children. We have your girls. They're after you. Escape the country now.' Well, he did. Simon escaped the country. He went through those detention centres in Africa and eventually he was accepted as a humanitarian refugee by our country.
           </p>
           <p>
            We went through all the bases of getting his two girls out here, which we could not have done without the help of my amazing staff. Finally they were united about two years later, and I am now the proud godfather of those two girls. As a government, we can do more for migrants in this country. Rather than reducing the migration intake, we should be increasing that amount.

            is such an amazing workplace, and I am sure you all agree. It never ceases to amaze me. From the moment you arrive in the morning, all of us are greeted by a friendly Comcar driver who drops you off, and some of us are greeted by a cleaner who has just completed cleaning your room and has thoroughly cleaned your suite during the early hours of the morning. Then, for me, it is off to the parliamentary gym where the staff spot you on your exhaust repetition weights you are lifting. I know Senator Mason is not here today, but he was kind enough to drop me a note. Probably only he would understand that. Then it is a chat with either Dom or Antonio from Aussie's after your workout.
           </p>
           <p>
            Later on in the day you are greeted by our friendly Senate chamber attendants as you enter the chamber for morning prayers. Of course, there is the professionalism of the staff from the Clerk's Office to help you get through whether it is—a bill or a procedural matter—while you chair this amazing chamber, ensuring the business is progressed. Additionally, you may engage with the competent secretariat committee staff while being part of a committee meeting. In fact, everywhere you turn in this place you have the utmost support from all staff of parliament. While not singling anyone out intentionally, I do appreciate the support that Ian and Peter from Senate Transport have provided and their tireless work in ensuring you get to and from the Senate. Also, to the Clerk, Rosemary Laing, Deputy Clerk, Richard Pye, Maureen, Brien and Chris: thank you for your guidance and your knowledge in respect to my capacity of chairing this chamber at times. It has been invaluable. Thank you to everyone from Hansard who turns words into meanings.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, I think one of my favourite pastimes that I will miss is the end of the week evening meal at Timmy's Kitchen—one of our favourites. Most Thursdays you will find Senator Hogg, Senator Bilyk, Senator Polley, Senator Peris, Senator Farrell, Senator Tillem and Senator Bishop there, just to name a few—sometimes the characters change. We end up there, having an excellent but simple meal and friendly conversation over a bottle of wine—or two.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will continue my work for and my involvement in and commitment to Relay for Life, and I thank Senator Moore for her involvement in my team since 2006. I also thank my good friend Vicki James from Queensland Cancer Council and all the other team mates who have been through over the years to raise money to the tune of over $120,000 since 1996. I salute you for your efforts and your commitment to finding a cure for cancer which affects so many of us in our communities.
           </p>
           <p>
            Now I turn to my staff, and I do not have to tell other senators that we would be helpless in this workplace without the staff that we have here. I am so grateful that most of them are here today for this moment. Christine, unfortunately, could not be here today. Christine is my rock and throughout she has been without fault in regards to anything. It has been such a great opportunity to have her on my staff. Unfortunately, she is at home with her first child, Eva, and is unable to be here today. Eva Doolan came into the world five weeks early on 26 May, and the family is doing well. I really do not know how I could have got through a week without Christine's conscientious commitment.
           </p>
           <p>
            Terry, I appreciate your meticulous attention to detail in everything you do, whether it be constituent matters or other duties in the office. Thank you for your endless professionalism. Abdul, despite calling yourself Adam, you will always be Abdul to me. Just one word Abdul: concentrate—and you will get what you are looking for. Thank you for your loyalty and friendship. Then there is Abby. You brought a new dimension to the office. You became the social butterfly of the office while maintaining my financial records. You made us all laugh while maintaining those boring accounts. Lastly, Trent, your mum, Lee, would have been so proud of you for all your commitment to my office.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lastly, I turn to my family. I think, in this line of work you sometimes take your family for granted. I say that on the basis of having lost my mum while being here. I always said to myself, 'I'll see her soon.' Then that time passes. You never get that chance back again, and then they are gone. My mum passed away, never to see me in this workplace. But I always promise to commit more time to my dad, which I hope I am living up to, mate.
           </p>
           <p>
            Notwithstanding mum passing away, I have now been blessed with two beautiful grandchildren, Xavia and Marley. Yes, I know what you are all thinking—I struggle myself—'He's too young to have grandchildren.' But you cannot stop

            and, despite being so young, I am so happy they are here, albeit too far from Brisbane to enjoy on a regular basis. It is terrific to have Troy, Stacey and Sally, my adorable children, and Daniela, my daughter-in-law, here today. Despite only having Sally at home now, she makes every effort when I return from Canberra most weeks to spoil me with a beautiful meal.
           </p>
           <p>
            To my amazing wife of 35 years: Lorraine, you have stuck with me along this journey and everything I do, and now I am about to commit to my next stage in life to continue a political career in Queensland. Thank you for your love and your support.
           </p>
           <p>
            Well, where to from here? Recently, a couple of weeks ago, Sally and I went up to our good friends Terri and
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bindi_Irwin" rel="nofollow">

             Australia Zoo
            </a>
            to discuss some work up there. That will at some stage come to fruition. I am not going to go into too much detail about what that will mean. Certainly one of my opportunities as a senator was to open the Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital up there. When we were in government we donated some money towards it. That is where the relationship blossomed.
           </p>
           <p>
            I have had an amazing opportunity to go up north in the cape. I know some of the senators in Queensland have been up there and been on the property on the

            and jumped a crocodile with them, a 10½-footer. They record the findings of that particular reptile and then let it go. That particular work is important and must continue. Those reptiles have been around a lot longer than us. I must invite all of you to at some stage drop in and see this amazing attraction. I promise I won't feed you to the crocodiles—at least, I promise some of you I won't. But I certainly promise you this: I will definitely not be throwing roo poo at you.
           </p>
           <p>
            The other opportunity is that you may wish to become one of my clients as your own parliamentary personal trainer. Just recently I have been training a new client, the member for Wright in Queensland, Scotty Buchholz. It is great to see you in the chamber, mate. So I could give you some instruction in the gym. If you are looking for a body like mine, you know my number and you know where you can find me.

             I am the lucky last of the retiring senators to speak—although, come to think of it, lucky is probably not a word that you would necessarily associate with my political career, especially since I was given a dead fish by Senator Kroger. That has certain connotations, I think, in certain areas. Those of you who were here last night will recall Senator Ursula Stephens singing in her valedictory speech. I have been strongly encouraged to do the same here tonight, but I will not. Later on perhaps I will give a rendition of

             with Senator Stephens. Senator Furner got all of the good lines, because he spoke before me.

            <p>
             I propose to start this evening by referring to something that you usually mention at the end of a speech. Of all the things that I have to say this evening, this is going to be the most important. On this my last week in public life I want to thank my wife of 30 years, Nimfa, and my daughters, Mary, Tess and Emily, for the unqualified love and support that they have given me—throughout my working life, certainly, but most importantly during my time here as a Labor senator for
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
              South Australia
             </a>
             . It has been said before by others—and I shall say it again tonight—that we could not do our work in this place without the unflinching support of our partners and our families, and it is certainly the case for me. My time in this place would have been quite impossible, indeed quite intolerable at times, without the knowledge that my family—including my new son-in-law, James; he and my daughter Mary are watching this tonight over the internet in Moscow—have stood alongside me at all times but particularly when the wheel of political fortune rolled wildly downwards, as it has done over the last two years.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have had the immense privilege of serving the people of South Australia as a senator, as a deputy whip and as a parliamentary secretary. I was a Labor minister in both the Gillard and Rudd governments with the portfolio of Sports, Tourism and Science. In recent months, I have served the Senate as the Opposition Spokesman on Veterans' Affairs. I am sure my colleagues will allow me—with much humility of course—to point out some of the achievements that I am quietly proud of.
            </p>
            <p>
             As Minister for Sports, I facilitated one of the largest tranches ever of funding for grassroots sports infrastructure to encourage the participation of people of all ages and ability in healthy sporting activity—I intend to do a little bit of it myself over the months ahead. In tourism, we saw a record increase in the number of tourists visiting Australia from key markets like China. As science minister, I assisted South Australia's new health and biomedical precinct with a $100-million boost for the Uni SA's cancer biology centre to research blood cancers and for the University of Adelaide's integrated clinical school for medical and nursing students.
            </p>
            <p>
             As Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water, I was able to improve the capacity of the

             </a>
             by increasing the number of front-line forecasters and launched the next gen weather forecasting system. This has enabled the bureau, a much loved Australian institution, to provide better forecasting for ever-accelerating severe weather events' also drove the roll out of the National Television and Computer Recycling Scheme. In what was a fractious parliament, I brought together the opposition and the Greens to support a world-class scheme that ensures that from July at least 90 per cent of all e-waste materials, most of which are unpleasantly toxic, will be recovered from landfill and made available for use in new products.

             , who is here tonight, in securing the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. For the first time in our history, water became a national rather than a state issue. I need to be clear about this: it would not have been achieved without a second Labor of term in office, but I am certain that the plan will stand the test of time.
            </p>
            <p>
             If you believe some of the media, you would think that politics is concerned with left and right. Instead, it is about right or wrong. In my six years in this place, I have worked hard with colleagues on my side of the chamber but also with colleagues opposite and on the crossbenchers to achieve progress in the portfolio areas which my leaders have assigned me. Unfortunately politics is seen as a blood sport in the media in Australia but what Australians do not see often enough is the genuine cooperation and the spirit of bipartisanship that often underlies a lot of we do to advance Australia. I take this opportunity to thank all Senate colleagues for the good work that we have done together in good heart.
            </p>
            <p>
             Perhaps the portfolio area that has meant most to me and the one that has affected me most deeply is veteran's affairs. In this, my last hurrah, I intend to resist the temptation to lecture and hector but I would like you to forgive me this: the government's attempts to remove modest entitlements from the children of dead and wounded veterans was mindless and utterly disgraceful. I was proud to have led the parliamentary charge which defeated that attempt. I must use a few of my last words in this place to implore the coalition senators not to allow their government to downgrade the indexation of pensions of war veterans and war widows, a downgrading that will over time leave them much worse off. Please do not do it.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is a place of rough-and-tumble, of vigorous debate and of hotly contested approaches as to how taxpayers' money should be spent. We all accept that there ought to be one area of policy that is of a higher order—that is, a matter of unassailable public bipartisanship—and that is veterans' affairs. Putting oneself into harm's way in the service of our country is the highest form of public office bar none. We owe these people and their families a monumental debt and the gravest obligation is to look after them and their families. When they are deployed in the name of our country, ADF members and their families do not stop to count the cost nor must we count the cost when they return to us, not now, not ever.

There is a predisposition on the part of some commentators in this country to denigrate anybody who comes to this place from a union background. Let me say this: I have been, I am and I always will be a staunch member of the Australian trade union movement. I do not care what anybody says; I am proud of having served ordinary Australian working men and women as an officer of the SDA and I am proud of my commitment to social justice, fairness and dignity in working life. I am proud to have been part of a Labor government that undid the deeply un-Australian, unmandated

             My time as a senator has been marked by some very difficult challenges as well some terrific highs. But it would be hypocritical of me not to address those challenges here. It is well known that I was described as one of the 'faceless men' who argued for the replacement of

             .
            </p>
            <p>
             This is vastly entertaining, as I consider that I have been in the public eye all of my working life. For good or ill, I am a recognisable figure and have been so for decades. To suddenly wake up one morning and find myself without a face was extremely Kafkaesque. I have also been called 'the Don' and 'the Godfather', and one genius in the press gallery even dubbed me 'the Pope'. In this he was clearly mistaken—as he is in so many other things. For the record, I am married with three daughters, and infallibility belongs to the women in our household.
            </p>
            <p>
             Make no mistake: removing a Labor Prime Minister mid-term was a traumatic political event, but my view at the time was that it had to be done for the good of the country. My view has not changed in retrospect. During this very difficult time I rang an old friend for some counsel. It was being said that the removal of the Prime Minister was the worst political assassination since
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar" rel="nofollow">

             fell on the Senate steps. My erudite and witty friend said, 'Comrade, tell them this: not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved Rome more.' I think that probably says it all.

             I was deeply saddened at the way Julia Gillard was treated as Prime Minister of this country. Frankly, her critics diminished themselves rather than her. Tonight I wish to acknowledge the extraordinary skill and the courage with which the Prime Minister dealt with that hung parliament. Her legislative achievements will be seen more appreciatively through the prism of history. If there is any doubt that she was not worthy of the high honour of being Prime Minister of Australia, I invite people to revisit her graceful concession speech and her own brave and insightful valedictory speech. As far as the leadership of our nation is concerned, it will be easier for the next woman and the one after that. As a proud father of three daughters, I want them to know that they can be anything they want to be. Julia Gillard showed them the way, and I will be forever grateful to her for that.

             </a>
             , who is here tonight, for the opportunity that he gave me to serve on his front bench after the election. In a very short space of time, Bill and his very talented frontbench team have put the Labor Party well and truly back in the race. I wish Bill and Chloe all the best as they seek to rebuild the fairness and egalitarianism that should underpin our country and the conduct of our national affairs.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Labor challenge has been made much harder by our disastrous Senate result at the last election. I do not think there is any other way to describe it. The loss of eight Labor senators committed to fairness and dignity for all Australians is devastating. Future Senate contests will require us to mount a proper campaign if we are to regain a second Senate seat in South Australia.
            </p>
            <p>
             At election time particularly, those of us involved in campaigning often come across people whose knowledge of the way we conduct our national affairs is less than fulsome. There are some people out in the electorate even now who are not sure what senators do. When I was elected, a mate of mine with only a marginal knowledge of classical history told me that Rome had senators too and that is why it declined. I suspect in the next term of this parliament we are about to find out whether or not that is true. The challenge, I fear, in the new Senate will be to avoid turning this great institution into a reality

             It has been a tremendous privilege to serve South Australia and the labour movement in the nation's parliament, a privilege given to so few. After my Senate defeat, my youngest daughter, Emily, said that I had lost a sparkle in my eye. I intend to get that back in the months ahead. I wish all Senate colleagues the very best, whether they are staying, coming or, like me, going. I welcome the new senators, some of whom are here tonight, and I urge all of them, regardless of party or other allegiances, to think deeply, argue courteously and remember the words of the philosopher

             <p>
              Tonight, we farewell the last batch of our departing senators. All three of them have done themselves, their party, their states and this Senate proud.
             </p>
             <p>
              I first turn to Senator Furner. His reference to Meatloaf's
              <i>
               Bat out of Hell
              </i>
              as being a relevant number made me wonder what the analogy was—whether getting out of Labor caucus or the Senate is like getting out of hell, or whether he was describing himself as a bat, because they know how to fly blind, and that is a very worthwhile quality to have, especially in the game of politics. In relation to his other discussion, about crocodile wrestling, I will leave that to him. But, once again, the chances are that it is another very valuable attribute to have in the pursuit of political life. Senator Furner's speech highlighted his rich and extensive involvement in our Senate and its committees. He told us what he was seeking to do after this place, and I simply say that we wish him very well—but chances are that in that one respect, and I think he knows what I am referring to, not too well!
             </p>
             <p>
              Nevertheless you have been a very collegiate colleague and you leave this place with the respect of senators from all sides. I wish you well on behalf of my colleagues.
             </p>
             <p>
              I now turn to Senator Farrell. Your speech told us straight off how very important family is to you. In all of your policy settings and statements, family was always very important to you. From a personal perspective, I salute that.
             </p>
             <p>
              Senator Farrell told us that fortune did not smile on him, and I must say it was one of the unluckiest hands to have been dealt in all the circumstances—having been chosen by your party to lead the ticket, then graciously accepting the No. 2 position, only to see yourself not being re-elected. I make the observation that this happened in the state of
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
               South Australia
              </a>
              , It also happened in the next-door state, but it is interesting how the media talked about
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
               Western Australia
              </a>
              as opposed to South Australia. I leave it up to the media to explain why all the focus was on one of the states as opposed to the other.
             </p>
             <p>
              I simply say to you, Senator Farrell, that your contribution has been a very worthwhile one. You can look back on six years with a great degree of satisfaction with what you have achieved. I confess that when you became a minister I was one of those who believed that you were one of these people who was seen but never heard, but we always found out afterwards what you had been up to. I thought it would be a very smart tactic if we started serving you up with questions. It did not take us long to learn that when you were on your feet you knew how to answer questions, and we soon eased off on that tactic. I confess, we had to raise the white flag on that

              simply say that the Labor Party and the Senate will be poorer for your leaving us, and, from what I heard, for your departure or retirement from public life all of us on this side wish you well.

             <p>
              Turning now to my good friend and colleague, Senator
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Kroger" rel="nofollow">
               Helen Kroger
              </a>
              , the chief opposition whip and chief government whip. I think I have known Helen for nearly all of my adult life; we go back quite some way. It is somewhat ironic that the offspring of somebody who came to Australia courtesy of stealing not one but two loaves of bread became responsible for handing out the scones and the morning teas at all the whip's functions. There was a real turn of the wheel there. On behalf of all your colleagues, Senator Kroger, thank you very much for the important role that you have played, not only in the technical side of the whip's job, but also in the very vital role of keeping the team together, keeping the camaraderie together and making sure that everybody had the appropriate pastoral care in all the difficult circumstances and vicissitudes of political life. You did that exceptionally well, and all your colleagues are greatly indebted to you for that.
             </p>
             <p>
              Senator Kroger's role, of course, was not only as whip; she was also a great contributor to foreign affairs policies to the foreign affairs committee in this place. Your involvement on matters in support of the state of Israel and the Jewish people, I am sure, will be remembered by many people. The simple fact is that the state of Israel is the only genuine democracy in the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
               Middle East
              </a>
              and it has human rights second to none in that area, and yet it is continually put under pressure. The state of Israel needs defenders like you, and you clearly were one of its very keen and strong defenders. But you were not only there to defend countries, you were there also looking after individuals. You mentioned in your valedictory speech, and I had it in my prepared notes, your advocacy for
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Joyce" rel="nofollow">
               Matthew Joyce
              </a>
              and Marcus Lee during their incarceration. That, I think, shows the depth and breadth of your political involvement in this place. You could deal with the big ticket items—the macro policies of foreign affairs country to country—but you also had the capacity of dealing with the needs of the individual and taking a keen interest in an individual. I think that shows the breadth of your parliamentary involvement.
             </p>
             <p>
              I must say I was also very heartened by your public commentary on the way that the Liberal Party allocates its preferences, especially in relation to the Greens. If you were not the vanguard, you were definitely part of the vanguard that assisted in getting that change, which clearly ensured the coalition victory in Victoria at the last state election. So I congratulate you for the huge impact you had in that regard. Your speech referring to your sons Simon and Jack told us that the real love of your life is your family and that you have been able to maintain that strong connection with your two children also shows us that you have a very good and balanced life. You did not become all-consumed by politics, but you also had the right balance, knowing how important family life and children are to you. That is one of the qualities that made you such a good whip in understanding those issues.
             </p>
             <p>
              Mr Acting Deputy President, it is not easy being a whip, because too often you are accused of saying 'No' to your own colleagues and 'Yes' to your opponents in handing out pairs. You did it with distinction; you did it well; and, whilst your departure from this place is not of your choosing or the choosing of any on this side, you do leave with the very best wishes from all of your colleagues on this side. We wish you every success in whatever life may hold for you in the future, but, above all, we wish you good health and happiness in the future.

              <p>
               I rise to speak on this last set of valedictories in this Senate to farewell Senators Kroger, Furner and Farrell, who all came to this place on 1 July 2008 following their election in 2007. I will make some brief remarks first in relation to Senator Kroger, who has had a long association with the Liberal Party; I have a note here that it commenced with the Springvale Young Liberals in 1974. She has held many positions in the party in Victoria, and she spoke of her continued advocacy of what she saw as the interests of the Victorian party, particularly in relation to the issue of preferences that she discussed. As a Senator, Senator Kroger’s interests included education, the rights of children, mental health and the participation of women in political and national life. She was also active with Parliamentarians Against Child Abuse and Neglect, and I note she made a contribution on this topic this week in the adjournment debate, which demonstrates her continued advocacy.
              </p>
              <p>
               In her first speech, Senator Kroger said:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               None of my friends here today would ever accuse me of being part of the sisterhood, but I draw inspiration from two of my predecessors, former senators Dame Margaret Guilfoyle and Dr Kay Patterson.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               And I could not let the opportunity pass me by without saying how excited I am as a woman to begin my career in parliament at the very time that
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Palin" rel="nofollow">

               is about to shatter the penultimate glass ceiling of politics in the United States.
              </p>
              <p>
               I trust senator Kroger does not mind that her powers of prediction were wrong. I would say this: even if Senator Kroger does not see herself as ‘part of the sisterhood’, I believe it is always a shame when a strong woman from any party leaves this chamber. We do need them. I did note one of the comments Senator Kroger made tonight that she had been bullied and threatened, but that only strengthened her resolve; and that is a response that I respect. As Senator Abetz said, Senator Kroger has served as the party's whip in this place, and that is not an easy job. And yet one has to deal with all sorts of issues that others in this place do not. I recognise her contribution to her party in that role, and I wish her and her family very well for the future.
              </p>
              <p>
               Senator Furner has obviously served too short a time in this place. I do not think he spoke of it tonight, but he grew up in a housing commission house in Brisbane's northside suburb of Chermside. He worked as a trades assistant, a floor-covering layer, truck driver and 18 he became the youngest delegate of the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Workers'_Union" rel="nofollow">
                Transport Workers' Union
               </a>
               in Queensland. He went on to serve as an organiser with that union, and subsequently with the Queensland Police Union and the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Union" rel="nofollow">
                National Union
               </a>
               of Workers, including as Queensland Branch Secretary.
              </p>
              <p>
               In the Senate, Senator Furner has served on a number of committees, including the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee" rel="nofollow">
                Joint Committee
               </a>
               s on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_Enforcement" rel="nofollow">
                Law Enforcement
               </a>
               . He has made contributions to debate in many areas, particularly concerning the rights of workers and law enforcement agencies. He spoke tonight, movingly, I think, of the imperative to close the gap. I think one of the privileges we have in this place as a senator is that we have the opportunity to engage with regions and communities we would not otherwise have engaged with. Senator Furner did so but, more importantly, what he took from that was the imperative of that great national challenge and great national responsibility to close the gap.
              </p>
              <p>
               It is, as I said, a great shame that Senator Furner's time in this place has come to a premature end. We will miss his no-nonsense approach to debate, which was on show again tonight—although I am not sure that your career as a physical trainer is necessarily one that will take off, Senator Furner; but I could be wrong! Whilst he is leaving the Senate, we do all hope that Senator Furner is going from this parliament to another parliament—in the state of Queensland. We on this side of the chamber know how important it is for us to rebuild Labor in Queensland. We wish you all the very best in that endeavour, Senator Furner; not just for Queensland Labor but also for the Labor Party, and for the very many people who expect and hope that we will stand up for them. So I hope that 'Furner for

               ' catches on! If you need help from any of us up here in campaigning, I am sure that all of us would be very happy to add our efforts to your campaign effort.
              </p>

               Finally, I turn now to my

                Don Farrell
               </a>
               . It is with deep disappointment that we farewell Senator Farrell tonight after only one term. Don Farrell has been a leader within our labour movement. He has devoted his life to the service of the labour movement and to the Labor Party. Prior to his election, as he said, he served the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees’ Association for some 32 years, beginning as an industrial officer in the mid-70s. and concluding as

                Australian Labor Party

               in many capacities, including as

                State President
               </a>
               , but perhaps the greatest part of his role as leader has been the support and mentorship he has given to so many. Many of the next generation of Labor leaders and future Labor ministers—here and in South Australia—have benefited from his support and his guidance. He is a guiding figure for so many. Tonight in the chamber, we saw people such as

               —people who will be ministers in a Labor government in the future—and all of them, I am sure, would refer to Don as one of the guiding figures in their political careers. In many ways, there is no greater mark of a leader than those you bring to the table, in the way that Senator Farrell has.
              </p>
              <p>
               Since entering the Senate on 1 July 2008, Senator Farrell has served in many positions, from Deputy Government Whip to Parliamentary Secretary for Sustainability and Urban Water—as he has said, a portfolio with particular significance to South Australia. In 2013, he entered the ministry as Minister for Science and Research and Minister Assisting for Tourism, and later as Minister for Sport. Since the 2013 election, he has served as shadow minister for Veterans’ Affairs and the Centenary of
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANZAC" rel="nofollow">
                ANZAC
               </a>
               , and tonight his championing of veterans was evident.
              </p>
              <p>
               The departure of Senator Farrell is a loss to Labor, and to the Senate. Many would be aware of the reasons for Senator Farrell’s early departure; none more than me. I acknowledge and thank Don Farrell for his decision to volunteer for the second position on Labor’s Senate ticket in South Australia at the 2013 election. In that decision and in many others, Senator Farrell put the interests of the Labor Party first. In ordinary circumstances, we would have expected that we would both return to the Senate as colleagues. However, this was not to be the case. It is a profound regret that South Australia only returned one senator at this election and that, as a consequence, Don was not re-elected. The fact that Senator Farrell was not re-elected stands as a compelling example of the need for Labor to improve its vote in Senate elections, and the responsibility of all of us—particularly those of us in this place—to work to improve our vote; not just to return senators of the calibre of Senator Farrell, Senator Pratt and so many others to this place but, most importantly, to ensure a strong presence for the Australian Labor Party in this chamber—to give voice to the rights of Australians who most need the advocacy of the Labor Party in this place.
              </p>
              <p>
               Don's love of his family is deep and abiding, and was evident tonight. I wish Don and his wife Nimfa, and his family, all the very best for the future. The only exception is that I do not wish his team well for the showdown next weekend!

               <p>
                I rise as well to provide farewells to those leaving the Senate this evening. First of all, I would like to make some remarks on the leaving of one of our truly favourite senators, Senator
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Kroger" rel="nofollow">
                 Helen Kroger
                </a>
                . Senator Kroger, as a senator representing Victoria from 1 July 2008—it seems so long ago—and, more recently, as Chief Government Whip in the Senate, you have proved yourself an accomplished professional. Your negotiation and skills as a strategist I think are unsurpassed. Your knowledge of the Senate and its procedures—things which, even to those of us who have been around a while longer, and certainly to me, seem to remain completely obscure—is enviable.
               </p>
               <p>
                But it is your gentle and unassuming manner that is most remarkable in an environment not always known for graciousness or that good old-fashioned notion of magnanimity. Even under intense pressure, Senator Kroger has always been a model of civility. Perhaps this is her secret weapon—that she is so disarmingly kind and refined, belying her steely resolve and determination when it comes to issues that she believes in dearly. It is no surprise, then, that she came to win Victoria's Liberal Party presidency and, in doing so, brought a healing and a balm to what many thought was a wounded party.
               </p>
               <p>
                Perhaps her steely resolve was forged in the modest and resilient family background in which she grew up. She stated in her maiden speech in this place in September 2008:
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                … while my father was a simple labourer, he knew that education was life’s great equaliser …
               </p>
               <p>
                continuing that her parents had sacrificed their present to provide her and her siblings with a future. In this respect, Senator Kroger has never lost her ability to relate to the aspirations of many Australians who strive to achieve a better life for their children. And I know that the principles and values instilled in her by her parents continue to be a guiding light in her life. Senator Kroger was not born into privilege or wealth, but she was gifted with something far more important: strength of character; a determination to succeed and make a difference—the epitome of the 'liberal' essence.
               </p>
               <p>
                The importance of education has been a consistent theme in Senator Kroger's life. In that maiden speech, some six years ago, Senator Kroger highlighted that, in the educational context, there is no more important form of choice than the power of parents to be able to choose where their children will be educated. She has been passionate about the education system rising above mediocrity, arguing for competition amongst public schools, and that, in particular, it was important to shatter public-sector monopolies. She very much believes that there is no valid reason why low- and middle-income families should not be able to enjoy the same power of parental choice that the wealthy take for granted.
               </p>
               <p>
                She also understands the importance of giving back to society, having a great appreciation of volunteerism and the central role it plays in Australia and on the international stage. I understand that she was the fundraising director for
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_College" rel="nofollow">
                 Wesley College
                </a>
                in Melbourne for six years prior to entering the political sphere. Selflessness has been an important feature of her career and personal life.
               </p>
               <p>
                Small business has been another passion of Senator Kroger; she has called it the primary engine of Australia's economic prosperity. Like many on our side, she has been prepared to give small business its rightful place in the economy and recognise that it is at the centre of good economic management. In addition, she has had a distinguished career in human resource management—again, most apt for a woman of her capabilities in dealing with people and understanding what motivates them.
               </p>
               <p>
                Since being elected as a senator in this place, Senator Kroger's name has become synonymous with hard work and dedication. She is the chair of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee and is Acting Deputy Chair of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee. She is also a voting member of the Senate Standing Committees on Finance and Public Administration and the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee" rel="nofollow">
                 Joint Committee
                </a>
                of Public Accounts and Audit, and the coalition representative on the Parliamentary Education Office advisory committee. In addition, she is a member of the coalition backbench policy committees on education, industry and foreign affairs, defence and trade, and serves as a Temporary Chair of Committees in the Senate.
               </p>
               <p>
                She has also been a wonderful ambassador on parliamentary delegations overseas. I can recall that, in 2008, not long after you got here, Senator Kroger, you relaunched Parliamentarians Against Child Abuse and Neglect, which aims to increase the awareness of, and take action to eliminate, the serious issue of child abuse and neglect. This is something that I know you have been passionate about and you have remained so since you started in the Senate.
               </p>
               <p>
                Senator Kroger has avoided characterisation as a feminist or as belonging to the sisterhood. But what better role model is there for women who are thinking about entering politics to make a real difference? She has never once referred to being held back because she is a woman; she has just got on with the job and has taken on the best of us males—and, in many cases, I think she has won.
               </p>
               <p>
                Senator Kroger, you will leave a lasting legacy—you will not be forgotten. I thank you on my own behalf, and on behalf of my staff and the National Party, for the impeccably courteous and helpful manner with which you have always dealt with us. It has meant a lot to us.
               </p>
               <p>
                I have no doubt that the next chapter of your life will be just as rewarding because you will continue to seek out the opportunities that will allow you to make a contribution. Good luck in your further endeavours.
               </p>

                 I will make just a couple of brief comments about Senator Kroger. It will be nice not to turn around all the time when someone sings out, 'Helen, Helen'! But thank you very much for the contribution that you have made. As
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_Wong" rel="nofollow">
                  Penny Wong

                 said, it is always a shame when we lose women from this chamber. I wish you every success.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I now turn my attention to Senator Furner. He was another chamber buddy of mine. But I have to say: since I was moved away from you, at least I have been quite calm when I have had a question to ask, because on several occasions during our journey together you would take away the question, and at times I said to you, 'Well, that's all right—I'll just make it up as I go!' But it has been a great privilege to work alongside Mark. He has made an outstanding contribution. He is a man who respects other people's views. He is also a strong family man. He speaks up for what he believes in. He has outlined tonight, and we have heard on many occasions, that he has given distinguished service within the union movement.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Senator Wong made comments in relation to your role, Mark, in the Senate as an instructor. I am probably not the best example of someone who you helped with weights and for whom you were a trainer, so I am not sure you will be able to earn much money in your new life going into that field!
                </p>
                <p>
                 But I think it is always important that we note the contribution of those who are leaving the chamber. You leave with my friendship. I have an open door for you to come and visit. I know you are a strong Queenslander, but the best state in this country is Tasmania, and the door is always open for you to come and experience our hospitality.
                </p>
                <p>
                 There are those on this side of the chamber who—as I think Mark mentioned before—like to go out to dinner and to socialise, but it is always hard to get people in this place to try a new restaurant. I actually did convince people to go along to Timmy's in Manuka after telling them it was the best Asian food in town, so I hope I have not upset too many people here tonight! But we certainly are going to miss you. Our Thursday nights will not be the same. I want to wish you all the very best and say to the Queenslanders listening in tonight that you will continue to make outstanding contributions—and I hope your next chapter will be in the state parliament.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Now I want to say just a couple of things in relation to
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Farrell" rel="nofollow">
                  Don Farrell
                 </a>
                 because I know other people want to make a contribution. It is not always easy being in this place and having views that are not held by the majority of your own party, but you have been someone to share those with and someone to act as a guide and a support and that should not be left unsaid. Senator Farrell, I think it is a great shame that you were not re-elected to the Senate from
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                  South Australia
                 </a>
                 . I think not only is it the Labor Party's and South Australia's loss but in general our country and our community will be poorer for you leaving.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I want to mention, as I did in relation to Senator Furner, your family values and your commitment to those who are less fortunate. You outlined again in your speech that which is very close to my heart, veterans affairs. You stood up for veterans against the government, and we appreciate what you have done for them. I know veterans and war widows have always respected your contribution.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Moving forward, our social activities here in this place will not be the same either because Senator Farrell was always the first to invite you around for a drink or to get together and have something to eat. I remember when he supported me to become deputy whip in this place. He said, 'Helen, it's a great office, but you have to have the blinds open so that you can see outside and see that this is really just a small part of what is happening in the greater community that we are here to represent.'
                </p>
                <p>
                 Senator Farrell, going forward I think it is a shame that you are going into retirement, as I have said. I appreciate your friendship and your guidance. I do know that you have been referred to as 'the don', so I want to say thank you very much. Thank you from your Labor colleagues. It has always been a privilege to work with you, and I personally thank you for your support and leadership.

                  I have to say that since I have been in this place I have actually only sat next to two senators—and two fabulous senators they are, indeed—Senator Boyce and Senator Eggleston. I am not sure whether it is coincidence or just terribly bad luck on both their parts but they are both leaving. Hopefully people will continue to sit next to me! I wish both of you all the best. Both Senator Boyce and Senator Eggleston have been wonderful role models and guides. They have given me huge support as we have sat in this chamber over the last two years.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I also wish all the best to Senator Boswell. What an amazing person he is. Even though I have been in this place for only a very short time with such a great man, it has certainly been a huge privilege to have been able to serve some time with him.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Senator Farrell is a great

                  </a>
                  n. Senator Farrell and I have certainly not necessarily agreed on a huge number of topics, but I have to say that South Australia will be all the worse off for not having Senator Farrell here fighting for the interests of
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
                   South Australian
                  </a>
                  s and unfortunately also not even in the South Australian parliament. To Senators Furner, Bishop, Pratt, Stephens and Thorp, I wish you all the best in whatever you choose to do in the future.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Now I come to my friend Senator
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Kroger" rel="nofollow">
                   Helen Kroger
                  </a>
                  . The minute I was preselected I think she was the first person on the phone to me. I do not think the ink was dry on the ballot papers before Senator Kroger rang to congratulate me on being successful in my preselection and to immediately offer me assistance. Right the way through the time I have been here she has offered amazing support, guidance, friendship and care. There is nobody I can say has offered and given more of herself to me since I have been here than Senator Kroger. I think initially I thought, 'My gosh, I must be so extraordinarily special to be receiving this treatment,' but it did not take me terribly long after I got here to realise that that is the way she treats everybody. For that reason, I think it is a great tragedy that we are not going to continue our careers together in this place. But I am sure we will continue our friendship outside of this place forever.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I will finish quickly because I know others want to make contributions. On behalf of Senator Payne, who would have made a contribution tonight except I am afraid she is still in the anteroom crying, I want to say what a brilliant whip you have been, what an inspirational woman you are, what a tremendous friend you are and what an amazingly caring colleague you are. This place is going to be so much the worse for you going.

                   I too rise tonight to wish all the senators leaving good luck and good fortune in whatever lies ahead. But I did tonight particularly want to mention Senator Kroger, Senator Farrell and Senator Furner and speak to their leaving this place.

                   Senator Kroger, it has been a pleasure to work with you. We have worked together so well in PACAN as co-convenors. It is a great parliamentary friendship group to be involved in and over the years I think we have developed a really good working relationship in regards to it. You will be missed. Yes, I saw you to tip your hands there, motioning about having a little drink! We certainly will. I was trying to keep it a bit nice because you said there were some things I was not allowed to say tonight!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Also working with you in your whip position as a fairly new deputy whip has been great. You have been very easy to work with and very cooperative, so thank you for that. As I said, I will not say too much about what happened on the bus. What happens on the bus stays on the bus between those who were on the bus! A few around the chamber who were on the bus will know what that means. But I will look forward to seeing you in Melbourne, maybe with some red legs on at some stage. Thank you for being such a good person to work with.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I also wanted to mention Senator Farrell. He mentioned being a 'faceless man' in his speech. I was going to talk about that and say he is the most well-photographed faceless man I have ever seen! He is a great man. I have got to know Don really well since we have been here. He loves his family inordinately, and I know that one of his best prizes is that he is going to be a grandad soon. He is absolutely chafing at the bit for that to happen. I do hate to tell him it is not going to happen as quick as he wants, but it will happen around Christmas time. I am excited for him because of that.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I will not go into people's work histories—they have already been spoken about tonight—but I do know that Don has always been passionate about improving the lives of workers and he has always worked hard for the people of

                   , being a Tasmanian, but he assures me that they are the best team in South Australia and, as no-one has ever really tried to convince me otherwise, I will take his word on that. Both Senator Farrell and Senator Wong alluded to what happened in the last election that resulted in Senator Farrell having to leave this place. As someone who is fairly close to Senator Farrell, that was the time to see the character of a person come through. He did not grizzle and he did not complain. He copped it on the chin. He could have gone berserk in the media as other people do when they do not get what they want, but he did not do that. My dad always says it is not what happens to you but how you handle it that truly shows what your character is like, and in this case, Don, you have shown your character to be great, mate. I would like to thank him also for all the support and help he has given me over the six years I have been here. Senator Kroger, Senator Farrell, Senator Furner and I all came in together, and I would like to wish Don and Nimfa and their family all the best.
                  </p>

                   The last person I want to mention is Senator Furner. They say if you want a friend in politics you should get a dog. I should have called Senator

                   'Fido'. He has been my best mate in this place, hands down. We entered parliament together, we had offices next to each other in the beginning—I think they moved us to separate us, to tell you the truth—we were on committees together, we spent a lot of time together, we know each other's families. We could see tonight from his own speech what a wonderful sense of humour he has and what a warm person he is, and I will miss him enormously. There are some things we will always remember about him. We will always remember Drago and we will always remember, as Senator Polley alluded to, him grabbing questions if you sat anywhere near him. One day he grabbed my question and crumpled it up, and he did not give it back to me until right before I stood up so I had to quickly flatten it out so I could read it. He is a great community person. I say to him, thank you for your support and your friendship, helping me to learn the ropes. It certainly helped to have someone I could get on with so easily, too. He is a great family man to Lorraine and the kids, and especially to Xavia and Marley, his two beautiful grandchildren. I hope they get to see Grandad a bit more—I know he has always missed you when he has been down here. I hope the family does well, and I hope the Senate's loss will be a Queensland Labor government's gain. Good luck to everyone.

I still owe her a yiros at Yianni's Yiros on Hindley Street, so I hope she can take me up on that when she is next in Adelaide. She has done a great job as Chief Government Whip and she has made a significant contribution to this place. I wish her all the very best.

                    , I am genuinely disappointed that he will not be back in this place. That reflects, as it does in respect of Senator Kroger, the voting system we have. There is a need for some genuine reform in our voting system—the will of the people was not directly reflected at the last election. It was, in a sense, subverted by a bizarre preference system that I think needs some reform—a reform that should not go against minor parties and Independents having a fair go. Back in 2001 Senator Farrell was the man, along with

It was a real loss to the people of South Australia that he did not get an opportunity to be the member for Napier, for a number of bizarre reasons. He is a Labor stalwart and he deserved to be the member for Napier, and he could have made a contribution to public life through the state parliament. I respect his contribution enormously.

                     I wish to make a couple remarks about my good friend and colleague on this side of the chamber, Senator
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Kroger" rel="nofollow">
                      Helen Kroger
                     </a>
                     . Senator Kroger has always been a person of class in the way she conducts herself and in the undertaking of her duties as a senator and indeed in her day-to-day life. We saw that in spades with her valedictory statement this evening—the class shone through, her achievements in this place were demonstrated and her commitment to principles and values were clearly on show.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Helen's leaving will be an enormous loss to this place and to the Liberal parliamentary team but by no means will she be lost to Australia. I am confident that Helen, great friend that she is, will continue to champion the causes and the issues that are dear to her heart, will continue to speak out when it is warranted and will continue to make a big and lasting difference. I have been proud and pleased to call Helen a friend, to support her in this place and to give her support in performing her role of chief whip both in opposition and in government, and I have been delighted to see the way in which she has conducted those tasks whilst not losing sight of the fact that she is here not just as a whip to help with the administration of the place but as a senator and an individual to make a contribution to issues, to champion the causes of her constituents and to be able to demonstrate that she can do all of the different duties that come with being a senator, a member of a party, a chief whip as well as, of course, a mother.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Helen was whip during the time that our two children were born and during the time when my youngest had a couple of operations. A whip has a special role when it comes to pastoral care in this place and being able to provide assistance, time out and opportunities to deal with the matters back home. I have nothing but praise for Helen for the way in which she helped me through those times and ensured that our family had the attention and support that was needed back home whilst allowing me to get on with the job here. As many have said, Helen will be dearly, dearly missed. I associate myself with the remarks of others in that regard, and I look forward to maintaining a continuing friendship with Helen that will last many, many years—a lifetime, I am sure—into the future.

                     has been electorally dominant at a state level in SA for such a period of time. He deserves credit and respect for what he has done in backroom roles in that regard. I also know that in this place Don has been somebody to champion the issues and values that are important to him and to those who put him here. A couple of months ago I had the pleasure of welcoming the historic clipper ship

                     back to Adelaide. It had been saved from being demolished and destroyed in a shipyard in Scotland, thanks to the work of Senator Farrell. When he was parliamentary secretary to the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Senator Farrell ensured that the ship could be returned and that that piece of Adelaide's history would come back to Adelaide. That is one of his accomplishments.

His stories have always been thoughtful and considered, and a demonstration as to why he was an appropriate fit to be the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, given the deep sense of commitment he has shown to those issues. I do wish Don as well as his wife, Nimfa, and family all the best for the future, and I am sure I will run into them in the

                      I just want to take a moment to place on record my great admiration for our whip and current colleague, Senator Kroger, as she departs from this place. Again, on the record, I want to associate myself with all of the other things that others have said with far more time at their disposal. Helen has been a great contributor to this place and to Australia so far, but I know she has a lot more to contribute to public life in Australia, and I would certainly and fervently hope and expect to see her talents being used again for the benefit of her state and her country. Competent, compassionate, courageous and intelligent are just some of the words I would use to describe Helen. The vagaries of politics and the preselection process are such in our party that you can never really anticipate what is going to happen or why things happen, but it is such a shame that she is leaving us after too short a time here. I wish her all the very best for the future and, like my colleagues, I am certain that we will see a lot of her in the future in many different roles. I will conclude by wishing all the Labor senators who are leaving us next week all the very best for the future. I repeat my good wishes to Senator Furner. I said I wished him well for the future, but not in his political future, as he takes on a sitting
