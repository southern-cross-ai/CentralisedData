        The Albanese Labor government is placing the safety of Australians and the security of our nation at risk by giving temporary protection visas to more than 860 Palestinians. For almost 20 years, Palestinians in Gaza have supported Hamas and their terrorist regime. Polling of Palestinians in recent years has shown that up to 70 per cent of them are supportive of Hamas, a proscribed terrorist group.
       </p>
       <p>
        And this Labor government wants to bring more than 860 of these people hereâ€”no doubt, to swell the ranks of those on Australian streets calling for the gassing of Jews. We have absolutely no assurance or guarantee that these people aren't heavily radicalised or that they're not members of active terrorist cells. Why is Labor bringing them in here to sow more antisemitism when they could find refuge in Muslim countries where their alien culture is more accepted? Why must they be allowed to come to our country, where we have values, freedom of religion and speech, secular democracy and the rule of law that are incompatible with theirs?

       <p>
        Our housing crisis hasn't ended, by the way. It's worse than ever. Labor's housing policy is completely worthless, and their 30,000 homes will make no dent in the current shortfall of at least 650,000 homes. Yet Labor still insists not only on flooding our borders with hundreds of thousands of people every year but also now on giving temporary protection visas to another 2,000-plus people from the

        conflict zone. This is completely against the national interest, just like this appalling Labor government.
       </p>
       <p>
        I just met with a Jewish couple from Melbourne who stated that they no longer feel safe in Australia. Shame on this government for allowing these obnoxious hate-filled rallies to continue on our streets in this nation. We actually need to call for peace, by all means, but give the people the feeling they're safe on our streets.
