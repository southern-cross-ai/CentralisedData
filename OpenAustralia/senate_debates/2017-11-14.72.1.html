         Mr President

        , I join with other senators in congratulating you on your appointment. My question is to the Minister for Employment, Senator Cash. On 25 October, the minister told the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee that, in a question time briefing with the Prime Minister, she 'advised him'—the Prime Minister—'that what

         Anthony Albanese

        had said was not true'. Given that Mr Albanese said:

        We know that Senator Cash's office was ringing around media organisations yesterday afternoon, telling them that this was going to occur.
       </p>
       <p>
        can the minister confirm that what Mr Albanese said was, in fact, true?

           As the minister well knows, the questions we're asking are the ones that she's refused to answer up until now. The Prime Minister has said that you assured him that you were not responsible for tipping off the media about the raids. At any stage, did you assure the Prime Minister that your office was not responsible for tipping off the media about the raids of

              I note the minister continues to refuse to answer the questions that she refused to answer at estimates. Given the minister was accompanied to the meeting by her senior media adviser, who has now resigned, did the minister's senior media adviser seek to correct the mistruth that she told to the Prime Minister at that briefing?

                    I know she misleads, but now she's not even trying to answer the question. My point of order is direct relevance. Did the minister's senior adviser seek to correct the mistruth told to the Prime Minister by the minister? That's the question. She should answer it.

                         That is the second day in a row Senator Hinch has raised this. It is a legitimate query. It's the second time it has been raised today. I will start to enforce the limits on noise volume more strictly because senators have directly requested me to do so. I ask senators up at this more action-oriented end of the chamber to keep their colleagues at the other end in mind, as we've had two complaints they cannot hear questions or answers.
