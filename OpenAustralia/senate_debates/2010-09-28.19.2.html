        The Defence White Paper 2009 states at para 16.17 that the “Government has decided that military-off-the-shelf and commercial-off-the-shelf solutions to Defence’s capability requirements will be the benchmark against which a rigorous cost-benefit analysis of the military effects and schedule aspects of all proposals will be undertaken. Such an approach is consistent with the Defence Procurement and Sustainment Review.”

         OTS

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet updated its Cabinet Handbook in July 2009. The associated Drafter’s Guide – Preparation of Cabinet Submissions and Memoranda states, “The options must include at least one off-the-shelf option, where such an option exists, and where it is judged not to exist, this must be explained in the first-pass approval submission.”
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Defence is fully implementing these requirements.

        In summary, where an off-the-shelf option does exist, it will be presented for Government consideration and will be the benchmark against which a rigorous cost benefit analysis of the military effects and schedule aspects of all proposals will be undertaken; and when an off-the-shelf option is judged not to exist, this will be explained in the first-pass submission to Government.

        The purchase of capital equipment by rapid acquisition, which by-passes the usual two pass approval process, is used where an unforeseen operational capability is urgently required by the ADF for current operations. The Government may provide additional funding to Defence, in cases of exceptional circumstances, where such a capability is required as a result of major operational or strategic discontinuities or in cases of exceptional and unanticipated operational contingencies. Defence will bring forward any such requests on a case-by-case basis for Government consideration in accordance with the standard approval thresholds for major capital equipment. For instance,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         National Security Committee
        </a>
        or Prime Ministerial agreement is required for acquisitions over $100 million. The Government decides on a case-by-case basis whether supplementation will be provided or Defence will absorb the cost of rapid acquisition proposals. Generally speaking the Defence Capability Plan is the source of funding for meeting Defence’s major capital equipment needs, both current and future, particularly where there is an ongoing utility past the immediate requirement associated with the equipment being procured.
