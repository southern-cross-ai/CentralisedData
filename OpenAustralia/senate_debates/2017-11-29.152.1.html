            Australian Bureau of Statistics
           </a>
           in its media release of 15 November 2017, the final cost of the postal survey is yet be determined but it is under $100 million. The appropriation allocated to the ABS through the Advance to the Finance Minister Determination (No. 1 of 2017-18) was for the specific purpose of a conduct of the Australian marriage law postal survey. Any surplus funds will be returned to the budget.

          <p>
           The coalition government has made mental health a priority and it is expected that we will be investing over $4.2 billion in 2017-18. Included within this investment is an additional $47 million for suicide prevention and continuing support services.

              The opposition will support this motion today. The fact is that there has been an increase in demand for mental health services over the past month as a result of the postal survey. In August it was reported that beyondblue registered a 40 per cent increase in call volume following the announcement of the postal survey.

              </a>
              ife has also recorded a more than 20 per cent increase in the number of calls since the postal survey was announced.

              We know the mental health of LGBTQ people is of concern, with lesbian, gay and bisexual Australians twice as likely to have a high to very high level of psychological stress as their heterosexual peers. Australia's leading mental health experts were so concerned about the impact of the postal survey on LGBTQ Australians that they launched their own campaign, Mind The Facts. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten wrote to the Prime Minister,
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Turnbull" rel="nofollow">
               Malcolm Turnbull
              </a>
              , because he too was concerned about the impact this postal survey would have on the LGBTQ community. It is also clear that they never wanted a public debate—
