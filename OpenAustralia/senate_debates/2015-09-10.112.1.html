         I thank the senator for his question and note his very keen interest in this issue. As I have said on several occasions in this chamber, more Australians are touched by the ice epidemic every day. The last phase of the national drugs campaign 'Ice Destroys Lives' ran from 10 May until the end of June this year and consisted of advertising on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">
          TV
         </a>
         , social, online and cinema channels. As well as supporting the work of the National Ice Taskforce, this phase of activity aimed to raise awareness of the harms associated with ice use through advertising targeted to young people aged 18 to 25 years, who are at greater risk of ice use; young people aged 14 to 17 years, who are beginning to be exposed to illicit drugs; and parents of 14- to 25-year-olds. With ongoing community concern about the impact of ice, the second phase of the 'Ice Destroys Lives' campaign will again reinforce the dangers of taking ice and encourage people to visit the campaign website for more information, resources and links to treatment and support services and drug counselling. One very positive flow-on from these ads has been parents taking direct action to talk to their children about drugs. We know that parents are the most influential source of drug information for young people, and it is so important that these conversations happen in the home. Ice is extremely addictive. It is destroying the lives and families across Australia of people I have met. I have travelled across Australia and spoken to many communities experiencing the devastating impacts of ice. The government is committed to a national strategy. We believe that these ads, broadcast into the homes of all Australians, are essential.

          Will the minister advise the Senate of the results of the evaluation of the coalition government's first round of advertising about the scourge of ice?

           The ads are deliberately hard hitting, and the evidence shows that they are working. Independent evaluation of the government's ice advertising has heaped praise on the campaign. Some 3,805 people were surveyed about the ads, including 2,126 young people aged 14 to 25 and 1,679 parents of young people aged 14 to 25. Incredibly, 94 per cent of youth who saw the campaign said they had taken some action as a result, either by talking to peers or to their parents or by changing their thinking about ice. Critically, 51 per cent of at-risk youth who had seen the ads said they would now avoid using iceâ€”an outstanding result. It is particularly pleasing to see that the ads have cut through to these at-risk youth and are changing their attitudes.

             As I have stated previously, the 'Ice Destroys Lives' campaign is also assisting to highlight the work of the National Ice Taskforce. The task force is continuing to work with states and territories and the Australian National Advisory Council on Alcohol and Drugs on the development of a final report and the national ice strategy. The report and strategy will go to
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
              COAG
             </a>
             before the end of the year. The task force has identified six key areas to guide work towards the development of the national ice strategy: focusing law enforcement actions, targeting primary prevention, improving access to early intervention, supporting local communities to respond, improving tools for front-line workers, and improving and consolidating research and data. I again commend my colleagues who have done so much work on this: Senator Smith, Senator McKenzie, Senator O'Sullivan and the many other colleagues who have been working tirelessly to ensure that this government works with others to bring in a national ice action strategy.
