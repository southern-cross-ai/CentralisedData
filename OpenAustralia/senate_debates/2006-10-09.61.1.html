         Mr President
        </a>
        , I would now like to comment on report 78. Report 78 contains a report of the seminar held in March this year to mark the 10th anniversary of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties was established in 1996 as part of a package of reforms to the treaty making process. Since then, the committee has tabled recommendations on over 380 treaty actions in 77 reports. Prior to the establishment of J
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCOT" rel="nofollow">
         SCOT
        </a>
        , during the 1970s treaties were tabled in parliament but often in a manner which prevented meaningful parliamentary scrutiny or input. Treaties were tabled in bulk, approximately every six months and often after they had entered into force.
       </p>
       <p>
        By the 1990s Australia had entered into a period of negotiating a broader range of treaties—some of them quite controversial. There was also a growing awareness that international obligations affected domestic legal regimes and policy responses to a wide range of national issues. In recognition that parliament ought to be able to scrutinise Australia’s international treaty obligations, JSCOT was established in May 1996.
       </p>
       <p>
        Four other key reforms were introduced at the same time that JSCOT was established. These consisted of: (1) the tabling of treaties in parliament for a minimum of 15 sitting days before the government takes binding treaty action; (2) the tabling of National Interest Analyses to explain the reasons for the government’s decision to enter into the treaty and to detail the impact the treaty would have on Australia; (3) the establishment of a treaties council as an adjunct to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Australian_Governments" rel="nofollow">
         Council of Australian Governments
        </a>
        to consider treaties and other international instruments of particular sensitivity to the states and territories; (4) the establishment of a treaties information database for individuals and interested people to easily and freely obtain information on any treaty.
       </p>
       <p>
        A fifth reform involved a change to the Standing Committee on Treaties, or SCOT as it is otherwise known. SCOT was not established as part of the 1996 reforms but its role and functions were formalised as a result. The treaties committee has a dual role in providing for the parliamentary scrutiny of treaties and in increasing the transparency of the treaty scrutiny process. As part of its role in providing a more transparent treaty making process, the committee also functions as a check that adequate consultation has taken place. After 10 years of JSCOT it was fitting that a seminar be conducted to assess the 1996 reforms and to look more broadly at the role of the legislature in the treaty making process, both here and overseas.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 30 and 31 March this year, the committee held a seminar to consider the role and effectiveness of the committee, the treaty making reforms and the role of parliaments in the treaty making process. The seminar commenced with a reception hosted by the Presiding Officers of the Commonwealth parliament and a dinner addressed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the shadow minister for foreign affairs and trade and international security.
       </p>
       <p>
        The following day the seminar heard from a diverse range of people who were involved or interested in the treaty scrutiny process. Some of the issues which participants considered were:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         has the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties made the treaty making process more democratic, transparent and accountable?
        </li>
        <li>
         how adequate is the consultation between the Commonwealth and the states and territories in relation to treaties? How could it be more effective?
        </li>
        <li>
         how has the failure of the Treaties Council to meet more than once since 1996 had an impact on the treaty making process?
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        The seminar also provided an opportunity to consider recent trends in treaty making, such as the increase in free trade agreements, treaties with regional neighbours and climate change treaties. Finally, the seminar provided the opportunity to consider the committee’s role, and Australia’s treaty making processes, in an international context.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is clear from the seminar that the committee is a successful and effective body and was considered by seminar participants to be the strongest performer of the 1996 reforms. The report contains a detailed summary and analysis of the issues discussed at the seminar.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend both reports to the Senate.

           Thankfully I have now been freed of that onerous responsibility, Senator Marshall. It was very kind of the government to take that away from me. Perhaps I will have more opportunity in future. Report No. 78 is definitely worth reading for people who want a good overview of the history of this matter, of the work of the committee and various opinions on it over a 10-year period. I certainly do not dissent from it at all. I signed off on it as a member of the committee. I want to take the opportunity to make some comments of my own about the history of the committee’s role in reviewing treaties, the lead-up to its implementation and where it should go from here. I am currently a member of the committee; I have been on and off a few times over the period I have been in the Senate. Back through the early 1990s, the Democrats agitated quite regularly for a much stronger role for the parliament in reviewing the very large number of treaties that the Australian government enters into. There has often been a lot of fairly exaggerated talk about the Australian government handing away our sovereignty to international bodies when we enter into these treaties. The fact that this committee was established has been a mechanism to show that a lot of that rhetoric is completely unfounded. That is not to say that—

               Thank you, Senator Kemp. I happen to recall as well. You try to say something positive about this government and they still have to come across and slag you off in a typical pig ignorant way. It is extraordinary; their arrogance is unbelievable. They cannot let you get to the end of a sentence without misinterpreting what you are saying, when you are about to give them a compliment, and they try to say that you do not know what you are talking about. You are right: sorry, I do not know what I am talking about and I do not know why I was trying to give you a compliment. Clearly, that was stupid of me! The treaties committee, when it was established, did go some way to enabling the scrutiny of treaties.

                , on a point of order: normally I do not respond to these rather childish comments that Senator Bartlett makes. The history of this period is that there was a lot of concern in the Senate, including among members of the Democrats, which led to the establishment of this committee. They were not trite comments and they were not foolish comments that people made. The fact is, Senator Bartlett, that you do not understand the history.

                  The minister continues to display his ignorance by again misrepresenting what I was partly through saying and by demonstrating that he does not know what a point of order is. If, for once, the minister could actually listen, what I was saying is there are many people in the wider community who used to make quite outrageous statements about the distorted nature of international agreements and who used to suggest that such things were giving away Australia’s sovereignty. There were many people—including the Democrats, as I said—who agitated in this place throughout the early 1990s to give the parliament a greater role in scrutinising those agreements. Indeed, the Democrats suggested that the parliament should have the opportunity to vote down international agreements in the same way as we do with various regulations and delegated legislation.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  It is a strange anomaly that we have the potential in this parliament to vote down minor details of subordinate legislation, regulations and minor ordinances but we do not have the power to vote down major international treaties, as of course many other parliaments around the world do. Nonetheless, the fact that this government went halfway towards allowing some scrutiny of treaties was a positive development. After the completely stupid and arrogant contribution by Senator Kemp just then, it pains me to note that Senator Kemp had a positive role to play in that. Obviously since then his overpowering arrogance has completely enabled him to ignore the contribution by anybody else except himself in that particular role.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  It is very important to emphasise that, whilst this has provided some improvement in scrutiny and has allowed the parliament to demonstrate that the grossly overstated complaints of some in the community about the nature of international agreements was indeed overstated, it has nonetheless shown its limitations over the 10-year period. I think what we have seen over the period of 10 years is an indication that whilst the process to date has its positive mechanisms it could be made to be more positive. I would still like to see the parliament able to negate treaties—and I realise that would be a fairly significant shift—but regardless of that I do think the committee itself could take a more proactive role.
                 </p>

                  I would point to one of the lower points in the history of the Joint
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Committee" rel="nofollow">
                   Standing Committee
                  </a>
                  on Treaties over the 10-year period, when it refused to consider a reference from this Senate chamber to consider a proposed treaty action. In fact, it refused to do so more than once. I thought that was probably the lowest point in the committee’s history. The committee had a clear-cut reference from this Senate chamber asking it to examine a matter regarding the Australian government’s ongoing negotiations with the
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
                   US
                  </a>
                  government to see if the US could be exempted from the provisions of the
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court" rel="nofollow">
                   International Criminal Court
                  </a>
                  . It was on the public record a number of times that Mr Downer said he was pursuing the matter. This Senate passed a resolution asking the treaties committee to examine the matter, and the committee simply refused to do so. That is an example of a problem that occurs when a committee is government dominated and when you have the sort of arrogance from government members that Senator Kemp has so effectively demonstrated. Arrogance and ignorance are a pretty horrible combination to subject a parliament to, and it is unfortunate when it starts to infect parliamentary committees. Whilst the committee has performed a useful role, it has nonetheless fallen short of its potential.

                  It did take a proactive role on a few occasions—most particularly, for example, with the
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAI" rel="nofollow">
                   MAI
                  </a>
                  , the

                   Multilateral Agreement on Investment
                  </a>
                  that was proposed at one stage. It was a clear time when the committee did not wait until the government had finished all its work in negotiating a treaty, wait until it was tabled and then look at it. What it did was to take account of the fact that there was consideration being given to a possible international agreement being adopted, and it initiated its own inquiry to take evidence from the government and to hear concerns from the community and the public on that issue. It enabled public input into the issue prior to the treaty being agreed to.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  That is the area where I think the committee could do a lot more effective and proactive work. At the moment, most of the time but not all of the time—indeed, the hearings this morning would be one example—the committee waits until the process is completely finished and the treaty has been negotiated and tabled in this place prior to it being adopted and then it investigates. That is fine on the vast majority of occasions. A huge number of agreements are adopted each year, many of which are uncontroversial, and that is the right way to do things. But occasionally there are incidents where it would be beneficial even for the government—assuming that we had a government that listened to anybody, which of course we do not have at the moment; but one day we will have a government that feels as though it needs to listen to the community—to hear public input in advance of when a treaty is negotiated rather than at the end. I think that is the area where the treaties committee could move on to the next stage and be much more proactive in its work and much more involving of the community and community input. It is that aspect of the committee process that has always been the most beneficial and where I would urge the committee to go from here. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
