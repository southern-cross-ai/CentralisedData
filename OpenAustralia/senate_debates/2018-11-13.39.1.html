         I thank Senator Whish-Wilson for his question. As I think I've indicated in the chamber before, we are disappointed that Japan's decision to return to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ocean" rel="nofollow">
          Southern Ocean
         </a>
         this summer to undertake scientific whaling has commenced. We are clear in our opposition to all forms of commercial and scientific whaling. I would note that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Whaling_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          International Whaling Commission
         </a>
         found that Japan had not justified the need for its whaling in the Southern Ocean and, indeed, recommended that Japan cease these whaling programs unless they can demonstrate a scientific need for what is known as lethal research. And we continue to make representations to Japan.

             I reject the premise of Senator Whish-Wilson's question in relation to Australia's relationship with Japan. We, in fact, have an extremely valuable, high-level, special, strategic partnership with Japan, which is borne of many years engagementâ€”and very important bilateral engagement, at thatâ€”across a range of areas. We cooperate in our own region here in the Pacific and more broadly in the Indo-Pacific. We are cooperating strongly in relation to the denuclearisation of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Peninsula" rel="nofollow">
              Korean Peninsula
             </a>
             , which I would have thought may have been of passing interest to the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
              Australian Greens
             </a>
             , but perhaps not. That denuclearisation requires the engagement of countries like Japan, Australia, the United States, China and a number of our other counterparts to ensure the greatest pressure is applied to the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPRK" rel="nofollow">
              DPRK
             </a>
             in relation to that denuclearisation. In relation to whaling, Japan is, of course, well aware of Australia's strong opposition to commercial whaling and to scientific whaling, as it is described.

               Minister, only a month ago you met your Japanese government counterpart and praised Japan's commitment to an international rules based order. Given they have essentially militarised their whaling fleetâ€”they've passed new legislations to give their whaling fleets new powersâ€”and they are going to the

They are part of our engagements with Japanâ€”

                  I have asked the same question twice, but I want to be very specific. I've asked whether this will be raised with Mr Abe directly on Friday.

                     Senator Whish-Wilson, resume your seat! If your point of order was direct relevance, then please make that clear at the start of what you say. That was part of your question. Your question had a substantial lead-in. The minister is entitled to address any part of the question. Senator Payne.

                      . In response, I would say I was absolutely directly relevant to Senator Whish-Wilson's question by talking about the engagement between Australia and Japan, regularly, on these matters of concern. Whether or not it's raised between the Prime Minister and Prime Minister Abe is a matter for them, but it is regularly raised between Australia and Japan.
