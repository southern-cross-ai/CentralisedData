        My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Wong. I refer the minister to modelling undertaken by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBS" rel="nofollow">
         UBS
        </a>
        showing that the government's mining tax will raise only $4.8 billion over the forward estimates and not the $13.4 billion the government has asserted in the budget. That is $8.6 billion less than the government has predicted over the forward estimates. How will the government fund its $8.6 billion mining tax budget black hole, which will only continue to grow?

         First, in terms of the mining tax, the position of the opposition seems variously to be that this is a tax that will end the mining industry and that this is a tax that will not actually raise any money. If it is a tax that will not raise any money, then presumably it will not actually end the mining industry. You cannot even work out which scare campaign is the most convenient, Senator Cormann. You cannot even work out which part of your opposition to this campaign is the most convenient, because you say both that it will end the world as we know it, in terms of the mining industry, and that it will not raise any revenue. I start with making that point, because I think everyone should be very clear about where Senator Cormann is coming from—which is all over the place. He simply wants to say no. It does not matter what the proposition is when it comes to the government's policies. He simply wants to say no. In terms of the revenue that is to be raised—

          is clearly on to something, because the minister is steadfastly refusing to be directly relevant to the question, which is how the government is going to fund that $8.6 billion shortfall.

            In relation to the revenue projections, we did revise
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRRT" rel="nofollow">
             MRRT
            </a>
            receipts in the most recent budget figures. The revision has been to a figure of $13.4 billion over the forward estimates. It is the case, and we have said so publicly, that how much revenue the MRRT will raise will obviously depend on a range of factors, including commodity prices, exchange rates and production volumes. I am also asked about black holes. Senator Cormann should turn around and tell his colleagues how he is going to find $70 billion worth of cuts to services. He asked about black holes. Well, he should know about them. Those on that side—the economic team on the Liberal Party's side, the coalition's side—have done nothing but preside over costings errors and black holes to the self-confessed tune of $70 billion.

             , I ask a supplementary question. Given that the minister has just conceded that mining tax revenue will depend on commodity price assumptions, production volume assumptions and various other assumptions coming to fruition, will the government now release all the mining tax revenue assumptions it has used—in particular, the commodity price and production volume assumptions—to estimate its mining tax revenue estimates? Given that the government has so far been desperate to keep these assumptions a secret, what has it got to hide from the Australian people? Is it yet another Labor Party budget black hole?

                      , I ask a further supplementary question. I ask again: given that an independent economic modeller has now revealed that the estimated revenue for the mining tax will be one-third what the government has forecast, how will the government make up the shortfall? Given yet another multibillion-dollar shortfall, how can anyone believe that Labor will deliver on its promise of a $1.5 billion surplus next financial year after a track record of $174 billion of accumulated deficits?

                       In terms of estimated revenue, I again point the senator to the transparent and printed budget documents. The

                       will collect $13.4 billion over the forward estimates. They were revised down; we were transparent about that, and that transparency is in stark contrast to the way those opposite are hiding their $70 billion worth of cuts. So don't come in here, Senator Cormann, and talk to us about transparency.
