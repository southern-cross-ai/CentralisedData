        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. Can the minister update the Senate on how the government's budget will fix legacy issues Labor inherited from the Liberals and Nationals, and address cost-of-living pressures?

         The Albanese government is committed to a stronger economy and a fairer society, and the budget will reflect that. We on this side have been working hard to clean up the mess left by the Liberals and Nationals. They failed to manage the budget and they drove up debt. Tonight's budget will be a budget in the best Labor tradition: a budget focused on delivering cost-of-living relief now, including a $14.6 billion package of targeted relief for household energy bills, cheaper medicines, expanded access to the parenting payment, and more. Obviously, much more will be revealed tonight, but I can say that this budget will be delivered in the most responsible way so that it will not drive up inflation.
        </p>
        <p>
         We've also worked to ensure that this budget invests in the future growth of our economy, with cleaner and cheaper energy at the core of that strategy, in sharp contrast to what those opposite delivered. Our budget is built on a foundation of responsible economic management—a stark contrast to those opposite. Tonight's budget will include billions of dollars cleaning up the mess left to us by the Liberals and the Nationals. Unlike those opposite, Labor is not prepared to leave vital government functions unfunded, including biosecurity, disaster management, management of radioactive waste, digital health and online safety. Unlike those opposite, we're not happy to leave national collecting institutions to crumble or ignore the Liberals' chronic underinvestment in our national parks or flood-warning infrastructure. We had to address the previous government's failure to provision a single dollar for the Olympic and

         </a>
         —not a single dollar. I'm hoping the Queenslanders might cheer a government that's backing in Queensland when it comes to the Olympics and Paralympic Games. We are building on the $4.1 billion in the October budget we had to spend to resolve legacy—

            I thank Senator Stewart for her supplementary question. I would say this: this senator and all senators are very focused on cost-of-living relief for Australians in a way that is responsible and effective. Our priority is to provide cost-of-living relief without adding inflationary pressure to the economy, so we will include $14.6 billion in tonight's budget in responsible, targeted cost-of-living relief. It builds on—those opposite might remember this—an increase to award wages for aged-care workers, improvements to paid parental leave, and cheaper child care. But, as the Treasurer has flagged, it will forecast a surplus for this year, a deliberate result of the Albanese government's responsible bottom line. Unlike those opposite, we will deal with this responsibly. We won't be wandering around like those opposite did, with the 'Back in Black' mugs. We will deal with this budget responsibly.

               I would make this point, because those opposite seem to live in some sort of fantasy land where they think they were responsible. Those opposite doubled the debt before the pandemic. Those opposite left Australians with a trillion dollars in debt and nothing to show for it. We on this side—this government—will make decisions to reduce the debt.

                  Those opposite doubled the debt before the pandemic. They left us with a trillion dollars in debt and nothing to show for it. What we will see in tonight's budget is $17.8 billion in spending reprioritised, building on the $22 billion in savings and reprioritisation we identified in the October budget. Guess what their savings were in their last budget. Zero. One of the things driving the improvement to revenue is improvement in wages and we all know those opposite are for a low-wage economy.

                   My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Wong. Minister, is it accurate that most working Australian families will receive no energy bill relief in this budget, but will still be hit with the costs of higher inflation and an increased tax bill caused by bracket creep?

                    I thank the senator for her question, and I would make this point. Obviously, details of the energy price relief plan, which required bilateral discussions with all states and territories, will be demonstrated in some detail in tonight's budget. It does seem strange—just like it did with the housing question—that we get a question from a coalition senator about energy price relief after they voted against it. You voted against it! You voted against the plan that you're now asking questions about.

                      It's because our policies weren't going to deliver, he says. It's interesting, isn't it? They come in here and they say, 'We're for energy price relief—sort of—but we're going to vote against it, and actually, we've got nothing else on the table to deliver.' There's only one party here, one party of government, that is absolutely clear about the responsibility and opportunity of government to deliver price relief to Australian families. We know that energy prices have risen less than they would have if you had been government. Those opposite irresponsibly voted against price relief for Australian families and we will ensure, between now and the next election, that every time you raise energy prices we will remind everybody who is listening that you voted against it. All of you voted against it, and really, you should go out to the Australian people—

                        and you should apologise for your refusal to give some price relief to families who are struggling with higher prices. As always, those opposite are still too focused on the ideology, not on practical outcomes, and their only response to energy price increases was to try and hide them before the last election.

                              Yes, I think so. From my recollection, the ending of the LMITO was in fact flagged by your government. If you're now going to fund that, I look forward to a budget reply which tells Australians how you will fund that. Senator Hughes, you are asking a question about a policy. If your policy position is to fund that, I look forward to Mr Dutton outlining his plan to fund that, and which government services—which parts of Medicare—he's not going to deliver in order to fund that. We are very focused, in this budget, on ensuring we provide responsible cost-of-living assistance to Australians. Obviously, there is always more that you would do if you could.

                                Minister, the Albanese government continues to promise energy bill relief for Australians, but, as this latest revelation proves, it rarely delivers and most miss out. Isn't it true that the millions of Australians ineligible for this current package also have no hope of ever seeing Labor's promised $275 cut to their bills?

                                 s would have been paying $530 more. I realise you're not a South Australian senator, but I did see that figure and I thought, 'There you go—that's the actual cost to South Australian families of the opposition of the opposition.' It is the 'no' of the 'no-alition', who, extraordinarily, came in here and voted against price relief for Australians at a time when we knew—because of 10 years of your policies and because of what is happening with Russia's illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine—that energy prices were going up. But you voted against it. South Australians would have been $530 worse off if you had succeeded.
