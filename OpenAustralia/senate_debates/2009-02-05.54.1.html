        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Local Government
        </a>
        , Senator Conroy. Given the tangible economic and social benefits to people in need offered by public transport and cycling infrastructure and the extremely overburdened or non-existent public transport systems on our city fringes and in our regional towns, can the minister explain why the government’s economic stimulus package contains no funding streams or appropriations for public transport?

         Thank you, Senator Ludlam. Being asked to answer a negative is always an entertaining challenge. Let us be clear. The government has focused its priority on schools; it has focused its priority on infrastructure in roads; it has focused its challenge on consumption and helping Australian families. No-one is suggesting that in the upcoming budget none of these issues could be addressed. But this is a very specific package that is designed to alleviate the pressure on the economy and try and support 90,000 jobs. That is the challenge. That is what is before you. We have put forward a stimulus package based on all of the evidence around the world, as six of our major trading partners are sliding into or already in recession. To stop Australia sliding into recession, as on current forecasts, this package will stimulate the economy, it will deliver jobs and it will deliver protection for families. For all of those in this chamber—

           This is about what is needed urgently in this country to address a recession. Buses, last time I checked, travelled on roads; railway crossings usually have trains going across them. These are measures that deal with aspects of public transport. But let us be clear that this is a package that delivers immediate stimulus to address the very specific problems that have emerged in the last few months, and particularly with the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMF" rel="nofollow">
            IMF

           ’s forecasts over the last few days. We have put in place a stimulus package—

            is fairly familiar with the minister’s brief on the overall justification for the package. I am interested, given that the stimulus package invests $6 billion to fast-track 20,000 units of public housing, in what planning the government is doing—it may not be doing any—to ensure that the new housing is well served by public transport and does not strand low-income people in car dependent and congested communities.

             I am not quite sure how relevant that was to the primary question because it was about housing, and I am not actually sure that I have carriage of public housing questions. So I would defer the question to my colleague. But, from the information I have to hand for you, stage 1 of this new initiative will fund the construction of around 2,300 dwellings that are already planned and approved, with construction to commence this financial year. The government anticipates that around 15,000 dwellings will be ready for occupancy by the end of 2010, with the remainder to be available by the end of 2012.

                     , I ask a further supplementary question. Given that immediately buying more buses and trains made in Australia would get jobs into the transit manufacturing sector and the cycling sector and address the urgent demand for public transport, when can we expect an announcement of a government plan for the transit manufacturing sector?

                      I have to say I am not sure that the premise of that question is actually factually correct, Senator Ludlam. I do not have a lot of experience in ordering buses, trains and carriages, but I do understand there is a fair amount of lag time involved. Let me be clear: I do not think the premise of your question is accurate, because you do have to place these orders and they have to be slotted in behind existing orders. So I do not think the premise is correct. But we are committed to addressing the short-term needs of the economy, as have been exposed by the

                        Thank you for that question. I appreciate that the Prime Minister and the premiers have only just held the press conference. I was able to watch a little bit of it before I came in here. Possibly Senator Barnett did not get an opportunity to see that. Quite clearly, the Prime Minister has stated that, firstly, we make no apology at all for investing in schools, something those opposite have been laughing at and making a mockery of. We make no apology. We have signed the states up to the toughest criteria to ensure that there is no substitution—there is no withdrawing of state funds and topping up with Commonwealth funds. That was the agreement that even the

                        I watched as much of that press conference as I could before I came in here. It is quite clear that the

                        communique sets out the responsibilities of state governments. They will not be allowed to withdraw their funding for programs and substitute Commonwealth funding. Let me quote from the communique:

                       <p class="italic">
                        ... a process to ensure that there is no substitution of capital effort by the states in the areas of schools, energy-efficient homes, social housing, regional roads, black spots and boom gates, overseen by heads of treasuries and reporting to COAG through the

                       </p>
                       <p>
                        So there is a very specific commitment that the states have signed up to, and we will be holding them to that.

                         , I ask a supplementary question. Is the minister aware that federal Labor abolished the coalition’s Investing in Our Schools Program? Secondly, is the minister aware of a statement made by Premier David Bartlett today on ABC radio in Tasmania where he said:
                        </p>
                        <p class="italic">
                         We have projects in housing and in schools that are ready to roll, ready and waiting for this sort of injection.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Hasn’t the Tasmanian Premier, Mr Bartlett, today confirmed that infrastructure funds merely replace already planned state government spending with borrowed federal debt?

I have just read to you from the communique that Premier Bartlett has signed. It is quite clear. As you appear not to have heard it the first time, I will happily read it to you a second time. It says:

                           , I ask a further supplementary question. The minister has clearly not answered the question as to his awareness of Premier Bartlett’s statement. How will the substitution of federal funds for state funds stimulate the economy? Is the government merely bailing out Labor state governments, after a decade of incompetence, at the expense of future generations of Australian taxpayers?

                            Those opposite, who all of a sudden have discovered the words ‘schools’, ‘hospitals’ and ‘infrastructure’, who starved the states of public housing funding, who starved the states of hospital funding and who starved the states of education funding, now want to stand here and be taken seriously. If you want to be taken seriously on schools, on infrastructure and on roads, vote for this package. If you want to be taken seriously, vote for this package to protect families and to protect jobs.

                            When you return to Tasmania and start explaining to people that you are more interested in playing short-term politics than protecting their jobs, you will suddenly discover that all the short-term politics in the world will not protect you from voter backlash. What you are putting forward here is crocodile tears about public infrastructure when you had 12 years to do something about it. What you did was rip the funds out of all public infrastructure.

                              I thank Senator Arbib for his question and note that at least he is asking a question to the minister who is actually responsible for this area. Education and innovation go hand in hand. The purpose of the education system is to nurture creativity. The purpose of the innovation system is to harness that creativity. The government’s $14.7 billion

                              initiative is a huge, long-term investment in our innovation capacity. It will give schools the physical facilities they need to do their job properly. Remember that there is something in this initiative for each and every Australian school. The Independent Schools Council of Australia ‘supports the inclusive nature of this package’.

                              The opposition of course have different ideas. They want to slash the investment to $3 billion. That is one-fifth of what is actually needed. Under the opposition’s plan, four out of five schools will miss out. Perhaps Senator Minchin can tell us which

All of this is lost on the opposition. The world is in crisis and they want to play politics.

The opposition, of course, does not care how much pain and how much suffering it inflicts upon the Australian people.
