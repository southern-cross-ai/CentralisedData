        Given that former Treasurer Joe Hockey once described an official cash rate more than three times as high, under Labor, as being 'beyond emergency levels', how does the minister describe the current cash rate?

         I'm pleased: not only do we have the great senator from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         reading the talking points of the Prime Minister's office, we have Senator Gallagher reading what I say in the

          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Financial_Review" rel="nofollow">

         </i>
         . That is really good.
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to the official cash rate, what I said in the interview that was quoted—and I stand by that—is that decisions on monetary policy are entirely a matter for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">
          Reserve Bank
         </a>
         , to make assessments independently as they consider is appropriate. You've obviously got to consider the international context, and that is obviously part of the judgement the Reserve Bank has made, if you listen to what the Reserve Bank has said in recent times. The Reserve Bank governor has actually said exactly this: you've got to consider what is happening in a structural sense to global interest rate settings.
        </p>
        <p>
         If the interest rate, the official cash rate, in Australia was materially higher than in other parts of the world—as it turned out under Labor, when you put in massive fiscal stimulus—then the value of our currency would go up and our exporting businesses would be less competitive internationally. It would hurt our agricultural sector. It would hurt our resources sector. It would hurt our manufacturing sector. So the Reserve Bank makes these judgements, independently as they see fit, and I have indeed welcomed the decisions the Reserve Bank has made. Indeed, monetary policy and fiscal policy are working in the same direction, helping to ensure that our economy can continue to strengthen into the future in the context of very difficult global economic conditions.

            -rated by the three major credit rating agencies, with more than 1.4 million new jobs and the highest workforce participation on record. Earlier I was asked a question about wages growth. Real wages grew by 0.7 per cent through the year to the June quarter—above the 20-year average of 0.6 per cent and above the rate of 0.4 per cent through-the-year growth when Labor left office. So, let me say again: wages growth today is stronger than it was when Labor left office. Real wages growth today is stronger than the long-term average.

            We are continuing to work to build the strongest-possible economy in the context of very difficult conditions globally and domestically. You say that you had difficult conditions back in 2012-13. Let me tell you: you either had the—

               I don't think Senator Gallagher listened to my previous answer. Wages growth through the year is actually above the 20-year average of 0.6 per cent and above the rate of 0.4 per cent through-the-year growth when Labor left office. I'm just telling you the facts. I also know what the

               governor said very recently—that he expects the economy to gradually strengthen on the back of lower interest rates, lower taxes, continued high investment in infrastructure, a pick-up in the resources sector and stabilisation of the property market. The government are continuing to do everything we can to build a stronger economy through our ambitious infrastructure investment program and our ambitious free trade agenda, helping our exporting businesses sell more Australian products and services all around the world, as well as our deregulation agenda and our plans to bring the cost of energy down. We will continue to do the right thing by the Australian people, and we'll leave the sniping to you.
