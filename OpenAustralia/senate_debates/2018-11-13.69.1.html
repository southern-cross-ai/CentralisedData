           In relation to Senator Carr's question, I am aware of the reports that Senator Carr has referred to. I'm advised that Gretals had applied for a bridging grant under the Global Connections Fund in 2017. The fund is administered on behalf of the government by the Australian Academy of Technology and Engineering. The Australian Academy of Technology and Engineering has confirmed that, while Gretals was found to meet the requirements to be awarded a grant, the company withdrew its application. Furthermore, the Australian Academy of Technology and Engineering has confirmed that no funds were paid from the Global Connections Fund to Gretals.

              Leader of the Government in the Senate

             didn't refer to this grant and the circumstances around the matter that he's just raised. Was there any advice provided to the leader of the government on these matters before that letter was sent?

                    Obviously, Senator Carr has asked a question that relates to issues that were handled by the
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Government_in_the_Senate" rel="nofollow">
                     Leader of the Government in the Senate
                    </a>
                    , so I do not have direct advice with regard to that. But I think Senator Cormann outlined the case properly here: there are two different grants, one of which is administered by the
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Industry" rel="nofollow">
                     Department of Industry
                    </a>
                    , Innovation and Science, about which I have related information to you. The other grant that was referred to yesterday, I believe, comes under the education department.

                      I thank the minister for his answer. I simply ask this: given that the Prime Minister has previously stated that he had no concerns in this matter, did the minister or the department provide the Prime Minister with a brief on the question of the Global Connections Fund grant before the Prime Minister made those comments, given that the member for Dunkley actually stated in the House of Representatives that the company, which he personally had invested in, had actually received the benefit of this $50,000 grant?

                               . As I was indicating earlier, the question Senator Carr just asked was: did the Prime Minister receive briefings? Obviously, as I outlined, I don't represent the Prime Minister in this chamber. What I can advise is that I have been briefed on this information as the representative minister. Of course, any questions in relation to the Prime Minister's briefings need to be asked of the relevant minister.

                                , I seek leave to table a statement from the member for Dunkley relating specifically to this matter and the grant from the department of industry, the Global Connections Fund. He specifically refers to his company, a company which he's invested in, and the receipt of $50,000.
