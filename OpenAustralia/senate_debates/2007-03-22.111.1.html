Who in the Prime Minister’s office did the Australian Federal Police inform on Thursday, 1 March, that these raids would be conducted the following day? Is the minister aware of the media report on 7 March that the member for Bowman’s office received a telephone call an hour before the raids were conducted? Can the minister confirm whether a tip-off occurred and, if so, can he guarantee that it did not compromise those investigations? Is the minister aware of whether the

                I thank the senator for his question. Firstly, I can confirm that the investigation has in no way at any time been compromised to any degree whatsoever by conduct on any person’s part in the inquiry. On 13 November 2006, the alleged fraudulent use of electoral allowances by federal MPs was referred to the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
                 Australian Federal Police
                </a>
                for investigation. The Australian Federal Police accepted these allegations for investigation on 30 January 2007. On 1 March 2007, the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
                 AFP
                </a>
                provided preliminary advice to government, through the Prime Minister’s office, that search warrants would be executed on a number of electoral offices the following day—2 March. On 2 March 2007, the AFP formally briefed the office of the Minister for Justice and Customs on the execution of the search warrants, when the search warrants were being executed, the substance of the matter being investigated and who was the subject of the investigation. On 2 March, the AFP provided the Department of Finance and Administration with a copy of its ministerial briefing.
               </p>
               <p>
                At no time were any of the activities undertaken by the Australian Federal Police compromised, interfered with or engaged over by any member of the government. The AFP, in terms of their operational requirements, went about their duties without any government interference whatsoever. I am instructed that the information flowing to the Prime Minister’s office on 1 March was in line with a longstanding policy by the commissioner to inform government of matters relevant to government. No flow of information, influence or engagement was forthcoming towards the AFP in any shape or form. They carried out their duties, as is their wont. This government takes no role in operational matters whatsoever. That is all I have to say.
