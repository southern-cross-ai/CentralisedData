        My question is to the Minister for Defence, Senator Reynolds. Can the minister update the Senate on how the Morrison government is helping to protect Australians and build a more resilient economy by continuing to strengthen Australia's defence capability?

         I thank Senator Henderson for her question and for her fearless pursuit of defence industry and jobs in her state. This government is investing more than $200 billion to deliver a more potent, agile and capable ADF. The investment will ensure that we maintain our capability edge and are prepared for a more contested geostrategic environment in the Indo-Pacific. This reinvestment is vital after years of cuts, delays and indecision under Labor, which included cutting defence funding to 1.56 per cent of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">

         , the lowest level since 1938.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Morrison government is getting on with the job of making considered investment choices based on capability requirements and emerging threats, as well as building a strong sovereign industrial base and creating jobs right across Australia. This financial year alone we have invested $8.2 billion in crucial capabilities. We are moving ahead on the $90 billion naval shipbuilding plan. We are already building 57 naval vessels in Australia, by Australian workers with Australian steel. Over $5 billion of investment in Army's next generation logistic vehicle fleet has achieved initial operating capability and is ready for training and major exercises. In fact, the fleet did an extraordinary job for our nation on Operation Bushfire Assist. Under our $18 billion commitment to deliver the next generation of air strike capability, we welcomed another seven F-35s to Australia in December last year, bringing the total here in Australia to 13. The Morrison government is ensuring that the men and women of the

          <p>
           Key to this the successful delivery of defence capability is our partnership with Australian defence industry. This is truly a national endeavour. There are thousands of companies right across Australia involved in defence projects and supply chains that are supporting hundreds of thousands of Australian jobs. It is this government that is ensuring that Australian industry involvement is maximised in all defence programs to build a sovereign industrial base that supports Australian jobs. In Victoria, for example, Universal Motion Simulation in Geelong was awarded a $21.4 million contract for sustainment of six training simulators for the Boxer combat recognisance vehicle. Over 50 Australian companies have contracts already supplying the global supply chain for the F-35, including 17 in Victoria, Senator Henderson.

                   It's no surprise that Labor doesn't want to hear the answer to this, because the only threat to this project is the member for Corio himself,

                   . It is deeply disappointing that the shadow minister for defence, himself, whose seat is in the heart of Geelong, continues to talk down Geelong's ability to support this project.

                   The Morrison government is extremely proud of its commitment to build and sustain 30 self-propelled howitzers in Geelong, providing vital Army capability and delivering up to 350 jobs. This project is fully funded and is now underway. Mr Marles represents an electorate with one of the highest unemployment rates in this country yet he continues to talk down this important project for Army capability, which will also deliver jobs for Geelong. The people of Geelong deserve so much better.
