        Hundreds of trucks, good employers and industry transport groups took part in convoys across the country on Saturday, including on the lawns outside this building, urging this chamber to urgently pass the closing the loopholes bill. This year there have already been 210 everyday Australians killed in truck crashes. Every month, 55 transport businesses collapse and, thanks to the Liberal and Nationals, these urgent life-saving reforms will be delayed by months. That means more insolvencies, more exploitation and more sweatshops on wheels.

        These reforms are widely supported by every major transport industry stakeholder. There is nothing contentious about them, but the Christmas message from Leader of the Opposition, Mr Dutton, to Australians in the road transport industry, is, 'You're getting paid too much.' He says that you have it too good.

        , because that's who he represents. According to media reports, Mr Dutton sat by the billionaire's hand for the evening and enjoyed smoked wagyu brisket and ribs whilst half-naked acrobats spun around. It sounds like a lovely evening for Dutton and his billionaire paymastersâ€”
