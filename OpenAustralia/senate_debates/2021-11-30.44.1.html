         I thank Senator Askew for her question and her interest in this matter, as I know many senators and members of the House of Representatives have expressed serious interest in and concern about these matters. On behalf of all of us, I welcome the report of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Review" rel="nofollow">
          Independent Review
         </a>
         into Commonwealth Parliamentary Workplaces, led by Sex Discrimination Commissioner Kate Jenkins, and I thank her for her leadership in this review and for the report,
         <i>
          Set the standard
         </i>
         . This report highlights that people who work in our parliament and the agencies that exist across its operation consider it a privilege to be here, and they work with the utmost of integrity in making a difference to our nation in the vast majority of cases. We give thanks and celebrate the work of all of those tireless individuals right across this building and across parliamentary workplaces.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, the report also highlights that people in our workplaces, particularly women, have experienced bullying, sexual harassment and sexual assault. It is unacceptable. Some of the examples in this report are deeply distressing. It is clear that we have not had pathways to successfully prevent these instances from occurring or to effectively respond and support people when they have experienced it. Every Australian has a right to feel and to be safe at work. The high-pressure environment of this workplace is not an excuse for unacceptable behaviour. We should, as the report's title says, set the standard.
        </p>
        <p>
         The report provides 28 practical recommendations for change, which we have a responsibility to make and to work positively through. I thank all those who have engaged courageously in this review, sharing their stories and helping to drive change and a better workplace for all. I acknowledge that this report will be distressing for many as well. I urge those in this building and beyond who may be distressed by aspects of its release to access the support services available, be that 1800APHSPT, 1800RESPECT or other services available.

            Whilst this important review was underway throughout much of this year, the Prime Minister also commissioned a deputy secretary in the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_the_Prime_Minister_and_Cabinet" rel="nofollow">

            , to review procedures and processes involved in identifying, reporting and responding to serious incidents that occur in the parliamentary workplace. In March the government accepted an urgent recommendation from Ms Foster to establish an independent, trauma-informed, confidential support line, 1800APHSPT. This has been supporting staff, MPs, and their family and friends to receive necessary support. Ms Foster provided her consultation report in June 2021. Following feedback from across the parliament, Ms Foster provided a final report in July 2021. The government accepted the 10 recommendations in that report, working to establish the Safe and Respectful Workplaces training program, the Parliamentary Workplace Support Service, and transparency and monitoring measures in this regard. I thank Ms Foster for her work, in addition to that of Commissioner Jenkins, and all those who have engaged in these processes, including across parliament.

               The review was established with engagement with the opposition, the Greens, other minor parties, crossbenchers, and current and former staff. We engaged in terms of the reviewer, the terms of reference and the timing and worked collaboratively to ensure that a review was put in place that could provide maximum confidence for individuals to participate and to ensure that participation gave us the best possible basis upon which to prevent bullying, sexual harassment or sexual assault in the future.

               I thank the opposition and all other parties for their engagement to date and commit that we wish to continue the cooperation in relation to the response to this report. The Prime Minister has asked me and the
