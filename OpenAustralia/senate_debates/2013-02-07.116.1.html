        I have a policy question for the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Senator Wong. Can the minister inform the Senate what funding the Gillard government has provided to support regional Australia? How does this compare to any alternative plans for the development of regional Australia?

         , this government has made unprecedented investments in regional Australia, investments that were never seen under a coalition government. There has been some $4.3 billion invested in regional Australia, including $1.8 billion in regional health. We saw a regional priority round of the Education Investment Fund and, of course, the Regional Development Australia Fund.

          It is unsurprising that I could have been Deputy Prime Minister, Senator Joyce. Senator Joyce is very quiet while we are talking about all of the things that this government has delivered to regional Australia.
         </p>
         <p>
          The record of this government stands in stark contrast to the performance of the opposition because after a decade of neglect of the regions which the National Party participated in—and it took a Labor government to turn that around—we see now what Mr Abbott's real plan is, a plan that he has been keeping secret, a plan that has all the rigour of something dreamt up by Senator Joyce, the man who apparently could have been Deputy Prime Minister according to him. But more worrying than the fact that this really does look like Barnaby might have dreamt—

            I will come to where this actually came from. It certainly looks like something Senator Joyce dreamed up. But what is more worrying is that it has been authored by the man who wants to be the finance minister, Mr Robb.

                . Ms Rinehart floated something surprisingly similarly nasty last year as part of a plan that included paying Australians two dollars an hour. It is interesting that those ideas now have found their way into coalition policy. You have to say that not only is this plan ridiculous it is also completely uncosted.

                    Senator Joyce, that is not even a point of order. I have given people before the opportunity to revamp the question. I have been quite consistent about that. You have the opportunity to make it conform to the standing orders.

We know there are many public servants who live and work in Western Sydney. For example, we have in the
