        Reasons for Urgency

       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Charities and Not for profits Commission was announced to commence operations from 1 October 2012.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It will be important for the bills to be enacted at the beginning of the 2012 Spring sittings to allow time for regulations and appointments to be completed prior to the commencement of the Commission’s operations on 1 October 2012.

        The bill would amend the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989 (the

        It is important that introduction and passage of the bill take place within the 2012 Spring sitting to enable the Government to deliver on its commitment to implement the measures in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRIS" rel="nofollow">
         CRIS
        </a>
        , particularly the revised tier structure for NICNAS registration, by 1 January 2013. Consequential amendments to the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Regulations 1990 will be required to give effect to new fees and charges in the 2013 14 financial year beginning 1 July 2013. A delay in passage of the bill may result in insufficient time to give effect to the revised NICNAS registration structure and delay the Government’s commitment to lower fees for small business.

        National Portrait Gallery of Australia Bill 2012

        National Portrait Gallery of Australia (consequential and transitional provisions) Bill 2012
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Purpose of the Bills
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The purpose of the National Portrait Gallery of Australia Bill 2012 is to establish the National Portrait Gallery of Australia as a Commonwealth statutory authority subject to the Commonwealth Authorities and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companies_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Companies Act
        </a>
        1997 from 1 July 2013.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The companion Bill, the National Portrait Gallery of Australia (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2012 contains consequential amendments and transitional arrangements related to the establishment of the National Portrait Gallery of Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Reasons for Urgency
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The National Portrait Gallery currently operates as a Branch within the Department of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Regional Australia

        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Local Government
        </a>
        , Arts and Sport (the Department). These Bills need to be dealt with in one sitting period in order to ensure arrangements to transition the Gallery to a statutory authority are effective on 1 July 2013.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A range of administrative arrangements must be finalised following the passage of the Bills to ensure that the National Portrait Gallery of Australia is fully functional from 1 July 2013. These include: the required Regulations; the recruitment of a Director and the appointment of a governing Board; transfer of assets and liabilities; transitioning of the Gallery building, collection, property and staff from the Department; and processes and procedures in relation to financial and other systems.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The passage of these Bills in the 2012 Spring sittings will enable all administrative arrangements to be completed and ensure the operation of the National Portrait Gallery of Australia is not affected and the transition is seamless for visitors and staff.
