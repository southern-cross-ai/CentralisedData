        I table a response from Senator Cormann to a question taken on notice during question time on 20 September 2018, asked by Senator Watt, relating to the matter of responses to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee inquiry into allegations concerning the inappropriate exercise of ministerial powers, with respect to the visa status of au pairs, and related matters, and I seek leave to have the answer incorporated into

        I write with regard to a question I took on notice from Senator Watt on Thursday, 20 September 2018 on the matter of responses to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee inquiry into
        <i>
         Allegations concerning the inappropriate exercise of ministerial powers, with respect to the visa status of au pairs, and related matters.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am advised that on Wednesday 5 September 2018, officials from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Home Affairs
        </a>
        (the Department) attended a three-hour public hearing of the Committee. A total of 27 Questions on Notice (QoN) with multiple subparts were received by the Department in relation to the inquiry. Of these, 24 QoNs resulted from the Department's attendance at the public hearing, with a further three QoNs received by the Department on Wednesday 12 September, Monday 17 September, and Tuesday 18 September.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On Tuesday 11 September, the Department provided responses to the Senate Committee regarding the QoNs that resulted from the Public Hearing on 5 September, including an interim response to QoN IEMP/022 entitled "
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLO" rel="nofollow">
         DLO
        </a>
        emails". The interim response indicated that the request for information was being actioned, noting that due regard was being given to the privacy of individuals, names and contact details of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Public_Service" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Public Service
        </a>
        staff referenced in the emails.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On Wednesday 19 September (at 8:46AM), the Department provided a finalised response to the Senate Committee to QoN IEMP/022. This response included all information and departmental records — including emails — from the department official relating to the so-called 'Brisbane' and 'Adelaide' cases. This totalled 167 pages of redacted Departmental records and correspondence.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I therefore reject Senator Watt's assertion that the Department acted disrespectfully towards the Committee or the Senate. I believe that the Department answerts3 the Committee's questions appropriately given their complex and sensitive nature, and that therefore there is no reason for the Secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet to pursue this matter.

        I have copied his letter to the Minister for Home Affairs and Senator Watt.
