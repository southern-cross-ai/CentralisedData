           We should not underestimate the fact that the bid from southern African states is very stiff competition.

             I understood that this was a project that actually attracted bipartisan support in this parliament. I understood that there were some on the other side that actually understood—and Senator Back is one of those. I understood that this is a project that people knew would be able to help us transform the way we live. This is not just merely a question of being able to produce world-class research. It is a massive infrastructure project that will create the technologies for the future and will help us reshape the way in which we live, whether it be through the provision of off-grid power supplies or whether it be in the provision of supercomputing capacity, which will have massive implications.

               This is not an ambition that the government can carry alone. This is a project that will require the great strengths of Australian industry. It will ensure that we are able to develop the capacities of Australian industry to compete in what is a very stiff international business environment. Just last year alone,
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
                CSIRO

               . That included work for the hydro-solar storage and generation plants in Murchison. The contracts we have seen that have been let are very significant.
              </p>
              <p>
               But they are all dwarfed by the phenomenal demands of the SKA itself. The construction phase demands of this project will involve €1.5 billion from the global community. They will take some 50 years to develop because we will have to maintain the project for that length of time.

                   I thank Senator Barnett for the question. He is right to bring to my attention the question of the impact of the school closures on

                   R funding in Tasmania, but I point out to him firstly that in fact the federal government put $327 million into Tasmanian schools, the largest capital injection probably ever, and that investment has been money well spent—money that has benefited every child in Tasmania by providing new facilities for all children in primary schools in Tasmania. So it has been a tremendous invest­ment in Tasmanian schools, it has been tremendously successful and communities are reaping the benefits of that.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   It is true that the Tasmanian government have announced that they will consult with the community about closing up to 20 schools, and the Tasmanian Minister for Education and Skills,
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_McKim" rel="nofollow">

                   </a>
                   , did do me the courtesy of ringing me before the budget was handed down to advise me of that. We did discuss that decision's impact in terms of the investment we had made in those schools as part of
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BER" rel="nofollow">
                    BER
                   </a>
                   funding. I understand the process of consultation will go on for some weeks before final decisions are made about which schools will close, and my department will continue to monitor and work closely with the Tasmanian gov­ernment with regard to the affected schools, wherever they may be.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I think the media might also have highlighted today that the Tasmanian government has obtained legal advice that it has no legal compulsion to return the BER money.

                    , I ask a supplementary question. Thank you, Minister, particularly for that last comment; I appreciate that. I refer to statements by the Tasmanian Minister for Education and Skills, Mr McKim, in the Tasmanian parliament this morning, where he said, 'Not one dollar will be repaid by the state government to the federal government.' He went on and said that he has spoken to Senator Evans about this issue personally and that 'at no time has he expressed to me that he, his department or his government has a view that we are obliged to repay the funds'. Does the Commonwealth accept that not one dollar of its funds will be returned?

He also advised me that his legal advice was that they had no obligation to repay funds to the Australian government. I understand that. Fundamentally, we invested in their schools and the state education and other funding authorities have responsibility for those schools. That was an investment in the future of Tasmanian students. But I also made it clear to him that we would be taking further advice about our responsibilities and our options and made it clear to him that our primary objective, as I made clear to you, is to make sure that the investment is for the benefit of Tasmanian students and the broader Tasmanian community. We will continue to monitor the developments with an interest in making sure that the facilities that have been established are there for the benefit of Tasmanians. That is our primary interest. We will continue to pursue that interest.

                        I do not know whether Senator Barnett in his last days is prepared to visit the schools of Tasmania and tell them that the Liberal Party does not support the investment in their schools—that you do not support the $327 million that we have put into Tasmanian schools in order to give those kids a better education. You are hypocrites on this issue, because I know you go to school openings. They turn up at the school openings, and they say, 'Oh, this is great,' and they come in here—

                          , I do get cross because I am outraged that senators from the opposition, the Liberal and National parties, would regard the investment in our schools as a waste of money. This has been one of the best investments the Commonwealth has ever made. We have invested in school buildings that will provide educational support for children for the next 30 or 40 years, and every school I go to is extremely grateful and tells me about the benefits it will bring.

                            . My question is to Senator Evans, representing the Minister for Defence. The

                             Department of Defence
                            </a>
                            has announced eight reviews into allegations of abuse and misconduct in the
                            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AD" rel="nofollow">
                             AD
                            </a>
                            F. Of these reviews, one relates to the personal conduct of ADF personnel and another to the process by which incidents and complaints were managed by the ADF. These are the only two reviews run by ADF officials out of the eight. Can the minister advise why these two reviews, unlike the other six, are not being undertaken by independent parties? Does the government acknowledge that some victims of alleged abuse may be reluctant to come forward because of this lack of independence?

                             </a>
                             this year the Minister for Defence announced a series of reviews and initiatives into various aspects of the culture of the
                             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AD" rel="nofollow">

                             </a>
                             F. These comprehensive reviews were initiated following the raising of allegations of inappropriate conduct at
                             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADFA" rel="nofollow">

                             on 5 April. The reviews are drawing on a range of expertise both within and external to Defence. In relation to the two reviews mentioned by the senator, the review of the management of incidents and complaints in Defence is being undertaken by the independent Inspector-General of the
                             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">

                             </a>
                             . The review will have specific reference to the treatment of victims, the transparency of processes and the jurisdictional interface between military and civil law, which may lead to untimely decision-making processes. The position of Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force is appointed by the Minister for Defence under the Defence Act,. That ensures the Inspector-General is independent and free of action with respect to the chain of command in that his or her tenure does not depend on any member of the ADF. So this is an independent position.

                             professional within Defence. The review is concerned with systemic issues, not individual cases, and the review team is consulting with external experts with experience and a professional background relating to military culture and organisational performance.

                             The two reviews of concern that Senator Xenophon has raised are reviews which we think are capable of being delivered independently by the persons I have referred to. We think this is the best course in terms of conducting those reviews. As the senator knows, the other reviews are being conducted by persons from outside the ADF.

                                 I think the formal terms of refer­ence were formally released on Monday, 21 June but the scope of the review was first announced by the minister on 11 April. Further development and refinements were made in consultation with

                                 Piper. The essential scope of the review—the allega­tions of sexual and other abuse—was made public to Defence personnel in early May and more widely through a departmental media release on 21 May and subsequent national advertising of the review. I think senators would have seen those ads in the paper in recent weeks. So, while the essential scope of the review has remained unchanged, issues relevant to the review have been raised and addressed iteratively. So that is the process. The final terms of reference were released on 21 June and are publicly available.

I did have the opportunity of speaking with the Indonesian Minister for Agriculture, Mr Suswono. The meeting went well. It pro­vided both of us with an opportunity to share views about how we can return this industry as quickly as possible. When you look at the comments the minister himself made, as reported, they provide clear encouragement that we can look to the way this trade can return on a sustainable footing whilst maintaining animal welfare outcomes.

                                        The hide from the opposition in relation to this issue! The 40 per cent subsidy that they now describe was in fact a decision by the opposition, when they were in government, to move to full cost recovery within this industry. You then squibbed on the deal to return the industry to full cost recovery—a decision you made. It might have been stared down; I am not sure exactly what occurred. You then put in place a rebate in respect of this industry.

                                          Mr Dutton said, 'We would have stopped them going to those abattoirs that have been highlighted,' and later he said: 'We wouldn't have had a full suspension. We would have stopped the cattle from going to those abattoirs where we saw that horrific action.' What he does not say is that without a suspension and an opportunity to reform supply chains, this approach would not have provided animal welfare outcomes at all. Without a suspension or supply chain reform in place, it would have ensured that animals would continue to be mistreated. That is what the opposition have signed up to.

It will help business across Australia, particularly in the regions, to take advantage of the enormous online opportunities.

It examined some 13 countries responsible for 70 per cent of the world's economic growth. It found that the internet is a significant job creator. In France, for example, it has resulted in a net addition of 700,000 jobs—that is, 2.4 jobs created for every job lost. In the survey of 480,000 small and medium-sized businesses across 13 countries, 2.6 jobs were created for every one lost.

                                            It also found the internet contributed to 21 per cent of the economic growth in the last five years in advanced economies. All industries benefited from the web, and in fact small to medium-sized enterprises benefited to a disproportionately greater degree. Some 75 per cent of the economic impact was a positive result for small to medium-sized businesses.

                                                The Gillard government has a vision for Australia to become a global digital leader. This is a major economic reform. We are aiming to put Australia in the top five advanced economies by 2020 in the percentage of businesses and not-for-profit organisations using the internet. It drives productivity, it expands customer bases and it creates jobs.

We heard the demonstrators the other day down in Sydney and what they aspire to. What do my colleagues in the Senate aspire to? They aspire to a vegan society. We are about to all become vegans—we are about to transform ourselves from eating meat to being hunters and gatherers on the forest floor living on a diet of beetles and nuts!

It has been an absolute blanket insult to a whole nation to say to them that we do not differentiate between those who are doing the wrong thing and those who are doing the right thing; we just think they are all doing the wrong thing. The whole nation is doing the wrong thing.

And what do we have? We have a foreign minister who can hardly stay home. He almost needs a passport to get back into Australia. Where is he when we really need him, when we actually need him to go to work? He is here now—it is the only time we do not want him here but he is here. He has been away for 71 days. He was guiding the Arab rise and the Arab Spring. He was over there guiding the process in Libya. He was part of what was happening in Syria. He is everywhere but he is nowhere where he is needed. When something is of real import­ance to our nation, where is he? So help me—he is in the building stacking up numbers for his challenge. This is how disconnected this government has become. Everything is a reflection.

The former Prime Minister—and well may we remember that he is a former Prime Minister, especially today—before he was ceremoniously politically assassinated by his colleagues, who then ensconced a replacement who is polling at 27 per cent, is now the foreign minister and does not seem to want to stay in Australia. When we actually need him to do a job, when he actually has to go out and earn his salary, he has decided to stay home. Where is his ticker when we really need it? Where is his ticker when we need him at something that is just slightly more important than Kate's and Will's wedding? He can make it to

I hope that we are not differentiating between their right to work and ours. We have actually decided to leave them out as well. Where is it all going to finish? Indonesians now, if they wish now, can start sourcing their cattle from other places. This will do nothing to help animal husbandry.

They were quite happy to let the barbarity that they saw in those certain abattoirs continue for two months, until they could get media bang for their buck. We know that even back in January they had pictures and were discussing their plan of attack. Why didn't they do something about it in January? Why did they wait? Because this is about theatre, this is about bang for your buck, this is about transforming Australia to their nirvana—a vegan society. They want us to remove ourselves from the consumption of meat! And what do we have for this? No doubt Indonesia will look quietly across the borders at us and say: 'Australia just does not understand. Australia is completely out of touch.'

                                                         Senator Joyce concentrated on the question to Senator Ludwig, and I will touch on that briefly before I go to broader questions in question time today. Cheap quips and suggestions that we are turning into a vegan society aside, perhaps the only serious issues that Senator Joyce sought to address were those around consultation in these difficulties with live exports and Indonesia. But I do not recall the Howard government being particularly strong on consultation. I could think of countless examples of very poor behaviour and conduct. In fact, the very conduct that led the Howard government to going out of office was around its poor consultation—its very poor consultation on the

                                                         legislation, if I recall. That was the very point made the other day by Senator Minchin, I think, in his valedictory remarks.

                                                         So, if there is nothing more significant than these issues around his appraisal of poor consultation and the suggestion that Aust­ralia is turning into a vegan society, it is very hard to take Senator Joyce's comments seriously. But let me take a moment, since he was taking note of the answers to all of the questions to Senator Evans and Senator Ludwig in question time today, to appraise some of those others. I am glad to see that Senator Abetz is in the chamber at the moment, because apart from the predictable political rhetoric, as indeed Senator Evans highlighted in his response to the first question, Senator Abetz seems to suggest that the Gillard government, by setting priorities, is meant to achieve them within 12 months. We all know that priority issues such as climate change are never going to be achieved within 12 months. It is good to see that this government is attempting to deal with these issues, but suggesting that there should be any resolution within a 12-month period is just laughable.

                                                        <p>
                                                         The other priority issues raised by Senator Abetz were the mining tax and boat arrivals in Australia. I seem to remember that these have been problems for the former government. They are intractable problems, and the closest I have seen in policy terms to any resolution of these problems is indeed with the avenues being explored in the Malaysian solution. The Howard government liked to try and claim that it solved the boat problem. We know they did not. We know the number of boat arrivals that appeared over the term of the Howard government, and we know that that government did not find a satisfactory resolution. But to suggest that this is a problem that the Gillard government should have resolved within 12 months is just laughable.

                                                         We went through a range of other areas where the opposition asserted promises had been made and had not been met within 12 months. Well, I am sorry, but my assessment of today's question time, apart from the usual one, which is of tedious repetition by the coalition's questions committee, is: seriously, you are starting to look a pack of
                                                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Froot_Loops" rel="nofollow">

                                                         . Lemons have become much maligned, and the pack of Froot Loops that get up in question time in this place day in, day out cannot raise serious policy issues. This opposition really does highlight the concerns that have been raised time and time again with the Abbott leadership, which is: it is a policy-free zone. There are cheap rhetoric and questions about stabbings, killings and leadership change, when this very opposition is more vulnerable—far more vulnerable—on that issue than the government: four leaders in four years.

                                                         I would like to take this moment to remind the chamber of the last leadership change of the opposition. Climate change was the issue raised by Senator Abetz today. What was the demise of the former opposition leader about? What were the issues around which Mr Turnbull failed to continue as Leader of the Opposition? I seem to recall an enormous backflip.

                                                          I would like to take note of answers and support the motion moved by Senator Joyce, particularly with respect to answers given by Senator Evans on behalf of the government and specifically regarding the question I asked about school closures in Tasmania. The question related to the slated 20 closures of state public schools in Tasmania and the more than $13 million of

Of course, if those schools close, that is taxpayers' money gone down the gurgler. For and on behalf of Australian taxpayers, we say that money has been and will be wasted if those schools are closed.

                                                          The big question relates to the advice that has been provided by the state Minister for Education and Skills, Mr McKim, a Greens minister in the Labor-Greens coalition government that is now in a rolling crisis in Tasmania and is dudding the Tasmanian economy dreadfully. His advice to the state parliament this morning was, 'Yes, I can guarantee that not one dollar will be repaid by the state government to the federal government.' He went on to say, 'That is because those buildings were part of an investment program designed to stimulate the economy and announced 2½ years ago.' So he is saying that, because it was announced 2½ years ago, not one dollar will be going back to the federal government. He said, 'Those buildings are part of state government schools on state government land, and we will decide how to operate those schools, not the federal government.'

In fact, I have spoken to Senator Evans about this issue personally and at no time has he expressed to me that he, his department or his government have a view that we are obliged to repay the funds, so let us be very clear about that. He has not expressed those views to me.'

In the answer from Senator Evans today he made it very clear that he was looking into the matter, he would deal with each school on a case-by-case basis. He did not in any way, shape or form agree with the advice of Mr McKim, the minister for education in Tasmania, that not one dollar will be repaid by the state government to the federal government. Clearly there is a division. Clearly they are way apart in their views if the federal government is dealing with these matters on a case-by-case basis.

You have the federal Labor MPs from Tasmania saying something totally different to the state minister for education. The question is whether Senator Evans, who represents the federal minister for education, supports and agrees with the views of those federal Labor MPs from Tasmania. Clearly you have a crisis and a division between state and federal Labor. Let us make clear what the

I have always thought that Senator Joyce was disconnected from reality, but when you talk about a disconnect, how could you come this week to the Senate and ask questions of the government, and not ask a question about the biggest economic change that has been made in this country for years—that is, the

We heard from Senator Joyce that we are going to turn into a vegan society, that there is some kind of plot by the Left to turn everyone into a vegan. For anyone who has ever been to dinner with me, that would come as quite a surprise. I certainly would not want to live in a vegan society. Nevertheless, I think we have to be aware that when this ban was put on live exports it was done because of the massive response to the

Paul Kelly gave the coalition a lesson in what you need to do in terms of taking leadership positions and governing, not responding to these stunts that the Leader of the Opposition seems to be so good at. You cannot govern the country on stunts; it just does not work. You must be a leader and

                                                              I rise to take note of answers given during today's question time and to talk about a government that does not keep its promises, because it simply cannot. It is not only a weak government; it is a government that is riven by division. This government could not fight its way out of a paper bag, but they sure can fight with themselves—unfortunately demonstrated by none better than Minister Ludwig's answers today on the blanket suspension of the live cattle trade to Indonesia. This is a decision that not only jeopardises an entire industry; it also threatens to trash our diplomatic relationship with one of our nearest neighbours—one of our nearest neighbours that needs our help, not our hindrance. It is an example of an area where this government has been cowed into submission because it is a policy-free zone. It has been cowed into submission by an organised and orchestrated campaign by lobbyists. This is a government that has been caught flat-handed, flat-footed, bereft of ideas and forced into some sort of desperate action that is all pain for no gain. Blanket suspension of live cattle exports to Indonesia is pain for cattle, because cattle are probably still being treated cruelly when slaughtered daily in Indonesia. They may not be Australian cattle but they are cattle and ani­mals nonetheless. A government genuinely concerned about cruelty to animals would not take an approach that seems to say, 'Out of sight is out of mind.' This decision stands to do nothing but damage to our relationship with Indonesia.

What he failed to commit to was having consulted with the Indonesian government prior to deciding to blanket suspend live cattle trade to Indonesia. He failed to commit to that. Why? Because he did not do it. Had he done it, he should have said so today. Minister Ludwig clearly failed to consult with the Indonesian government before deciding to suspend our live cattle trade with that country. He also failed to explain to Senator Williams why he has not sought the help of his ministerial colleagues, such as former prime minister

                                                              , said of Minister Emerson that he is a rat, that he is 'friggin hopeless'—actually, big Bill Ludwig used another word, but that is pretty close to it—that he is not a team player and that he has never done his bit for anyone except his own ambition to be Prime Minister. So why would Minister Ludwig even hope to get any help from Minister Emerson, the man who Minister Ludwig's own father has said is a rat? Had Minister Ludwig gone to his colleague Minister Emerson, he hardly would have got a helping hand. This is a government that is riven by division, a government that is breaking its promises to govern the country because it is a government that cannot govern itself.

                                                               That is totally untrue. I was never a mover against Kevin's Rudd leadership as Prime Minister. I have never spoken publicly about this, but I am forced to do so now. Everybody on my side and I think many in this parliament know where I stood in regard to that issue. This is not the first time that Peter van Onselen has written something about me that is incorrect. It seems to be an increasing habit. The journalist makes statements in the media without even bothering with the courtesy of ringing the individuals concerned.

                                                                has been an important component of Australia's growth in the past and will continue to make a positive contribution to Australia's economic growth and prosperity in the future. This is because Australia's domestic savings are not sufficient to meet the demands of domestic business for investment funds. Foreign capital represents the necessary call on overseas resources that fill this gap. It contributes to our capacity to develop and improve living standards.

Our assessment was that Australia's existing regime was already well-placed to deal with any national interest concerns arising from such investments.

These were updated and expanded in June 2010 when, as part of the release of the Government's Foreign Investment Policy, the Government explained the national interest considerations for all investment proposals to buy Australian businesses or companies. For foreign governments and related entities, these considerations emphasise independence and commerciality.

This strategy should also provide additional information about how foreign investment decisions are made and provide information about the emergence of sovereign wealth funds and state-owned entities internationally.

The first task that FIRB undertook was to draft an easy-to-read version of the Foreign Investment Policy for prospective investors. The Government released that new Policy on 30 June 2010.

FIRB has also rolled out a new stakeholder awareness program to educate and disseminate information to individuals and organisations affected directly and indirectly by the Government's Foreign Investment Policy.

This information is valuable in analysing the effectiveness of the skilled selection and assessment processes.

While the assessing authorities charge fees for skills assessment on a not-for-profit basis, the fees charged are at the discretion of the individual assessing authorities.

The review resulted in the development of a new points test to come into effect from 1 July 2011. The employer-sponsored temporary and permanent migration arrangements continue to provide a framework for meeting skill shortages which cannot be met through domestic employment and training.

The new monitoring approach has formalised the liaison and support role by including an annual conference and ongoing contact by Departmental officers with assessing authorities.

To this end, DEEWR has developed a regular newsletter that is sent to assessing authorities every two months. DEEWR also convenes an annual conference to inform assessing authorities of changes in policy impacting on their work. Attendees and presenters include assessing authorities and key Government departments, including DIAC. The new monitoring and support initiatives have been predicated on the need to improve further communication flows with assessing authorities.

As an example, in the lead up to the change to the Points Test to be implemented from 1 July 2011, DIAC officers have visited or teleconferenced with all assessing authorities and held a conference to discuss the policy changes.

While the majority of users of the website are potential skilled migrants who are required to have good English language skills to be accepted for migration, people with lower English skills are assisted to use the ASRI website through a summary of its purpose and function in seven major community languages – Arabic, Chinese, Dari, Hindi, Indonesian, Korean and Vietnamese. These are the top languages in common across the Skill and Family Streams and the Humanitarian Programme. These translated summaries allow non-English speakers to identify whether the ASRI website could be of use to them and then engage the assistance of an interpreter if necessary to find information relevant to them. It would not be practical to provide translation of all material on the website as the site comprises many thousands of pages of content.

This morning we understood that this bill would be proceeding under difficult time constraints. The bill has not been concluded. Senators were speaking on the bill for lengthy times. We asked in the whips meeting under the private senators' bills arrangements if we could time manage this bill. This was denied. We believe this bill is of considerable importance and we would like to facilitate the passage of this bill through all stages today.

As you have notified the Senate, Mr Deputy President, Senator Fifield has withdrawn the matter of public importance that was listed for this afternoon in this time slot that we are now speaking in. That motion was withdrawn in consideration of the one hour that would then ensue with this debate. In fact, it may be completed in less than one hour if we can have a time managed debate, which is what we have been seeking from the moment this bill has appeared on the

                                                                        </a>

This is a bill that the coalition has put forward. We accept that the bill may or may not be passed; that is not the issue. The issue is that we want a bill that is a private senator's bill completed. We want to test the bill on the floor of the chamber. The only way we can do this and effect this bill is by debating this bill today.
                                                                       </p>
                                                                       <p>
                                                                        I understand from my colleagues that this bill has a time-sensitive aspect—there are some 1 July matters that are impacted by this bill. There are some amendments that Senator Boswell wanted to put forward. We would like to facilitate those amendments going through. Once the bill, in its amended or unamended form, is completed, we would like all stages finished and the bill concluded this afternoon. We are being very generous with our time and our management of this process. We did have an agreement that we would split the time of the private senators' business this morning by allowing, in the two hours and 20 minutes that is allocated, one hour and 10 minutes for Senator Xenophon and one hour and 10 minutes for us. That was an agreement whereby we divided our time, as discussed in our normal whips meetings. This did not eventuate this morning. Senator Xenophon's bill went over­time slightly. There were senators speaking on the bill who, I am sure, had genuine interest, but it was a little bit dispro­portionate. There were a number of additional Labor senators scheduled to speak compared to the opposition.
                                                                       </p>
                                                                       <p>
                                                                        Again, we indicated that we would like speakers to be kept to a minimum to enable that bill to progress—allowing sufficient debate—and Senator McLucas in the committee stage did ask some detailed and probing questions which were answered quite well, I think, by Senator Xenophon supported by the Greens. If private senators' business time will not facilitate the carriage of a bill through to its final stages—again, not determining the outcome of the bill but allowing the bill to reach its final stage so that we can vote upon the bill—then we are wasting our time by having private senators' bills debated without a logical conclusion.
                                                                       </p>
                                                                       <p>
                                                                        The whips meetings have been very congenial in many respects in allowing many matters to take place. We would agree that under private senators' bills arrangements that, if there are more complex matters, we would allow longer debate. We get one shot at this every sitting Thursday, and some of these bills could then roll over into consecutive Thursdays. So it may take several weeks to get a private senator's bill passed through the chamber. They are the issues that we are concerned about in relation to the process, and I would urge all senators to support us in facilitating one hour of debate for this private senator's bill.

                                                                        </p>

Notwithstanding that, it spoils what were very meaningful discussions about how we could have private senators' bills dealt with at a particular time by an arrangement between the parties to ensure that private senators could bring bills forward into this place, have them dealt with sensibly and appropriately during that period and have them brought to a vote, as we saw this morning with the palm oil bill. It was brought to a vote, which then allowed that debate to be had. In the past, it could only happen in general business or, alternatively, through this process. So the government, opposition and other people sought—and I think Senator Bob Brown wants the credit; I do not mind who gets the credit—time to allow private senators' bills to be debated. We have agreed to that, with quite generous time being allowed for that process each week. The next time we come back here, if the opposition, the Greens or the Senate want to debate Senator Boswell's bill they can. If it is not his time slot then he can debate his private senator's bill in the following week.
                                                                        </p>

Why? Because he is a spoiler. That is the only thing I can think of, quite frankly. He wants to spoil the process of having private senators' business dealt with on a Thursday morning, the appropriate time, and allowing parties to come to a concluded view, because it is all about you, Senator Boswell. It is all about you, because you think you take urgency, you take precedence, over everything else—

It is an outrageous suggestion. This government does not agree with it. Senators should not agree with it. Private senators' business should be confined to where it is. In addition, the opposition has effectively said that it would gag and guillotine the debate to allow Senator Boswell's bill to be dealt with. It is effectively saying to the Senate, 'We accept a confined debate,' notwithstanding others may want to make a contribution to the debate. But, no, Senator Boswell will then say: 'I don't want people to speak on this for very long because I want it brought to a vote. I want to have a vote in relation to this bill. I want to cut people off. I want to gag them so that I can have my way.' It is very selfish, in my poor view, to have that opinion. But it does seem that Senator Boswell is saying that to the Senate.

It is not well thought out. It is not a clever plan. It is simply an outrageous stunt from those on the opposite side, and it should be called as such. Quite frankly, they should withdraw it and not proceed with it.

We have already given the government some other time today—an extra couple of hours—so that they can get their own legislation debated. It is interesting that they bring their appropriations bills on late on the last night of the sitting. This is so that it is unlikely that people will want to speak to the appropriations bill, but that is going to happen tonight.
                                                                           </p>

I do acknowledge Senator Boswell's passion for this piece of legislation, but it does happen to have my name on it, Senator Ludwig—as you leave the chamber. It is quite a simple mechanism. It is not an unusual mechanism to be seen in legislation. In my experience, it is very, very responsibly used. In fact, one interesting piece of evidence that came to the Senate inquiry was from a former Labor speaker in the Victorian parliament, whose view was quite strongly that this legislation should be supported, because one thing that a disallowance provision does is promote proper consultation. If the government is guilty of anything in the development of its marine protected areas it is its failure to properly consult. This has been abysmal to the extent where it was a major issue at the last election—and perhaps that is why the government does not want this piece of legislation debated. There were attempts through the committee stage to put this bill off to report without there being any opportunity for us to debate it in private members' business. I have to thank Senator Cameron for at least conceding that we could get it reported last week, but there were attempts to push it back beyond this week. It is quite an important piece of legislation. We are talking about impacting on a significant area of Australia's marine environment. Senator Siewert seemed to imply that we were against marine protected areas. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, after the evidence to the inquiry presented by the

Indeed, I had a personal involvement with the south-east marine protected areas. When we undertook a process after the draft maps were released, and the Greens and the media all said that we were going to try to shrink it, we actually delivered 20 per cent more area. We delivered 20 per cent more area than the department put up, but we actually reduced the impact on industry by 90 per cent.

The report said that 50 per cent of the south-west zone needed to be locked up, based on the science in this report, to effectively protect marine stocks and ecosystems in the south-west. We then find in the fine print that 50 per cent is an input to the report, not an output to the model. That is the sort of thing that we need the opportunity to be able to investigate and have a look at. It is absolute rubbish.
                                                                           </p>

We support the process of them being done responsibly and with proper consultation. But we do believe that the parliament should have the opportunity if there are problems with the consultation process and within the system to deal with those problems. To that extent, when I discovered that there was an error and some concerns about the drafting of the legislation, I wrote to the committee before inquiry. I put that on the table before the inquiry so that the committee could actually deal with that. Yet during the inquiry it was very difficult to get the chair to actually focus on it. I think we have been really upfront about this all the way through, and I think it is reasonable that we get the opportunity to debate this properly and have it put to a vote in this chamber.

In fact, as I recollect, it was the previous week that they were due to have a slot on a program—the whole slot. Senator Xenophon was very generous in giving up some of the time for this morning's debate to start the debate on this particular bill.
                                                                            </p>

It is because they know very well what is about to happen in the Senate as of 30 June. So do not pretend anything else; that is exactly why you want to do it. All this talk that it is time dependent on 1 July is nonsense. Admit why it is time dependent. It is not because there are time dependent divisions in the legis­lation. Be honest: you got the drafting wrong and that is why you had to make amendments. The original drafter of the bill tried to amend the wrong piece of the

                                                                            </p>

We all agreed that it should be reported and not pushed out beyond July. We all agreed at that discussion in the committee. As to the comments that Senator Colbeck made in terms of consultation, I think that I went through this pretty clearly this morning when I spoke about the extended period of consultation that had been occurring around the south-east process—during which time the coalition was in government—and the very extensive consultation process that is going on in the south-west areas.
                                                                            </p>

                                                                             If it sounds like I am backing up the government there, I do not want them to think that we are happy with the plans. We are on the record saying, 'No; we think it needs to improve.' But we do think that there has been a lot of consultation with every stakeholder. As for the backlash during the election, we know very well who was stirring up a whole lot of that. The untruths and misrepresentations of various people's positions that were articulated were outrageous—for example, about the Greens' position on fisheries. There were outlandish statements being made that we want to ban fisheries—which is so far from the truth; it is nonsense. We are the ones who care about the future of fishing because we are the ones who believe we should have adequate marine protected areas so that fisheries can be protected for the long term. In fact, since having that debate this morning, I received an email that once again highlighted the peril that our oceans and our fisheries are in.
                                                                            </p>

The fact is that at the moment the act allows a lot of consultation. The management plans are disallowable instruments. In fact, you used that measure yourselves—and I am obviously referring to the coalition—to try to disallow the process for the
                                                                             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_Sea" rel="nofollow">

It did not get through, but you made use of that process yourselves as a disallowable instrument for the zoning of the management plans. So the ability to have the debate in here quite plainly works.
                                                                            </p>

When all that process is negotiated you want to then come in and circumvent that and make it a political process so that certain people in the community—and I am not pointing any fingers here—can tell mistruths and half truths about what impact those particular zonings have and say that it will stop fisheries forever and that certain people want to ban fisheries, which is nonsense. That is what will happen if you try to do that with marine protected areas.
                                                                            </p>

Now, all of a sudden, it is changing, because 11 years down the track those provisions are finally starting to be used to get some conservation outcomes and a proper planning process. This talk about bioregional plans and the planning process delivering uncertainty is nonsense. They deliver certainty because there has been extensive com­mittee consultation and everybody knows where the lines are drawn. That is certainty; it is not uncertainty. What you want to do is further destabilise the process.

What I am going to say is that this needs to be debated, because there are four million blue-collar workers who normally vote for Labor. I will read one of the submissions to the committee again. It should be absolutely compulsory reading for everyone in the Labor Party. The Labor Party is getting ripped to pieces. This is just a classic example of why you have to listen to the people, and you do not. The vote is dividing now, at 27 per cent, and the people who want those bioregional zones, in the form that they are, are voting for the Greens. The four million people who fish and normally vote Labor are coming over to us, and that is why we won every seat down the east coast of Australia, in Queensland. You ignore this at your peril and you continue to ignore it.
                                                                             </p>

The minister, Mr Burke, has the power of life and death over fishing, mining, boating and anything that happens in those zones, and he can do what he likes. This bill does not want to ban bioregions—not at all. It is saying: give the parliament a vote; let the parliament have the right of disallowance. It is the same in every declaration, bar this particular one.

Out of those 31 there would have been 28 that represented professional fishermen or boat users, such as the Cairns Professional Game Fishing Association and the Haines Group, which provides boats. The boating industry is worried; it is in the doldrums because of all the closures that are going on. I will read from Cameron Talbot's submission. It is an absolute cry in the wilderness from a Labor voter. He said:

The Department does not consult us or simply ignores what we have to say. I feel that democracy has been lost and further more my faith in the Labour party has gone with it. I along with all labour supporters that I know who also fish, are so disenfranchised with this government that at the next election we will do what I never thought we would and vote

We'll tell you what we're going to do, and if you don't like it don't worry about it. But, if you're on the Pew group or if you're on a green group, you get the ear of the minister.' This is what the four million people are saying: 'We want the same rights as Pew. We want the same rights as the World Wildlife Fund. That is what we want and we're not getting it. We voted for the Labor Party, but we're not going to do it anymore.' You are going to be torn to pieces and you should understand this, but you keep walking into the fire.

It is not the appropriate time to be debating a private senator's bill now when the Senate is in the last hours of the last day of the last sitting week of June and there is significant government legislation that needs to be debated, including the incredibly important appropriation bills and other time-critical legislation that has to be implemented by 1 July.
                                                                                 </p>

People listening should be well aware that this is a stunt by the coalition to try to force something to happen with this bill.
                                                                                 </p>

I admire Senator Colbeck's dedication to this issue. He is usually a very reasoned and thoughtful contributor to debates and was a good participant in the Senate committee. He is right. It is significant legislation and it should be given the dignity of significant legislation and be allowed to be debated in full, and the debate should be able to be contributed to by all senators who want to make a contribution to it.
                                                                                 </p>

I participated in the inquiry on this bill and I have been walking around all day with my speech ready to give. But I was prepared to give it in private senators' bills time. Now is not the time for me to be making a speech about this bioregional plans bill—and I know that there are government senators who also wanted to contribute, because we understand how important it is.
                                                                                 </p>

                                                                                 </p>

There was never an agreement that that would happen. There was an agreement that there should be private senators' bills time, and in fact in that time we have seen a number of government bills brought to the vote including, I clearly remember, a vote on the Defence Force retirement incomes bill. I clearly remember a vote on Senator Nash's social security legislation, and I clearly remember a vote just this morning on Senator Xenophon's palm oil bill. So it is outrageous for the coalition to claim that somehow the govern­ment is not allowing private senators' bills to be debated to fulfilment. It has happened and it will continue to happen.

The bill also makes changes to the way people are assessed for the disability support pension, creating a two-speed, two-track process for

This freeze includes both the basic amount of family income of $94,316 and the additional amount for each FTB child after the first $3,796. What this means is that families in which both partners work and earn average incomes of $50,000 to $60,000 each will be affected by the government's measures. Many of the families that will be affected by the FTB freeze in this bill are struggling to make ends meet on a mere $45,000 a year. The rate of indexation for the family tax benefit part B income limit, the baby bonus income limit and the FTB A and B supplements will also be frozen for three years from 1 July 2011.

She disclosed that confidential government emails showed that the Labor government had been planning to freeze indexation well before the last election. Not only had the government been planning to slug Australian families with a carbon tax despite vowing not to; they had been planning to slug ordinary Australian families through this freeze since before the last election.
                                                                                        </p>

What I discovered was that Minister Macklin's office had sought and received advice on freezing the family benefits in this bill as early as January 2010 and had updated advice as late as one minute before the caretaker provisions commenced. The email that was sent to Minister Macklin's office advised that the department had completed 'a new version of the spreadsheet with updated numbers for the pause supplements option'. As I mentioned, this email advice was received one minute prior to the caretaker period coming into effect.

The government did not give the Australian people the opportunity to cast a ballot, to give their verdict, on the merits of the particular proposal. This again represents the government being less than straightforward with the Australian public, as was the case with the carbon tax.
                                                                                        </p>

I cannot help but wonder whether Senator-elect Rhiannon, before she takes her seat in this place, will, for example, submit her boycott, divestment and sanctions policy for costing and consideration—or, for that matter, whether the Greens policies currently being costed by the government include their policy on reintroducing death duties. I guess time will tell.
                                                                                        </p>

They will be hit by these changes. Unfortunately, the government is seeking to give the impression that these families are rich families when many, many, many of them are anything but rich. Indeed, over 2.1 million families will lose some support as a result of the real value of the FTB supplement being cut. That is the 'pause supplements option' that appeared in the email that the government received a minute before the caretaker period started before the last election.

They have risen by an average of 51 per cent across Australia since December 2007. The overall cost of food has increased by 13 per cent and education costs such as school fees have increased by an average of 24 per cent across Australia.

Labor should not be using these sorts of measures to search for savings to accommodate what has been an incredibly reckless period of fiscal management by this government.

This measure will extend the commencement date for indexation of the paid parental leave income limit to 1 July 2014. As I understand it, the aim of this schedule is to maintain some consistency with the pause in indexation for the baby bonus income limit under the Family Assistance Act.

I should point out firstly that the elements found in this schedule first appeared in the 2010-11 budget under the heading 'Job capacity assessment: more efficient and accurate assessments for disability support pension and employment services.' Under that measure, DSP claimants without sufficient evidence of future work capacity of less than 15 hours per week could be referred to an alternative income support payment. Others may be offered employment assistance through

They were to come into effect on the same day. Presum­ably, the government believed that there was a legitimate need for alignment between these two reform measures. I doubt that the alignment between the two measures was part of a government commitment to a policy-making aesthetic; I am sure that there was a reason for having them in alignment. The 2011-12 budget measure Building Australia's Future Workforce, the imple­mentation of more efficient and accurate assessments for disability support pension, brings forward the implementation of the 2010-11 measure from 1 January 2012 to 3 September 2011. This measure was originally in alignment with the new impair­ment tables, and I would be interested to hear the government's rationale now for the decoupling of those measures.
                                                                                        </p>

What this will do, as I touched on briefly before, is create a two-track, two-speed assessment process which will have some similarities to reforms in the United Kingdom. One group will go through a more thorough testing of their capacity to work, as a result of these changes, and if they still satisfy the relevant criteria they will go on to the DSP; if not, they will be offered an alternative income support payment like Newstart.

The Cape York Welfare Reform trial is a partnership between a number of communities on Cape York, the Australian and Queensland governments and the Cape York Institute for Policy and Leadership, which has done so much good work in this area. The intention is to restore local Indigenous authority, to support the local community, to increase individual engagement in the real economy and to reinforce and restore positive social norms.

These com­missioners will hold conferences with com­munity members, refer people to support services and, when necessary, arrange income management for people who need it. They will help provide a better social fabric for these communities in need. At present, a person can only be subject to income management under the trial after a decision by the Family Responsibilities Commission made before 1 January 2012. This schedule pushes the date out to 1 January 2013, to enable income management to continue in Cape York for a further 12 months.

This is a matter that the government was clearly examining, anticipating and intending to introduce before the last federal election. Key changes to public policy, such as the freeze and such as the intention to introduce a carbon tax despite telling the Australian people the opposite, go to the democratic deficit in the current government. This government is really starting to put serious pressure on the compact of trust that there should be between an elected government and the voting public. This is yet another deeply disappointing example of that growing trend in this government to say one thing and do another—or to say nothing to hide an intention and then to reveal it after an election.
                                                                                        </p>

                                                                                         There are also some significant changes to the disability support pension. I know that I and a number of colleagues on this side, including Senator Boyce, will be very carefully monitoring how these play out in the lives of the Australians who rely on these benefits and who need to go through these processes. Obviously, we all want to do whatever we can to encourage people and support them in moving from payments back into the workforce. The government has spoken of that as well—there has been plenty of rhetoric around that—but we will have to wait and see and examine what the real effect of these particular measures are. I indicate that the coalition will not be opposing this bill.

There are many reasons why we have some concerns with particular aspects of the bill. Not only does it cut costs at the expense of low-income families and people with disabilities but it has been rushed through this place without adequate time for proper consultation or consideration of the detail. I will go into some of those concerns shortly. We are particularly concerned with schedule 2, which is freezing the indexation of the

On the supplements, freezing of indexation will impact on 629,000 recipients of family tax benefit and income support. It will impact on additional families on low wages and the working poor. But, although I asked for those figures, unfortunately they were not provided. They were provided in terms of those numbers on income support, which was, as I said, 629,000. So it will be impacting on more families that are on a low income.
                                                                                         </p>

These families often use the supplements for large-sum expenses, such as appliance repair, bonds, moving house and car registration.

                                                                                         </p>

One of the measures the govern­ment announced in the budget was to change the age of dependants at which parents transfer out of parenting payment (single) and on to Newstart from 16 to 12. That will drop their income $56 a week. If you factor in this measure as well, you start to have an impact on families.
                                                                                         </p>

                                                                                          I asked the government on two occasions, first at estimates and then at the inquiry to this bill: what are the calculations for the cumulative impact of all these budget measures on Australian families, in particular low-income families and those on income support? As yet, I have not received that piece of information. In fact, I was quite shocked that the government had not done that calculation. I asked what the overall impact of all the different measures the government wants to implement through the budget measures is, and they could not tell me. So we are extremely concerned about the impact on low-income families of that particular measure. Of course, if you receive FTB A and FTB B you will cop a double impact through these measures. So we do not support that particular measure, and I have several amendments, one of which is to take that particular schedule out of the bill altogether and, if that does not succeed, to try and make sure that the lowest income families are quarantined from this measure. I will talk about that more in committee.

This requires people with disabilities to prove their incapacity to work by participating in training or work related activities, the new definition of that program of support before they are eligible for

For a start, the method of determining serious disability is an issue. To be determined to have a severe disability is essential for exemption from the lengthy program of support requirement. It is far too narrow. To be judged to have a severe impairment a person must—and I am taking this on my understanding of the ME—be assigned an impairment rating of 20 points or more under a single, and this is very important, impairment table. This means that a person with co-occurring disorders may not be classified—I say 'may' because they may have multiply occurring disorders where one of them is above 20 points on one table. If that is not the circumstance and they have co-occurring disorders they will not be classified as having a severe impairment unless one or both of the disorders rates above 20 under a single table.

A person with two or more moderate level disorders occurring across the tables when combined could result in a total equivalent of a severe impairment, when you combine substance, mental and physical disorders. The current amendment does not allow for cumulative totals across the tables and therefore does not take account of co-occurring disorders.

Episodic symptoms can often be misinter­preted as noncompliance. If a person is assessed when they are functioning at a healthy or high level, they will not be deemed to be severely impaired. It is unclear what will happen if they later down the line become unwell and are not able to participate in a program of support. According to the evidence given at the hearing, there was no information provided about the right to appeal or to be reassessed.
                                                                                         </p>

I must say that I knew that already, and that is the problem. It is clear that if the only qualifying factor for severe disabilities is 20 points under one table and there is no discretion to assess this, many people could be placed on a program who would not be able to derive any benefit from it. In fact, it will have even greater negative impact on those people.
                                                                                         </p>

It is encouraging that the department considers these factors, but they do not provide much reassurance without this being in the legislation. Finally, it has been very difficult to fully evaluate concerns relating to severe impairment when not only are there are revised impairment tables not completed yet, but the process of current review has not been made public. The speed with which this bill is being pushed through indicates the bringing forward of the start date is clearly only a cost-saving measure designed to cut $49 million out of the budget and makes little sense when the very tables designed to be used in implementing the measure have not yet been completed.

Considering the impact of these measures on people with disabilities, 'probably' is not acceptable. There is no time limit in the legislation, and the length of participation would appear to be at the discretion of the government. It is also unclear what exactly the program of support contains. Some information was provided by FaCHSIA at the inquiry, but no detailed information is in the legislation. Such measures, which have such massive potential impact on vulnerable people, need to be subject to parliamentary review and public scrutiny. They should not be at ministerial discretion.
                                                                                         </p>

At the inquiry I tried to get some concrete numbers on how many people this measure would impact and then, specifically, on how many would eventually end up on DSP after initially being rejected—because, basically, everybody is going to be rejected when they apply, other than those who meet the criteria that I have already outlined about a severe impairment and 20 points on one table. During the hearing the department stated that 3,000 of the 6,000 people rejected between September 2011 and January 2012 would eventually end up on DSP. This equates to over half the applicants who should be on DSP ending up on Newstart.
                                                                                         </p>

It will not help; it will actually probably make them feel even worse, because for 18 months or whatever period of time they will have failed in a participation program—but the government will have managed to save 128 bucks a week for 18 months for 3,400 people. That is what it is about: people who should be on DSP from the beginning who will just sit on Newstart with worse taper rates—and I will come back to the taper rates. The government have acknowledged that taper rates are a barrier to people getting work on DSP. They have made moves to fix that and I congratulate them on that, but they have not fixed it for people with disabilities who are on Newstart.
                                                                                         </p>

I could not find where the 6,000 or the 3,400 comes from, because the subsequent figures that we were given in answer to a question on notice was, I think, around 2,900 people who would then go onto DSP in 2011-12. But at the hearings they said there would be 3,400 just in the first period. So I found that a little bit confusing and it has not been cleared up. Perhaps it could be cleared up during the committee process. However, even those figures that we were given subsequently showed that by 2014 over a third of the yearly applicants would eventually end up on DSP. Again, this is a savings measure.
                                                                                         </p>

                                                                                          These findings are not surprising, considering the impact of other punitive measures. Six months after the first DSP applicants were put onto Newstart as part of the Welfare to Work reforms, less than one-fifth of them were off income support and in paid employment. We believe it is unacceptable for the government to continue down this punitive path when its effectiveness has not been proven. You are setting people up to fail, and it is not the way you encourage people into work. We believe that these figures indicate that this is essentially a cost saving exercise at the expense of those people with a disability.
                                                                                         </p>

Eighteen months of trying and not succeeding in training or work related activity could be extremely damaging to already vulnerable people, and we believe it is unnecessarily cruel. People with disability who are placed on Newstart will suffer significant financial hardship as a result of this, as ACOSS made comment on in its submission.
                                                                                         </p>

                                                                                          Since the alternative payment, Newstart allowance, is at least $128 per week less than the pension, the bill would deprive the majority of applicants—those with low employment prospects who still have an ongoing need for income support—of additional income to help them meet basic living expenses. At $237 per week for a single adult, the Newstart allowance is inadequate to pay for the essentials of life. Given that most people with a disability face additional costs—for example, transport and medication—and will occur additional costs such as travel costs when participating in a program of support, it is likely that many applicants would struggle financially until such time as they either secure employment or are granted a pension. People placed on Newstart instead of DSP are subject to a double disadvantage. Not only do they receive $128 a week less but also they are subject to the higher taper rates. This barrier to work is ironic considering the government's aim to encourage people with disabilities to engage in the workforce. It is interesting to note, as I said earlier, that this is one of the barriers that has been addressed by the government by lowering the taper rate for those on DSP. Now we have this bill which puts more people on lower payments and higher taper rates. I am really unclear as to how they think they are going to meet the aim of encouraging more people with a disability into work.

It was unclear during the inquiry how the providers would be required to contribute to the ongoing DSP qualification assessment process and how and when they would provide information as to whether people were not coping in the process. There will be an increased workload for the providers. Mr Baker from the

I am aware that those budget figures have changed again, but he was saying that he was extremely concerned about whether they would be able to cope with the extra workload and provide quality support. It is unclear how and when reassessment for DSP will take place, and I have ongoing concerns about the assessment process. There is ambiguity about how long a person will have to be on the program of support, what criteria will be used, if and when people will be reassessed to go on DSP and what role the job service providers will play in that decision.
                                                                                         </p>
                                                                                         <p>
                                                                                          Finally, I greatly object to the way in which this bill has been rushed through this place. It is clearly designed to save $49.7 million at the cost of people with disabilities. There has been inadequate time for community organisations to get involved in this legislation, to express their opinion and for them to consult low-income families and people with disabilities. We are greatly concerned about this. This is a substantial change for people with disabilities, and we are deeply concerned that it is being rushed through in this manner. It is unclear how the government will be ready to roll this out in a matter of months, particularly when you consider the issue of the impairment tables. We do not believe that this schedule should proceed.
                                                                                         </p>
                                                                                         <p>
                                                                                          As I articulated earlier, I have some amendments that I have circulated. We believe that the bill should be divided and that schedule 2 item 2, which is the indexation of
                                                                                          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBT" rel="nofollow">

Given the way that this process has been rushed through, I believe there would be room to amend schedule 3 to make it more acceptable and to genuinely help people on DSP. This is going to have massive unintended consequences for those living with disabilities. You have rushed this through. It is going to unnecessarily impact on those living with a disability. It will not help them. It will hinder them purely to save $128 a week from somebody who should have been on DSP and is placed on Newstart. There are more creative ways of helping people find work than this.

It is incredible that they cannot seem to get anything organised when it involves timing. What is particularly serious in regard to this particular piece of legislation is the very severe vulnerability of the people that it affects. As Senator Fifield pointed out, we will not be opposing this legislation—it is a government budget measure—but we will be watching very carefully. It is a small example of how poorly this legislation has been thought through, developed and put into parliament that the government's own members of the Community Affairs Committee which had a speed-read—you could not call it an inquiry—of the bill recommend that '… an Advisory Group engaging community organisations be established to work with government on the implementation of the

What a great shame that they could not quite manage to set up an advisory group to look at implementation of DSP changes before they put this legislation through, before they ended up with so many ridiculous and possibly very serious unintended conse­quences which will come from this legislation. Every one of the seven submitters to our inquiry on this legislation made the point that it had been rushed through, that there was no time to put together a real submission, and raised questions about what was proposed. In fact, some demonstrated a misunderstanding of what was proposed—not because they do not have expertise in the field but because of the complete lack of information from the government on the point. We even had the very bizarre situation of Minister Macklin writing to a witness, after the inquiry—the speed read—had finished, to try to correct some of the information. This is the information that should be in regulations. It is information that should be available to people. We went through some of the most ridiculous inquiries, and all we have ended up with is, 'Take it on faith from me,' says Minister Macklin about a number of issues that are very, very concerning to a lot of people in this area.

Can we think about these people. Firstly, they have been grandfathered since 2006. They are sole parents. There is a requirement on them already that they seek to work for up to 15 hours a week. They have all been in this situation since at least 2006. Let us think about why these 25,000 parents might not yet be employed for up to 15 hours a week. I do not think it is going to be because they have not tried to get a job. Could it be because there are not jobs available to suit their skills? Could it be because they have a disability or a dependant with a disability? Could it be because of a chronic illness? We have a system that has encouraged these sole parents into work. They are supposed to be working up to 15 hours a week; they are not. So what does this government do? They do not go out and try to find out why; they just change the rules for people who have been grandfathered. Fifty-six dollars a week is a significant amount of money for those sole parents. Every

                                                                                           </p>

I must admit that I have to agree with Senator Siewert that so many of these measures just seem to be a 'Quick, what's a way to save some money.' From July, these young people would lose access to Newstart and stay on youth allowance for a year after their 21st birthday. They are anticipating that over four years they will save $184 million with this, but it is a cut of $43 a week for young unemployed people living independently of their parents. It is just bizarre that yet again we have another very vulnerable group who have been targeted by this government to achieve some savings. The learn or earn requirements certainly are something that we would espouse. It is something that has been espoused and has been applied, but the sudden change in age and the sudden requirement that this move up: what is it designed to do? Send young unemployed young people who are not at university back home? Gee, that is great, if they have got a home to go to. Did we think about some of the reasons why this group in particular might be people who are not living at home? There have got to be other issues here, as there are in the area of the sole parents who have had a requirement to work since 2006 and yet have still not made it.
                                                                                           </p>

I would like the government to seriously consider whether they can delay the introduction of this measure until they have had a look at the impacts of it and any potential benefits. Senator Siewert talked a little about the figures on how much this is going to save the government and that it seems quite strange. They seem to be not only quite strange but also quite cruel. The government talks about encouraging people into work by providing programs of support, but let us look at the way this scheme has been engineered to work. You apply for a disability support pension. According to various figures, between 6,000 and 18,000 people a year who apply will be told, 'No, you cannot have disability support pension. Give us evidence about your capacity to work.' The way to get the disability support pension, of course, is to fail in having a capacity to work. This is a fantastic way to talk about creating dignity for people by giving them jobs. Instead of setting up a system that allows people to work to the best of their ability and receive a disability support pension depending on the level of work that they can achieve and their costs, what we have here is the appalling and disgusting situation of people being set up to fail. You apply for the disability support pension. You get knocked back. You are encouraged to undertake a program of support—whatever the heck that is, because no definition has yet been provided, although some ideas about what it might be were given to us during the speedy inquiry. You undertake this program of support. If you fail the program of support, then you can reapply for the disability support pension. And that is exactly what the figures that the department has given us are supposed to demonstrate: that they are expecting a high failure rate on capacity to work.
                                                                                           </p>
                                                                                           <p>
                                                                                            As I understand it—as Senator Siewert said earlier, we have seen several lots of figures—the government is expecting that between September this year, the new early start date, and January 2012 there will be 6,000 people rejected for the disability support pension. But, over the subsequent 12 months, 3,400 of those 6,000 will end up being eligible for the disability support pension. More than half of them will have gone through the little hoops and jumped into whatever program of support they have been told to go to. And then they will be told, 'Sorry, you don't have a capacity to work. You can reapply for a disability support pension.' All this does is save the government $128 a week.
                                                                                           </p>
                                                                                           <p>
                                                                                            One presumes that this more than 50 per cent case is based on the current impairment tables which will be used between September and 1 January, when the new impairment tables, which no-one has yet seen, will come into force—another brilliant move on the part of this government. What allegedly will happen in 2011-12 is that nearly 15,000 people will be initially rejected, and almost 3,000 of those will end up on DSP. And these figures continue to go up. But what is particularly worrying is that in 2013-14 and 2014-15 we will end up with 7,500 people eventually going onto DSP, despite the fact that around 18,000 people will have applied. So in the last two years of this estimates period, one-third of the people who apply and are rejected the first time will get the little badge the second time—after they have failed programs of support—according to the figures that we have been given. As I said, I am appalled that such a program could have been engineered in this way, to set people up for failure.
                                                                                           </p>
                                                                                           <p>
                                                                                            As Senator Siewert also mentioned, there is the extremely worrying issue that there are no time frames whatsoever within this. We are told that the longest job building capacity program goes for 18 months. I think the suggestion was that that is some sort of an end figure to put on it. But these figures suggest people are coming on and off within 12-month periods. We are told there are 13-week courses. There is nothing here that would suggest that you could not be sent from one program of support to another program of support and to another program of support by the government. If we have people rushing around on wheels, why not put them on several wheels and see what happens?
                                                                                           </p>
                                                                                           <p>

But this piece of legislation—which has been brought forward, which is being rushed through, of which there is no detail and which appears to have been engineered simply to save money and hurt vulnerable people at the same time—is not worthy of anybody who would call themselves a government in this country.
                                                                                           </p>

The unintended conse­quences of it could be horrific. We will be there. I hope we do not get the chance to say, 'I told you so,' but I am less than confident that that will not be the case.

This legislation was passed by the House of Representatives yesterday—and again I thank the opposition for their support. The government is a strong supporter of the family payment system and has added to the system since coming to government: through the 50 per cent childcare rebate; Australia's first national paid parental leave scheme; the education tax refund, which in this budget includes school uniforms from 1 July; and, in this year's budget, substantial increases to family payments for families with older teenagers in secondary education. The government also believes in a sustainable and targeted family payment system that will continue to support Australian families for many years to come.
                                                                                            </p>
                                                                                            <p>
                                                                                             This bill delivers a number of measures to help make the family payment system more sustainable for the long term. The first measure lowers the maximum child age of eligibility for family tax benefit part A from 24 to 21 from 1 July 2012. This change will bring family tax benefit part A into line with the reduction in the youth allowance age of independence from 1 July 2012. This will ensure that the family payment system continues to support families while the dependent children are in study or training, while recognising that young people aged 22 and over are considered independent. The second measure builds on reforms announced in the 2009-10 budget that better targeted the family payment system to focus on low- and middle-income families. In the 2009-10 budget, indexation on the upper income limits for family tax benefit parts A and B and the baby bonus was paused. This bill will extend indexation pauses on higher income limits for some family assistance payments for a further two years. In addition, indexation of the paid parental leave income limit will not commence until 1 July 2014.
                                                                                            </p>
                                                                                            <p>
                                                                                             Under the third measure, indexation of family tax benefit end of year supplements will also be paused for three years, from 1 July 2011. This will keep the end of year supplements at their current level for the next three entitlement years. The current supplement amounts are $726.35 per child for family tax benefit part A and $354.05 per family for family tax benefit part B.
                                                                                            </p>

It has been brought forward as part of the 2011-12 budget to start on 3 September 2011 rather than 1 January 2012. The new assessment procedure for the disability support pension will help people with disabilities return to the workforce, wherever possible, by focusing on their ability rather than their disability. The new assessment procedure will require most people to have tested their future work capacity by participating in training or work related activities in order to be qualified for the disability support pension. This require­ment will not apply to people with a severe impairment. People with a severe disability or illness who are clearly unable to work will be fast-tracked so that they receive financial support more quickly and will not need to have participated in a program of support.

It is important to proceed with these enabling legislative changes so that any extension of the trial is not delayed and the four Cape York communities are not adversely affected. Changes to Queensland government legislation would also be required in order for the trial to be extended.

                                                                                              This amendment proposes to remove changes to the disability support pension. As I articulated in my second reading contribution, the Greens have great concerns with the changes. We believe they will have very significant unintended consequences and that they should be excluded. More time needs to be put into developing a much more sensitive approach to helping people with a disability. I could be generous and give the government credit for thinking this is the way in which you help people with a disability. In that case, I urge them to reconsider their amendments, because they will have very significant unintended consequences.
                                                                                             </p>
                                                                                             <p>
                                                                                              But I think what the government is about here is saving money. I do not believe this is the way to do it. Research clearly shows that punitive approaches do not work. The government has recognised that there are barriers to people with disabilities finding work, and it has made significant changes in addressing taper rates and introducing disability brokers. These are good steps. On the one hand the government is making positive moves in addressing barriers to employment for someone living with a disability. But these amendments are not a good step. The government has not worked out the detail. It is rushing them through in order to save nearly $50 million. I do not think these measures are appropriate. Even if the government brought them in at the end of the year, I do not think they are the way to go. This is a particularly bad time and this is a particularly bad way of doing things.
                                                                                             </p>
                                                                                             <p>
                                                                                              The government are rushing these changes through. They have not completed the impairment table. They do not know—and they admitted this; I had a bit of a to and fro with the department over this—what role the providers will have. They are still making it up, quite frankly, as they go along. They should withdraw these measures. They should at least start them when they said they were going to—although, as I said, I do not agree with the changes; but at least a delay would maybe blunt some of the most dramatic of their potentially unintended consequences.

As I indicated in my remarks and as Senator Boyce did in hers, we will nevertheless be watching very closely how this particular measure works in practice. It is something that I am sure we will be examining closely at Senate estimates.

This is about trying to ensure that people with a disability get the support they need to get a job.

The government will move on this very quickly to ensure it is established and it will also involve the employment service providers.
                                                                                               </p>

So a great deal of work has been going on at the employment end as well to ensure that the disability employment service meets the needs of job seekers. Also, the Job Service Australia model has been expanded and improved in terms of stream 3 and stream 4 regarding outcome payments.

As I articulated in my speech during the second reading debate, we do not believe this is a good measure in that it focuses disproportionately on the members of our community on the lowest income, both those on low wages and those on income support. I acknowledge that the more well off Australians will not really notice it, but low-income families will notice it because every single penny counts for people on a low income. As I said in my speech, this money is often used to meet the lump-sum expenses that people have been accumulating through the year or when they need to replace a piece of equipment, pay bonds and things like that. I commend the amendment to the Senate.

While we have great sympathy with the intent and objective of the Greens amend­ment, the opposition has to deal with the budget situation as it is. The government have put the budget into deficit. They have done so with great consistency. They have racked up three budget deficits and I am sure they are on track for a fourth. They are nothing if not consistent. We have to recognise the fiscal situation that the government has placed the nation in. For that reason, it is with great reluctance that we adopt this course of action.

I start by rejecting everything that Senator Fifield said in relation to our economic manage­ment. We could debate that all day, Senator Fifield, and I note you constantly forget about the global financial crisis, but we will leave that for another day.
                                                                                                  </p>

I talked about a number of measures that the government has already taken. As a result of the change, the forgone increases in 2011-12 would be: for family tax benefit part A, $18 per child for the year, which is equivalent to 35c a week; and, for family tax benefit part B, $11 per child for the year, which is equivalent to 21c a week. The fortnightly family payments that families rely on week to week will continue to be indexed.
                                                                                                  </p>
                                                                                                  <p>
                                                                                                   Senator Siewert raised concerns about very low income families. I can advise the Senate that the impact on the maximum rate for a low-income single parent with two young children who receives both family tax benefit part A and part B will be $47 for the year 2011-12. As I previously noted, fortnightly family tax benefit payments will continue to rise with normal indexation. For this family, the total family tax benefit part A and B will increase by $12.32 a fortnight, or $321.20 a year, on 1 July 2011. That means that this family will still receive at least around $321 more in their family payments next year, depending on the age of their children. The increase could be higher.

As I said earlier, this particular measure will impact hardest. I make my point again: every cent counts for low-income families. This measure specifically exempts the freezing of the indexation in relation to FTB recipients who are in receipt of a social security pension, a social security benefit, a service pension or an income support supplement. In other words, it exempts those on a very low income.
                                                                                                   </p>
                                                                                                   <p>
                                                                                                    Before the government use the argument that this will be hard to implement because of administration, I remind the government that they introduced the measure that we debated just yesterday on child health checks that require FTB supplement payments to be linked to a health check. So there will be a system in place that traces those particular people. You could use the same system to make sure you do not freeze indexation of the supplement for people on income support or those on a very low income, because that will ensure that they get the indexation to help them a little more. I commend the amendment to the Senate.

We would have managed the budget in the previous years very differently. This government seems to have the worst luck of any government I have known. Every year there is always some bad luck. I do not accept the government's justification for why the budget is in the state that it is in, but nevertheless we have to accept the current state of the budget as a reality to be dealt with. Again, reluctantly, we indicate that we will not be supporting the Greens amendment.

The proposed amendment would have the effect of creating two supplement payment amounts: one for those on income support and another for those not on income support. I am advised that Senator Siewert raised this proposal along these lines during the inquiry hearings into the bill last week and Centrelink advised that there would obviously be a level of complexity with trying to make that differentiation because the limits would be currently applied across all. We would have to consider that and then advise the department, if that were the policy angle taken, and my initial reaction would be that that would be pretty tricky.

This amendment would therefore create inequities between low-income families receiving income support and those not in the income support system.

I was actually making those arguments around the child health checks just yesterday. I was making the point that you are applying those requirements for the bill that we dealt with yesterday, the further election commitments bill. The child health checks were being linked to those on income support and not other families—but all Australian families—and particularly other groups of families. So you can do it for that bill but you cannot do it for this one?

We will seek to move a second reading amendment which has been circulated in the chamber and which I understand the government has agreed to support.
                                                                                                        </p>

This is a government which has completely mismanaged our public finances. This is a government which has inherited a very strong fiscal position and a budget which was $22 billion in surplus. This is a government which inherited a net asset position of $70 billion and which has taken us to a position where we had a $55 billion deficit last year and a $50 billion deficit this year, and where we are on track to go to a net debt position of $107 billion over the current forward estimates. This is a government which is borrowing $135 million a day just to fund its day-to-day expenses. It is a government which will pay $26 billion just to pay the interest on the debt that it is accumulating over the current forward estimates. It is a government that has completely lost control of our public finances, which is why it always has to look around for another tax grab, for another way to raise more money.
                                                                                                        </p>
                                                                                                        <p>

Senator Wong, the finance minister, said the day before the budget that it was a typical Labor budget. It was a high-spending, high-taxing budget with more debt, more deficit and of course it was sprinkled with some ideologically driven attacks on those Australians that aspire to improve their station in life.
                                                                                                        </p>

The government knew very well that, when he talked about $22 billion of savings, in the media the next day it would be sold as $22 billion worth of spending cuts. Sure enough, the media played along with the government. The front page of the Financial Review, even, had a big headline stating there was $22 billion worth of spending cuts. Of course, the biggest single spending cut, so-called, was the $1.7 billion flat tax. In this bill there are a number of other tax and revenue measures which are part of the $22 billion of so-called savings.
                                                                                                        </p>

There are in schedule 1 some changes to trust laws regarding income averaging and farm management deposits. There are some changes in relation to trust income streaming in schedule 2; some changes to the

                                                                                                         </a>
                                                                                                         in schedule 3; and, of course, the two significant revenue measures, which relate to the phasing out of the dependent spouse tax offset and the changes to the car fringe benefits tax rule.
                                                                                                        </p>

This measure increases govern­ment revenue by about $961.9 million over the forward estimates, so it is a sizable increase in revenue as a result of this measure. These changes were announced in the 2011-12 budget, as I have mentioned. It will mean that those who drive less than 15,000 kilometres a year will now pay less fringe benefits tax; those who drive between 15,000 and 25,000 kilometres a year will pay about the same; and those who drive more than 25,000 kilometres will pay more fringe benefits tax. This measure will have a negative impact on those Australians who rely on their motor vehicle to earn their income and have to travel long distances, including tradespeople, salespeople, couriers, primary producers and small business people—the sorts of people that Labor always targets when it is in government to pay the price for the consequences of its mismanagement of our finances.
                                                                                                        </p>

But 60 per cent of the users of the 570,000 cars operating under the existing statutory formula will be worse off. So those figures mean that 342,000 individual Australians will be worse off as a direct result of these changes which the government is making to the

So this is yet another Labor Party tax grab which will punish people who live and work in outer metropolitan and rural areas through no fault of their own. It is just one more example of a government that just does not understand the cost of living pressures on Australian families and is not prepared to assist Australian families to deal with these pressures.
                                                                                                        </p>

It will mean that the dependent spouse tax offset will no longer be available for spouses of 40 years old or younger. Over time it will mean the rebate will be phased out as fewer and fewer people are left claiming it. These changes, as I am advised, do not affect dependent spouses who are invalids or permanently unable to work or those currently eligible for the rebate because of geographic isolation or other location issues. The rebate was never available to those claiming family tax benefit part B or if the income test for family tax benefit part B was exceeded. This schedule is expected to increase government revenue by $755 million over the forward estimates.

We have had waste and mis­management right across government. We have a government that has taken a strong and sound fiscal position and turned it into a position where we are now looking at record levels of government net debt, where we had the biggest deficit in the history of the Commonwealth last year, where we are going to have the second biggest deficit in the history of the Commonwealth this year and where we are going to have a significant deficit of about $22.3 billion next year, a deterioration of about $10 billion just compared to the figures that we were given seven or eight months ago in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook for the 2010-11 budget. Of course, we are supposed to believe that the following year, miraculously, on the back of the mining tax, the budget is going to experience a significant turnaround.
                                                                                                        </p>

However, people across Australia need to understand that they are paying the price for Labor's mismanagement of our budget. People across Australia, whether Australians with private health insurance who are about to lose their private health insurance rebate or people that are caught up in the measures in this legislation here today, are paying the price—and Labor wants them to pay the price—for Labor's mismanagement of the budget.

                                                                                                          I rise today to support the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 5) Bill 2011 and to say how extremely pleased I am that at last the perverse incentive which was in the tax system and encouraged people to drive their cars more in order to qualify for a tax concession is gone. This is something I have been campaigning for since I got into the Senate. It was identified in the Senate inquiry that I instigated on Australia's future oil supply and alternative fuels. It is absolutely ridiculous that in an age of peak oil—and we have reached peak oil—we should have embedded in the tax system a fossil fuel subsidy that encourages people, effectively, to waste oil in a world where we are going to see upward pressure on oil prices and real dislocation in oil economies around the world as there is a recognition that cheap, accessible oil has run out. We are going to see increasing dislocation in the food production system, particularly, and also in transport in cities.
                                                                                                         </p>

                                                                                                          So the first thing is that we should be looking at all fossil fuel subsidies and getting rid of the lot of them across government. If you are serious about addressing climate change and greenhouse gas emissions and if you are serious about preparing for peak oil then you would instigate a plan for the whole country: a plan to get off fossil fuels and to move to a transport system that is not dependent on imported oil.

That is why he spent billions in their recent stimulus package to try to encourage the use of biofuels in the United States in order to get off their dependence on imported oil. The problem, of course, with the disproportionate influence of biofuels is that it has led to distortions in agricultural production, and that will happen here in Australia unless we get some good rules around biofuels and focus on second- and third-generation fuels.

The passenger vehicle fleet will become electrified, and the challenge for government is to think about a transport plan for Australia in the age of peak oil and climate change—a transformational plan to get more public transport, more rail for freight and a very fast train for passenger commuting. We need more of those throughout the country. This I see as a beginning.
                                                                                                         </p>

Instead of just taxing luxury we were taxing vehicle fuel inefficiency. What we said then is that we should be looking at the efficiency of the vehicle and driving people to more efficient vehicles, and that should be the way that we consider taxing wasteful resource use. That was the first. As part of that arrangement I got an agreement from the government that the Treasurer, Mr Swan, would write to the Henry tax review and ask about this whole issue of moving the excise system into looking at efficiency and carbon embedded energy in fuel, in particular the fringe benefits tax concession on motor vehicles. I was very pleased, then, when the Henry tax review came out and recommended getting rid of this subsidy.

We got that costing back, and of course what we see is that it is a substantial saving to the budget. It improves the underlying cash balance by $953.9 million over the forward estimates. So for people who say that, with the Greens taking the balance of power, they might be concerned about fiscal responsibility: the Greens are extremely fiscally responsible, and for everything we want to spend money on we are prepared to find savings measures. I can inform the government at this point that every time they bring in a measure to get rid of a fossil fuel subsidy it will not only improve the bottom line in the balance sheet over the coming years; it will be great for the environment. It will reduce fossil fuels.

What you have there is about 1,500 mining companies getting $1.7 billion per annum in fuel tax credits at a time when they are making profits they could never have dreamt of. They are making extraordinary record profits and, frankly, they were allowed to get away with their ridiculous advertising campaign and reduce the tax take with the mining tax concession that they achieved without people realising that we are $1.7 billion worse off in this country every year because 1,500 mining companies get that fuel tax credit. I make the point of it being 1,500 companies because in the research and development spend in this country—and I have just supported and negotiated with the government a change to the research and development measures—we currently have less than 100 companies in Australia getting more than 60 per cent of the R&amp;D spending in Australia. Here comes another major subsidy: 100 companies getting 60 per cent of the R&amp;D funding and, of those 100 companies, 37 are miners. So the mining companies are hogging the research and development budget and hogging the fuel tax credit scenario while, at the same time, out there sponsoring the tour of a climate sceptic in Australia and putting ridiculous amounts of money into advertising budgets to undermine the national interest.

We estimate there are something like $8 billion worth of fossil fuel subsidies given out every year, and they include everything from exploration subsidies to tax concessions and goodness knows what. We are here ready and willing to help on that bottom line, to get in there and not only make a better outcome for Australia in terms of greenhouse gas emissions but accelerate the day when we plan for a low and then a zero carbon economy based on a magnificent transition to public transport, to electrification of the vehicle fleet, to getting more rail in this country, to getting freight off the roads and back onto the rail. This could be a very exciting future for Australia in the transport sector, rather than having the focus, as we always have, on road transport, on more highways, on more flyovers, on more dual carriageways et cetera. What are we going to do on those dual carriageways when oil hits $200 a barrel and we are still making cars in this country that are fuel guzzlers?

What a thing to be proud of! Whereas on the other foot we have got China moving for very high vehicle fuel efficiency standards, setting an objective of increasing its global market share of the electrified transport fleet, and setting up fuel efficiency standards for motor vehicles that mean that no car produced in Australia would meet Chinese standards today. That is because China wanted to build itself a global position so that the Europeans have got global market share for luxury vehicles and the Chinese are building massive market share for the mainstream passenger vehicle of the future. Where is Australia? Stuck at the bottom, with poor vehicle fuel efficiency standards and a trade agreement with Saudi Arabia to send our six- and eight-cylinder vehicles there. What a disgrace.
                                                                                                         </p>

If you want a strategy to make sure we have no vehicle industry in Australia, the best strategy is to do what we currently do, and that is to have such low standards that we produce mediocre cars in terms of efficiency so that, as the oil crisis proceeds, Australian consumers will want to buy imported cars and not locally produced cars. The only market for locally produced cars will be governments, again propping up cars that just do not cut it, and putting them into government car fleets. This is ridiculous. Again, we will be stuck with a massive subsidy to the car industry to produce cars that nobody wants to buy. That is not a strategy for efficiency or jobs. If you want to keep jobs in the car industry in Australia, we should be making highly efficient vehicles for the Australian market. That is why I will continue to campaign for very high, mandatory vehicle fuel efficiency standards.
                                                                                                         </p>

If a government was truly thinking of a national transport plan for the future it would be looking at setting the fuel excise to cover all of those in specific terms. That process has been started, but it is by no means finished. We need to accelerate the review of that excise and at the same time negotiate with the states on a road use charge; otherwise we are going to reach a point where people will be driving electric vehicles generating energy from their own rooftops in order to have plug-in electrics and they will not be paying anything for the roads they use. The government will then be in a crisis in terms of its revenue take. So now is the time to be thinking about how we are going to think about the future. Already here in Canberra we have people installing electric recharging stations. In China there will be 10 million of these electric charging stations across that huge nation. They know where the future is in vehicles, and it is in electrification.

It is a step we have been campaigning for and it gives me great satisfaction, having campaigned for this since I got here in 2005, to be standing here in 2011 and seeing a government deliver a reform that was laughed at five years ago. When we recommended it in the oil inquiry report that time ago, people said it was ridiculous. Now we are actually doing it. We need to have as a philosophical view that we should be encouraging people to drive less and, when they do drive, to drive more efficiently. This is the first step in saying: we want people to drive less.
                                                                                                         </p>
                                                                                                         <p>
                                                                                                          We want to end the March 'rally' in Australia where people would stand in offices, put the car keys on the table and say, 'If anyone's going to the coast this weekend or needs to go to Queensland, take my car, drive it there, because I need to get the tax concession for vehicle use.' Getting rid of this means people who genuinely need to drive long distances will still have their logbooks, will still be able to demonstrate that and will have it recognised, but we will not have this perverse incentive that requires people to drive round and round and anywhere they need to go in order to get themselves up to a level where they qualify for a tax concession. So I could not be happier. And I know the tax office will be delighted to know that, as we come into the balance of power, the Greens stand ready and willing to produce billions for you in getting rid of tax concessions, getting rid of fossil fuel subsidies. We are the most economically rational when it comes to fossil fuel subsidies.

We are going to stand here and help this government meet its bottom line by saving itself up to $8 billion. Those of you from the tax office that are listening: we are here ready to go on this. As you will have seen when you did the costing for us on getting rid of this, the Greens have made a substantial contribution to this year's budget by, as I said, improving the under­lying cash balance by $953.9 million over the forward estimates.
                                                                                                            </p>

                                                                                                            </p>

It is lamentable that Australia identified, through the Treasury, 17 fossil fuel subsidies that we could get rid of but then the government redefined what a fossil fuel subsidy is so that, by the time we got to the G20, we had no fossil fuel subsidies in Australia at all. Well, we agree with the Treasury. There are 17 fossil fuel subsidies that are pretty evident and we are coming to remove them to improve the bottom line, to work with anyone who will work with us to get rid of them because we need to be incentivising the future. We need to get to the low-carbon economy.
                                                                                                            </p>
                                                                                                            <p>
                                                                                                             We need to focus on energy security. Anyone who wants to maintain a dependence on imported foreign oil is, frankly, risking the energy security of Australia into the future. This has now become a much bigger issue than just the price of petrol. This is about securing our future energy. Everybody recognises that most of the oil left in the world is now owned by countries, not companies. Those countries are going to be exercising their geopolitical weight as the world gets more and more desperate for dwindling resources. It is going to come to a choice of which is more expensive: do you go out and try and find more oil in deeper water with greater risks—and we saw with Montara and the oil well in the Gulf of Mexico what happens when you get into deep water and deep drilling—or do you go the other route and say, 'Let's get off oil and go to efficiency and electrification, and not take those risks'? That is the choice we have to make.

Let us get into incentivising efficiency, transformation, new technology, innovation and real competitiveness. We are on the side of efficiency and compet­itive­ness. I really congratulate the government for actually doing this at last. I hope we can accelerate the rate of change, because there are 16 other fossil fuel subsidies. We are ready to legislate them and so improve the bottom line.

By the end of that very long road, it was really difficult to find anybody who would speak in favour of it, so it is good that the government has taken this opportunity to finally just kick it over. There are many others there.

It is a good initiative. It is not a homelessness initiative as such but is designed to increase the supply of affordable housing for key workers and low- to middle-income earners, and to encourage investment on a large scale, an institutional scale—that is, to get investors back into the business of funding affordable housing rather than the kinds of property investments which investors, large and small, have been making over the last couple of decades.

Schedule 3 of this bill amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to provide a legislative solution to allow NRAS consortia to receive their full entitlement to the NRAS incentive. These incentives were designed to be received tax-free by participants in the scheme, and this bill extends this to joint-venture operations, as we thought the government had originally intended.

Treasurer Swan responded in January of last year with an administrative solution that resolved the tax issues for joint ventures until regulatory and legislative amendments could be introduced later that year to effect a permanent fix. Investors and people wanting to get into the sector to help provide affordable housing have been waiting until this evening for that instrument and for that permanent fix to come about.

Canberra, we know, is now one of the most stretched housing markets in Australia. Rental houses here are the most expensive of any capital city after Darwin with a median price of $500 a week for a house and $425 a week for a unit.

CHC Affordable Housing Canberra has a number of NRAS properties, so they were involved in the scheme. They have developed 95 per cent of their allocations—that is, they are tenanted—and have another 34 incentives in progress in a new Canberra greenfield suburb. In the suburb of Holt, they have two NRAS developments: one with 24 units and a smaller one with eight. In both cases they own the properties and will retain them, and they are able to rent them at less than 80 per cent of market rent that is required for NRAS—they are actually renting them at just under 75 per cent of market rent. That is the scheme operating as the government intended. That was what it was designed to do.
                                                                                                             </p>

Seventy-six of these were to be NRAS dwellings but the legal structure was not in place at the time to provide the assurance that the NRAS incentive in this joint venture would actually get passed on to them. Without that proper structure in place it was deemed too difficult administratively and too expensive to pursue a private ruling from the ATO to provide the assurances to the investors that they were needing. Instead, 67 incentives were transferred to another project and the units were sold to investors for rental in the private market. This bill, which we are very happy to support tonight, will prevent that from happening again. We believe and understand that CHC Affordable Housing will revisit the model now that that certainty is in place in future projects.
                                                                                                             </p>

One large development project in Queensland, which has been pending, specifically awaiting the passage of this legislation, I understand will now go ahead. It is a project to build 186 units, and 45 of them will be NRAS properties. It is worth $84 million. So far, half of the NRAS residences have been sold off the plan on the condition that this legislation gets up. So we are very pleased tonight to support this legislation, which provides the necessary assurances to finalise that project.
                                                                                                             </p>

After a two-year wait we are all very relieved to finally have the certainty. We also welcome the government's assurances that the benefits of the tax offset will be retrospective.
                                                                                                             </p>

The last time I raised this issue in budget estimates the people processing the incentives through the government's approval process were bas­ically being swamped. Although the scheme has been criticised for moving too slowly, at the moment the people doing the assessment work cannot keep up. This is certainly one thing we think could be improved. There are huge delays between the time of application and announcement.
                                                                                                             </p>

We would like to see a commitment to a second round of 50,000 incentives past 2015, when the first 50,000 incentives allocation will be completed, because that really will provide certainty to the big institutional investors that you can get into affordable housing markets in Australia, that the return stacks up, that that can be banked on and that we will finally be increasing supply.
                                                                                                             </p>

Senator Milne just spoke eloquently about the perverse incentives in the tax system, and that is true in housing more so than any other sector. That is something we will be pursuing later this year.
                                                                                                             </p>

We had a long and anxious wait for the last three years on the issue of whether the provision of affordable housing through NRAS was deemed to be a charitable purpose. To me the threat by the ATO that charities could have their charitable status revoked if they were in the business of providing affordable housing through this scheme was quite perverse, and yet it has been so since 2009. People are basically participating now on the basis of goodwill. The day after the federal budget was released we finally saw the ruling come out that the provision of a rental dwelling under NRAS is deemed by legislation to be a charitable purpose. Finally people were given that certainty.
                                                                                                             </p>

The affordable housing sector and their allies, from superannuation funds right through to people running community housing organisations, really should be congratulated for their very swift action. We were very pleased to support them and to lead the charge on giving the department time to process the applications that were already afoot and then restoring that funding after 2014. We are very proud that we achieved the goal of at least restoring the original program funding.
                                                                                                             </p>

I remind government senators here tonight that the government's original intention was to treat NRAS as though it were a 10-year project and to double the target to 100,000 if the scheme were successful. I suspect by this time next year there will not be any further argument about whether the scheme is successful. It will be more: what happens when the 10-year scheme comes to an end? Will there be more incentives? What will happen to affordable housing when the incentives no longer apply?
                                                                                                             </p>

We certainly will not give up on an announcement for another 50,000 incentives, as former housing minister Ms Plibersek promised when she introduced the scheme. We look forward to working with the government on the ways that NRAS can be used to fill the desperate gap in the three key areas where we believe the scheme currently falls short. These are obviously housing for our students, housing for our key workers in boom towns and housing for our ageing population. There is a long way to go in the housing affordability agenda, but I congratulate the government for at least bringing this scheme forward and for committing to its continuation.

You can imagine what sort of a hiding the Australian public and the Australian taxpayers are in for when the Greens are out there effectively inviting the Labor Party to tax more and more and are telling the tax office that they have a friend in the Greens.

If the carbon tax does come in—and I still hope and pray that sanity will prevail and it will not be imposed upon the Australian public—it will add to the cost of living pressures. It does not mean much for people in this chamber—public servants, all of whom are on pretty good incomes—but for those who are struggling in Australia the carbon tax and all of these additional taxes, such as the flood levy tax, are all extra burdens increasing the cost of living, restricting their enjoyment of life and making it a lot harder for many families just to provide the basic necessities of life. Here we have a Labor-Greens alliance—a coalition of Labor and the Greens—running the government and proudly boasting that they are there to increase taxes.

The Labor Party has a propensity for taxing, they cannot help themselves. That is because they are such bad financial managers. Their debt blows out all the time on stupid programs like the pink batts program. They basically cannot handle money. There is the old adage: where money is concerned you cannot trust Labor. Now they have the Greens in an even more relevant position than they are today inviting the Labor Party to go ahead and increase the taxation burden on ordinary Australians.

One wonders what is going to power those electric charging stations. If they are like the ones that we use for the little vehicles that run around this parliament house, you plug them into the wall and your electricity charges these vehicles, which I assume is the sort of thing Senator Milne is talking about—10 million new electric charging stations. Where does the electricity come from? In China in particular it comes from more and more coal-fired power stations that are being built every day. There are a couple of windmills, sure, and a few solar panels but China is increasing its energy from coal-fired power stations, many of them of course using coal from central Queensland, the state that I and you, Madam Acting

If you live in Hobart like Senator Milne does, Perth like Senator Ludlum does, Melbourne or Brisbane like opposition speakers do, sure, you can cut down the usage of your car and that is good for everything—good for emissions, good for pollution, good for looking at alternatives—but if you live in country Australia, particularly if you live in Northern and remote Australia, you really do not have much alternative. If you live in Laura, where I was the other day for the Indigenous dance festival, and you want an electrician, that electrician has to come from Cooktown, I think 170-odd kilometres away, or from Mareeba, 250 kilometres away. If your motor vehicle breaks down and you have to get a mechanic out to fix it, the tradesmen coming out to do that of necessity has to drive long distances. So this bill is going to add costs not just to people in the cities, who might use their vehicles but have an alternative, but to people in remote Australia,

I understand the Senate Economics Legislation Committee in a rather quick inquiry had a look at the bill. This whole legislation has been framed in such a way as to make it impossible for the coalition to oppose it, particularly at five minutes to midnight on practically the last sitting day of the financial year, when these things are always rushed through. As Senator Cormann has mentioned, we will be supporting this bill, but Senator Cormann's amendment is very appropriate and it arises from the Senate committee—that is, the amendment requires the Economics References Committee to undertake a review of the operation of the amendments made by the bill 12 months after commencement and report on them so that we can actually see the impact.

Does the Labor Party care about that? No. They get few votes out there. Following the carbon tax they will get no votes out there.

They just look after the capital city people and this sort of thing is not too bad for them, because there are alternatives. But there are no alternatives for tradesmen or professional people wanting to get assistance, as I say, using the example again in Laura when they have to get their tradesmen from 200 or 300 kilometres away. I despair for those people who do live in rural and regional Australia. These sorts of fringe benefits tax concessions did try and bring a bit of justice and equity. They tried to level the playing field, so to speak, so that Australians living in those more remote areas had some opportunity to get ahead.
                                                                                                              </p>

They are not big numerically and therefore are not of interest to the Labor Party in the political system. You, Madam Deputy President Boyce, I know are aware of this. You understand the issues, but I cannot believe that the Labor Party people can be so insensitive, so ignorant or so uncaring when it comes to the additional burdens that country people—people living in remote Australia—have to carry. The bill that is being put through and that meets com­mitments made in this year's budget will make it more and more difficult for those of us who live in the country removed from the major capital cities to get the basic services of life. I hope that one day the Labor Party will understand this and bring a bit of equity, fairness and justice into the way they tax Australians.

The amendments in schedule 1 of this bill allow trust beneficiaries to continue to use the primary production averaging and farm management deposits provisions in a trust-loss year. The amendments broadly restore the position that existed before the High Court decision in Bamford v Commissioner of Taxation, which necessitated the commissioner with­drawing a public ruling that in certain circumstances the beneficiary could be eligible for the primary production averaging and farm management deposits rules in a trust-loss year. The amendments secure continuity for taxpayers because they apply from the 2010-11 income year, and the commissioner's ruling applies up to and including the 2009-10 income year.
                                                                                                               </p>

                                                                                                                The amendments in schedule 2 of this bill ensure that, where permitted by the trust deed, the streaming of capital gains and franked distributions, including any attached franking credits, of a trust to specified beneficiaries can be effective for tax purposes. The amendments also introduce specific anti-avoidance rules to address the inappropriate use of exempt entities to shelter the taxable income of a trust. These amendments will provide more certainty for the trustees and beneficiaries of trusts that stream capital gains and franked distri­butions, including any attached franking credits. The government is committed to a broader review of the taxation of trust income. It is important to simplify and rewrite the rules, which will give more certainty to the users of trusts, particularly small businesses and farmers.

The amendments provide some additional flexibility to NRAS participants in how the incentive is shared between members of the NRAS consortium. The amendments do this by establishing an election to allow approved participants to relinquish their entitlements to an NRAS tax offset in favour of other members of their NRAS consortium. The amendments also address minor technical issues that have arisen from the interaction of the tax law and the National Rental Affordability Scheme Act 2008 and also ensure that certain payments provided under NRAS indirectly, such as through the NRAS consortium, are treated as non-assessable non-exempt income.

From 1 July 2011, taxpayers with a dependent spouse born on or after 1 July 1971 will no longer be eligible for the dependent spouse tax offset. This means that the offset will be gradually phased out as the population ages. Dependent spouses aged 40 or over will not be affected by this measure, nor will dependent spouses with children or taxpayers whose dependent spouse is a carer, an invalid or permanently unable to work. Taxpayers eligible for the zone, overseas forces and overseas civilian tax offsets are also not affected by this measure.
                                                                                                               </p>

Under the current statutory formula method the calculated fringe benefit from a salary sacrificed car decreases as the distance travelled by the vehicle increases. People can therefore increase their taxation concession by driving their vehicle further. This reform will replace the current statutory rates with a single rate of 20 per cent that applies regardless of the distance travelled. This reform implements another recommendation of the Australia's Future Tax System review. This reform will apply to new contracts entered into after the budget announcement of 10 May this year and will be phased in over four years. This bill deserves the support of the parliament, and I commend the bill to the Senate.

However, let me just make a number of observations on behalf of the opposition. Budget time is always the time to take stock of how the government has been performing. When it comes to the management of public finances, this government has performed very badly indeed. This government inherited a very strong budget position back in 2007 when

                                                                                                                   </a>

The budget was $22 billion in the positive and we had $70 billion worth of net government assets. But last year we had a budget that was $55 billion in the red and this year we have a budget that is $50 billion in the red—and it is going to be $22.3 billion in the red next year. We are now on track for $107 billion worth of net government debt—the highest ever.
                                                                                                                  </p>

Through hard work, good government and sound financial management the Howard government was able to pay off that debt, return the budget to surplus and deliver tax cuts. But what we have had under this government is wasteful spending, more taxes and record levels of debt and deficit. In fact, this year we will have the second-highest deficit on record, after we had the highest deficit on record last year.
                                                                                                                  </p>

The people of Australia have to pay the price through the proposals in this budget by the Labor Party to abolish the private health insurance rebate for hundreds of thousands of Australians and reduce the private health insurance rebate for hundreds of thousands of Australians through means testing. People across Australia will pay the price for this government's reckless spending and mismanagement of our public finances.
                                                                                                                  </p>

It is just extraordinary. Back in 2007 the government was paying $0 in interest on net government debt. Today, the government is paying $26 billion just on the interest to service the debt that they have accumulated since they came into government in 2007.
                                                                                                                  </p>

This Labor government has not delivered a single surplus budget. In fact, Labor has not delivered a surplus budget since 1989-89. We have had nine successive deficit budgets from the Labor Party.

She keeps lecturing us about what she perceives to be our record in relation to fiscal management. I say to Minster Wong that people across Australia well understand that it is always the coalition that has had to fix up the fiscal mess that Labor govern­ments have created in Australia again and again and again. That is what happened last time—we had to come in and fix up the mess—and that is what will happen next time. The longer Labor stay in government the greater the mess they are making—and the more people across Australia have to pay the price for Labor's fiscal mismanagement.

It is important to pause to reflect on this. It is just over two years ago that the government asked for the debt ceiling to be more than doubled—to $200 billion—and now the parliament is being asked to increase the gross debt ceiling by another $50 billion. And the parliament will have to agree with that because by the end of June, according to the budget papers, according to the face value indicated that is being used for this, gross debt will already be at $192 billion.

And she was right. It was a typical Labor budget. It was a high-spending, high-taxing Labor budget with more debt and more deficit, and it was sprinkled with a whole series of ideological attacks on Australians who have aspirations to get ahead. This is what Labor governments do when they get the chance. They spend beyond their means and then have to find some targets and some people across Australia that can pay the bill. Invariably, the people whom Labor wants to pay the bill for their reckless spending and incapacity to manage public finances are those who are working hard to make a contribution and to get ahead, and are a key part of driving the economic prosperity of Australia. This government is currently borrowing $135 million a day just to fund its day-to-day expenses. In the week after the budget, the Minister for Finance and Deregulation tried to make a virtue of the fact that it had been able to keep spending growth, in real terms, below two per cent. What she did not mention—and what was excluded from the graphs in the budget papers—was that over the last two years spending in real terms had gone up by 17 per cent. It has been the highest increase in spending, in real terms, since the Whitlam government: 17 per cent. If you start off from an inflated base, of course it is easier to keep your spending growth limited to below two per cent.
                                                                                                                  </p>

We had two years where the government was dishing out the money—it was spending money on pink batts and school halls and sending out cheques to people—and that inflated level of spending, spending at record levels, has become the new base. The government somehow wants us to think that it is being disciplined and doing a great job just because it is able to bring spending growth from that inflated base to below two per cent. That is not an achievement. It would be extra­ordinary if the government were not able to keep it below two per cent.

For more than three months there has been a question on notice to the Treasurer asking him how much of the fiscal stimulus spending for this year and next year remains uncommitted. I have not had an answer. For more than three months the Treasurer has failed to answer a question about how much of the fiscal stimulus spending has not been either spent or committed.

It is a bit like groundhog day, because if you look at the debates we have been having today, last week and the week before that—in fact, if you look at the debates we have been having every single week over the last 12 months—there has been no moving forward at all. The Prime Minister was going to move forward, but I think we are just stepping on the same step every day. It is like every day we wake up and it starts again.
                                                                                                                  </p>

We talk about the mining tax mess. The more scrutiny that is applied to it the more obvious it becomes that it is a complete mess. It is a mining tax which came out of a flawed process, an exclusive, secretive negotiation with the three biggest mining companies, which of course is not a sound foundation on which to develop a tax policy. Then we have the border protection fiasco. The Prime Minister told us about the

Remember the East Timor solution? What has happened to that? Now we are talking about the Malaysian solution. That is not going anywhere either.

It is a government that has lost control of the financial management situation. It is a government that has lost control wherever you look. Look at live cattle exports. Why would you impose a blanket ban on live cattle exports if you were concerned about some rogue operators doing the wrong thing? Why wouldn't you target those rogue operators and allow all the other abattoirs in Indonesia and other places that are complying with appropriate standards to continue operating? This is a government that does not seem to care about the flow-on consequences for real people across Australia—real people across Australia who are getting hurt. This government, being driven by the Greens in this chamber into one corner after another, does not seem to care when real people across Australia are getting hurt by its reckless and ill-considered approach to government.

It includes a total appropriation of $72.85 billion. We also have Appropriation Bill (No. 2), which includes the request to parliament to increase the government's gross debt ceiling from $200 billion to $250 billion. It is intriguing. The government is also asking the parliament to remove the requirement for it to provide a statement of reasons as to why it has to further increase gross debt before it goes ahead with it.
                                                                                                                  </p>

Why does the government want to remove the particular requirement to table a statement of reasons in both houses of parliament? This is a government led by a Prime Minister who promised us back in August 2010 that this was going to be a new era of openness and transparency—that the government was going to let the sunshine in. Wherever you look, you find that this is a secretive government which is trying to reduce the capacity of the parliament to scrutinise its activities. It is a government that, rather than letting the sunshine in, closes the curtains wherever it can. Of course, secretive govern­ment makes for bad government. It is our job in this chamber to ensure that people across Australia can benefit from the best government possible, and this government seems to be a lost cause when it comes to that.
                                                                                                                  </p>

Even though we are told the carbon tax is going to start on 1 July 2012, the carbon tax is not included in the budget. Why is that? The government says, 'Oh, well; we don't know yet what we're going to do.' But the mining tax, which is supposed to start on the same day, 1 July 2012, has been in the budget for 12 months. Why do you think that is—why do you think the mining tax has been in the budget for the last 12 months and the carbon tax has not been? The reason is that the mining tax, which was developed through a deeply flawed process with no consultation and no engagement with state and territory governments—even though the mining tax in its original iteration was supposed to replace state and territory royalties—is supposed to generate significant revenue to help the government create the illusion of an early surplus.
                                                                                                                  </p>

                                                                                                                   It talks about all the associated budget measures, which the government says will be part of its reform agenda. They do not start to come into effect until a bit later, and the cost of the related measures will only really play out during the years beyond the forward estimates. But, of course, the mining tax revenue is in this budget. The mining tax revenue is what is required to help the government make its claim of an early surplus. But the carbon tax would raise $11.5 billion worth of revenue if the government stuck to similar parameters as were on the table in the context of the

I suspect it will be very difficult for the Greens to vote in favour of a carbon tax which imposes a lower carbon price than the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. Why did they not vote for the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme if they are now be prepared to vote for a price on carbon than is lower than what was in that legislation?

From 2012-13 onwards the information is wrong, because we have the wrong revenue figures, the wrong expenditure figures, the wrong employment data and the wrong economic growth forecasts, because all of that is going to change once we know what the government's plans are in relation to the carbon tax—the carbon tax the Prime Minister promised before the election would not be introduced.

We have to get back into the telecommunications business and we're going to make some money for you, so we can take it off the budget.

Senator Moore, wait and see the connection, but you have been in the parliament long enough to know that on appropriations any subject is a matter for discussion. But I do want to confine my remarks to money matters, as you will see. I had spoken for a full 23 seconds before the Labor Party took a point of order. It shows that the Labor Party are certainly very sensitive about the great celebrations tomorrow of 'Assassination Day'. And why shouldn't they be? The most rueful political assassination in the history of this parliament occurred one year ago tomorrow.
                                                                                                                      </p>

I suspect that 'Assassination Day' tomorrow will be a day to cement the plans for the next assassination, and we know with the Labor Party down at 27 per cent in the opinion polls that, being as ruthless as they are, being only interested in power for power's sake, that the Labor Party will be plotting now to get rid of Ms Gillard and install the next one on the revolving roundabout in the shades of

I want to continue mentioning that, because some of my colleagues here were not around in 1996, when the government changed from the last Labor government to the Liberal government. We were told that there was to be a surplus in that year on the current account. When we got into government, of course, we found there was a $10 billion deficit. Not only did it show bad financial management, but it showed an inability to tell the truth and an action by the Labor government to do everything possible to keep the truth from the people of Australia—shades of, I might say, 'There shall be no carbon tax under a government I lead'. A promise to the Labor Party means absolutely nothing. Telling untruths when it comes to financial matters is part of their

It took a lot of constraint. A lot of the programs we would have liked to have funded we could not fund, but we understood the importance of paying off debt and getting surpluses. Of course, in our last several budgets we had annual surpluses, and those surpluses were put aside in the moneybox, so to speak. When we were defeated at the election, we handed to the incoming government a surplus of $60 billion, set aside for a rainy day. That, of course, was spent in less than two years, and we now find ourselves in a situation where Common­wealth net debt levels will rise from $82 billion this year to $107 billion next year, largely to fund the budget deficit and helping to drive up the liabilities incurred for Australia under this Labor government from $200 billion to $227 billion.

I am sure not many Australians would be aware of that. Our current debt, $227 billion, is going to increase. Under the rules and regulations for the governance of Australia there is a limit on what they can borrow, but this bill today will allow the Labor Party to increase the amount of their borrowing beyond what it is at the present time.

He urged governments to heed the lessons of Europe and the US as growing state and federal borrowing pushes their financial liabilities past half a trillion dollars in the new financial year. The net debt levels in the states—all of them Labor states until very recently and, of course, the financial mess that all of the states are in is a result of decades of Labor government—have risen from $102 billion this year to $135 billion next year. This will put their net financial liabilities at a record $285 billion. If you add to that the $227 billion that the Com­monwealth has then you understand why people like Mr Murray are sounding warnings. Mr Murray said that these huge debt levels could force private sector to compete for funds as the resource sector booms. Of course, we know what happens when there is competition for money.

The debt crisis in Europe has forced governments to cut public services and pensions, while the US is struggling to raise the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling it has—they want to try and increase that; they are not having much success in Congress—to avoid the United States, would you believe, from defaulting on its debt. We are not quite to that stage, but leave a Labor government here for another few years and we will be. Labor Party people who are oh so concerned, so they say, about the poorer people and the working people should have a look at what is happening in Europe after years of socialist and left-wing governments. They are now cutting pensions in Greece. They are cutting services because the government simply cannot pay for it any longer. That is what is happening and what will happen in Australia if Labor continues to govern in this country.

The carbon tax, the mining tax, the flood levy; on and on it goes. Labor is addicted to debt; it is in their DNA. But they have to understand that you just cannot keep borrowing. You cannot do it in your own household and the country is the same. Someone has to pay back the debt, someone has to pay the interest and someone has to keep borrowing the money to pay the interest so that Australia can keep up the basic services.

The Labor government has been one continuous episode of mismanagement and waste. We know about the pink batts and we know about the school halls. How much have we spent on the climate change debate in the last term of government, ending up in that failed Copenhagen conference that became a laughing stock? The whole Copenhagen climate change thing was so mismanaged by Australia. Just the sheer money, as well as the carbon footprint that others have written about, of going through the routine under the last Labor government's failed approach to climate change. It goes on and on.

Again, I am concerned that in typical form this Labor government is bringing in—sneaking in—at five minutes to midnight before the end of the financial year this bill to further increase the ability to borrow, at a time, as I say, when people are out celebrating the assassination a year ago.

There will be a lot of commentary about the 'Assassination Day' coming up. We know from discussions with our Labor Party friends that the situation is getting to an extent where something will happen. When the next assassination happens I think even the Labor Party will have to go to an election, so Labor friends are telling us to look towards September or October: get a new leader, try to get the carbon tax off the agenda, try to get the illegal boat people off the agenda and try to get people to forget about the mining tax so that we can go to an election this year.

As you heard from the previous debate, the Greens are out there boasting about what they have done to increase taxes yet again, and saying to the Labor Party and the Taxation Office, 'You want more money? You want more taxes? We're here to help.' I cannot believe that, but I suppose those of us who have followed the Greens for a while at least appreciate their honesty, unlike the Labor Party. At least the Greens are open about it: 'We want to increase taxes, we want to make it more difficult for families in Australia to exist. We want to put more and more pressure on the cost of living.' That is something, of course, that we in the coalition do not want to do.

Debt is the absolute key performance indicator of how you are going financially. You can have all the beautiful stories you like—all the wondrous stories that I used to see as an accountant and in my five years in banking—about how things are actually going. But you just say to them, 'What do you owe the bank? Are you paying off your debts? Are you getting further into trouble?' Because debt does not lie: you cannot get around it. It is there, on your bank statement. You can give wonderful stories about net debt and this debt and that debt but it is your gross figure, easily pronounced on your bank statement.

Actually, in the last week they paid a little bit of it back, but that is just because it is the interim period between the roll of bills and it will blow right back out to where it was at $196 billion. The reason we are in here tonight, and the reason they sneaked in this extension of debt is because if we did not extend this debt the government would close down. It would all finish; the cheques would bounce and we would have no money. They said as much in Senate estimates, where they clearly said, 'Oh, that would be so irresponsible not to extend the debt limit,' because if you did not extend the debt limit the place would just come to a conclusion.

It was temporary, he said, because China was going to fall backwards. It was basically going to go into recession, along with India. Neither China nor India missed a beat. They charged ahead. Not only did they charge ahead but our debt charged ahead and went from a temporary increase to a permanent increase. The premise of the Treasurer's wish for an extension was not there, but the debt certainly was. You could see where it was. If you could see a source and application of funds statement—'Where is the money?', that is what they always ask—you would see that it is in ceiling insulation for the rats and the mice to sleep on at night. It is in school halls. It was in that manic $22.8 billion they sent out in $900 cheques. I would like to remind the Senate that I voted against each one.

We will magically find the rest of the money to get us out to a $56 billion spend. I can tell you one thing: the Treasurer will not find the money; he will be borrowing that money as well—or shutting it down. That debt also gets added in, and on and on it goes.

I seem to remember saying something very similar myself a couple of years ago. He mentioned half a trillion. Isn't this marvellous? Under this crowd, we have got ourselves into the trillion club. We can actually start talking about our debt as a portion of a trillion.

Money is being sucked out of the economy. On the news tonight we hear that the people in Sydney, the businesses, just do not have the cash. It is not there. We hear it in Brisbane. We even hear it in small regional towns, such as Dalby, that the money is not there—because he is sucking the money out of the economy. Is it just the view held here that the debt is out of control? No. I have got a paper from Dr Ken Rogoff, from the Harvard Centre for Economic Policy Research. He has got no barrow to push. I do not know him; I have never met him. What does Dr Ken Rogoff say? He talks about the cumulative increase in real public debt since 2007—surprise, surprise, that is when the Labor Party got voted in. Let us go through them. The worst was Iceland; that stands to reason. The next was Ireland, the next one—not Spain, not the

Congratulations! You are No. 3. You have done an incredible job. Since you have been here, you have brought about the third-biggest cumulative increase in real public debt since 2007. Well done! He is a genius, our Treasurer. What an omnipotent light! What an orb of financial wonder! The debt has got to be paid back. There are real people who really want their money back.

So the pensioner, when they go to the chemist and ask for the script, believing it will be subsidised by the government, will find out that, because of the stuff-up that the Labor Party has created, the money is just not there. So they will have to pay the full price, the actual price. Instead of the $4 script it will be the $400 script. Instead of the $200 cancer treatment it will be the $20,000 cancer treatment. You will have to pay the real price. Access to free and public hospitals: if the money is not there, you cannot afford them. Close them down or make people pay. That will certainly fix up the waiting queues in public hospitals, because they will not be public anymore, because you will have to pay, because we will not have the money. The Defence Force: you will be able to see your ships all the time. You will be able to get a marvellous sense of pride, because our fleet will always be in port, because it will not be able to afford to go to sea. Pensions: forget about pension rises; forget about pensions altogether. This is what happens when you get out of control.

They ask, 'Why?' You say, 'Because that is where you are going to live, unless you get it under control.' The Labor Party can smirk, but I do not want you to smirk; I want you to show me how you can pay the money back. I want you to prove to the Australian people that you can pay debt back, because you have a commodity based economy and you have got debt in boom times. God help us when you have to pay it back when times are not so good. If you cannot make your two ends meet now, what hope have you got in the future? I would love to make the Labor Party sweat on this. I really would. I would really like to ring a bell for the Australian people about exactly what you are doing and where it is all going, so they could understand the sort of strife we are getting ourselves into. But apparently that is irresponsible—and I understand that. But the Australian people have to understand that under this crowd—with all their stories, like they are going to cool the planet; they are going to build a new, multibillion dollar telephone network; they are going to do this; they are going to do that—you always have to go to the article of truth. The key performance indicator for any government or organisation is whether your debt is going up or down. Do you have the capacity to pay your bills as and when they fall due? I might remind the Australian people that the way we pay out interest bill in this nation is that we just borrow more money. Capitalise your interests. In accounting terms it is called 'economic palliative care'. But we do it. We just naively stumble along, with this group of people who have no hope. There is no hope and no competence.

I will briefly—given the hour—respond to a few issues. Obviously, senators would be aware that these are the appropriation bills and they form the core of this, the fourth, Labor budget, a budget that builds a more produc­tive workforce, including a $3 billion training package. This budget delivers a plan for better schools, hospitals and health care, including a significant spend on mental health services and regional health services. It will also ensure that we remain on track to get in the black by 2012-13.

I would make the point that this is a budget that returns to surplus by 2012-13, with the budget growing both in size and as a share of

This does represent the fastest fiscal consolidation since at least the 1960s, around 3.8 per cent over two years. This has been achieved despite significant revenue weakness from the legacy effects of the global financial crisis, an event which had an extraordinarily significant effect on the global economy and particularly on many developed economies but which the opposition appears to forget.
                                                                                                                        </p>

The two per cent cap is part of one of our fiscal rules. We have actually done better than that over the forward estimate periods. The average across the forward estimates averages one per cent per year, which is the lowest average real growth in expenditure over a similar period since the 1980s. And, of course, that is compared with real spending growth in excess of two per cent for most of the period the coalition were in government—an average growth of 3.7 per cent. The budget achieves savings of $22 billion in addition to the $83.6 billion identified in the last three Labor budgets. It delivers a net improvement to the bottom line of $5.2 billion across the forward estimates.
                                                                                                                        </p>

Government spending as a share of the economy falls. So, for those on the other side who like to speak about the importance of small government, it is a Labor government that is actually delivering a reduction in government spending as a share of the economy to 23.5 per cent of GDP by 2014-15. And, in case people suggest that is just because it is at a higher level because of the

Australia's net debt is forecast to peak at 7.2 per cent of GDP in 2011-12. This compares to an average net debt position of around 90 per cent of GDP in 2016 for most major advanced economies. Our peak net debt position is less than one-tenth that of comparable economies.

I think that is somewhat disingen­uous, given that it is in the legislation before the parliament and being debated. The senator also made some comments about the carbon price. We previously discussed that at length in estimates and in other fora. I would again make the point that the government have said very clearly: we will account for the carbon price in the usual way, after the package has been finalised—just as former Prime Minister Howard accounted for the

We agree, which is why we have put forward a budget with savings measures. I would make the point that in fact it is the coalition blocking a range of savings measures in this parliament that have an impact on the budget bottom line. If they are keen on a surplus, they need to demonstrate that by voting the right way.
                                                                                                                        </p>

                                                                                                                        </p>

                                                                                                                        </p>

In fact, as I indicated prior to this debate, if the coalition's position in terms of their voting record and their $10.6 billion black hole were included, the coalition would in fact be in deficit in every year of the forward estimates—not the party of surpluses but the party of deficits.

I am not sure if they are able to be responded to. He did make a point about debt and I thought he might like to be reminded of what Moody's ratings agency said after the budget:

                                                                                                                          I rise to speak on the Remuneration and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2011. This bill contains measures that extend and reinforce the authority and independence of the Remuneration Tribunal. When the Remuneration Tribunal was established in 1973 it had the sole authority to determine the base remuneration of parliamentarians. However, the Remuneration and Allowances Act 1990 removed this authority. This bill will restore that.
                                                                                                                         </p>
                                                                                                                         <p>
                                                                                                                          One of the key impacts of this bill will be that the determinations of the Remuneration Tribunal will no longer be subject to tabling or disallowance motions by members of parliament. Indeed, members of parliament will play no role in determination of remuneration. The coalition believes that an independent tribunal that is free from the political process is best placed to make determinations about members of parliament. An independent tribunal is an important measure to ensure that the public can have confidence in the process by which the remuneration of their elected representatives is determined. The process must be transparent and free from political connotations, and this bill will help the tribunal achieve that objective.
                                                                                                                         </p>
                                                                                                                         <p>
                                                                                                                          This bill will also extend the Remuneration Tribunal's authority to determine the remuneration of the Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Secretary of the Treasury. Furthermore, the president of the tribunal will also, with the secretaries of those two departments and the Public Service Com­missioner, decide upon the remuneration of other departmental secretaries. Additionally, it will also be the responsibility of the Remuneration Tribunal under this bill to determine a classification structure for departmental secretaries. These deliberations regarding the remuneration of departmental secretaries would also no longer be subject to disallowance motions by the parliament. The Remuneration Tribunal will be allowed to operate in a framework that allows it the independence to determine the most appropriate level of remuneration for members of parliament and senior depart­mental secretaries.

This is an important accountability mechanism and should go some way to ensuring that the public can have faith in the remuneration system for their elected federal representatives. This bill was referred to the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee for inquiry and report. The inquiry has been completed and the committee supported the measures contained in the bill. The report stated:
                                                                                                                         </p>
                                                                                                                         <p>
                                                                                                                          In relation to the removal of the provision for disallowance of Tribunal determinations relating to parliamentary entitlements, the committee notes this decision will reinforce the indepen­dence of the Remuneration Tribunal and ensure the integrity of the process to determine the remuneration of parliamentarians. The committee supports the view that this is an important mechanism to remove opportunities for political intervention.
                                                                                                                         </p>

That review did present a compelling case for reform.
                                                                                                                         </p>

The government will continue to seek to improve and make more transparent both the framework and the service delivery in this area. It is important work because it is critical to the enabling of members and senators in how we do our work representing our constituents in our system of representative democracy.

                                                                                                                           Parliamentarians that are supported by an effective, efficient and transparent system of remuneration and entitlements will do their jobs better. This bill is an important initiative in the reform of that framework. The bill will restore the power of the independent Remuneration Tribunal to determine the base salary of parliamentarians. It will allow the tribunal to determine the remuneration and other terms and conditions of departmental secretaries and the remuneration and recreational leave entitlements of other officers established under the Public Service Act 1999. In restoring the tribunal's power to determine the base salary of parlia­mentarians, the bill will implement the cornerstone recommendation in the report of the Committee for the Review of Parlia­mentary Entitlements. It will restore the power to set parliamentary base salaries to the independent Remuneration Tribunal, beyond the reach of any potential political interference. The committee made a range of recommendations around parliamentary entitlements. The government has agreed to the cornerstone recommendation of the review. This bill implements this recom­mendation and, by doing so, will provide more transparency and, importantly, independence in the determination of parliamentarians' base salary. As I have indicated, the government has agreed to the first recommendation of the report and is implementing it in this bill. The remaining recommendations of the report have been referred to the Remuneration Tribunal, which will provide advice to the government in due course.

Pay was initially set by the Constitution and then by the parliament itself, under the auspices of the Constitution. With the enactment of the Remuneration Tribunal Act in 1973, the Remuneration Tribunal became responsible for setting parliamentarians' base salary. However, the tribunal's authority to deter­mine parliamentarians' base salary was removed by the Remuneration and Allow­ances Act 1990. The bill restores the Remuneration Tribunal’s role of conclus­ively determining parliamentary base salary. This change will enable parliamentary base salary to be determined in its own right, rather than by the current arrangement, where it is set by reference to a figure determined for another purpose and a matter for decision by the government of the day.

                                                                                                                           The current situation has resulted in outcomes on parliamentarians' salaries being determined by political considerations, to the detriment of considered and informed decision making on appropriate remuner­ation. The government notes that Remuneration Tribunal determinations on parliamentarians' remuneration were disallowed or varied by legislation in 1975, 1979, 1981, 1982, 1986 and 1990, prior to the passage of the Remuneration and Allowances Act 1990. Since this enactment, parliamentary base salaries have been determined by the executive arm of government. The pre-1990 situation, where determinations were subject to regular disallowance, was also unsatisfactory. It was also inconsistent with the independent nature of the tribunal. Accordingly, the government has decided that, in addition to the restoration of the Remuneration Tribunal's power to determine parliamentarians' base salaries, the tribunal's determinations of parliamentary remuneration will, in future, not be disallowable. This will reinforce the independence of the tribunal and ensure the integrity of the scheme for determining the remuneration of parliamentarians by removing, to the greatest extent possible, opportunities for intervention in the imple­mentation of the tribunal's deter­minations by the beneficiaries of those determinations.

To ensure openness and trans­parency of the Remuneration Tribunal's decision making, the tribunal will be required to make its decisions public and publish reasons for them.

Those amendments implement the government's 2007 election commitment to make the Remuneration Tribunal responsible for determining the remuneration of departmental secretaries and other public office holders under the Public Service Act 1999.

The Remuneration Tribunal would determine the amount of remuneration that is to be paid to the Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Secretary of the Treasury.

As is the case currently with determinations made by the Prime Minister, the Remuner­ation Tribunal's determinations of the remuneration and other conditions of departmental secretaries would not be subject to disallowance.

                                                                                                                          </p>

The government will be moving an amendment to the bill to implement these measures. The measures contained in this bill restore independence and transparency to the remuneration of parliamentarians, depart­mental secretaries and the other office holders I have mentioned. As I said earlier, a system that sees parliamentarians supported by an efficient, effective and transparent system of remuneration and entitlements, removed from political interference, will allow public servants to do their job better. The measures in this bill are an important step towards that goal.

I am grateful for the discussions that I have had in general terms with the Special Minister of State's office in relation to these issues broadly. I just want to clarify a few things. Firstly, schedule 2 contains amendments in relation to the salaries of parliamentarians and implements the recom­mendation of the committee for a review of parliamentary entitlements—the Belcher review—which proposed to restore the ability of the tribunal to determine parliamentary base salary, require the tribunal to publish reasons for its decisions in relation to parliamentary remuneration and remove parliament's ability to disallow parliamentary remuneration determinations made by the tribunal. I note that my colleague Senator Bob Brown, in his minority report for the

That relates to the extent to which there can be appropriate public input into the process to ensure some openness so that, if politicians are seeking a pay rise or a change in their conditions, there must be some transparency in the process, in the same way, I guess, that Fair Work Australia may work. To what extent can the Remuneration Tribunal in its current form have a process that is seen to be more inclusive and transparent with respect to the setting of parliamentarians' pay? Is that something that is covered within the scope of the current powers of the tribunal, in addition to the proposed amendments?

In terms of transparency, this is a big step in the right direction and certainly one of the intentions of the other bill.

I understand that there is greater transparency than before, which is welcome, but, in the framework that is being proposed for greater transparency, does the govern­ment consider that it would mean that the tribunal could open up its hearings and, for instance, call for public submissions to look at comparative pay and conditions in other sectors of the economy, ask for comments from parliamentarians as to the nature of the work they do, and ask for comments from other interest groups before deciding what the appropriate level of remuneration would be? Is that something that could be done within what is being proposed, which is in addition to the current framework? In other words, is there scope for the tribunal to have that additional level of public and community input?

In the new bill, they would be required to print the reasons for any decision making. In terms of any of their processes, that would be a matter for the tribunal to make themselves. The tribunal, as I have said and as Senator Fifield has said and everyone has noted, are independent in terms of their decision making, but they are also independent in terms of their processes.

Does that mean that the tribunal does have the power, given its independence, to, for instance, decide that the mechanism by which it calls for submissions is a public one and it could seek submissions quite broadly—from the community, from parliamentarians, from interest groups and from the general public? Also, does it have the capacity, should it so wish, to hold public hearings in relation to its process of making a determination?

Maybe this is a question I could put to the opposition as well, and I presume that Senator Fifield is hanging onto my every word. If the tribunal had a process whereby they did have public hearings into their determinations, is that something that the government would be comfortable with, regarding the way the tribunal operates? It is a similar issue to that of the opposition—if there were an additional level of openness.

I think we all acknowledge that the tribunal's decision making must be independent, but would that independence be in any way compromised if there were a requirement, for instance—and it will not be debated on this occasion—for the tribunal to hold public hearings and consider a broad range of evidence before reaching a decision, without in any way influencing what that ultimate decision may be? Is that something that the government would consider as in any way interfering with the independence of the tribunal?

I just want to leave it at this: I will write to the tribunal and ask them whether they will seek to open up the process—and I believe it ought to be—and to have a much more public process in the determinations. I do welcome what the government is proposing for a publication of reasons. That is of course welcome. I think it would be fair to say that, if you open up the process, that does not impede or compromise independence as a tribunal and it may well be that this matter will be revisited. I will leave it at that and I look forward to corresponding with the tribunal to see what they say about opening up their process so that it is seen as much more transparent than many in the community believe is currently the case.

But I do not know of any determination by the tribunal that parliament has interfered with to increase. What this legislation is about is the government and the opposition supporting a recommendation which takes away not only the right but also the respon­sibility of parliament to curb a grant of extra payments to parliamentarians at a time when the rest of the community is not getting them. That will come down the line again. Sure, it is good that we have an independent tribunal looking at parliamentary salaries and entitlements, but it is beyond common sense that we remove from parliament the right and responsibility written into the Constitution that we determine ultimately the salaries of parliamentarians. This is a cosy and con­venient piece of legislation to say that the Remuneration Tribunal should keep parlia­mentarians' salaries increasing above the level of salaries and income for the rest of Australians, because that is the trajectory, but please shield us from the responsibility of keeping that in check. This is just an easy way for MPs to say, 'We do not want controversy as we get increases which are out of kilter with the average worker in this country.' I for one, and on behalf of my colleagues, am prepared to take on that responsibility. We have always had it and we should retain it.

Is the next thing going to be a further recommendation going through the Remuneration Tribunal that our electoral allowances be rolled into the salaries so that we no longer have an obligation, at least an implicit obligation, to spend money on our electorates and have it go instead straight into our pockets?

As I understand it, it means that for those members of parliament elected prior to 2004, who are in a different superannuation scheme from those elected post 2004, it means therefore that there is that ability to roll various allowances including a travel allowance into the remuneration package by virtue of these amendments. I think that was one of the issues that Senator Brown was concerned about.

For example, $30,000 or $40,000 of electorate allowance is going to go straight to salaries under this trajectory that we are seeing in this parliament now. MPs can currently spend their electorate allowance on themselves if they want to, but the at least implicit obligation is going to be removed. We all know what that means: it is going to mean that in the electorates where there will not be an electorate allowance there will be less money going to the electorates. There are people who spend more than their electorate allowance on their electorates at the moment, and there are some who spend almost nothing of that electorate allowance on their electorates, but what this does is validate the second component of that: it validates that money being transferred into MPs' packages with no strings attached, not even an inherent obligation to spend the money on the electorates.
                                                                                                                                                      </p>

                                                                                                                                                       I know what will happen next: there will be legislation coming into this parliament a couple of years down the line to restore electorate allowances on top of the new salaries. That is something for the majority in this house and the other house to do if they wish. I believe that this legislation removing our responsibility and, indeed, the debates that have regularly occurred about MPs' salary increases are a shedding of our own responsibility to the electorate to be moderate in our assessment of our own worth. We are paid well and we do have good allowances compared to other parliaments around the world, but we have a responsibility, after an independent tribunal makes recommendations, to ensure, for example, that that is in keeping with what other people, who have voted us into the parliament, are getting.
                                                                                                                                                      </p>

                                                                                                                                                       I will not labour this point. I support the new measures of accountability of the tribunal—that it should publish its reasons and that it should be able to assess base salaries—but really the crucial point of this legislation is ridding ourselves as parliamentarians of the need from time to time to get up and contribute to a debate about how much we are worth, how much we should be paid and how closely that is related to the value of other workers in our community. I reiterate that the Constitution puts that obligation on us very early, and it is one that we should be keeping, not trying to shed off our shoulders through this piece of legislation.

Of course, politicians and members of parliament can make submissions to the tribunal, and also they can make public statements at any time about what they believe is appropriate, but in the end what we are attempting to do as a parliament is to ensure that the independence and transparency are there for the deliberations of the tribunal. At the same time, parliament still retains the right to amend the legislation at any time. The right is obviously there and is something that could be considered in future.

I have sent submissions to the tribunal, and I almost always found they got little reception. Maybe it should be this way. It is an obscure tribunal that is out there somewhere, divorced from any close working relation­ship with MPs. Maybe that is a good thing. But, Senator—through you, Chair—on your suggestion that we send submissions to the tribunal, I found that a process that has not been very rewarding in the past. Maybe after this legislation it will improve.

Given the proposed new powers of the tribunal—which from my point of view, in terms of their accountability provisions, are obviously welcome—what is the position of the government and the opposition in relation to making submissions to the tribunal with respect to the new powers it will have to roll in components of a member of parliament's entitlements into the overall salary package?

Presumably, there will be some submissions, one way or the other, as to the tribunal's new powers and in terms of its deliberations.

As senators and members would know, their parliamentary allowance is effectively their salary for superannuation purposes. Without the amendments current and former parliamentarians who are members of the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Scheme, established under the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act 1948, could also receive increased superannuation benefits if the tribunal decides to incorporate any allowances into their parliamentary allow­ance. This would occur as, under the scheme, the benefits of former parliamentarians and eligible dependants are linked to the salaries of current parliamentarians.
                                                                                                                                                             </p>

                                                                                                                                                              As a consequence, each increase in the salary payable to current parliamentarians increases the superannuation income of members of the PCSS who are no longer in the parliament. This benefit would also flow to PCSS who subsequently leave the parliament. The amendments provide the tribunal with the authority to determine that a portion of parliamentary base salary is not 'parliamentary allowance' for the purposes of the 1948 act. Accordingly, a person covered by the 1948 act would not be entitled to receive superannuation benefits based on those amounts. The intention of the amendments is to ensure that the independent Remuneration Tribunal, should it be granted responsibility for determining parliamentarians base salaries, will be able to exercise that responsibility without creating unintended benefits for members of the 1948 act scheme. These amendments are consistent with a recommendation in the report of the review of parliamentary entitlements and further demonstrate the government's commitment to an efficient, effective and transparent system of remuneration and entitlements for parliamentarians.

I acknowledge the minister's openness in the answers he has given me. I have had some frustrations in my dealings with the Remuneration Tribunal. Again, this is not a criticism, but I believe there is scope to further improve this once we see how the tribunal deals with its new powers. I foreshadow that I will be moving amendments to ensure that the processes of the tribunal are more open and transparent—I will firstly correspond with the tribunal but, if the response is not satisfactory from my point of view, I will do so. I think the more transparent it is, the greater the confidence the Australia people will have in the process by which politicians' pay is set. I acknowledge how hard every one of my colleagues in the chamber works, but I think it is important that there is a much better process in terms of openness and transparency. That may be the case with the tribunal's new powers. If the tribunal's response is not satisfactory, I will be moving a bill to amend this further. But I look forward to having further discussions with the opposition and, indeed, the government in relation to the openness of the process for setting the remuneration of members of parliament.

I have been a member of the committee and its predecessors for some time but will not be part of that inquiry. I want to take this, my last, opportunity to make some comments about the circum­stances which the Australian industry now faces and which will no doubt be the subject of examination by the committee, and perhaps others, in the coming months.

I noted that LiveCorp has appointed Mr Cameron McDonald as Animal Welfare Manager, effective from May 2010, based in Jakarta. There are also repeated reports on the website of LiveCorp since that time about the importance of animal welfare and the talk of encouraging better practices and the use of stunning in the process for slaughter of those animals.

I do note that Meat &amp; Livestock Australia is funded by and represents red meat producers in Australia and, if one is to believe its website, has a duty of care to Australian farmers, particularly to helping them meet community and consumer expectations with regard to their industry.

In talking about the number of facilities, for example, it says that Indonesia tops the list of the number of slaughter facilities, with 800 officially registered slaughterhouses. The report makes particular remarks about the country of Indonesia. It says:

The shift to a market economy and decentralization led to the opening of many small, private slaughter facilities with poor hygienic standards but which attracted the majority of livestock due to the lower cost. Although offering much better hygienic standards, the central abattoir in Jakarta now operates only at 10 percent of its capacity. Some municipalities (Bogor and Yogyakarta) recently built good medium-sized abattoirs with line slaughter for cattle. Both have not gone operational as yet because of disputes with the local butcher communities who prefer to continue slaughtering in the traditional way.

The bodies charged with the responsibility of representing the live export industry, LiveCorp, and meat producers in Australia, MLA, ought to be condemned by their membership. If the opposition in this place takes a reasoned and responsible position on this matter they will ensure that those bodies bear the opprobrium that they should bear in relation to this matter because it is those bodies who are primarily responsible for the livelihoods of Australian farmers, particularly in Northern Australia, who may for some time lose markets in Indonesia because of the unacceptable practices which have been developing for some time in that market and clearly have gone without any reasonable interruption. If you have a reasonable interruption, if you have an industry with 800 processing facilities, many operating at very basic standards, there can be no guarantee of reasonable animal welfare standards.
