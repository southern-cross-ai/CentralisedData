        My question is to the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator Carr, in his role representing the Minister for Resources, Energy and Tourism. It relates to the government’s proposal to dump radioactive waste at Muckaty Station, close to

Can the minister explain why after the 2007 election responsibility for radioactive waste management was transferred from the Innovation, Industry, Science and Research portfolio, where it had been for decades, to the Resources, Energy and Tourism portfolio where there is no expertise whatsoever in radioactive waste management.

                 That is an arrangement between two ministers that would have been determined by the Prime Minister. I am not aware of why the transfer of responsibilities from Senator Carr to the Minister for Resources, Energy and Tourism, Mr Ferguson, occurred. The officers in the division were transferred. It is your prerogative to ask a question, but I do not really see how a question about the process of transferring ministerial responsibility from one minister to another would be particularly informative for you. Nevertheless, I will take it on notice and see what information I can find for you.

                     , on a point of order on relevance, the minister appears to be answering my previous question. The question that I just put to him was whether the minister would take responsibility back for this portfolio.

                      I think I ruled at the start that the minister may well have difficulty in answering for a minister that he is not representing, but I do invite the minister to answer on behalf of the minister that he is representing. If there is anything further that the minister wishes to add then the minister can do so. There is no point of order.
