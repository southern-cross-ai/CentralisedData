        Tonight I pay tribute to a great Australian who made a significant contribution to my home state of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and, indeed, to the nation. It is with great sadness that I stand in this place tonight to speak of the passing of Robert John Hasting Atkins, who died last month.
       </p>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Atkins" rel="nofollow">
         Robert Atkins
        </a>
        was one of South Australia’s most respected businessmen and—more than that—a great community leader. He is perhaps best known for being the man who saved the iconic
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">

        retailer

         Harris Scarfe
        </a>
        , and in the process saved 1,500 local jobs. It is a measure of the man that when others were convinced there was no hope for Harris Scarfe when it faced collapse in 2001, Robert found a way forward, and now the business that could have been lost is thriving.
       </p>
       <p>
        Robert’s broader career in the retail sector spanned some 25 years. Robert was
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        of Burmah Fuels in Australia, president and chief executive of Coca Cola Amatil’s business operations in the Philippines, director of Castrol, and general manager of buying and marketing with Kmart, to name a few. Such was his passion for creating jobs and opportunities, Robert was the South Australian president of the Australian Retailers Association, president of Business
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SA" rel="nofollow">
         SA
        </a>
        and chairman of the Rundle Mall Management Authority. Such was his passion for others, Robert was tireless—some would say relentless—with the time and energy he gave to charities and philanthropic causes. I will have more to say about that soon.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sadly, some two weeks ago, following a long battle with cancer, Robert passed away. He was just 52 years of age. At his funeral, his best friend,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Baird" rel="nofollow">
         David Baird
        </a>
        , said simply, ‘Everything Robert turned his hand to, he made effortless.’ I first met Robert in 2001 at a meeting of the Australian Retailers Association in Adelaide. I speak not only for myself but for many others when I say that on first meeting Robert you could not help but be struck by the commanding presence of the man—his razor sharp intellect and wit and, above all, his zeal and passion for getting things done. I very much valued his wisdom, his advice and, above all, his friendship.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whilst he was a major employer and was identified with business he also worked constructively with unions and he rightly had their respect. Robert told me on a number of occasions of the respect that he had for the then head of the Shop Assistants Union—the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SDA" rel="nofollow">
         SDA
        </a>
        —in South Australia, the now Senator Don Farrell. Senator Farrell, as head of the union, played a key role in brokering a way forward during the Harris Scarfe crisis of 2001. He played a key role in saving those 1,500 jobs. I understand Senator Farrell will pay his own tribute to Robert shortly, but the fact that Robert was so widely and deeply respected by both employers and employees alike says a lot about the decency and fairness of the man. He was also widely and deeply respected by political leaders, and South Australia’s

       </p>
       <p>
        Robert also committed a great deal of his time and effort to charity work. He was the inaugural chair of Bedford Industries, which provides work and opportunities for the disabled. He served on the Board of the Council of the Australian Business Arts Foundation and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_Foundation" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , and he worked tirelessly for many other charities and philanthropic causes.

        Business SA Chief Executive,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Vaughan" rel="nofollow">
         Peter Vaughan
        </a>
        , told the
        <i>
         Advertiser
        </i>
        newspaper that Robert provided ‘strong, clear and vibrant leadership’ to the business community in South Australia. Indeed, while not everyone always agreed with him, Robert was a true reformer when it came to business. His friend and fellow businessman, Stirling Griff, says Robert was someone you could find yourself having a very spiritual discussion with around business or ethics. In fact, you could name the issue—Stirling reminded me—and find yourself engaging in a lengthy discussion on just about anything. Robert was a man with strong opinions—there is no doubt. But at the same time, if you presented him with a sound argument, he would hear what you had to say. He would be convinced to agree with you and would move on. Many in the business world say one of the most remarkable things about Robert is that he was always a very consultative person. He added so much to the world of business but at the same time was always humble enough to listen if others knew a better way.
       </p>
       <p>
        In delivering his eulogy, David Baird also said that this is not the eulogy of a life that could have been or of a life wasted but—tragically, for all of us—of a life cut short. David said that shortly before Robert died he went with him to see one of his treating doctors. When the issue of his age came up, Robert told the doctor not to worry because, ‘For every year of my life, I’ve lived three.’ And he had.
       </p>
       <p>
        Robert is survived by his devoted wife, Deborah, and his sons, Michael, Timothy, Christopher and Matthew. His passing is Australia’s great loss, and will especially be felt in my home state. I extend my deepest sympathies to his loved ones.
