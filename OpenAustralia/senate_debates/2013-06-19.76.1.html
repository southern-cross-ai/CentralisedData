        My question is to the minister representing the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, Senator Lundy. Can the minister explain to the Senate why it is so vitally important that all states and territories sign up to A National Plan for School Improvement?

         I thank Senator Crossin for her question and her ongoing commitment to education. As we know, Australia has great schools but we can do a lot better. An independent review by the Gonski panel found the current school-funding system is too complex and lacks transparency.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPLAN" rel="nofollow">

         results show that one in 12 of our kids is not meeting minimum standards in reading, writing and maths. These kids are in danger of leaving school without the skills they need for adult life.
        </p>
        <p>
         The result of this is that the gap between students is widening, with our disadvantaged students struggling to keep up, particularly our Indigenous students in the Northern Territory in years 7 and 9, who were found to be about four years below the performance of non-Indigenous students in reading and numeracy. This is why we have the National Plan for School Improvement. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to resource schools properly for future generations.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our plan for better schools will make sure that every kid reaches their full potential. Our plan includes more attention and support in the classroom for every single child; specialist literacy and numeracy programs for those children in danger of being left behind; greater assistance for those students with disabilities or special needs; and, finally, building the skills and knowledge of teachers and providing mentoring support for new staff. All of these points are attributes of our plan for improvement in schools. We believe as a government that this is truly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for investment in our education system. If we are to prepare Australia for the significant challenges of the 21st century then it starts here in our education system, in our schools.

             I thank Senator Crossin again. And, again, it is good to see her focused on the Northern Territory with her longstanding interest in education policy. As the Prime Minister and Minister Garrett released today, under A National Plan for School Improvement government schools in the Northern Territory will receive a boost of around $205 million while nongovernment schools will receive an extra $95 million in funding over the next six years. The national plan will particularly help Indigenous students in the Territory through specific funding loadings for Aboriginal and
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
              Torres Strait Islander
             </a>
             students and small, remote schools. As such, from the total public funding provided to the Territory over the next six years, 41,000 students will benefit from the $921 million in funding through location loadings across 190 schools in total.

               Unfortunately, it appears as though, once again, the Liberal and National parties are putting petty politics before the future of our children. We saw it in the Territory budget in May. Today, the Prime Minister has provided solid figures and facts to put the case once again to the

               of the Northern Territory that this funding will benefit all students, teachers and parents in the Northern Territory. You only have to listen to the wordsâ€”and I suggest those opposite listen carefullyâ€”of the Northern Territory education minister,
