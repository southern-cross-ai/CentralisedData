        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for

         ATSIC
        </a>
        in the Constitution'. Given the failure of ATSIC to improve the outcomes, opportunities and hopes of Indigenous people in areas of health, education and employment and the fact Labor supported the abolition of ATSIC, why is the Minister for Indigenous Australians using ATSIC as the basis for the Labor Party's model?

         I thank Senator Price for her question. I would begin by acknowledging the huge amount of work that the Minister for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
          Indigenous Australians
         </a>
         , assisted by Senator Malarndirri McCarthy and Senator Dodson, has done in supporting the Prime Minister and the announcement he made on Saturday about progressing a referendum and voice, treaty and truth. This is a period of time—and certainly we discussed it this morning in our party room—of enormous pride to get behind and build momentum to amend the Constitution with a referendum—

          : with all due respect to Senator Gallagher, Senator Nampijinpa Price's question was very, very clear. It was in relation to comments made by the minister on
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATSIC" rel="nofollow">
           ATSIC

          is using ATSIC as the basis for the Labor Party's model. It wasn't about the work that had been done to date; it wasn't about anything, yet, that Senator Gallagher is referring to.

                   I didn't see the minister's comments, but I know the minister well and have had many conversations with her about this, as I have with many of my colleagues on this side of the chamber. The point, I think, of the discussions that we've been having since the Prime Minister's address on Saturday is really about progressing constitutional recognition for Aboriginal and

                     and why the Minister for

                     is using ATSIC as the basis for the Labor Party model. I put it to you—and I may have to request that you have a look at your rulings—that the mere mention of a word in a question does not enable the minister to refer to that particular word as the answer.

As the Prime Minister has said, there will be further consultation and deliberation with

Earlier the same day, the Prime Minister outlined that the Australian parliament would decide what the voice will look like—after the referendum. On behalf of all Australians, can the minister please clarify who is correct: the Prime Minister or Minister Burney?

                          Again, the approach that the Prime Minister has made is around consulting, and consulting widely. That work needs to be undertaken. Minister Burney will be leading that, along with Senator Dodson.

                          Obviously there will be a mechanism for the voice, but we are not determining that ourselves. For too long, policies have been imposed rather than developed. And that is the work that needs to be done now. We won't play the game of dividing people on the basis of certain quotes that I haven't heard. This is a process where we would like to work together, to reach across the chamber, to hear different views, to have that fed back in—we understand there isn't unanimous agreement even in this parliament, let alone outside the parliament. So let's work together to deliver a magnificent outcome for this country.
