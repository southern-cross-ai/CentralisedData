            AUSTRAC

           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth_Mint" rel="nofollow">
            Perth Mint
           </a>
           's compliance with anti-money-laundering and counterterrorism finance laws. It's also why the WA government is investing $34 million to overhaul the Perth Mint's internal systems and procedures and has commissioned a comprehensive strategic review into the Perth Mint's future. AUSTRAC and the WA government are taking these matters seriously, as we are. The senator knows this motion will not only duplicate this effort but also risks compromising these independent investigations. We do not support a motion that is driven by state politics that would disrespect and undermine due process.
