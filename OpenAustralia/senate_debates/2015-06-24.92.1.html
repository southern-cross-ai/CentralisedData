         I thank Senator Lindgren for her question. I am pleased to inform the Senate that the government recently announced a new initiative in partnership with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UnitingCare_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          UnitingCare Australia
         </a>
         that will assist mothers and women to get back into the workforce. The scheme will create jobs pathways for women who will be selected and placed into ongoing employment with UnitingCare agencies across Australia in the community and aged-care sectors. The scheme will be piloted at sites in Sydney, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide and will commence on 1 July 2015.
        </p>
        <p>
         This initiative will be particularly helpful for women who have spent time caring for children or other family members and who now wish to re-enter the workforce. The scheme will also provide opportunities for those disadvantaged and vulnerable women to access employment pathways, which will of course help break down the barriers to workforce participation and assist them and their families out of the poverty cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
         Pre-employment training and other requirements for applicants will be identified and addressed as part of the scheme. Induction training, mentoring, peer support, and post-placement support will be provided to maximise the opportunity for successful and ongoing integration back into the workforce. It is based on job seeker services and funding in place under the employment services model which commences on 1 July.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is an entrepreneurial and practical approach to creating jobs pathways for women who have been out of the workforce and may not realise the skills they already have. Positions that will be taken up could be in areas, including: transport and administration; aged care; early-years care; palliative care; disability; and homeless support work. This project is a win-win for the women themselves; their families; the sectors in which they will be working; UnitingCare Australia, which will provide the vital services to the community; and the Australian community as a whole.

           Through budget measures and programs such as the UnitingCare project, this government is improving the opportunity for sustainable employment outcomes for all of those in the workforce, and in particular for those who want to be in the workforce. Increasing women's workforce participation and economic empowerment is one of the most powerful ways to improve the country's economic prosperity and living standards.
          </p>
          <p>
           The ability of a woman to earn an income and participate in work reduces her susceptibility to poverty, to homelessness and, of course, to family violence. That is why we have announced a budget which has women at its heart. It includes our families package, which will deliver a more affordable and accessible childcare system, allowing more Australian women to enter and stay in the workforce; and of course our small business and jobs package, which will support women in small business and encourage more women entrepreneurs.

             Greater labour force participation by women will reduce the disparity in outcomes for women and men, with resulting benefits for families, personal skills development, women's financial independence and their retirement incomes. The government has funded a range of initiatives, including the project with UnitingCare. These include: our partnership with ASIC to upgrade the MoneySmart website, which includes new content designed to improve women's financial literacy at all stages of their life; funding the

             to deliver a practical resource on employers' legal obligations, employees' rights and strategies to assist working parents to navigate various family stages, such as pregnancy, parental leave and return to work; and, of course, supporting disadvantaged women to find sustainable employment and to increase their financial independence through our partnership with Fitted for Work.
