       <p>
        Last week I went with my partner Tim—good old Tim!—to the Launceston Salvation Army and volunteered to do breakfast. I flipped eggs and bacon until 150-odd sandwiches were made, and Timmy served coffee out the front. Breakfast at a cafe is something we all do, and the Salvos give those who are in need in Lonnie and in other towns a cafe that they can walk into and feel accepted. Without the help of volunteers, volunteer organisations and small business support, the homeless and those in immediate need will lose access to the important help that these services provide.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite one-quarter of Aussies volunteering in Tassie, volunteering is still in decline. This is not just a Tassie issue; it's Australia wide. Volunteers are important. Volunteering is valuable. Without the Salvos serving a regular breakfast, there will be people on the street starving. My family has a long history of doing what they can when they can. We used to go to cemeteries and do clean-ups. We used to take care of the graves and have afternoon tea there while we were at it. We'd also volunteer through other church activities and Parents and Friends and other organisations through the school.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm passionate about my community in Tassie, but I want you all to be passionate about your patches as well. Without volunteers, community events may close. Connections to community are lost and valuable ties fade into the past. An example of this is Evandale in Tassie. The annual penny-farthing championship is in jeopardy because there are no volunteers to help run it. That would be an shame. The championship is a volunteer-run and volunteer-led event. It has operated for over 40 years, and the volunteers just aren't there anymore.
       </p>
       <p>
        National events and local events are at risk and, more importantly, community connection is at risk. Find your niche. Find your place. Find your passion. But go out and volunteer today. It's important.
