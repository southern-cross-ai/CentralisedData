        My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Evans. I refer the minister to the fact that the people on board the

             I have never been accused of talking too softly in this chamber; there have in fact occasionally been allegations to the contrary! As I was saying, there is an agreement that these people will be disembarked in Indonesia and then be processed by the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNHCR" rel="nofollow">
              UNHCR
             </a>
             over any asylum claims they have. We are confident that we will be able to see a successful disembarkation. The Australian authorities are obviously working with Indonesian authorities on how that might occur. We are very confident in the professionalism of the Customs officers on board the vessel, and they will obviously work out a plan of action with Indonesian officials to effect the disembarkation. I might say, though, that it is our intention that they be disembarked in Indonesia. While the passengers may prefer another destination, that is the intention, and we hope to see them disembarked in the near future.

               I thank the senator for her question. I am not sure whether she is arguing that they should be taken to
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island" rel="nofollow">
                Christmas Island
               </a>
               or should not. I have heard so many different positions from the opposition on this. But, turning to the first part of her question, I can indicate that the provincial governor seems to have softened his earlier comments and is quoted as saying:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               But if it’s an order from Jakarta, we have to accept it.
              </p>
              <p>
               I note that a spokesperson for President Yudhoyono has clarified Indonesia’s position and that they will be honouring the undertaking from the president that they will cooperate in the disembarkation of those passengers at the Indonesian port. So we expect that agreement to come to fruition, as I say, and we expect those passengers to be disembarked at the port of Kijang.

I know that people in this chamber are also very much aware that comments should not be directed across the chamber when senators are on their feet; they should be directed through the chair. If people on both my left and my right desist from these interjections, we can get on with question time.
