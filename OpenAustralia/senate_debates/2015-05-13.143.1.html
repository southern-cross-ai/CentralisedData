        My question is to the Hon. Senator
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Birmingham" rel="nofollow">
         Simon Birmingham
        </a>
        , representing the Minister for the Environment. My question to him is being delivered on behalf of fellow Queenslander Gwenda Casey from Birkdale in Queensland. In 2012
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Burke" rel="nofollow">
         Tony Burke
        </a>
        declared 40 new marine reserves around Australia and, as well, implemented management plans for the new parks to provide increased protection for Australia's unique and vulnerable marine environment. Some of these areas are habitats for humpback whales, blue whales, sea lions and other creatures. Senator, could you please explain why your government has suspended the management plans for the new parks and placed the status of the new parks on hold while you undertake a review?

         I thank Senator Glenn Lazarus for the question and I thank Gwenda for raising the issue as well. I say to Senator Lazarus and his constituent that it is correct that this government believe we can do much better in the management of Commonwealth marine reserves. It was our opinion that the previous government seriously bungled the creation of new marine reserves in 2012 and that, in doing so, they trampled over the sustainable maritime community to achieve a political outcome. They rushed consultation and they shut recreational fishermen in particular out of the process. In Queensland, I certainly invite and encourage Senator Lazarus to make sure that he is talking to both his professional and his recreational fishing communities about their concerns with the process that was undertaken. I think he will find that many of his constituents shared the concerns that the coalition had, which is why we acted.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our intention is to deliver a better environmental outcome that reflects community views and maintains the sound economics required for our fishing industry as well. We want to strike the right and sensible balance. We are undertaking genuine community consultation with local communities. Five bioregional advisory panels have held more than 170 regional public meetings all over the country throughout February, March and April this year to ensure that we have proper consultation on how to get the marine reserve plans right in future and not repeat the types of mistakes that the Labor Party made. The four-month consultation period review received more than 13,000 written submissions and approximately 1,800 responses to the online survey. There is enormous community interest in this in this—I acknowledge that, Senator Lazarus—but also a lot of particular interest from the fishing communities, which I would encourage you to speak with as well.

          And, I understand, the mining companies, too.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I understand that the management plans prevented mining activity in the new marine reserves. Because the reserves are under review and the management plans have been suspended, your government is understood to have issued exploration licences and special prospecting authorities in these parks. Is that true?

           I will look into that matter for Senator Lazarus. If he has any particular examples or areas of concern I would invite him to provide them to me or direct to Minister Hunt. If there is further information we will bring it back to the chamber.

            dated 25 April this year, which states that seismic testing to look for petroleum has commenced in these marine parks. Can the minister please advise how many licences and/or authorities have been granted by the government and to which companies?

            <p>
             I can advise Senator Lazarus that no oil and gas activities will be permitted in sensitive marine areas. There will be no oil and gas exploration and production in sanctuary zones, in marine national parks of the Commonwealth marine reserves. This will be clearly reflected in the new management plans. We are making sure that we get the balance right on this. These reforms are not about allowing mining exploration in sensitive marine areas; that will not be permitted. This restriction will be reflected appropriately in the new management plans. If Minister Hunt has anything further to add in relation to the specific example we will bring that information back to the chamber.
