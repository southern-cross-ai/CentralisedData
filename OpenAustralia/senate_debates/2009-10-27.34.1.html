        My question is to Senator Faulkner, the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Could the minister tell us: when was the Commonwealth first aware that oil from the Montara oil spill had crossed into Indonesian waters? Which minister or department contacted which authorities and when? What arrangements, if any, have been made to monitor and assess the impacts of the oil on Indonesian waters? Are there any clean-up or compensation arrangements?

         I will try and deal with those important questions with the information I have available. The first date I am aware of is when the incident itself took place, which was 21 August 2009. As Senator Siewert and other senators would be aware, it is the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Maritime_Safety_Authority" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Maritime Safety Authority
         </a>
         â€™s responsibility to coordinate the clean-up under the National Plan to Combat Pollution of the Sea by Oil and other Noxious and Hazardous Substances. I can say that the majority of the oil remains within the vicinity of the platform and the closest sheen to the mainland is reported to be at least 200 kilometres from the Australian coast.
        </p>
        <p>
         I also can say that the area affected is being closely monitored by regular daily flights arranged by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMSA" rel="nofollow">
          AMSA
         </a>
         . As I understand it, AMSA has been keeping Indonesian authorities informed about the progress of any oil sheen near Indonesia. I can also inform the Senate that Indonesian officials have taken part in a daily observation flight aboard the AMSA Dornier search and rescue aircraft. In addition, I can say that reports taken on 25 October indicate patches of sheen to be around 230 kilometres from the Indonesian coast.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Is the minister aware of reports that there are in fact significant impacts on the livelihoods of at least 300 seaweed farmers on
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rote_Island" rel="nofollow">
           Rote Island
          </a>
          and on some subsistence fishers in Indonesian waters? This has been reported in the Indonesian media. Is the government aware of this? Has the government responded and has it taken any steps to validate that this is oil from the Montara spill?

           I thank Senator Siewert for her supplementary question. I am personally not aware of those reports and I do not know if any government agencies are, so all I can do there is undertake to find that out for you, Senator. I will do that. My understanding is that the oil spill is not in Indonesian territorial waters but, as I have indicated, some 230 kilometres from the nearest Indonesian coastline. That is the only information I have available to me, Senator Siewert. I can say that Indonesian authorities have been kept informed, through the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" rel="nofollow">
            Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade

           , of the location of the residual oil sheen and progress with the oil spill response and the relief well drilling operation.

            , I ask a further supplementary question. Once again I thank the minister for his answer. If the minister could take that on notice, it would be appreciated, because there are reports that the Indonesian authorities have been informed that oil has in fact entered Indonesian waters. If it has and if it is impacting on the livelihoods of some of the local Indonesians, could the minister also inform the Senate as to what obligations there are on the company to provide any redress and cover the costs incurred outside of Australian territorial waters? What actions, if any, has the government taken to pursue these matters?

             I thank Senator Siewert again for her supplementary question. As I have said, I am not aware of those specific reports. I have undertaken to find that out, and I will. Additionally, to assist Senator Siewert, I will ask about any obligations that might exist. I am sure that Senator Siewert would appreciate that that might mean that the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" rel="nofollow">
              Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
             </a>
             might need to establish that, possibly with other agencies. But I am happy to give the senator an undertaking that I will ensure that, if there is reason to answer that element of her questionâ€”obviously it is dependent on the threshold issue of where any oil sheen might be. I am certainly happy to undertake to do that, as I have outlined.
