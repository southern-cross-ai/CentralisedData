        My question is to Senator Kim Carr, the Minister representing the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth. Given the importance of teacher quality, what is the government doing to make sure that we have the best possible teachers for our students?

         I thank Senator Cameron for his interest in education and for this policy question. It is a pity we do not hear more about these types of things in this chamber, because we appreciate that education is, of course, the first priority of a Labor government. This is a simple proposition. We regard education as absolutely fundamental to the future of the nation. On this side we believe that quality teaching is fundamental to the learning experience of all students. Every senator here I am sure would recognise the importance of making sure that every teaching graduate has the required skills to be an effective teacher and positive role model. That is why this government will introduce new, more rigorous standards for teacher training courses.

         I note, Senator Mason, that members on your side of the chamber have in fact supported this approach. We acknowledge that on this matter there is a bipartisan approach to ensuring that we lift the quality of teacher education in Australia.

        <p>
         These new standards that the government will introduce will improve the quality of teachers graduating from universities and being employed in Australian schools. The four main elements to this plan include more rigorous and targeted admissions into university courses; a new literacy and numeracy test to ensure that students will have to satisfy before they graduate; a national approach to teacher practicum to ensure that new teachers have the skills, personal capacities and practical experience they need to do well; and a review of all teaching courses by the Tertiary Education Quality Standards Agency—TEQSA. Putting these steps in place will ensure that school communities have confidence in the abilities of new staff and will help ensure that parents—

           You are quite right. Despite the bipartisan approach on teacher quality, the fact remains that conservative state governments around this country have been cutting funds to education, and that has an immediate impact on students, on schools and on their families. Of course, there is a flow-on effect of these cuts; and, under the current funding system—a funding system that the opposition remains wedded to—these cuts will reduce the level of indexation and therefore the level of expenditure over time.
          </p>
          <p>
           In 2012 the indexation measure came down to 3.9 per cent. Senator Cameron is quite right about this. Because of the slower growth in the state funding arrangements, it has come down from a revised 6 per cent to 5.6 per cent across the forward estimates on a 10-year weighted average. The current funding system, if it is retained as those opposite would urge us to do, would see further reductions in that amount.

             I can confirm that the National Plan for School Improvement promises much better resources for all schools but does require the states to come to the party. The fact remains that, under the current indexation arrangements, about 60 per cent of those formulas are a result of the cost of schooling, particularly for teaching. That has seen a reduction in the level of support because the state governments are forcing down wages for schoolteachers despite the promises they made, particularly in Victoria. We are seeing that national responsibility is going begging because the state governments are refusing to take up the opportunity of a national school improvement plan.
            </p>
            <p>
             We understand that Premier Baillieu of Victoria—when he was the Premier—argued that he had a different plan. Premier Newman supported him in that approach. The Baillieu plan was a dud. Premier Baillieu is no more.
