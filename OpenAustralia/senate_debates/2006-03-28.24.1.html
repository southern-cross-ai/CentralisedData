         I thank the senator for the question. His state of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         is a very strong user of the temporary skilled migration program. Australia, as we all understand, is in the middle of an economic boom, and that is good news, but unfortunately it does lead to skills shortages. Labor’s approach to these circumstances would be to simply run this boom into the ground, as they have done with every boom that has ever come to Australia when they have been in office.
        </p>
        <p>
         We all remember that five lousy minutes of economic sunshine generated by the Keating government’s management of the economy. In contrast, this government has produced conditions that have enabled a long-term boom that we are all enjoying. The business long stay visa allows businesses to get people in with the skills they need to make the most of those conditions—not just to survive but to grow and expand while things are going well.
        </p>
        <p>
         The union movement and individual unions have embarked on a campaign of attacking this particular visa. The shadow immigration spokesperson has gone out and done a bit of dog-whistling by saying, ‘Why are we bringing people from Beijing, Bombay and Beirut?’ If he were up to date, he would say, ‘Manchester, Mumbai, Memphis and Muizenberg.’ That is what he would really say, because the truth of the matter is that 26 per cent of the people who come in under these visas come from the United Kingdom, 10 per cent come from India, six per cent come from the United States, six per cent from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa" rel="nofollow">
          South Africa
         </a>
         , and so it goes on. So the proper course of action was to mention Manchester, Mumbai, Memphis and Muizenberg. But the shadow spokesperson did not do that, because he was engaging in xenophobic dog-whistling.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are very positive outcomes from this program. I have been told of a meatworks that, for example, is able to maintain two shifts running. Without being able to maintain those two shifts running, they would have had to lay off Australian workers.

            These visas can be used to allow Australian workers to really enjoy the benefits of this boom. A motor trader in central Queensland told us that he was now able to train a number of apprentices because he had experienced mechanics to train them. But the opposition are still not convinced. They still complain. They want strong compliance on this visa—and so do I, incidentally. I do not want the visa ever to be misused. But what are they suggesting? That we go out into the health sector? Do we really think that hospitals are bringing in nurses to undermine Australian conditions? I do not think so. Seven per cent of uptake of this visa is by nurses. With an average salary of $62,000, it does not sound like slave labour to me.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do the Labor Party want me to go to the cancer institutes that bring people in under this visa and say, ‘I am sorry. The opposition thinks you are undermining Australian working conditions, and you cannot have the specialists that you bring in.’ Or what about the hearing centres that desperately need people? Do we want to tell the

               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John" rel="nofollow">
                St John
               </a>

You are trying to undermine Australian working conditions.’ St John are there at every fete and every celebration, looking after Australians. They are there when there is a car crash and bad news to be communicated. That is where St John are, and they use these visas.
              </p>
              <p>
               Perhaps we should go to St Vincent de Paul—that well-known bastion of hatred of Australian people. Help me here. What a joke. These visas are used by people like St Vincent de Paul and Barnardos for a very good reason: they allow businesses and charities to bring in the skills they need.

                 all use it. There have been, in fact, 296 nominations for lecturers. We could have a debate about whether the Labor Party think they are unskilled—at an average salary of $58,000—if that is the proposition you want to put, but I would not put that proposition. Or we could have a debate about the mining sector, with an average salary of $89,000.

                 Who was the biggest user in the last year of this visa? The New South Wales Labor government. Let’s send a compliance team and see if they are rorting the system. Let’s see if the New South Wales government are using this to undermine Australian working conditions. We could go to the Rail Corporation, the Wildlife Information and Rescue Service, the

                 and the Rural Doctors Network. We could go to every state government and say to them, ‘Do you really want to use this visa, because your federal opposition just do not understand?’

                    I refer the minister the answer she gave the Senate yesterday, when she was unable to provide details of two separate allegations of rorted 457 visas at meatworks in
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                     South Australia
                    </a>
                    . Now that the minister has had the opportunity to put her pearls on and to obtain advice about these cases, can she update the Senate on the status of these allegations? In particular, can the minister confirm that DIMA advised a union official some two weeks ago that foreign workers at a
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bridge" rel="nofollow">
                     Murray Bridge
                    </a>
                    meatworks were not engaged in skilled work and were being paid less than they should? If these workers were not engaged in skilled work, isn’t this just confirmation that the visa conditions were not met at the time the visas were issued? Doesn’t this mean that the department has allowed this employer to engage foreign workers in breach of visa conditions at the expense of Australian jobs?

                            , I rise on a point of order about the abuse of question time. I raised this with you yesterday. Ministers are making no attempt to answer the questions. This is a repeat of a question asked of Senator Vanstone yesterday because she was allowed to carry on with a statement and abuse of the shadow minister, which did not relate at all to the question. We then had Senator Abetz’s performance today. Opposition senators will get frustrated and unruly if there is no integrity in question time, and I ask you to ensure the integrity of question time.

                               . There is one meatworks in particular that is a very reputable Australian employer and, as I am advised, we have no allegations against that meatworks. They employ some 2,100 Australians, including 300 in Naracoorte. Their national workforce includes 13 apprentices and 300 trainees. They have taken on a number of overseas skilled meatworkers to supplement their Australian workforce and transfer skills. The overseas workers enjoy the same wages and conditions as their Australian workforce, many with salaries of over $60,000. As I indicated yesterday—but I did not think that the opposition was listening, as they do not listen to the electorate—all union claims or claims by anybody will be investigated. This visa is critical to maintaining Australia’s skills and to allowing industry not only to survive in a boom but to take real advantage of it to grow exports and create more Australian jobs. So we do not want it misused or undermined any more than anyone else does.

If a mistake has been made there I will go back to the South Australian Labor government and raise with them whether as a regional certifying body they have done the right thing. I will be saying to the South Australian government: what are you doing certifying these things if Aussies could have the jobs? And do you know what I expect to find? I expect to find that the South Australian government have done their job properly, because we are working very closely with them on immigration issues, unlike with you.

The bottom line with respect to this visa is this: it is very important for Australia that businesses can bring in the skills they need when they need them either for a short-term job or for people to come in quickly and then look at permanent migration. It is vitally important. We must make sure that Australian industry has the skills it needs. We will not condone people underpaying the Australian award or undermining these conditions and we will deal with them when that happens.

                                     The senator carries an imputation in the question ‘isn’t this yet a further corruption’, implying that there already is one.
