         Thank you,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
          Mr President
         </a>
         . I acknowledge the Ngunawal and Ngambri peoples, who are the traditional custodians of the gathering place on which this parliament was built. I am a proud Djabwurrung Gunnai Gunditjmara woman and I live on Wurundjeri country. I stand before you today on the shoulders of my ancestors, who fought and died for our country. Their resistance, knowledge and strength over thousands of years has guided me to this moment and I carry their spirit with me in this chamber.
        </p>
        <p>
         It's an honour to be the first Aboriginal person elected to the Senate to represent Victoria. While it's a great shame that it has taken this long, the timing could not be more significant. Outside these walls a global movement has taken to the streets to demand that black lives matter—an uprising of voices, united by the conviction that the colour of your skin should not limit your potential, your safety or your life expectancy. That was not something society told me growing up.
        </p>
        <p>
         For an Aboriginal girl raised in poverty and public housing, who left school at 14, the idea that I could make it all the way to this nation's parliament was laughable. People like me were not meant to end up in places like this. Our voices were silenced, sidelined and written out of the story of our own country. But I never gave up believing that better days were possible.
        </p>
        <p>
         I come from a long line of strong black women who taught me to stand up for what's right and never let injustice and racism beat you down. If you want change, you have to fight for it. I've been a human rights, climate, and forest activist. And, in 2017, I was honoured to be the first Aboriginal woman elected to the Victorian parliament. I have fought my whole life for those without a voice. My promise to the people of Victoria is: I will continue to fight for you, and I will never forget where I come from.
        </p>
        <p>
         I take my seat in this chamber today for every person who has been discarded, discounted or left behind. It's time for your voices to be heard. For too long, power has been tightly held in the hands of the privileged. I come to this parliament not as a career politician but as someone who's done it tough and grown strong through the struggles. I'm a survivor of family and workplace violence, I was a single mum at 17, I've had to confront my own mental health issues and I know what it's like to count every cent to put food on the table.
        </p>
        <p>
         Millions of people all over this country face similar challenges every day. They need a parliament that prioritises their right to live with dignity. Instead, they have been forgotten by a political class that sees poverty as a character flaw. It doesn't have to be this way. Right now, we have a chance to build a country that works for everyone, not just the chosen few. We stand at a crossroads.
        </p>
        <p>
         The year 2020 will leave an enduring mark in the pages of history. This was a year that demanded we not turn our heads from the challenges that threaten our future—yes, the urgency of our climate emergency; the growing economic inequality, exposed and exacerbated by a deadly global pandemic; and the ongoing fight for racial justice. For Australia to become a mature, self-assured nation, we must recognise the long history of violence inflicted upon this country's First People and embark on a truth-telling journey to reconcile that past. These challenges are big, but so is the opportunity. This is our moment to grow as a nation, and we must be brave.
        </p>
        <p>
         The devastating bushfires that ripped through this land were a wake-up call for those who deny we must act decisively to address the reality of a warming planet. We have watched in real time the full horror of the climate crisis and what happens when you stop caring for country. With governments of the world converging on Glasgow next November to lift their ambition on climate action, the denial, posturing and fidgeting that has gone on in this house for far too long must stop now. It's time for leadership. We must put the future of our children, our grandchildren and country ahead of the short-term interests of the fossil fuel industry. Last year, I attended the United Nations Climate Summit in Madrid and saw firsthand how big polluters are poisoning country and ripping the heart out of communities all over the world. I also saw firsthand how this government is holding the world back when it comes to global action on climate change. At a meeting of Indigenous leaders, we wept as we shared our collective grief over the destruction of our land—from the fires tearing through the Amazon to the devastation in our own backyard.
        </p>
        <p>
         Here, in Australia, we have seen
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Tinto" rel="nofollow">
          Rio Tinto
         </a>
         blow up the Juukan Gorge in the Pilbara, blasting 46,000-year-old Aboriginal rock shelters in an act of cultural and environmental vandalism. We know they have more planned. In Western Victoria, ancient birthing trees are being destroyed. At this site, on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djab_Wurrung" rel="nofollow">
          Djab Wurrung
         </a>
         country, Aboriginal women have given birth to an estimated 10,000 babies over many centuries. My ancestors' blood runs through the soil that nourishes these trees. When we lose these sacred sites, we sever the deep spiritual ties that connect our culture and language to this land. Caring for country is at the heart of who we are as Aboriginal people. As custodians of this land for thousands of years, we understand that the health of the community is only as strong as the health of our environment. We're tired of watching governments and their agencies pay lip service to an acknowledgement of country while at the same time destroying the very land they claim to respect. When we don't show genuine care for the country that nurtures us, we all suffer. That's why we can't separate climate justice from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          First Nations
         </a>
         justice. We can't maintain the protection of our land if its traditional custodians are locked up, disenfranchised and dying in the numbers that represent an outrageous human rights abuse.
        </p>
        <p>
         To heal this land we must address the inequality and injustice faced by Aboriginal people. Black Lives Matter needs to be more than a trending hashtag. It must be a reckoning; a line in the sand; a call to action. To those whose skin colour affords them greater safety and justice, it's time to stop looking away from systemic racism and stand with us and say, 'no more'. George Floyd's death was that moment for many people. I take hope from the spirit of solidarity that was born from this rising consciousness. But why did it take the death of a black man on the other side of the world to wake up Australia, when our Indigenous people are the most incarcerated people on Earth?
        </p>
        <p>
         We must now ensure that history also remembers the names of those who died in similar circumstances, right here in Australia: John Pat, David Dungay, Ms Dhu, Joyce Clarke, Kumanjayi Walker, Veronica Nelson Walker, Tanya Day and Raymond Noel Thomas, just to name a few. I wish I were afforded the time in this speech to name every life taken—441 Aboriginal people have died in custody since the royal commission in 1991. Not a single person has ever been held accountable.
        </p>
        <p>
         For years, politicians in this parliament have talked about closing the gap, but our children continue to be removed from their homes at rates far higher than white Australia. In fact, over 20,000 of our babies aren't with their families or their communities. Kids as young as 10 are held criminally responsible in this country, the vast majority of them Aboriginal. Our babies should be playing and learning, not incarcerated for petty offences, like stealing a chocolate bar.
        </p>
        <p>
         These are not just statistics on a page for me. Earlier this year, I went home to grieve with my mother and our community on Gunnai country, on what the colonisers call Gippsland. Four Aboriginal people had been lost to suicide in 10 days. These tragedies reflect a profound sense of hopelessness felt by many First Nations people when they look to a future that holds little promise. Three of those young people had connections to Lake Tyers, a community where, generations earlier, my mother's family were imprisoned as refugees in their own country. It happened as part of the systematic slaughter of Aboriginal people across this nation. In Victoria alone, there were 67 massacres and more are still being uncovered. They tried to wipe my people from the land, but they failed. We are still here. We are the oldest living culture in the world, and our fight for survival is part of this nation's story.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          White Australia
         </a>
         has a black history. We cannot change the past. But we can build a better future. We must reckon with our history so we can heal and move forward as one country, united by truth and common purpose. I believe Australia is ready to come with us on this journey.
        </p>
        <p>
         For the last two years, I've led a dawn service on 26 January to mark a day of mourning and honour all the Aboriginal men, women and, yes, children massacred upon invasion of our country, known as the frontier wars. The vast majority of people standing shoulder to shoulder with us have been non-
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
          Indigenous Australians
         </a>
         , sharing our grief in a spirit of healing. Their numbers grow each year. But, to truly bring this country together, we must treat not only the symptoms of disadvantage but the cause. We do this with a treaty. A treaty is a written agreement between sovereign nations, and Australia is the only Commonwealth country without one with its First People. If we write it together, treaty can be a blank canvas to reframe the story of who we want to be as a country.
        </p>
        <p>
         We can celebrate what unites us, protect the rights of First Nations people and acknowledge injustices, both past and present. There can be no justice without peace. Treaty could bring that peace. It would end the suffering and heal the wounds.
        </p>
        <p>
         That's why treaty must come before other debates, such as constitutional recognition, changing the date of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
          Australia Day
         </a>
         , or a voice to parliament, because the disadvantage and inequality we face as a community are not due to inherent failings in our character; they are symptoms of the persecution and oppression this country and its Constitution were founded upon. We can't be included in the Constitution before this chapter in Australia's history has been resolved via a treaty.
        </p>
        <p>
         And we mustn't replicate tick-and-flick domestic treaties that allow native title to be extinguished to make way for the destruction of country for megamines, logging or fracking. A genuine national treaty would elevate Aboriginal voices and reframe us as a more caring society where nobody is left behind. We need to make that shift, because the gap between rich and poor is growing wider. The unprecedented public health and economic crisis we're living through in 2020 has brought this into sharp focus. It has often been said that the COVID-19 virus doesn't discriminate, but we know now that its impacts do. Young people, women, migrants, the elderly, public housing residents and casualised workers are bearing the greatest burden.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to offer my condolences to the families of those whose lives have been tragically cut short by coronavirus. Through this crisis we have seen that inequality is not just a social issue; it's a major public health risk that eats away at the fabric of our society. Precarious work and insecure housing have fuelled this pandemic. When you have a low-paid, casualised workforce, inevitably people will be forced to make choices that have life-and-death consequences. Staying home when you're sick is not an option when that decision means your children go without food. Too many people are living hand-to-mouth, without job security or the dignity of a living wage.
        </p>
        <p>
         COVID has exposed deep cracks in our society, showing how quickly it can fall apart when people have no safety net. As we endured periods of lockdown, I thought of all the people who are permanently locked up and forgotten about by our government, like my friends Farhad and Moz, Kurdish refugees who spent seven years on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manus_Island" rel="nofollow">
          Manus Island
         </a>
         before being brought to Australia under medevac legislation. They are now locked inside a Melbourne hotel room with no prospect of release and fighting for basic rights. These men have committed no crime.
        </p>
        <p>
         How can we as a nation treat people like this? We are stronger as a country when we extend the hand of friendship to everyone—not just those who look like you and not just those who wear the same school tie as you do. That is what this parliament should be about—a place that represents everyone equally—because what COVID has shown us is that economic inequality is not an individual moral failing but an active political choice. The disaster in private aged care is a tragic reminder of what happens when we put the profits of big business over the dignity of our community's most vulnerable. Who's been looking after our elders? Certainly not this place—but it should have been. Through this pandemic we've seen governments find money to house the homeless, feed the hungry, support the unemployed, prop up child care and boost mental health services. These solutions to social and economic disadvantage have always been there; our political leaders have just chosen not to adopt them.
        </p>
        <p>
         We deserve so much better, and we can be better. This pivotal moment has offered us a unique opportunity to re-imagine our society. From the ashes of this crisis, we can rebuild in a way that addresses our overriding national challenges—justice for First Nations people, reducing inequality and addressing climate change. We can create a community where the collective good outweighs individual self-interest.
        </p>
        <p>
         As we look to that future, I think of the lessons we can learn from the matriarchs in my family. My great grandmother
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edna_Brown" rel="nofollow">
          Edna Brown
         </a>
         arrived in Melbourne on the back of a truck in 1932 after being forced off the Framlingham Aboriginal reserve near Warrnambool as part of the White Australia assimilation policy during the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression" rel="nofollow">
          Great Depression
         </a>
         . Back then, it was common for Aboriginal people to be buried as paupers in unmarked graves. Nan Edna wanted to offer the dignity in death that so many of our people were denied in life. She set up the Aboriginal Funeral Fund, supporting families to bury their loved ones. After Nan Edna, her daughter, my Nan Alma Thorpe, was one of the founders of the first Aboriginal Health Service in Victoria in 1973—the year I was born. To this day that service is saving lives. That is kinship. It is self-determination, and strength through community. And then there's my mum, Marjorie Thorpe—a co-commissioner for the

        </p>
        <p>
         This is where I come from. As I followed these strong women, I learned through one of the toughest periods of my life that strength comes from community. Living in the Collingwood housing commission flats saved my life. Public housing helped me escape family violence and gave me and my son the safety and stability I needed to get a job and pursue further education. That is what everyone deserves—a safe place to call home, secure work, food in their belly and the hope of a future with potential.
        </p>
        <p>
         If the pandemic has taught us anything, it's that our society is weaker when people don't have these basic rights. The people in this chamber have the power to change that. We can do more of the same or we can offer our kids and grandkids a politics of hope. The solutions to the big problems we face are there in the way my people have looked after each other for generations—holistic health care, caring for country, kinship and self-determination. We can give everyone the dignity of a living wage and lift people out of poverty. And it's not too late to tackle the climate emergency. But we can't be fooled by a gas-led recovery backed by both sides of this House. The only safe road out of our economic and climate crisis is one that creates thousands of jobs in renewable energy. We can write a treaty that acknowledges our past and brings us together to heal as a nation. That's why I'm here—to fight for the change that will unite and strengthen our country.

To the activists fighting to protect our country, climate and human rights: I stand with you. To all those women who have been trapped, who've been made to feel worthless or unsafe, who've been told time after time to sit down and be silent—whether in your home, your workplace or wherever you go—I see you, I've been you and I will not forget you. To Greens members and voters who have backed me on this journey, I thank you. I chose the Greens as my political home because it's a grassroots movement that won't sell out to vested interests that have corrupted our democracy. And I'd like to pay tribute to the person whose shoes I now fill,

         , a leader of great integrity and passion: thank you for your service and support. I also pay my respects to the other First Nations MPs who have walked this road before me.
        </p>
        <p>
         And I thank my sisters, Arika and Meriki; my partner, Gavan; my children, Andrew, Kowirra and Kaiaan; my daughter-in-law, Jackie; my granddaughters, Illuka and Ngakaya; and nephew Kadel—for loving and supporting me through this journey and for your sacrifices that got me here.
        </p>
        <p>
         Finally, to every person watching today, particularly those who have lost hope in politics as a vehicle for change, I say this to you: change is possible. Hold me and every other elected representative in this place accountable. Our job is to serve you. We have an opportunity to build a stronger, more unified nation. I invite you all to come on this journey with me, a journey of truth-telling, healing and justice. Together, we can build a brighter future. And I'm here to fight for it. Thank you.
