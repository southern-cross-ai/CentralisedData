       <p class="italic">
        You can apply to participate in the quarterly credits system for an income year if you expect to be entitled to refundable tax offsets for the income year that are covered by the system.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Participating gives you quarterly credits towards your likely refund from those tax offsets. These credits will either be based on your refund from a recent income year, or on a varied amount chosen by you after estimating your refund for the current year.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A reconciliation happens when the current year's assessment is made. General interest charge may be payable if you chose to base your credits on a varied amount and they are excessively high.

          The government is not in a position to support the Greens amendment.

           The Greens
          </a>
          amendment effectively seeks to drop the original intent of this bill, which, as I indicated in the second reading debate, was actually a budget savings measure initiated and banked in the last budget of the previous Gillard Labor government and which seeks to remove access to R&amp;D tax incentives for companies with annual aggregate assessable income of more than $20 billion a year.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Greens are proposing a quarterly credit scheme which would allow businesses to receive tax credits for eligible R&amp;D activities before the expenditure has actually occurred. This would introduce a number of risks, as the scheme seeks to anticipate a company's expected entitlement to a refund of the R&amp;D refundable tax offset and requires payments to be made on the basis of an estimate. Allowing a company to receive credits for R&amp;D expenditure before that expenditure has actually occurred would, in particular, introduce a risk of fraud and a risk of overpayment. Further, any integrity rules to reduce these risks would increase the compliance costs associated with the scheme while not eliminating the risks. The integrity rules introduced in the Greens' proposed scheme would not be sufficient to eliminate the risks, and it is likely that cases of fraud and overpayment would occur.

           indicate that the opposition will be supporting the Greens' amendment. I want to say a few things about the minister's statements. He is sorely testing the patience of this chamber, given how extraordinarily poorly briefed he is on these matters. These particular measures that the Greens have spoken of in regard to the quarterly credits were introduced by the previous Labor government from 1 January as part of negotiations with the Greens and the independent members of the parliament in the legislation to implement the tax incentive. The quarterly credits approach was recommended by the review of the National Innovation System. The quarterly credits were introduced by the 2013 measures bill—a bill which included other measures that the minister has referred to but which, of course, were not passed by the parliament at the time. The R&amp;D quarterly credits received strong support from business stakeholders, particularly small and medium sized firms and from the biotech sector. AusBiotech indicated that companies had already factored in R&amp;D quarterly credits in their R&amp;D and financial planning, based on the 1 January 2014 start-up dates.
          </p>
          <p>
           Specific proposals were built into the act in terms of Innovations Australia's capacity to monitor these measures, and a reference committee to ensure the appropriate application of these matters. These are steps that this government has abolished—just as they have sought to abolish the plan for Australian jobs and related savings measures. These are, of course, an integral part of the actions the previous government took on these questions which related to the funding arrangements for a transfer of resources on R&amp;D to those jobs programs—programs which this government has abolished. It is on that basis that the opposition has walked away from those announcements. If we were introducing measures to fund responsible actions to defend Australian jobs and to defend manufacturing, then of course you would have a reasonable expectation. If this government implemented the same measures for the same purposes, of course we would support them. But this is a government that has lied through its teeth about everything it has done before it was elected and after it was elected.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Labor government's R&amp;D tax measures were introduced after extensive consultations, and provided a 45 per cent refundable R&amp;D tax offset for small and medium sized enterprises and a 40 per cent non-refundable R&amp;D tax offset for other eligible companies. The new data, which came in after these measures, indicated that there had been a significant expansion in the number of firms that were actually undertaking R&amp;D in this country. And as of 30 June 2014, 11,936 companies had registered some $19 billion of R&amp;D expenditure. That was a substantial increase on the level of R&amp;D activity, despite the fact that we tightened up the definitions quite dramatically. There was an additional 2,700 companies that were new to the program, and 74 per cent of the registrations received in 2012-13 were companies with an aggregate turnover of less than $20 million. They were particularly in the services sector, but 33 per cent were in manufacturing and nine per cent were in mining, which is an important component of how the R&amp;D taxation concession system works.
          </p>
          <p>
           We are supporting this proposal that Senator Milne has advanced today because it is consistent with the original intent of the bill. The minister has just told this chamber that we had overly generous taxation arrangements—'overly generous' were the words he used. Minister, how do the taxation arrangements in the current regime compare with our international competitors in the Asia-Pacific region and in Europe? Minister, tell us that.

            The Minister for Finance stood up and completely rejected this notion of being able to have quarterly instalments. He made some general criticisms that, supposedly, it would allow fraud and so on. He showed absolutely no consideration of the checks and balances that are in this particular amendment, which were worked through, as Senator Carr has just indicated. There are careful considerations. There is clearly a whole governance arrangement set out, with rules around what you have to do to be able to participate in the quarterly credits system. You can be refused participation; you have to apply; there are tests imposed to determine whether you are able to participate. You have to pass the following tests—the reasonable receipt test, the complying-taxpayer test and any extra test listed in the table for the tax offset. There is a whole governance arrangement. It is absolutely scandalous for the minister to stand here and just glibly say, 'This allows for fraud.'
           </p>
           <p>
            This has the support of the R&amp;D sector. It has the support particularly of small business—the most innovative part of the R&amp;D sector.
           </p>
           <p>
            This minister has now clearly revealed to the Senate that he has no real interest in facilitating research and development in Australia. His only interest is to get legislation through that will make sure that $1.1 billion does not go into research and development in Australia. I will be very surprised if the sector does not give him very strong feedback on that absolutely glib dismissal of a whole governance arrangement which has been previously worked through and put in place. All of the complying texts are there of how to work out and pay the quarterly credit amounts, to look through the whole disallowing of the proposed varied amounts and to notify the commissioner of proposed varied amounts and so on and so forth. It is all here in this amendment.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is a very long and complicated amendment. It is based on what the government had in previous legislation that was developed. It requires careful consideration, not just a glib dismissal on the basis that it is some supposed thing that was thought up in five minutes; it is not. It has been carefully considered. There are the rules associated with it—the governance arrangements. I would be very interested to hear specifically in relation to this amendment if the minister can point to why and where he thinks the room for fraud is.

            <p>
             Firstly, in response to the issues raised by Senator Carr: the comparisons he seeks to make in relation to arrangements in other countries are not valid. This is because, essentially, you cannot just look at one aspect of our tax system as it relates to incentives to encourage research and development expenditure, because all of the schemes in different jurisdictions are fundamentally structured differently and obviously the flow-on consequences are different depending on what the specific arrangements are in individual jurisdictions.
            </p>
            <p>
             In relation to Senator Milne's question, it stands to reason that if, as you are proposing we should do, the government provides a benefit up-front on a quarterly basis before any expenditure has been incurred by a business—so we the government provide the entitlement up-front—and then after the business may or may not incur the expenditure, there has to be a reconciliation. If too much has been claimed, the business has to refund the Commonwealth.
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commonwealth" rel="nofollow">
              The Commonwealth
             </a>
             then has to go and chase businesses that might be tardy in refunding the entitlements that they have received from the Commonwealth erroneously or in excess of what their entitlement actually was. There will be such situations. It is just an intuitive reality that some businesses will seek to exploit this sort of loophole in order to facilitate their cash flows.
            </p>
            <p>
             The advice that we have is that the proposal before the Senate and put forward by the Greens will increase the risk of over-payments, with all of the compliance issues and increased compliance costs that come with that, and will increase the risk of fraud. We accept that advice from Treasury. We accept that advice from the experts. On that basis, the government has decided not to support this amendment.

              I would appreciate your tabling that advice from Treasury, because it was not the advice that was previously provided. Since it is Treasury that has supposedly said this, I would like to see that advice, because a huge amount of work went in to make sure that these governance arrangements went in. As Senator Cormann said, it is intuition that now determines his view of what will or will not happen in relation to this particular amendment. The whole arrangement here in governance is that, of course, if a company gets involved in that then they would not be available for it in the future. This is obviously going to be something that has to be put into practice. Companies would have to have been eligible for this concession in one of the previous five years before they would even be considered, and they would go through those tests ahead of it. So it is not any fly-by-night company that is able to do as it likes. There are clear governance arrangements, clear oversight arrangements, and this amendment is about encouraging R&amp;D in the small- and medium-scale sector.
             </p>
             <p>
              The minister is being extremely dismissive. I think he owes it to small- and medium-sized companies around Australia to table the advice that he says he has that says this arrangement is going to lead to fraud, given that the same advice was to the contrary previously.

               <p>
                It is very simple. It is on the same basis as the claim made by the previous government. The previous Gillard Labor government made a judgement that businesses generating more than $20 billion a year in profits were not an appropriate beneficiary of a research and development tax subsidy over and above the normal deduction of actual expenses incurred. So what you are suggesting now, contrary to what the previous Gillard Labor government suggested, is that businesses generating more than $20 billion in profit every year should have the advantage, the benefit, of an additional tax subsidy on top of the normal and ordinary deductions of genuine and legitimate business expenses that occur in the ordinary course of events.
               </p>
               <p>
                Given the general discussion that we are having in Australia at present, prosecuted in part by the Labor opposition, that we need to ensure that companies generating profits in Australia pay their fair share of tax in Australia, I am somewhat bemused as to why it is that in relation to this particular aspect of our tax system that Labor thinks that businesses generating more than $20 billion in profits a year—these are the big companies, the

                 Minister, you referred to the inflated rate in this country. Can you confirm that the rate of the taxation concession in Japan is 150 per cent, in Malaysia it is 200 per cent and in Singapore it is 400 per cent on the first $400,000 and 150 per cent thereafter? Can you confirm that the rate in China is 150 per cent, in Thailand it is 200 per cent and in France it is between 160 and 180 per cent? Minister, can you confirm those figures?

                  Senator Carr, the company tax rate in Australia is 30 per cent, which means that any legitimate business expense can effectively be deducted from your tax liability, out of your profits, at a rate of 30 per cent. What you are saying is that businesses generating more than $20 billion in profits a year should be able to claim 40 to 45 per cent in tax deductions when they only pay 30 per cent in tax. How is that consistent with the argument that you are otherwise prosecuting? It is inconsistent. You are saying that we ought to ensure that we protect the revenue base of the Commonwealth. Well, here we are seeking to protect the revenue base of the Commonwealth through a measure that you and the Labor Party, not us, initiated and banked in your last budget in May 2013. Here we are dealing with a budget measure out of your last budget still hanging around the country's neck. You are playing politics. I know that you rolled your leader in relation to this. I know that Mr Shorten was not strong enough to stand up to you because you have got a particular personal interest in relation to these matters. But the truth is that it was the former Labor government that initiated this particular saving. It is the coalition that is doing your work because you never legislated something that you banked in your last budget.

                   Minister, you made a statement that we have inflated rates in this country. I am asking you to confirm that that is not consistent with the fact that Japan has a 150 per cent rate, Malaysia has a 200 per cent rate, Singapore has a 400 per cent rate on the first $400,000 and 150 per cent thereafter, China has a 150 per cent rate, Thailand has a 200 per cent rate and France has a rate of 160 to 180 per cent. I would ask you to confirm that, rather than make bland statements about the inflated rate in this country. Minister, what is the evidence that companies will not simply transfer their R&amp;D to those places, where they can get a better rate of return and a higher level of support from the local government?

                    I think it is really interesting that Senator Carr continues to prosecute the case against former Prime Minister Gillard. All of the arguments he is running are arguments against the policy measure that Ms Gillard and Mr Swan initiated in their last budget in government. Ms Gillard and Mr Swan made a judgement that it is not appropriate for businesses generating more than $20 billion a year in profits to have the benefit of tax deductions well in excess of 30 per cent—40 to 45 per cent. It is appropriate to have the usual 30 per cent reduction that applies across the board. Why should a company generating more than $20 billion in profit a year be able to claim more than the applicable company tax rate as a deduction? We think 30 per cent is appropriate. We agree with former Prime Minister Gillard and former Treasurer Swan that it is more appropriate to bring that down to the applicable rate across the board. That will help repair the budget. That is why we are implementing the budget measure that Labor initiated in government.

                      I just have to explain to Senator Carr that there is currently a refundable tax offset in the law for research and development expenses for small companies. We consider the risk to revenue, as I mentioned to you before. That is now talking about the Greens amendment, and additional compliance costs to companies are not appropriate. But the important point here is that the tax deduction that Senator Carr is talking about is, in effect, a tax deduction of 140 per cent, which includes the 40 per cent tax offset because 100 per cent of the expenditure is deductible. What we are saying is that it should be 133 per cent—that is, 100 per cent of the expenditure and also the 30 per cent effectively related to the company tax rate. Senator Carr is still arguing against the policies adopted by the former Gillard Labor government, in which he was a minister, which initiated and banked the savings measure that we are currently dealing with.

                        Given that the Labor Party is so reckless and irresponsible and is not supporting its own budget measures, we have worked with Senator Wang and the Palmer United Party, and other crossbench senators, to come up with a different way to achieve the same policy objective. Of course, we are not yet dealing with the amendments of the Palmer United Party. But given that it is a wide-ranging debate I am quite happy to go to that point now. The Palmer United Party has proposed amendments to the bill which would delete the original measure and, instead, introduce a cap of $100 million on the amount of eligible research and development expenditure that companies can claim at the standard rate under the research and development tax incentive. For expenditure beyond $100 million, companies would claim a non-refundable tax offset at the corporate tax rate, which is broadly equivalent to claiming a normal deduction. Under an expenditure cap, Australian and foreign-resident companies would continue to be eligible for the research and development tax incentive and continue to receive a substantial tax benefit. This would address crossbench concerns about the perceived discriminatory effect of the original measure on Australia-resident companies. A research and development expenditure cap of $100 million would also achieve revenue gains approximately equal to the revenue gained from the original measure contained in the bill. This ensures that the changes will still play an important part in the budget repair effort.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        The crossbench amendments to the bill also include consequential amendments, which we can discuss later. But the important point here is that the Palmer United Party engaged constructively with the government. Senator Xenophon, Senator Madigan and other crossbench senators, including Senator Muir, said to the government, 'We understand what it is that you're trying to achieve. We agree with the principle, but we are concerned that this will impact disproportionately only on Australian companies and less so on companies that are predominantly operating overseas.' So by introducing a cap on the level of research and development related expenditure that is eligible we are achieving the same objective. But whether you operate predominantly in Australia and generate your profits predominantly in Australia or whether you generate your profits predominantly overseas, you are treated the same way for the purposes of this particular measure. We think that is a sensible improvement that has been put forward by the Palmer United Party.

                        might here thank Senator Zhenya Wang very much for the very constructive approach he has taken and for the hard work of his staff as well, who have been working with my office in trying to come to a sensible landing point that helps us not only achieve the policy objective and the saving but achieve the saving in a better way than was originally intended. Let me just say, again, that the original measure of course was the measure put forward by the Labor Party during their last period in government.

                            , who advised us that there had been no modelling undertaken on this arrangement—no modelling at all. I would ask you, Minister: is it the case that there has in fact been no modelling undertaken as a consequence of this amendment?

                            I would also ask you minister if it is the case that, at the Senate briefing on this matter, officers of the Treasury advised the Economics Committee that Treasury officers had actually drafted this amendment. Is that true or not?

                             In relation to the last question, the government has been working very closely with Senator Wang, on behalf of the Palmer United Party, to develop this alternative approach, given that Labor was taking this incredibly reckless and irresponsible approach of opposing their own budget measure.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             The government is very grateful to crossbench senators—the Palmer United Party, Senator Madigan, Senator Muir, and Senator Xenophon in particular—for the constructive approach they have taken with the government. We negotiated this as an alternative method of achieving the same objective. We wanted to ensure that research and development tax incentives were appropriately targeted and were not directed at those businesses that are extremely profitable.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             The initial measure was consistent with what Labor had banked in their budget, essentially applying this measure to businesses generating more than $20 billion in profits, but the Palmer United Party and Senator Wang in particular pointed out quite rightly to us that this would mean that Australian businesses operating and generating profits predominantly in Australia were comparatively disadvantaged compared with businesses that generated most of their profits overseas, but that might be generating more than $20 billion in profits, but outside of the Australian tax jurisdiction. So in order to take that observation on board we came up with this as an alternative method. The advice we have is that the number of companies that will be impacted by putting this $100 million cap in place in relation to eligible research and development expenditure will be broadly the same.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             If the Labor Party takes this approach where they oppose their own savings measures we will work with those senators across the chamber who take a constructive approach and are prepared to work with the government in the national interest. That is how we came to this point. And the government, of course, worked closely with Senator Wang in putting the relevant amendment together to make sure that it was technically accurate and well targeted.

                              I take it that the minister is confirming that the department drafted this amendment. I raise that because it is not in itself a matter of odium that that happened but it is a question of whether or not these amendments are understood. It does raise the issue of what support the government provided to understand the implications of these amendments. I take it that you are also confirming that there was no modelling undertaken. Is that the case? Was there any modelling undertaken to establish that, as you say, the same effect would be generated by this new amendment?

                               To clarify: the Clerk of the Senate is who would have provided assistance to the Palmer United Party in relation to the drafting of those amendments, as is usual practice, but subject to comment, advice and input by Treasury as appropriate. There is nothing unusual in relation to this to ensure that, as I have indicated before, these amendments are technically accurate.

                              <p>
                               In relation to the other matter, you would be aware that, in particular at the request of Senator Xenophon, after the Palmer United Party amendments were circulated the government did make Treasury and others available for an extensive briefing session of the Senate Economics Committee. That happened before Christmas. At the time, the indication was that this bill would be dealt with in the last sitting week before Christmas. As it turned out, of course, after the legislation on temporary protection visas we did not end up having enough time to deal with this, so this is a hangover from last year. The appropriate briefings and all of the background have been provided in good faith, and my feedback is that those senators who participated in that briefing—perhaps with the exception of Senator Carr—accepted that that was a very useful explanation of the background.

                               I think everyone very clearly understands what it is that we are trying to achieve. In effect, we are trying to implement a budget measure of the previous Gillard Labor government and trying to do it in a way that is acceptable to the crossbench so that we preserve the policy intent in a way that is slightly better than the original proposal. This is democracy at work. This is the Senate process at work. The government has engaged in it in good faith and constructively, and so have crossbench senators. Sadly, the Labor opposition has not.

                                The proposal that the government has put to us is that we senators were all pleased with the briefing that we got. It is true that we were pleased. We were pleased by the fact that Treasury officers confirmed that no modelling had been undertaken. The point of my question was for you to confirm with officers in the box at the moment whether that information was accurate. We have a situation here where the government is proposing measures fundamentally different from the original bill which directly and adversely affect manufacturers in this country.

                                The amendments proposed by Senator Wang fundamentally change the measures in the original bill. We had a bill that set a threshold excluding particular firms from accessing the incentive. Now we are debating a measure that puts a cap on how much R&amp;D expenditure firms can claim. On that basis, Minister, how can you say that this has the same effect as the original bill? It is a fundamentally different measure drafted by Treasury officers without any modelling and without any knowledge of the consequences of it other than your guesswork. How can you make the claim that this has the same effect as the original bill?

                                 Because Treasury has modelled the revenue effect and the departmental costs of the Palmer United Party amendment. Of course in the ordinary process of government the Treasury has costed and modelled the revenue effect, and the advice that we have been given quite clearly by Treasury is that the impact of the Palmer United Party amendment is such that the saving to the budget is broadly the same and that the companies impacted are broadly the same. I could not be more transparent. I could not be any more clear. The government has in good faith engaged with the crossbench to seek to achieve the policy intent of the original budget measure initiated and banked in the 2013-14 budget by the Gillard Labor government. We are still dealing with budget measures of the Gillard Labor government.
