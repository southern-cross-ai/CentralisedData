        That the following matter be referred to the Environment and Communications References Committee for inquiry and report by 3 December 2014:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The adequacy of arrangements to prevent the entry and establishment of invasive species likely to harm Australia's natural environment, including:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) recent biosecurity performance with respect to exotic organisms with the potential to harm the natural environment detected since 2000 and resulting from accidental or illegal introductions from overseas, including:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) the extent of detected incursions, including numbers, locations and species, and their potential future environmental, social and economic impacts,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) the likely pathways of these recently detected incursions and any weaknesses in biosecurity that have facilitated their entry and establishment,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii) the extent of quarantine interceptions of exotic organisms with the potential to harm the natural environment, including numbers, locations, species and potential impacts, and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iv) any reviews or analyses of detected incursions or interceptions relevant to the environment and any changes in biosecurity processes resulting from those reviews or analyses;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) Australia's state of preparedness for new environmental incursions, including:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) the extent to which high priority risks for the environment have been identified in terms of both organisms and pathways, and accorded priority in relation to other biosecurity priorities,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) the process for determining priorities for import risk analyses and the process for prioritising the preparation of these analyses,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii) the current approach to contingency planning for high priority environmental risks and the process by which they were developed,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iv) the adequacy of current protocols and surveillance and their implementation for high-priority environmental risks,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (v) current systems for responses to newly detected incursions, the timeliness and adequacy, and the role of ecological expertise,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (vi) the extent to which compliance monitoring and enforcement activities are focused on high priority environmental risks,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (vii) the adequacy of reporting on incursions, transparency in decision-making and engagement of the community, and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (viii) institutional arrangements for environmental biosecurity and potential improvements; and
