        I rise to speak on the Industry Specialist Mentoring for Australian Apprentices program, or ISMAA for short, a $60 million national program I negotiated with the government almost two years ago, ISMAA has had a very positive impact across all trades, particularly in the automotive industry nationally and in my home state of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Since Australia's passenger vehicle manufacturing ceased in 2017, there's been a perception that the automotive industry has hit the skids. It drives me mad because it just isn't so. The auto industry is not dead; it's very much alive and kicking. As a matter of fact, in Australia there are an estimated 35,000 jobs up for grabs due to automotive skills shortages right across the country—not just in vehicle manufacturing but also in new and used car and truck yards, car detailers, repair shops and tyre and spare parts outlets—and the number of jobs is very much on the rise.
       </p>
       <p>
        It seems incredible that, at the same time we have stubbornly high youth unemployment, this industry is struggling to fill jobs. What can we do about it? For a start, we can help apprentices complete their apprenticeships. Far too many, for various reasons, drop out before achieving their qualification. Back in 2017 I recognised the need for greater mentoring support for motor trade apprentices who were at risk of pulling out of their training as early as the first year. The Motor Trade Association of South Australia briefed me on a previous mentoring program that had boosted apprenticeship retention rates from a low 50 per cent to around 90 per cent. I was astounded that one program could help so much. What I found even more astounding was that the then Abbott government had pulled the plug on a mentoring program in its infamous 2014-15 budget for no other reason than to help balance the books. Apprenticeship retention rates predictably fell after that program was pulled.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fast forward a year, and I succeeded in securing $60 million to establish the new ISMAA program to support apprentices and trainees through their first two years of training. So far, ISMAA has assisted a staggering 30,000 apprentices from thousands of employers across a broad range of industries including construction, mining, retail trade, accommodation and food services, utility services and, of course, automotive. Completion rates aren't yet available for all industries but, if they are anything like those reported by the automotive industry, retention and course completion is likely to be around 90 per cent, thanks to the fantastic pastoral care and career support offered by mentors.

        I recently saw a couple of employer testimonials that were shared online by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Cabinet" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Cabinet
        </a>
        and Furniture Association. One employer who had five apprentices in the ISMAA program wrote:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I have observed all of the individuals involved grow in confidence and improve their communication skills. Discussions with their mentor has allowed the apprentice to open dialogues with the company regarding their future and the skills they would like to learn going forward. This has resulted in opportunities that may not have eventuated without the mentoring support provided.
       </p>
       <p>
        It makes economic sense that government commits ongoing funds to this type of program because it has an immediate payback to industry and ensures more school leavers gain qualifications whilst being employed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mentoring programs are there to help apprentices jump any life hurdles they are facing that might prevent them from succeeding in their training. They may need help for serious issues such as anxiety or depression, or a reliance on drugs or alcohol, or be coping with the challenges of youth adulthood such as moving out of home or even organising themselves so they get to work on time.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was informed by Senator Canavan today, who was responding to a question I asked of Senator Cash in question time, that the government was proud of the performance of the ISMAA program; I am too. He also said that government intends that apprenticeship support network contracts will in future require providers to facilitate mentoring as part of their in-training supports. I will be watching this space closely to ensure that this activity is tangible and not tokenistic, that apprentices get the mentoring support they need when they need it and that it is appropriately funded. Before I close, I must congratulate Paul Unerkov and the South Australian Motor Trades Association team on their implementation of the mentoring program and for achieving a champion 95 per cent retention rate. Well done.
