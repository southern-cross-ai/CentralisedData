           . It says they are facing a $30,000 to $50,000 increase in their electricity bills, partly as a result of the carbon tax, and that as result they may need to axe or reduce their involvement in programs that promote community and school involvement in sports. I ask the minister: is the government providing any direct assistance under its carbon tax package to the

              I will come to the question. I just thought that the chamber should be aware that I think he did very well. I suspect, however, from the tweets, that Senator Cameron might have bested him. I am very happy to take a not entirely unexpected question from Senator Birmingham. As he would know—and he was careful to word his question perhaps a little more subtly than Senator Joyce would have been capable of—it is misleading to attribute the entire electricity price rise experienced by clubs or in fact any other entity to the carbon price. I am advised that the Minister for

                    It is misleading to attribute the entire price rise to the carbon price. I would point out two things. One is that the Treasury modelling did estimate the impact of the carbon price on sport and recreation at about 0.3 per cent. That is about 20c a week. That did include the impact on football clubs. The government did assume cost pass-through in its assessment of the Household Assistance Package, which provides, as the chamber would know, about $10.10 in assistance through tax cuts and increased transfer payments. In addition, football clubs may be eligible to apply for the Community

Is the government providing any direct assistance to any

                      This question was asked last week by the member for Boothby, and a number of us know the Belair Hotel reasonably well. I think Senator McEwen might know it pretty well, to be honest with you; she still lives up in the hills. I understand from the information that was provided as a result of the member for Boothby's question that, of the increase in that off-peak rate to which the senator referred, the overall carbon price effect was less than 10 per cent of the overall electricity bill. There were significant increases in network charges, which, I am advised, added over $1,300 a month to the hotel's electricity costs. So, again, this is another one of those situations where the carbon impact is a particular amount. The government has assessed that in terms of its assistance to consumers, but of course there are obviously substantial increases driven by network costs.

                       , I ask a further supplementary question. Given the minister has failed, despite all of Labor's rhetoric about carbon tax compensation, to identify one piece of assistance given to local footy clubs, other clubs generally or pubs in her home state, will the minister confirm that these organisations simply have to wear the costs associated with Labor's carbon tax? Isn't it an inevitable consequence of the increased carbon tax costs that support for worthwhile local community programs by these clubs will be reduced?
