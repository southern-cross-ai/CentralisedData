        My question is to the Minister for Finance, Senator Cormann. I remind the minister that, before the election, the Prime Minister denied there would be any increases in tax under a Liberal government. Given that the minister announced by ambush today an increase in the petrol tax, can the minister please explain why the Prime Minister lied to the Australian people?

             Let me reject right up front the final assertion that the senator has made. Let me also clarify for the Senate that what I have announced today are revised implementation arrangements for a measure announced in the budget on 13 Mayâ€”and, of course, that budget measure was to ensure that the real value of the excise on fuel does not continue to fall. Something that might have escaped the Labor Party and the Greens is that the real value of the excise on fuel has continued to fall since indexation of fuel excise was abolished in 2001. Back in 2001 the fuel excise was 42 per cent of the average fuel price; today it is 25 per cent. And, of course, as we speak here today, the Greens, in particular, are advocating a position that the real value of the excise on fuel should continue to fall. Our position on this side of the chamber is that it is an important structural reform of the budget to ensure that the real value of the excise on fuel does not continue to fall, and that it keeps pace with inflation.

               If Senator Wong would give us the courtesy of listening to the answer, she would know that her interjections are based on a completely false premiseâ€”because, of course, the fuel excise indexation measure will ensure that the real value of the excise on fuel does not continue to fall, that it remains constant in real terms and that it keeps pace with inflation. I do not know how many other ways I can explain thisâ€”

                   What the Prime Minister said very clearly before the election is that the coalition would fix the budget mess that Labor left behind. We are fixing the budget mess that Labor left behind and we are making sure that the tax on fuel does not continue to fall. We think that from 42 per cent down to 25 per centâ€”

The second point I would make is that the impact on households from our fuel excise indexation measure will be modest. By the end of the financial yearâ€”

                       By the end of the financial year, a typical household will pay about 40c more per week for 50 litres of fuel, but the impact on our capacity to grow a stronger, more prosperous economy will be significant, because the government will be able to raise $2.2 billion in revenue over the forward estimates, which we will be able to invest in productivity-enhancing, job-creating economic infrastructure. And, of course, over time, as our economy grows more strongly, we will be able to generate more revenue for government and that will help us to fix up the mess that the Labor Party left behind and to fix up the mess that

Let me just say that I am very confident that on reflection, within 12 months, Labor and the Greens may have another thought about whether or not to support this particular measure. I am very confident that the proposal that we have announced today will be validated within 12 months by the parliament.

                           , I rise on a point of order on relevance. It is a very important point that has been asked of the Minister for Financeâ€”that is, if the tax is rejected, who gets the refund? I think Australians are entitled to know whether they would be refunded or whether the refund would, in fact, go to the companies.

The effect of the law, as it stands, is that, if the fuel excise indexation arrangements are not validated by the parliament, the funds will be refunded to the taxpayer who was responsible for paying the tax in the first placeâ€”that is, fuel manufacturers or fuel importers. That is something for the Labor Party and the Greens to think about.
