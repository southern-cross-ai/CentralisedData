         International Development

        and the Pacific, Senator Fierravanti-Wells. Can the minister advise the Senate of the contribution that Australian volunteers make to the stability and prosperity of our region?

         I thank Senator Fawcett for his question. Since the 1960s, 13,000 Australians have volunteered their time, their energy, their expertise and their passion in about 42 developing nations in our region and beyond. The Turnbull government recognises the vital role that Australian volunteers play today and have played over many years, not just in our region but beyond. In 2015-16, 1,345 Australians gave their time, their energy and their expertise in 29 different countries, not just in the Indo-Pacific but right across the world. That is helping governments in civil society, in education, in health and in a whole range of different areas to contribute to the economic growth of those countries, in turn to contribute to the prosperity of those countries and, of course, to contribute to the prosperity and security of our region.
        </p>
        <p>
         Everywhere I go, I have the opportunity, and indeed the privilege, to meet many of our volunteers. What is really interesting is that they come from all different ages—some are young and some are retired—and they do all sorts of different things. Their expertise is in a whole range of different areas. It could be, for example, lending support to the legal system or helping, particularly in the Pacific, in the prosthesis area, there being a massive problem with cardiovascular disease and diabetes. These volunteers are the public face of Australia. They are ambassadors for Australia and they are doing an absolutely marvellous job. As I said, they range from speech pathologists right through to those in different industries, but they are all making a wonderful contribution.

            They significantly contribute to building the capacity of countries in our neighbourhood. Basically, our volunteers are helping countries to help themselves. Many are embedded in key positions in countries, both in the Indo-Pacific and beyond, and they do different jobs. Often, they may go to a country to do a particular job but end up doing not just that job but a whole lot more. They become very integrated within the society. Often that is a very good measure of how Australia's contribution is having an effect at the grassroots of their responsibilities. Their assignments are often set out in our aid investment plans, and they are targeted and address particular needs that those countries have, particularly in relation to increasing their economic growth. For example, in 2015-16, 15 per cent of assignments were in the disability sector.

               Every volunteer makes a contribution to our strategic aim to improve the security and stability of our neighbourhood. Every volunteer is at the forefront of building not only the capacity of those countries but also greater understanding, tolerance, peace and harmony in our region. Stability in our region is paramount. A strong, stable and prosperous Australia needs a strong, stable and prosperous Pacific; therefore, utilising our volunteers in key positions means that they are adding not just to the long-term prosperity of the country where they are working but also to the stability and security of our region. They help to deliver skills to our neighbours, they build links and friendships, and I pay tribute to them for the hard work that they do.
