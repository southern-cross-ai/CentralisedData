       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That the Senate record its deep regret at the death, on 18 July 2009, of Private Benjamin Ranaudo, while on combat operations in Afghanistan, and place on record its appreciation of his service to his country, and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have met many men and women of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        and I am always impressed with their professionalism and courage. And Private Benjamin Ranaudo, whose life and service we honour today, was himself a brave and dedicated soldier.
       </p>
       <p>
        He joined the Army over three years ago and had previous operational experience in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
         East Timor
        </a>
        . Private Ranaudo was a popular and valued member of the Townsville based First Battalion Royal Australian Regiment and he was serving with the Mentoring and Reconstruction Task Force on his first tour of duty in Afghanistan at the time of his death. On 18 July this year, Private Ranaudo was killed by an antipersonnel explosive device during a cordon and search operation in the Baluchi Valley, some 25 kilometres north of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarin_Kowt" rel="nofollow">
         Tarin Kowt
        </a>
        . The same blast that claimed the life of this fine soldier also injured another Australian serviceman and three innocent Afghani civilians—and our thoughts are with them as they recover from their wounds.
       </p>
       <p>
        Private Ranaudo’s career record speaks of a professional young man, very well trained, with an extraordinary array of completed courses. I have heard how highly skilled an infantryman he was—someone who always put his mates first, who was a pleasure to be around and who displayed the true qualities of an Australian soldier. All of us in this chamber know that we are, in Afghanistan, engaged with the international community in a very challenging campaign. Our troops in Afghanistan are doing a dangerous and difficult job. As we remember Benjamin Ranaudo today—the 11th member of the ADF to be killed on active duty in Afghanistan—that danger is brought home to us. Today, as we offer our sympathy to Benjamin Ranaudo’s family and friends—and of course as we offer our support to them as well—we say to the family and friends of servicemen Sergeant Andrew Russell, Trooper David ‘Poppy’ Pearce, Sergeant Matthew Locke, Private Luke Worsley, Lance Corporal Jason Marks, Signaller Sean McCarthy, Lieutenant Michael Fussell, Private Greg Sher, Corporal Mathew Hopkins and Sergeant Brett Till that we have not forgotten you, either. We have not forgotten the brave Australian soldiers whom you and we have lost in the fight against the Taliban.
       </p>
       <p>
        For our troops in Afghanistan, danger is an everyday reality. They face it with the courage and the dedication that is the hallmark of the Australian Defence Force wherever they may be. The continued use of mines and improvised explosive devices by the Taliban is an insidious part of this insurgency. These devices, by their very nature, are designed to kill and to maim indiscriminately.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEDs" rel="nofollow">
         IEDs
        </a>
        are a constant danger.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our hearts are very much with the family of Private Benjamin Ranaudo. I spent some time with them at the ramp ceremony and the funeral service. Both occasions were very moving and great tributes were paid to Private Ranaudo, not only by his family but also by those who served alongside him. On behalf of the government I offer my very sincere sympathy to his family—to his mother Jennifer, his father Angelo and all of his brothers and sisters. It is a very sad and extraordinarily difficult time for them. I can only hope that they do find some comfort in the recognition that the Australian parliament is giving to Private Ranaudo today.

         On behalf of the coalition, I rise to support the motion moved by Senator Faulkner and to join with the government in expressing our sincere condolences to the family of Private Benjamin Ranaudo, killed on operations in Afghanistan on 18 July. As Senator Faulkner has said, Private Ranaudo was killed by one of these—as he properly described them—absolutely insidious improvised explosive devices while on operations north of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarin_Kowt" rel="nofollow">
          Tarin Kowt
         </a>
         . And that incident also resulted in very serious injuries to another Australian soldier, Private Paul Warren, as well as, tragically, Afghan civilians. That just shows the depths to which the Taliban will go—to kill their own fellow citizens. Senator Faulkner has properly reported to the Senate on Private Ranaudo’s membership of the Mentoring and Reconstruction Task Force—a great initiative of the ADF in Afghanistan.
        </p>
        <p>
         He was only 22 years old. I have a 23-year-old son, and it strikes you just how young these soldiers are and how tragic it is that the 60-odd years of life Private Ranaudo might have otherwise had have been denied him. His parents have described him as ‘a proud soldier’ who ‘believed in what he did’, which is very, very important. Our thoughts are with his parents during what must be a dreadful time for them. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_the_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Chief of the Defence Force
         </a>
         , Air Chief Marshall Angus Houston, has described Private Ranaudo as:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         … a professional soldier who served enthusiastically and with distinction … dedicated to his career as a soldier and committed to the profession of arms.
        </p>
        <p>
         There could be no better statement than that. The 2nd Mentoring and Reconstruction Task Force Regimental Sergeant Major, Warrant Officer Class One Darren Murch, described Private Ranaudo as ‘a highly skilled infantryman’ who ‘always put his mates first’ and ‘displayed the true qualities of the Australian soldier’.
        </p>
        <p>
         This reminds us, as Senator Faulkner properly said, of the enormous challenges that all coalition forces are facing in Afghanistan. Private Ranaudo was the 11th Australian soldier to die proudly fighting for what we believe in and for Australia’s interests against this dreadful terrorist threat. In fact, it is an enormous credit to the ADF that our losses are so relatively light in what is a dreadful war zone. I think we can all be proud of the ADF and what it is doing.
        </p>
        <p>
         Private Ranaudo’s parents, very importantly, said in their statement that they prayed that Benjamin’s death and the other 10 Australian fatalities in Afghanistan will not be in vain. I think that is very important. We join with the government in the resolve to ensure that Afghanistan does not fall back into the hands of the Taliban. We acknowledge the important role we play in ensuring that. As a member of the cabinet that first committed Australia to action in Afghanistan, I say that it is absolutely imperative that Australia not lose its nerve as a nation. The consequences of failure in Afghanistan, in my view, would be disastrous. I commend the government for its deep commitment to this cause. We respect the service of all Australian men and women in Afghanistan and the enormous sacrifice that they make.
        </p>
        <p>
         We also send our best wishes to Private Paul Warren and his family. I gather he has returned to Australia following the very serious injuries that he suffered. We wish him all the very best for his rehabilitation. We acknowledge and thank him for his courageous service in Afghanistan, and our thoughts and prayers are with him in his rehabilitation. Of course, our thoughts and prayers are also with the family and friends of Private Ranaudo. I want to emphasise our support for all the families of defence personnel serving abroad. We appreciate that they are serving Australia with great distinction and we acknowledge the enormous dangers that they face.

          I rise to briefly concur with the remarks of Senator Faulkner and Senator Minchin and the remarks that will no doubt follow. It is terribly important that we recognise that the death of Private Benjamin Ranaudo was not in vain. At 22 years old, as Senator Minchin pointed out, his life was in front of him. He made the supreme sacrifice for his nation, but his family, Angelo and Jennifer and his sisters, should realise that we acknowledge completely that he engaged in a battle in Afghanistan so we do not have to engage in it here. The families of the people who go forward must always realise that we hold them in the highest respect for their supreme sacrifice and that we recognise that it is their sacrifice that keeps our nation safe. That supreme sacrifice shows their love for our nation. They engage in battles that would be terrifying to so many and they make the sacrifice. Every time it happens we must do our utmost to recognise that.
         </p>
         <p>
          To his colleague Private Paul Warren, we pray for your speedy recovery and acknowledge also the impairments that you have suffered because of your sacrifice to our nation. To the three other civilians who were proximate, we obviously keep you in our thoughts as well. To his colleagues in 1RAR, we acknowledge the great work that you have done and continue to do in the 2nd Mentoring and Reconstruction Task Force. We acknowledge you all the time, and this chamber will never, ever put aside the sacrifice that all of you make, often with your lives. We will today show that in this chamber and let you know that we keep you in our thoughts and our prayers.

            in Victoria, very close to my neighbourhood. I did speak directly with his father to share our condolences directly. I think it is important that the Senate and indeed Australia acknowledge and reflect upon the death of any Australian who puts their life at risk for our freedom. Private Ranaudo paid the highest price for his courage, loyalty and commitment to the ideals of freedom. We can be humbled and proud of Private Benjamin Ranaudo.

            <p>
             I did attend the funeral of Private Benjamin Ranaudo in Melbourne some weeks ago. This was a very fine 22-year-old private. He was an outstanding solider. May I also go on to say he was an outstanding Australian. I extend my heartfelt condolences to Benjamin’s family and to his girlfriend, Hayley. He was on deployment in Afghanistan, a very dangerous place. He was away from family and friends yet was with his brothers in arms. He was a most honourable young man. I say to his family that his sacrifice will never, ever be forgotten.
