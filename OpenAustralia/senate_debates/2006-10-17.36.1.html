        My question is to the Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation, Senator Abetz. Will the minister update the Senate on the status of the fight against illegal fishing in our northern waters. What new measures is the government proposing, to assist in this fight? Is the minister aware of any alternative policies?

         I thank Senator Scullion for his question and acknowledge his strong knowledge of and longstanding interest in our fight against the scourge of illegal fishing in our northern waters.
        </p>
        <p>
         Whilst there are still many hard yards ahead, there are increasingly encouraging signs in the fight against fish poachers in our north. Apprehensions of illegal vessels to date this year have reached a record 308—and that is with 2½ months of the year remaining. In the last calendar year, we apprehended in total 281.
        </p>
        <p>
         Significantly, this increased apprehension rate comes before our $389 million package is fully implemented. Some important aspects of the package are now in full operational mode, including particularly the enhanced offshore protection command, which is resulting in increased coordination of our Navy and Customs assets and focus on illegal fishing.
        </p>
        <p>
         Other significant aspects of the package are yet to hit the water. In particular, Customs—and I acknowledge Senator Ellison’s role in this—is aiming to have the

         style mother ship on the water by January, with tenders currently being assessed. This is a vital component, which has been opposed by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Labor Party
         </a>
         , in its normal opportunistic way, albeit supported by state Labor governments. When this ship, plus our commercial charter and long-range, rapid-response helicopter come on line, I would expect that our effectiveness will be further enhanced, thus making it increasingly uneconomic for fish poachers to risk stealing our fish.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Scullion asked about new measures. I can confirm to the Senate that proposed changes to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_Protection_and_Biodiversity_Conservation_Act" rel="nofollow">

         , the

          EPBC
         </a>
         , introduced in the other place last week, will assist further in this fight. These changes will close an existing legislative loophole which currently prevents the detention and prosecution of foreign nationals for offences against EPBC protected species in our exclusive economic zone—species such as dolphins, turtles and dugongs. Currently, fish poachers in our

         can be arrested and charged, but poachers of other wildlife cannot unless there is evidence of fish poaching as well. These changes to the

         </a>
         are important, sensible measures which should be supported by all sides of politics.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Scullion asked about alternative policies. I would invite those opposite to set aside their opportunistic opposition for opposition’s sake in this area. We saw how they opposed the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
          GST
         </a>
         and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_Choices" rel="nofollow">
          Work Choices
         </a>
         . Everything the government puts up they oppose for opportunistic purposes. Last year those opposite were accusing us of being too soft on illegal fishing. This year they are saying that we are being too tough on illegal fishing. It matters not what one does in this game; those opposite, devoid of their own policies, will simply attack for the sake of attacking. I invite them to put national sovereignty and the national interest first in this important fight against illegal fishing.
