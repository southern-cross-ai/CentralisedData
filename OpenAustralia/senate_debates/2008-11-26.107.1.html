        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Evans. Has the government received any representations or had any discussions on issues relating to this Saturday’s

         I am not sure that I fully understand the question from the senator. What I do know is that a lot of preparation goes into
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
          COAG
         </a>
         meetings. There is a great deal of work conducted by officials from state and Commonwealth governments on the agenda, to try and reach agreed positions and to do the necessary research work and exploratory work that will facilitate the ministers, the Prime Minister and premiers to reach conclusions on their deliberations. So, obviously, a great deal of work goes into those meetings. Former ministers of the Howard government would be well aware of that. In many ways, the COAG meeting is a culmination of a lot of work that has been done by officials in the lead-up. Certainly there would have been preparations done.
        </p>
        <p>
         In terms of my own portfolio, I am not involved in the COAG, so I have no personal knowledge of that arrangement, but it stands to reason that there has been very serious engagement with the states and territories in the lead-up to COAG. The agenda has been prepared and no doubt that will be considered at the meeting. If there is anything further I can help the senator with, I will see whether the Prime Minister has got anything to add. But, as I said, I think it is self-evident that there is a lot of preparation before the meeting. No doubt that will be used to assist the deliberations of the ministers at the COAG meeting.

            Order! Senator Evans, resume your seat. On both sides, order! It is completely disorderly to be shouting across the chamber from both sides. The minister has 33 seconds remaining to answer the question.

             I would regard it as quite prudent not to invite Mr Buswell to certain meetings—not because he is from WA, not because he is a Liberal but because of his own personal characteristics that many of us find offensive.

                    , I ask a further supplementary question. Doesn’t the minister’s partisan answer prove that cooperative federalism is nothing more than a political slogan without any substance? Has the Prime Minister taken any action to reprimand state and territory Labor governments or at least reminded them of the need to work cooperatively, including with the state of Western Australia? If the Prime Minister has been too busy since this became public, given his international commitments, will he do so at the meeting on Saturday?

                       Senator Evans, resume your seat. I no sooner called ‘order’ than two people, one from either side, started up again. It is not fair to the person trying to answer the question. I understand that there will be interjections from time to time, but Senator Evans and other senators are entitled to be heard in silence.

The Prime Minister had a very positive meeting with the premier about that, and I hope that the WA government continues to provide support for that approach. Mr Barnett is a person of strong reputation and he is a very reputable person. I think he and the Prime Minister had a good first meeting on working together in a cooperative way. I am sure that that relationship will continue and I hope WA provides a strong input into the
