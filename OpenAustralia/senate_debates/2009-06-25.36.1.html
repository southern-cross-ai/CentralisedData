         by leave—The government does not support this motion. It was the opposition’s decision to insert their amendment into a section of the act that does not commence until November 2009. This timing was clearly outlined in the explanatory memorandum that accompanied the bill at the time that it was being debated, so the opposition was aware of the likely time frame. The government is on track to complete the necessary work required to commence operation of this section of the act in November. Commencing this section of the act prior to the necessary work being completed would result in a legally ineffective environmental impact assessment, enforcement and offences regime and could create confusion and imposts for marine park users. It is not legally possible to commence the specific amendments separately to schedules 4 and 6. For those reasons, we do not support the motion.

          by leave—There is absolutely no legal reason why the government cannot proclaim that particular section of the act without proclaiming the other parts of the act that Senator Ludwig referred to. It was the intention of the Senate, when the motion was originally passed, that those spent conviction provisions take effect immediately. By a curiosity in the act, what Senator Ludwig says is correct, but it does not in any way stop the government from today proclaiming that particular provision and so bringing into effect the will of the Senate and the interests of those who have been wronged by this particular provision. I am not here to debate this, of course, and I cannot urge people to vote for the motion, but I simply say that the government’s reason for opposing the motion is not precise.

           by leave—The government will not call a division on this matter. We recognise that, whilst the Greens would support the government, both Senator Xenophon and

            Senator Fielding
           </a>
           are supporting the opposition. That would give the motion a bare majority. We recognise that and therefore will not call a division.
