        I want to pay my respects to the many transport workers who have lost their lives while working in one of Australia's deadliest industries, and to their families and loved ones. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Workers_Union" rel="nofollow">
         Transport Workers Union
        </a>
        are fighting for safe, fair and enforceable standards for transport workers in the gig economy. I commend the ongoing advocacy of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TWU" rel="nofollow">

        Vic/Tas Branch secretary, Mike McNess, and assistant secretary Mem Suleyman; and the national secretary, Michael Kaine.

        Not too long ago I met with a delegation from the Transport Workers Union. The group included union reps, industry employers and transport workers. They spoke to us about the challenges facing the sectorâ€”namely, the unregulated and insecure gig economy that has led to the unnecessary loss of lives. The delegation shared their stories with many of us in this place. One story from the delegation that was particularly striking was from Mr Dogan, who spoke about his beloved nephew, a food delivery rider who was, tragically, killed while on the job. His family was denied funeral expense cover and never even received a condolence note from Uber Eats. Thank you, Mr Dogan, for so generously sharing your story. The tragedy of your nephew and of the 11 other food delivery drivers who have devastatingly lost their lives since 2017 is not lost on us. Every worker is entitled to security at work. Every worker deserves to get home safe. We'll continue to fight for transport workers to make this a reality.
