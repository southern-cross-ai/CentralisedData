        My question is the Minister representing the Attorney-General and the Minister for Youth, Senator Wong. Is the minister aware of reports surrounding the appalling conditions of juvenile justice detention centres around Australia, and in particular reports about the Magill Youth Training Centre in her and my home state of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">

               Senator Abetz continues to try to convince himself that Mr Howard is still the prime minister, but anyway! Senator Hanson-Young, I have gone into the question in my capacity as Minister representing the Attorney-General. I am aware of an article in the
               <i>
                Advertiser
               </i>
               from a few days ago on the Magill Training Centre. As senators may or may not be aware, that is a detention centre for young people who have been arrested and refused bail or been before a court and remanded in custody. The article makes a range of assertions about the conditions of the training centre.
              </p>
              <p>
               Obviously, some of those allegations are of concern. The training centre, as I understand it, is the responsibility of the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                South Australia
               </a>
               n government. In fact, Senator Hanson-Young, I think you made some comments in that article in relation to that issue. As I said, there are some concerning suggestions made in that article by people who are in that training centre and the government is aware of that in that context, but I again make the point that these are—

                I thank the senator for the clarification. I know that she used to be responsible for representing the Minister for Youth. Of course, before, there was an even younger senator on the front bench here. Thank you, Senator Wong, for answering those questions, particularly those relating to your role representing the Attorney-General, because I do believe that this is an important justice issue.
               </p>
               <p>
                I have a supplementary question. Is the minister aware that the conditions of the Magill youth training centre have been described as ‘a living children’s rights abuse hell’ by the Australian youth representative to the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
                 United Nations
                </a>
                ? They are said to be in breach of the United Nations
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child" rel="nofollow">
                 Convention on the Rights of the Child
                </a>
                , a convention to which Australia is a signatory. It must, therefore, be an important issue for the federal government. It is a breach because it does not comply with health and safety standards and does not provide a standard of living adequate for a child’s physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development, let alone the ability to help these young people to be rehabilitated—

                 . As I said, this is a centre that, as I understand it, is operated by the state government. I note that Senator Hanson-Young has suggested—I am not sure if that was one of the questions in the range of questions she asked me—that this should be part of the stimulus spending. I reiterate there that there were very clear guidelines around the nature of the facilities that the stimulus package would be expended upon. In the context of the education aspect, it was very clear that it would be spent on schools. I can advise the senator that the Attorney-General’s office is aware of these issues and that the government will consider the concerns that have been raised and, if appropriate, raise these issues with the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
