         Thank you, Senator Keneally, for your question. I think that it will be ugly. I agree with Senator Canavan. You'll have to check with Barnaby about whether he doesn't.

         What we're doing, as a political party, is carefully considering the proposal before us, and this proposal will set up a net zero position for our country over the next three decades. It's only right and proper that the party that represents miners, foresters, fishers, manufacturing workers, farmers and those who live out in rural and regional Australia assesses the impact of this decision on our communities. And that impact is not just between now and the next election and not just between now and our own political careers but between now and the three decades when this policy will be rolled out and will have impact. We're doing that in a calm, methodical way. We're doing it on behalf of the regions. It is the right and proper process to go through. Our party room has primacy in this. It's not the leader having a top-down approach on what should or shouldn't happen to our communities or what should and shouldn't happen to our industries; it is each and every MP and senator feeding into the leadership group what they think will be the implications and what their views are, and we're taking those forward as a group.

           Mr Joyce has declared that if Mr Morrison adopts net zero by 2050 without the Nationals blessing it could be 'a very hard time for the government' and 'not what you want for a harmonious government.' What does the Deputy Prime Minister mean by that?

            As I said yesterday, we've been a very successful coalition government for 75 years, delivering outcomes for our nation and for the regions as a result of our shared values and commitment to deliver. Sometimes we disagree—very rarely—but we do disagree. It is important that, when we have periods of disagreement, it is a respectful conversation. That is exactly how we are conducting this negotiation. It would be best, obviously, for the coalition that we come to an agreement. But we've made it very clear that we're not agreeing to anything that isn't right for the regions.

                     The point of order is direct relevance. The use of a verb doesn't mean that anything associated, potentially, with the verb is directly relevant. The former President talked about glancing references to the opposition; we understand that's part of the interplay of question time. But the minister was asked about Nationals resigning.

                     That is the question. We'd ask her to be directly relevant. I'm happy to move leave for Senator Canavan to speak for two minutes. I'm happy to give him leave. If the government will give him leave, we will give him leave.

                       The question was clearly about resignations. Senator Keneally has great experience here in forcing the resignation of a Labor candidate for the lower house, so this is directly relevant to the questioner's experience.

                          very clearly went specifically to matters of National Party ministers and their current representation in the current ministerial arrangements in the very first part of her response. Having addressed directly the direct question asked, it is entirely appropriate for a minister to be able to give context, including historical context, in relation to such answers that have been given. It is entirely appropriate for a minister to be able to elaborate on a point that they're making, and, in elaborating, that may mean that they are adding further context and information to what they have provided in terms of a direct response to the question that was asked.
