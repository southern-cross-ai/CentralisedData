        My question is to the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator Carr. Can the minister inform the Senate of what the government’s approach to climate change means for industry? What role do research and innovation play in the government’s approach? How is the government addressing the challenge of climate change while keeping our economy strong?

         I thank Senator Sterle for this very important question. You cannot tackle climate change by sticking to business as usual. You cannot tackle climate change by planting a couple of trees. You can only tackle climate change by transforming the economy, by creating a market based framework that will encourage people to find new and better ways of doing things.

           The government is developing strategic partnerships with industry to achieve the necessary transformation to secure a response to climate change. We are giving industry meaningful incentives to retool and make their operations greener and more sustainable. The

           is dramatically accelerating that process.

We are supporting the efforts of Australian innovators to develop and commercialise low carbon products and services. We are taking a high-tech path to a low carbon future by promoting innovation, attracting new investment, building infrastructure—

Our emphasis is on innovation because it is only by changing the way we do things that we can hope to meet the challenge of climate change. Innovation will give us the answers that we need. It will also make us more productive and more competitive.

                Innovation is the key to maintaining our living standards in a carbon constrained world. The opposition might have started thinking about climate change this week but the government has been acting on it for two years. In my portfolio, Clean Business Australia has already increased the energy and efficiency of existing businesses and it is stepping up Australian innovation to address climate change. A New Car Plan for a Greener Future has already secured new investments in local production for greener vehicle technologies. When the

                legislation is passed, we will roll out a further $1.97 billion climate change action fund to help industry, to help workers and to help communities to adjust to the demands of a carbon constrained world. The fund will support a new innovation in climate change program which will build on the success—

                  Emissions trading is the only way to bring about the fundamental transformation that this economy needs. Thirty-five countries have reached exactly the same conclusion and so did Mr Howard, Mr Costello and Mr Turnbull, but the temporary Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, thinks he knows a lot better than that. He thinks that climate change is all ‘crap’. He says he will conduct the greatest challenge of our time by a giant con job. The opposition’s plan does less and costs more and it is taxpayers who will be footing the bill. It will do nothing to transform Australian industry, it will do nothing for the millions of Australians who depend on industry for their livelihood and it will do nothing to stimulate new technology. The choice is very clear. A
