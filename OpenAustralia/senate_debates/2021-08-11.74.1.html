         I thank Senator Hughes for her question on this really important issue. We know that timely information and support are absolutely essential for Australians who live with disability, but never more so than they are now, as we navigate the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.
        </p>
        <p>
         The disability community is particularly diverse, and finding information about policies and programs and supports that are available for individuals can be quite a challenge. A lack of access to this information can also be a barrier to people being able to access the community and independence and their participation. We recognise this. In response, the Morrison-Joyce government has invested in the National Disability Gateway. We've worked extensively with people with disability and the disability sector to design a fit-for-purpose tool to make sure that Australians who live with disability have easy access to information and referral services. Importantly, we've relied on the advice of people in the field: those with lived experience of disability and those who care and advocate for them.
        </p>
        <p>
         The gateway will assist people with disability, and their families and carers, to use this trusted information through a website, a 1800 number and social media channels. It's a tool with information and advice on support from programs that range from education and health to housing and transport. It will be the central starting point for people with disability to be able to access the information and services that they need. It's fast and easy to use and it offers a range of accessible features—for example, an easy-read toggle on every single page of the website. Whether it be locating advocacy services, finding a sporting team to become involved with or identifying a local disability related event, the tool is there to assist everyone. Importantly, the gateway is for all Australians with disability, regardless of who they are or where they live.

            Currently there is a national campaign being rolled out across the screens to encourage Australians with disability, and their families and carers, to interact with the new gateway. The tagline of the national campaign is 'I can.' What's so great about the campaign is that the ads are presented by people with disability. They represent the range of different disabilities, both visible and invisible, demonstrating that there is a huge diversity of different people in the disability community. Importantly, they know, from their own from experience, what a trusted service is all about; they understand what it is that they need and will genuinely understand what will make a difference to their lives. The campaign's run across a whole heap of media—radio, print advertisements and social media—and, throughout the Paralympics, we'll be running a

            campaign as well. Already we've seen a huge increase in the number of hits on the gateway as a result of this campaign.

               Our government's absolutely committed to the National Disability Gateway, in response to the collective views of the disability community, who said that information about programs and services was often difficult to find and equally difficult to navigate. The gateway forms part of the government's investment in the new National Disability Strategy, where all governments—Commonwealth, state and territory—have committed to a national approach to building inclusion for all Australians who live with disability. There are an estimated 4.4 million people with disability across Australia, all with diverse and varying needs, and the gateway is designed to reach all of them, their families and the wider community. The website and the phone line are a central starting point to help people with disability, their carers, friends and family access services in their particular area and will help drive real improvements in their lives. The national campaign has also been designed to make sure that access is available to everyone.
