        The Australian Government has implemented a range of measures following the Montara and Gulf of Mexico incidents.

       <ul>
        <li>
         Initiated an Inquiry into the uncontrolled hydrocarbon release from the Montara Wellhead Platform that occurred from 21 August—3 November 2009. Commissioner David Borthwick AO

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Inquiry" rel="nofollow">
          The Inquiry

         was conducted on a “no-blame” basis under the powers of the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006.

         Commenced an internal government review of the findings and recommendations arising from the

        In addition the National Offshore Petroleum Authority (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOPSA" rel="nofollow">
         NOPSA
        </a>
        ) has increased its focus, in safety case assessments and through its inspection of drilling rigs, on issues arising from the Montara incident. NOPSA has urged Australian titleholders and rig operators to learn from the initial key safety recommendations made by US authorities in the wake of the Gulf of Mexico incident, including in relation to well control equipment (both surface and subsea), review all rig drilling/casing/completion practices and review all emergency shutdown and dynamic positioning procedures that interface with emergency well control operations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Companies operating in Australia are reviewing their operations to ensure that there are no further incidents. A number of them have already implemented actions in relation to their activities in Australia and worldwide. This includes reviews of well plans, drilling processes, blow-out contingency plans, testing frequencies and training of personnel.

       <p class="italic">
        The Montara Commission of inquiry is reporting to the minister for resources tomorrow. When will the government be releasing the report to the public for public review?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Commissioner David Borthwick AO PSM, delivered his report arising from the Montara Commission of Inquiry to the Minister for Resources and Energy, Martin Ferguson AM MP, on 18 June 2010.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Minister will properly consider the findings and recommendations of the report and act promptly and appropriately on them.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Prior to releasing the report publicly the Minister is bound to take advice to ensure that in the handling of this report he does nothing to prejudice the conduct of further investigations for possible offences including criminal offences, other civil or criminal action, or undermine any natural justice considerations.
