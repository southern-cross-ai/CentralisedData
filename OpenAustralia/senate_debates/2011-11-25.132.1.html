         The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) Since the High Court decision in the

          NFP
         </a>
         ) sector including, but not limited to, the charitable housing sector. These issues were raised in respect to the growing risk that profits of unrelated commercial activities undertaken by NFP entities may not be being applied to the entity's charitable or altruistic purpose.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2)
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">

        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) No targeted consultation was undertaken with representatives of the NFP housing sector prior to the 2011-12 Budget announcement. However, the Government met with NFP sector representatives prior to the Budget announcement.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) The Treasury is currently engaged in implementing the Government's 2011-12 Budget measure to better target NFP tax concessions, which will cover the entire NFP sector.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">

         </a>
