        My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Minister Gallagher. On 26 July 2021, in a media release, the Prime Minister, along with the Treasurer, said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        An Albanese Labor Government will deliver the same legislated tax relief to more than 9 million Australians as the Morrison Government.

        and Caucus have today confirmed that Labor in government will uphold the legislated changes to personal income taxes and maintain the existing regimes for negative gearing and capital gains tax.
       </p>
       <p>
        Minister, given you have already broken your promise to uphold legislated changes to personal income taxes, will you now categorically rule out any changes to negative gearing?

We accept it must have killed them to adopt Labor tax policy. It must have killed them to accept that Labor's policy was better than theirs, reached more people than stage 3 and was a fairer way to distribute that money.

                     We've been very clear on the tax reform the government is undertaking. We have changed our position on income tax. They have changed their position on income tax. We have brought forward some sensible measures around superannuation. We have brought forward some sensible measures around PRRT. We are bringing forward some measures around multinational tax reform. And you want to talk about all the things we are not doing, because you don't want to talk about the things we are doing, because you support the things we are doing.

                               I have a point of order, and it goes to relevance on two fronts. I would contend that the minister has not answered the question. Senator Hume's very narrowly worded question focused on what the government's policy is, not what the law is. But I also point out that, if the minister believes she's answered the question, that's then not an invitation to use the residual time to talk about whatever she wants. The answer still needs to be directly relevant to the question asked.

                                  Yes. As the chamber would have seen, I did seek the advice of the Clerk, and the question is out of order, pursuant to standing order 73, because that says that you can't directly ask about specific government policies—for a statement of policy. So, the minister is quite within her rights to answer the question in whatever way she sees fit.

                                   Thank you. And the policy that we have bought before the parliament is the income tax policy—the income tax policy that you wanted to call an election on, but now your are in support of it. Before that you said you were against it, before you even saw it. Then you were going to reverse it. Then you were going to roll it back. Then we saw the crab walking away when you realised, 'Oh, wait on: we've looked in the tea-leaves, and this isn't going so well', and you adopted it. And now you want to talk about everything else.

That is the work that we are doing. That is the work we did over summer. That is the work we did in our first budget. That's the work we did in our second budget, in our MYEFO.

                                          I'm answering the question you asked around the advice that the Treasury provides. I told you that the government has sought advice and support from our departments around cost-of-living relief. That's what you've seen flow through our budgets. And it's what you've voted against time after time, so no wonder your question didn't have 'cost of living' in it—because you have voted against the cost-of-living measures when they have come here. We will work with departments to ensure that we can provide cost-of-living relief where we can and where we can responsibly afford to do so.

I note that the Prime Minister said that he wants Australians to 'earn more and keep more of what they earn' and that Labor's plan will deliver a tax cut to all Australians. Can you please explain why the Albanese Labor government has made the decision to tackle cost-of-living pressures and deliver a tax cut to all Australians?

                                            Thank you to Senator Polley for that question. Cost-of-living relief is the highest priority of this government. It's our top priority. As of 1 July this year, every Australian taxpayer will get to keep more of what they earn—that's 13.6 million Australians—because the Albanese Labor government is working for every Australian. It's in Labor's

                                            , unlike those opposite. These tax cuts offer relief and reform—more relief for workers and better reform for our economy. Labor is doing the right thing for the right reasons. Treasury is clear that the plan does not add to inflation. Labor's tax cut is backed by Treasury. It went through

                                           <p>
                                            After the government said it would deliver tax cuts, Senator Cash said they would 'oppose tax cuts' and Senator Birmingham said they were not going to be supporting Labor—because their reflex is always to oppose, even if it means they are not supporting Australians. Of course, if those opposite had considered the detail and the facts—that Labor's plan benefits every single Australian taxpayer and that it puts more money into the pockets of hardworking Australians—then maybe the Leader of the Opposition wouldn't have been so humiliated on national television last night.

                                           <p>
                                            The reason the opposition have had to support these tax cuts is that they know in their heart of hearts it's the right thing to do. They know Labor has done the right thing. They know Labor's tax cuts will deliver bigger tax cuts for more Australians, and more Australians will be better off as a result.

                                               I thank Senator Polley for her question. She, of course, is one of the great Tasmanian Senate team for Labor, and they all know that every single taxpayer in Tasmania and around the country will be better off as a result of these tax cuts. In fact, in Senator Polley's home state of Tasmania, nine in 10 taxpayers will receive a bigger cut than they would have under the Morrison government's policies. Nine in 10—280,000 people—will pay less tax than they are now. We know hardworking women are likely to earn less. In Tasmania, about 140,000 women will get a tax cut, and 94 per cent of them will get more than they would have under the Morrison-Dutton plan. So I'd say to Senator Duniam, Senator Chandler, Senator Colbeck and Senator Askew, why is it that our Senate team can do so much more for Tasmanians, and particularly Tasmanian women, than you ever could?

                                                  I thank the senator, who, like all members of the Albanese government, is engaged with her community. Meanwhile, I have to say the response from those opposite shows they clearly don't listen, although we already know this. They didn't listen at the last election to those many Australians who demanded action on climate change, and, certainly, Senator Caravan is still not listening. There are those who choose a bit of conspiracy and echo chambers over evidence and listening.

                                                  On Monday night, more of the Liberals' and Nationals' self-serving attitudes were exposed. Mr Turnbull said, 'The former government treated Australia as a plaything.' Senator Reynolds said, 'People were blackmailed and threatened into supporting Mr Dutton,' and Mr Morrison said, 'Mr Dutton was seen as a great intolerant threat to the moderates.' I don't think we have to say much more than what they say about themselves. We on this side do the right thing for the right reasons, and we always will.

                                                  </p>
                                                  <p class="italic">
                                                   The government has no plans for a mining tax. The Prime Minister has been very clear on that. The Treasurer has been clear on that.
                                                  </p>

                                                   On 8 February 2023, in question time, the Prime Minister ruled out any changes to the fuel tax credits scheme. Considering both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have repeatedly reassured Australians that they had no plans to change the stage 3 tax cuts and then broke that promise, how long will it be before you betray the trust of the Australian people again and introduce a mining tax or undermine the fuel tax credits scheme?

                                                    I thank Senator Canavan for the question. Again, I think there is an obvious reason why they don't want to talk about the change that we have brought forward on tax—the change that the parliament will be considering, the one that the House has been considering and, indeed, the one that you have adopted. And, by adopting that policy, you have accepted that it was the right thing to do—to change our position; that it was a fairer way of applying those tax cuts; that it got to more people—bigger tax cuts to more people, and everybody gets a tax cut. You have accepted that as your policy and, in doing so, you now want to talk about everything that we are not doing.
                                                   </p>
                                                   <p>
                                                    The Prime Minister has fronted up and he has explained to the Australian people why he has changed his mind and why the government have changed our minds. It is to ensure that the tax cuts reach more people and that the average taxpayer gets a much bigger tax cut, that 90 per cent of women get a bigger tax cut when they're paying tax and that a hundred per cent of women taxpayers get a tax cut. And you want to talk about other things. We have a full book of tax reform. How about you work with us—

You want to talk about all the things we are not doing—that are not proposals by this government.

I'm just not going to do it. You wouldn't expect me to pull out one ingredient or one part of tax reform.' You are so clearly embarrassed by the position you have taken, by the backflip, by your adoption of our policy that you're scrapping around looking in that drawer for scare campaigns of 'what next?' because you've actually had to capitulate and accept that our policy on tax is the better policy.

We have high-balance-super-accounts reform. We have PRRT reform. Those reforms are before the parliament. That is the government's tax reform agenda. You might want to talk about all the things we're not doing, because you're so embarrassed about the fact that the decision we took was the right one.

Minister, could you reassure the 1.1 million people who work directly or indirectly in the resources sector, or the millions more who work with and rely on our farmers, that you will not break yet another promise and introduce a mining tax or change the fuel tax credit scheme?

I explained the government's tax reform agenda, some of which you have adopted and other parts of which you are blocking. The rule in, rule out game is fine for everybody else but not for you. We have been very clear what our tax reform is.

That is a very clear answer for all of you who quite can't seem to grapple with it and can't quite can't seem to understand.

We've explained the position.
