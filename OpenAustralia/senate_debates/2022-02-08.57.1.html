        My question is to Senator Birmingham, the Minister representing the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister has said that he's committed to making workplaces safe, but Commissioner Jenkins's earlier report,
        <i>
         Respect@Work
        </i>
        , made it clear that a positive duty on employers is critical to achieving that. Your party voted against that. Then we were told at last estimates that consultation on the positive duty would start in December, with a view to implementation by late March. We're now in the second week of February, with only a handful of sitting days before an election, and none of this has happened. How can women in this country have any confidence that this government is committed to making any workplace safe for them?

         I thank Senator Waters for her question. At the commencement, I acknowledge that my colleague Senator Cash and the government have been pursuing action across a range of areas in implementing recommendations from the
         <i>
          Respect@Work
         </i>
         report—a very valuable and important piece of work, undertaken by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_Discrimination_Commissioner" rel="nofollow">
          Sex Discrimination Commissioner
         </a>
         , in terms of advancing equality and opportunity across Australian workplaces. The government's comprehensive response has been released.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Waters's question relates specifically to recommendation 17, the positive duty recommendation. The government has been clear: we believe this requires further consultation to assess how such a duty would operate effectively alongside existing duties under various work health and safety laws and, indeed, under the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_Discrimination_Act" rel="nofollow">
          Sex Discrimination Act
         </a>
         , including to ensure that additional complexity is not created for those seeking to use such protections. We are working through those consultation processes to make sure that any changes that are put in place operate as intended and do not result in unnecessary duplication, confusion or uncertainty for either employers or employees.
        </p>
        <p>
         The vicarious liability provisions in the Sex Discrimination Act and model work health and safety laws already place, I'm advised, a positive duty on employers to protect workers from health and safety risks, including psychosocial risks such as sexual harassment, so far as that is reasonably practicable. Employers must therefore already take reasonable and preventative steps such as implementing appropriate policies and providing—

           Yes, reluctantly. I did go to the question of timing. I'm aware of everything else you've said, Minister, but you said consultation would be done and that it would be implemented by March. Where is it?

            Senator Waters, you've brought the minister's attention back to part of the question. The minister was being directly relevant to other parts of the question. Minister, you have the call.

               This morning's statement committed to listening to survivors and staff, but the Prime Minister is reportedly not going to listen to Grace Tame or Brittany Higgins at the

                These are important matters that I would hope could exist and be discussed above cheap political pot shots or pointscoring such as occurred in the question there from Senator Waters. I have no doubt that the Prime Minister will indeed be seeking to ensure he understands the messages and views that are conveyed in tomorrow's
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Club" rel="nofollow">

                address, as he does other statements of importance that are made across the country. He recognises the important work around

                 Respect@Work
                </i>
                , which is why, under Prime Minister Morrison, the government has been pursuing the vast majority of those recommendations. Some 42 of the 55 recommendations under

                  Despite government commitments that survivors would be invited to today's statement of acknowledgement address, we've heard from a number of survivors who participated in the review that they didn't know about the statement until they heard about it in the media. This is not acceptable. What went wrong? What message do you think that sends survivors?
