        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Payne. Can the minister advise the Senate on how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting our region and how Australia is responding through our Partnerships for Recovery strategy?

         I thank Senator Askew for the question and for her interest in our international affairs. We know the COVID-19 challenge has brought a range of difficulties to our region. Health systems and livelihoods have been put seriously at risk. With our Pacific island neighbours, together we acted decisively to contain the spread of the virus and we stood together in our responses.
        </p>
        <p>
         We're working with partners in the

         s Forum to support a specific humanitarian pathway to move essential humanitarian supplies and workers. I meet again next week with my counterparts in the ministerial action group on the implementation of the pathway, and I really appreciate the support of the Tuvalu foreign minister, Simon Kofe, and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIF" rel="nofollow">

         secretary general, Dame Meg Taylor, in our joint statement about the pathway on 1 June.
        </p>
        <p>
         Framing our response, as the senator said, we released Australia's new development strategy, Partnerships for Recovery, focusing on the Pacific,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timor_Leste" rel="nofollow">
          Timor Leste
         </a>
         and Indonesia and concentrating on three areas: health, stability and economic recovery. This entails a pivot of our development effort towards the immediate needs of partners in our region. We're also making important contributions to the global response and to the recovery, committing $352 million at the European Union conference for vaccines, diagnostics and treatment and $300 million to Garvi the Vaccine Alliance, which was recognised today by a motion in this chamber. I acknowledge the support of the chamber for that.
        </p>
        <p>
         How this region comes through this crisis matters to all of us. The growth and stability of the Indo-Pacific has provided the foundations for our own security and prosperity. Most importantly, we recognise that Australia can only do this with partners in partnership.

            countries will be between zero and negative 12 per cent this year. For example, up to 70,000 tourism jobs are at risk in Fiji alone. In South-East Asia, economic growth is stalling, after five decades of rapid expansion.
           </p>
           <p>
            We're working closely with partners and with international financial institutions to forge pathways to economic recovery by keeping markets and businesses functioning, avoiding government debt stress, and strengthening human capital and job creation. Also in Indonesia, for example, we're providing technical advice on economic stimulus and social protection measures. In the Pacific we're delivering immediate financing support to strengthen our neighbours' capacity to provide essential services to their communities.

                Fiame Naomi Mataafa

               , to discuss the impact of COVID-19 on women's health, economic security and personal safety. Thirty Pacific parliamentary and civil service women leaders from 18 countries—an impressive meeting in anyone's terms—agreed to work together to explore new ways to enhance the wellbeing of women and girls. Contributions canvassed the economic impact, family concerns, women's safety, jobs and cultural issues—thought provoking and vital for shared understanding of the challenges. Our Partnerships for Recovery strategy is underpinned by our focus on the most vulnerable and includes addressing gender specific impacts of COVID-19. Australia stands with Pacific women at this time.
