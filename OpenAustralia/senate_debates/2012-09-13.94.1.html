        , Senator Conroy. I refer the minister to reports that the government has frozen $2 billion worth of grants as a result of a $120 billion black hole in its budget and the

        cost blow-out. Can the minister confirm that part of this freeze includes the $1 billion Regional Development Australia Fund, which it promised to the Independents in return for their support after the 2010 election? Can you confirm that you will deliver all promises to regional Australia in the time frame you promised the Independents?

         I congratulate Senator Joyce on campaigning in his own portfolio area. The government is building on the $4.3 billion investment announced in the 2011-12 budget by continuing to invest in regional health initiatives, education, liveability, skills and infrastructure in the 2012-13 budget. The 2012-13 budget invested in regional Australia with projects including $3.7 billion for the national Living Longer. Living Better aged-care plan—including improving aged-care service delivery in regional, rural and remote areas, recognising special regional needs and including zero real interest loans and a viability supplement to assist providers in targeted areas; $1.5 billion for the Remote Jobs and Communities Program to provide a more integrated—

As I was saying, $1.5 billion for the Remote Jobs and Communities Program to provide a more integrated and flexible approach to employment and participation services for people living in remote areas of Australia; a billion dollars over four years to start the first stage of the National Disability Insurance Scheme, providing people with disabilities in up to four regions personalised care and support; $524 million to strengthen Australia’s biosecurity system, which underpins our unique biosecurity status—

              , Senator Conroy is exactly responding to that question by detailing the delivery of the commitments made to regional Australia. He is providing the detail of those commitments, of the delivery of those commitments and of the record of huge investment in rural and regional Australia, for the first time in many years, across a range of portfolios. So I would suggest, Mr President, that Senator Conroy is exactly responding to the question asked, which was about commitments given to invest in regional Australia.

So $225 million to assist parents with the cost of child care including those in rural and remote areas of Australia who are undertaking work, study or training, to better enable them to take advantage of employment opportunities; $77 million over four years for a new grants program to help dentists relocate to regional, rural and remote areas; $34.9 million to meet increased demand of

                       Yes. Is 'stocktake' just code for delay so that you are not actually going to deliver on your promises to the Independents? Because you are not delivering on those promises, don't you think it is time that they deliver on their promise to withdraw support from you?
