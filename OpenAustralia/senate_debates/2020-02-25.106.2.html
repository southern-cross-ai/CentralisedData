        Purpose of the Bill
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill removes references to specific Regulations in Acts, replacing them with references to the enabling powers for those Regulations. Passing the Bill will contribute to the ongoing maintenance and integrity of the Commonwealth statute book, and improve the quality and accuracy of Commonwealth legislation. This is important as it will promote consistency and useability of the Commonwealth statute book. The Bill contributes to the Government's regulatory reform agenda by improving the accuracy of Commonwealth legislation.
