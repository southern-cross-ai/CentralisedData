         I thank the senator very much for his question. It is very helpful to have his interest in the issues of the

         In general, records management is changing with technology. That is hardly a revelation. Since July 2012, the department has kept all its new Centrelink records electronically. The number of paper files that we have and the workload that goes with that have decreased significantly. Because the need for traditional records management facilities in the department has been reducing we have been reviewing the way we manage our records. For example, if a lease comes up for renewal—and call me crazy!—the records management properties area in the department quite rightly considers the sustainability of that site. In some cases we have got record management centres which are merged—

           The management of all my department's records, whether they are outsourced or in-house, complies with the relevant policy requirements. Australians can be absolutely confident that their information is secure and that this is an effective and efficient way of doing business. The Australian public should expect no less than that efficiency and effectiveness.

             Again, it is important to put the mistruths which are being peddled to the sword, quite frankly. Contrary to that scaremongering, these changes will not result in any job losses for my department. I find, in fact, the protests of those opposite quite interesting, given that the outsourcing of record-management units for Medicare began in 2009—

                  Firstly they closed the Darwin office in 2011. Then they consolidated two units in Perth in 2012. So perhaps Senator Cameron could decide to check his facts. He has half-a-dozen former human services ministers to ask, including three in this chamber.

                     , I ask a further supplementary question. I thank the minister for that excellent answer. Can the minister advise the Senate how these arrangements will improve her department's capacity to deliver services for all Australians?

                      I think 'the great outsourcer' is an exceptional interjection, Senator Fifield! I can advise the Senator that, in a revolutionary way, of course, as we see the result of the evolving nature of records management, we are reviewing the sort of work that existing records management staff are doing.

                      to make sure that we have consistent and up-to-date job descriptions for records-management staff. It does not matter how many lies they tell opposite—
