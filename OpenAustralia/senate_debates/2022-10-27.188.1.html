        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Education, Senator Watt. Private schools funding across the forward estimates will now be $1.7 billion more than the amount the previous government committed in their final budget. Does the minister believe that throwing even more money at private schools at a time when public education is in dire need of support is a fair thing to do?

         Thank you, Senator Allman-Payne, for the question. I speak to you as a proud product of the state education system in Queensland, as is my wife and as are both of our children. But, as I have often said in the past, I equally respect the right of families to choose the schooling environment that is appropriate for them. For my family, the appropriate choice was a state school environment. For other families it's a Catholic or independent school.

             As I said, we respect the choice of families as to the appropriate schooling environment for their children. That's why we're providing funding for both state and non-secular schooling environments. Some of the things we have delivered in this budget are $270.8 million over two years for the Schools Upgrade Fund, $56.2 million for bursaries to attract more high achievers into teaching, $68.3 million to expand the High Achieving Teachers program, $27.6 million for other measures to tackle teacher shortages and better prepare student teachers for the classroomâ€”

                 Just to provide a bit more detail on funding for different sectors, in 2022 the Australian government is providing $25 billion in recurrent school funding. The largest amount, $9.94 billion, is to government schools. There is $8.64 billion for Catholic schools and $6.67 billion for independent schools. The increase to non-state schooling in this year's budget is, I understandâ€”and, again, I'll check thisâ€”as a result of the indexation model that already exists and has applied for some time. But I've run out of time.

                   As a proportion of total funding, private school funding is growing, according to the budget, and funding for public schools is shrinking. Does the minister accept that the government's budget has moved Australia even further away from reaching 100 per cent of the minimum Schooling Resource Standard for public schools?

                    Senator Allman-Payne, as I was saying, one of the factors that influence the amount of funding that's provided to different schooling sectors in every budget is the indexation model. Another factor that influences it is the number of enrolments in particular sectors. We are in the process of beginning a new schools funding agreement with the states and territories which will consider a wide range of matters, including the indexation of school funding.

                    But I might point out that in electorates that are represented by the Greens, such as Brisbane, Griffith and Ryan, there is a substantial proportion of families who choose a non-state schooling environment for their children. We strongly support the rights and interests of public schools, and, as I say, I've reflected that in my own personal decisions. But we also respect the need for some level of funding for private schooling as well.

Is the minister also aware that there has been around a 45 per cent increase in demountables in New South Wales public schools from 2014 to 2020? Does the minister believe that it is fair that Labor is giving even more money to private schools while the public system crumbles?

                       . I think it is important for all independent schools to be accountable for the public funding that they receive and to make good decisions about how that funding is used. I don't think that taxpayers would expect public funding to be used for inappropriate purposes. It is intended to be used for what goes on in classrooms. I'd certainly encourage all private schools to approach funding that way.

                       There is no doubt that state schools in Australia need more public funding. They've needed it for at least the last 10 years during which the last government was in power. These are matters that we will consider further with the states and territories as we approach a new schools funding agreement.
