          Last night we witnessed an extraordinary situation where the government's guillotine stopped its own minister from being able to make a ministerial statement. That ministerial statement was then tabled in this place in a manner that provided no opportunity, as ministerial statements usually do, for the opposition to respond. That is of grave concern because the ministerial statement made by Senator Conroy once again poses far more questions than it does answers. Those questions can only be transparently and rightly dealt with through a proper, open parliamentary inquiry. This is exactly what select committees were established for, and I would urge, particularly given the extraordinary nature of Senator Conroy's statement, and the content of that statement that has already been highlighted by others as false or misleading in some ways, that the chamber support this motion.

             I will not take up the full two minutes. I have some sympathy for this motion that was proposed by Senator Birmingham earlier this week, and I apologise to Senator Birmingham for keeping him in limbo. I wanted to see whether the minister was proposing to make a statement. I also agree that the timing is highly unfortunate. I would have appreciated more time, if it had been tabled today, to put some comments more firmly on the record.
            </p>
            <p>
             What Senator Birmingham has not recognised in his comments is that the minister announced last night that the Auditor-General is being called in, which I think is an entirely appropriate course of action and should probably have occurred well before now. This issue is vexed and has major commercial players who feel aggrieved, as well as including our national broadcaster in the mix. Rather than further politicising this issue with a select committee to rake over what has occurred, it is appropriate that a senior and neutral official such as the Auditor-General take carriage of the issue, recognising also that the

             is involved in investigating the source of the leaks. With some sympathy for the reasoning behind this select committee motion, the
