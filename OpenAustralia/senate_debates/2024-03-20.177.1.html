        Introduction
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government (the Government) welcomes the Joint Standing Committee on the National Disability Insurance Scheme's (the Committee) final report of its inquiry into the Capability and Culture of the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA, the Agency).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 14 September 2022, the Committee announced it had initiated an inquiry into the capability and culture of the NDIA.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         The Committee
        </a>
        would inquire into the implementation, performance, governance, administration and expenditure of the National Disability Insurance Scheme (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        ), with particular reference to:

       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        notes that the Committee received a total of 206 submissions and held 13 public hearings across the country. The Committee tabled an interim report for this inquiry on 30 March 2023 and its final report on 16 November 2023.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The final report makes 27 recommendations. In addition, the Committee made five recommendations in its interim report. There are a further three recommendations from the Coalition and seven recommendations from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Greens
        </a>
        . This Government response addresses all recommendations made in relation to the inquiry.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Two significant and related processes ran in parallel to this inquiry:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        1. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Commission
        </a>
        into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability (the Disability Royal Commission) published its final report on 29 September 2023. It made 222 recommendations on how to improve laws, policies, structures and practices to ensure a more inclusive and just society that supports the independence of people with disability and their right to live free from violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        2. The Independent Review of the NDIS (the NDIS Review) released its final report on 7 December 2023. It made 26 recommendations, with 139 detailed actions under these recommendations, to help restore trust, ensure the Scheme's sustainability, and deliver a better NDIS experience for participants.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There is considerable overlap and alignment between the Committee's recommendations in its interim and final reports and the recommendations of the Disability Royal Commission and the NDIS Review. The Government response to this inquiry notes where there is alignment between these recommendations, and does not pre-empt the Government's response to the NDIS Review and the Disability Royal Commission.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government acknowledges that the Committee's recommendations in its interim and final reports, along with the recommendations of the Disability Royal Commission and the NDIS Review, are aligned with the Government's focus on rebuilding trust and confidence in the NDIS and getting the Scheme back on track. The Government accepts reform is required to secure the future of the NDIS, so that it can continue to provide life-changing outcomes for current and future generations of Australians with disability. This hard work necessarily starts with lifting the capability and capacity of the NDIA.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government is working openly and transparently, as it takes forward the further work required with the disability community and state and territory governments on the response to the Disability Royal Commission and the NDIS Review.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government has already invested more than $429.5 million through the 2023-24 Budget to lift the NDIA's capability, capacity and systems to better support participants. These investments include better decision-making processes and planner capability for participants with specialised needs, strengthening guidelines for planners on support volumes and intensity, and providing clear minimum standards of evidence for assistance with daily living.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government is committed to transparency and partnership with the disability community in delivering these initiatives.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government has also worked through National Cabinet on an initial response to key aspects of the NDIS Review. On 6 December 2023, National Cabinet agreed to work together to implement legislative and other changes to the NDIS to improve the experience of participants and restore the original intent of the NDIS to support people with permanent and significant disability, within a broader ecosystem of support.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The National Cabinet agreed to jointly design additional Foundational Supports to be jointly commissioned by the Commonwealth and the states, with the work to be oversighted by the First Secretaries Group.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        An initial tranche of legislation will be introduced into the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Parliament" rel="nofollow">
         Commonwealth Parliament
        </a>
        in the first half of 2024, with rule changes phased in as developed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This is a significant step. These commitments demonstrate governments' ongoing commitment to the NDIS. It reinforces support for the NDIS and the social and economic inclusion of people with disability across the nation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Discussions with the disability community will continue over the coming months as we work together to make the positive changes needed for people with disability.

        Recommendations made by the Committee in the Interim Report
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        1. Interim Reportâ€”The Committee recommends that NDIA staff have comprehensive training in disability awareness and anti-discrimination, and that the Government support planners and other NDIA staff, including contact centre staff, develop specialised skills in specific areas of disability and participants' needs, so the Scheme can serve the diversity of NDIS participants.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australian Government response to Interim Report recommendation 1: Noted
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government is committed to improving the training and development for NDIA staff so that the NDIS works for all participants, including those from diverse backgrounds.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There are a number of initiatives underway including mandatory annual training on contemporary disability rights, disability awareness and diversity for all people working at the NDIA, access to a Disability Navigator and Disability Snapshots, a Disability Inclusion Plan, deep dives led by the NDIA's Disability Champion focused on improving accessibility and inclusion, and co-designing a new Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CALD" rel="nofollow">
         CALD
        </a>
        ) strategy and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations
        </a>
        strategy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The NDIA is also transforming the National Contact Centre (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCC" rel="nofollow">
         NCC
        </a>
        ) by redeveloping and expanding the NCC induction training, doubling the amount of training provided to staff, creating and training specialist teams with a new additional advanced skills program, and a skills-based routing model design, which will direct calls to specialised teams based on menu selections.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government's investment in the NDIA's capability, culture and systems will build on these initiatives and allow the NDIA to invest in a workforce capacity and capability package to improve training, tools, and system improvements for planners and partners. It will also improve the consistency, cultural inclusivity, and experience of the planning process for both the frontline workforce and participants.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government notes this recommendation overlaps with Recommendation 22 of the NDIS Review to embed a highly skilled, person-centred, disability aware culture across all disability agencies and governments.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government is considering these issues further in response to the release of the final report of the NDIS Review in late 2023.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        2. Interim Reportâ€”The Committee recommends that the Government lift staffing caps and improve workplace culture to reduce staff turnover and improve the experience of participants through continuity of relationships.

Between 30 June 2023 and 31 December 2023, the number of permanent APS roles has increased by 1,279 (5,328 to 6,607). The number of temporary roles decreased, with APS non-ongoing roles decreasing by 112 (324 to 212) and Labour Hire roles decreasing by 122 (2,004 to 1,882). 292 Labour Hire workers also transitioned to APS employment with the Agency over this period.

         ASL
        </a>
        in financial years' 23-24 and 24-25. The framework sets a clear expectation that most roles and functions in Government Agencies will be delivered by APS employees and outlines the limited circumstances in which external workforces such as labour hire can be engaged.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Agency" rel="nofollow">
         The Agency
        </a>
        is currently developing an implementation plan to support to support role transition and ensure adherence to the framework for new recruitment requests in the Agency.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Agency is making good progress in reducing rates of employee turnover. Over the 12 months to 31 December 2023, the Agency staff turnover rate for ongoing APS employees has decreased from 11.20 per cent to 7.86 per cent; a reduction of 3.34 per cent.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        3. Interim Reportâ€”The Committee recommends that the Government invest in training of staff and updating systems to improve the quality and transparency of decision-making, and to ensure that decisions consistently meet the requirements of the NDIS Act, so participants do not have to tell their stories again and again to multiple people.

        The Government is committed to ensuring the NDIS planning process is simpler and more transparent for NDIS participants. The NDIA's Participants, Platforms and Processes (3P) Project will improve the consistent application of NDIA's processes, and better support participants through a new fit-for-purpose business system called

        The Government notes NDIS access and planning decisions are not made using algorithmic technologies or in an automated manner. The NDIA uses data to assist in the prioritisation of work and to support staff in making decisions by providing benchmarks. This approach is consistent with that used more broadly within an insurance context to enable efficient decision making. It is important to note that a human is still required to review all available information and make a determination.
