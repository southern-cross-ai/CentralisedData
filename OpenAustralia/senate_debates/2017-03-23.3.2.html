         I raise a point of order. I note that there is a proposal to have the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee meet today and 24 March, which is tomorrow. My point of order—and I am not quite sure how to deal with it—is that there has been no legitimate meeting of that committee to determine to meet on 24 March. There was a meeting yesterday. Senator Watt and I both had to leave the meeting. The meeting was then inquorate. The discussion had started about the decision to meet, but it had not concluded. It had not got anywhere near the moving of a motion to meet on the 24th when the committee became inquorate. I did, as I left the meeting, indicate that the committee would be inquorate, so the committee was aware of it. I raise, as a point of order, the fact that this actual request is here for the meeting on the 24th.

             Yes. I have it as a point of clarification. Our advice from the secretariat was that the notice given by Senator Macdonald that the committee was not constituted appropriately was contrary to his view of that, so we proceeded.

               I was also at that meeting. I do note that Senator Pratt has just arrived in the chamber and may wish to make a comment here. The very clear advice given was that a member is unable to call attention to whether or not a committee is quorate after they have left the meeting. It was only when Senator Macdonald was leaving the meeting that he did it over his shoulder on the way out.

                    The committee was clearly inquorate. Senator Watt had left, and I stood and said, 'I'm leaving; you are now inquorate', and then I left the meeting. It was clear to anyone there that the committee was then inquorate. The fact that Senator McKim has a different view of things really does not take the matter any further. The committee was clearly inquorate and if this proceeds it means we get to the stage where, as long as there is a quorum at the beginning of a meeting, everyone can leave and then one person can maintain a committee hearing by himself or herself. If we get down to that, it even further diminishes the standing of Senate committees and the notice that is taken of Senate committees, because they have become an absolute farce. This committee, particularly, keeps demonstrating that it does not matter what the rules are, it will do whatever the Labor and Greens majority want. They set up meetings knowing that no government member will be there. They therefore have these hearings, which are just extensions of the Labor Party and Greens political campaign using Senate money and Senate time and resources to run a political line.

                           I am going to get to the points. Firstly, it is not a matter for the President to determine the affairs of a committee. A committee determines its own affairs. One of the points of concern has been raised by Senator Macdonald. Maybe Senator Macdonald should write to the
                           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_Committee" rel="nofollow">
                            Procedure Committee
                           </a>
                           or write to me in relation to that to have that matter examined. Secondly, committees determine their own agendas and their own issues. It is up to the Senate if it wishes to take issue with the performance and with the outcomes and the deliberations of a committee. But a committee is empowered by this Senate to deliberate and take action.

                               I will deal with it in this way. I take it that there is no objection to all the other committee requests; there is no objection to any of those proposals. Senator Macdonald, I am happy to split the question in relation to the dates for the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee to meet today and 24 March. I gather there is no objection to the meeting today. Therefore, the question is: does the Senate agree to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee meeting tomorrow during the sittings of the Senate if the Senate is sitting?
