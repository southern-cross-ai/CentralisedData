        My question is to the Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Senator Cash. Can the minister inform the Senate of the progress of Operation Sovereign Borders and how it compares with previous policies?

         Senators would be aware that on 18 September the country celebrated 12 months since the implementation of the coalition's Operation Sovereign Borders policy. Since the implementation of the policy, the clear failures of those on the other side have quite literally been laid bare for all to see. Let us cast our minds back to 2007, when there were four people in immigration detention and none of them were children. Jump forward five years, and this country saw in excess of 50,000 people arrive here illegally on in excess of 800 boats. In the 12 months preceding Operation Sovereign Borders, under the former government, there were a total of 401 people-smuggling boat ventures carrying 26,543 people on board. I remind people who are listening in that those people were dumped into the community by those opposite and they did not even commence processing them. They left the Australian taxpayer with a legacy case load of 30,000 people whom they literally dumped in the community.
        </p>
        <p>
         No-one has died at sea since this government implemented turn-backs in December 2013. Compare that to the 1,200 who were confirmed dead at sea under the former government's policies.

         of last year, the Australian people voted overwhelmingly for those on this side to restore integrity to our borders, and that is what we are doing.

          <p>
           Yes, I can. In the first instance, more than 1,600 potential illegal immigrants on 45 ventures have been disrupted before they could travel to Australia. If you remember, under the former government at one stage a boat was arriving every single day. There were so many that the Australian people woke up and literally saw the numbers getting higher and higher and higher on a daily basis. As I said, more than 1,200 people were declared dead under the former government's policies. None have died since we implemented turn-backs in December 2013.
          </p>
          <p>
           The number of children held in detention is down under this government by 40 per cent and the downward trend is continuing. That is why were elected to restore integrity to our borders.

             Under this government, more than $2.5 billion has been saved because we have stopped the flow of illegal boat arrivals to Australia. That compares to the $11 billion budget blow-out over a five-year period under the former government. By mid next year, under this government 10 immigration detention centres will have closed, and we will have saved the Australian taxpayer $88 million for the four closures announced at MYEFO and a further $283 million for the further six closures announced at the 2014-15 budget.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is a government that recognises that it has a duty to the taxpayer to spend their money wisely. In that regard, every one of us on this side is doing their bit to clean up Labor's mess.
