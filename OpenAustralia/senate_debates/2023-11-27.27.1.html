        The cost of living is accelerating across Australia, and we need serious action to directly provide support to people and families, instead of heaping billions on private corporations. Serious action includes funding our public schools. The vast majority of public schools in this country are desperately underfunded. More students are disengaging, and performance is dropping. When the Labor government continues to underfund public schools, it is the parents, families and teachers who are left to pay the difference. Unable to access a fully funded public school—there are only 1.3 per cent of those in the country—more and more people are forced to fork out for entry to a private school. If they do stick with their local public school, they end up covering the cost of funding shortfalls.

        found that, on average, teachers are spending $159 million per year out of their own pockets to pay for classroom supplies. Public schools must be truly free and this starts by immediately fully funding all public schools across the country.
