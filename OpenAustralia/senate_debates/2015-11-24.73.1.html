This was a very important delegation taken by the Australian government to Indonesia last week to promote Australian business and education into the Indonesian market—

                , your home state of Victoria actually brought in $5.6 billion for the financial year 2014-15. In addition to the $18.8 billion contribution to the national economy, there are significant other benefits. For every international student who comes to Australia there are 2.3 visitors who come to Australia on an annual basis. This creates an extra 130,000 jobs into the Australian economy and plays an important role in the government's objectives of seeing international education as a key—

                  Earlier in question time my colleague Senator Sinodinos talked about the work we are doing on free trade agreements. In the Chinese free trade agreement one of the things that became available to Australian international education providers was the opportunity to establish in China, to grow that market. Also, we are having with discussions with India. Minister Robb has already said there will be a significant service offering as part of that free trade agreement that we are negotiating with India. That is something we are also pursuing into that market.

                  We announced last week that we are recommencing our economic partnership arrangements with Indonesia. In Indonesia there is significant demand for education. They have 54 million students in grades K to 12 and there is a huge demand for vocational education and training and that was justified by the people who came in the delegation last week.
