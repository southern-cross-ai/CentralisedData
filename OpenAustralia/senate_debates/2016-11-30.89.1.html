        My question is to Senator Brandis, the Minister representing the Prime Minister. I refer to reports released yesterday by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARC" rel="nofollow">
         ARC
        </a>
        Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies which show that 67 per cent of the corals in the northern section of the Great

         Barrier Reef
        </a>
        have died after the worst coral bleaching episode, earlier this year, that the reef has ever faced. My question is: when will this government accept that coral bleaching en masse is driven by human induced global warming, and when will you stand up for the 70,000 people whose jobs rely on the reef remaining healthy?

         Thank you very much indeed, Senator Waters. It is a very important question you ask, and I acknowledge your deep interest in the issue. We know that the two biggest threats to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrier_Reef" rel="nofollow">
          Barrier Reef

         are climate change and water quality. Reefs around the world have been impacted in recent months by a global coral bleaching event of unprecedented magnitude. The impacts of this event are of deep concern to the Australian government just as they are to the governments responsible for other

         sites impacted by the coral bleaching event.
        </p>
        <p>
         The reef, however, is also showing resilience. The

           study found that the coral cover increased by 19 per cent across the marine park between 2012 and 2015, nearly doubling in the southern sector due to good early recovery from cyclones and floods. For visitors, the recent surveys show that there are still many reefs throughout the marine park that have abundant living coral, particularly in popular tourism locations such as the Whitsundays, Cairns and

           2050 Long-Term Sustainability Plan needs a strong bipartisan approach to achieve the goals we set ourselves. In the plan, the Australian government and the Queensland government have jointly committed to invest a projected $2 billion over the next 10 years, and the Commonwealth government welcomes the cooperation of the Queensland Labor government.

                    <p>
                     Truly, Senator Waters, as I said to you in my response to your initial question, the Australian government accepts that one of the great challenges to the Great
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrier_Reef" rel="nofollow">

                     </a>
                     is climate change. I said that to you. That is the Australian government's position. There are some in the government ranks who have a variety of views about climate change, but the position I have outlined to you is the position of the Prime Minister, it is my position, it is the position of the Minister for the Environment and Energy, and it is the position of the Australian government.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I was in the course of telling you what we are doing about the challenges posed to the

                     by the twin issues of climate change and water quality. In addition to the $136 million I just mentioned in relation to programs specifically directed at water quality, there is another $199 million for future Commonwealth projects to protect the reef.
