        <p>
         I witnessed this cooperation firsthand when I visited Mount Bundey last month with Senator McMahon and US Ambassador Culvahouse to observe Exercise Koolendong. Observing this high-end, live-fire exercise demonstrated once again the great interoperability between our forces and the clear benefit to both our nations. The fact that the rotation went ahead at all despite COVID-19 is a great testament to the ADF's ability to be agile and also to our ability to work with the United States forces. At

             Northern Territory
            </a>
            . As part of this investment, we are spending $1.1 billion to further redevelop

             RAAF Base Tindal

            . These works will enhance defence air combat capability and our ability to engage with allies and partners through the conduct of joint exercises, including our enhanced air cooperation with the United States. The building tempo for the redevelopment is accelerating very rapidly, as we both witnessed. These works are in addition to the new facilities to support the

            , which are now already complete. Just last month I had, with Senator McMahon, the great privilege of turning the first sod for this $1.1 billion additional development. This will develop 350 jobs locally.

               is our nation's security but, wonderfully, it will also provide significant new job opportunities in the Northern Territory for at least the next decade to come. This government has provided industry with significant long-term pipelines of investment. I was up there recently meeting with the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Minister" rel="nofollow">
                Chief Minister
               </a>
               , Senator McMahon and business representatives to work together to ensure we can provide a continuous pipeline supply of jobs and investment in the Northern Territory. Local industry capability plans, which were implemented by Senator Payne, who was the relevant minister at the time, are now realising very significant benefits to local industry in the Northern Territory. The Northern Territory's industry participation in major Defence construction projects is now over 80 per cent and is continuing to rise. Hundreds of local jobs and millions of dollars are now flowing into local businesses and this will continue for many years to come.
