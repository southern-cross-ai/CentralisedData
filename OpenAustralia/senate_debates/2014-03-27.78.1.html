        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Senator Ronaldson. I refer the minister to a recent statement by the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Ferguson" rel="nofollow">
         Martin Ferguson
        </a>
        in Perth:

       <p class="italic">
        … the Maritime Union WA Branch is a rogue union … I think they are not only potentially going to kill jobs for their own members, children and grandchildren in the future the way they've conducted themselves.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I think it's about time the rest of the union movement fronted up to the fact that they are now killing jobs in manufacturing.
       </p>

        Can the minister inform the Senate how the actions of the

         I thank Senator Back very much for his question and I thank him for his ongoing interest in the great state of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         . The Australian oil and gas industry, of course, is one of our economic powerhouses, and the industry's contribution is set to expand rapidly, because more than $200 billion worth of new projects are under construction now and that will generate more than 100,000 jobs. While it is successful already, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNG" rel="nofollow">
          LNG
         </a>
         sector has the potential—and I emphasise 'potential'—for a further $180 billion in investment over the next 20 years, creating up to 150,000 jobs.
        </p>
        <p>
         I say 'potential' because everyone in this chamber knows that competition for global capital is fierce and we must be seen as an attractive destination for investment. We have to be hungry for future jobs and we have to be hungry for future growth. Regrettably, as Senator Back knows, the recent activities of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUA" rel="nofollow">
          MUA
         </a>
         are particularly short-sighted not only for their own members but for the people of Western Australia. Regrettably, they have been aided and abetted by Senator Pratt and her anti-jobs co-conspirator Senator Ludlam, who continue in this place to stop jobs growth in Western Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         I think that Mr Ferguson has belled the cat in relation to this whole issue. What Mr Ferguson has said is that we have to make some changes. The one, of course, who is out on a limb in relation to this matter is Mr Bill Shorten, the opposition leader. Why he will not back a sustainable future for this nation, for the people of Western Australia and for the people he ostensibly represents we simply do not know. We are going to work sensibly and methodically to provide a workplace relations system that encourages investment, growth, productivity and better pay.

             I again thank Senator Back most sincerely for that very important question. Isn't it interesting that you have
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Ferguson" rel="nofollow">
              Martin Ferguson
             </a>
             , a former darling of those opposite, who has made it quite clear that this royal commission must occur to ensure that we get the thugs out of the building industry? It is very interesting, isn't it, that the secretary of the nurses union,
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Olson" rel="nofollow">
              Mark Olson
             </a>
             , has also said that this must go ahead. What we are saying to those opposite is: listen to what these sensible people are saying. Do not sit there and allow this industry to be destroyed by inaction and inactivity. Get in there, support our moves to get the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABCC" rel="nofollow">

             back into work, because all we are seeing at the moment is inactivity of a union based party, and your behaviour, as I have said before, is an absolute disgrace.
