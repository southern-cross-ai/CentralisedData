        It is terrific to be able to continue my remarks about this bill, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telstra_Corporation" rel="nofollow">
         Telstra Corporation
        </a>
        and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2021. I note that the changes proposed in this bill still maintain a significant degree of control over this corporation. I think it is incumbent upon us as the elected officials to consider the longer-term view here about the mass disruption of the technology industry of telecommunications, the role of big-tech organisations, and media disruption. We need to think about whether or not we should be sustaining highly detailed, quite prescriptive arrangements for particular companies that were once monopolies. I think that's a good question for us to consider.
       </p>
       <p>
        The changes proposed in this bill that is before the chamber are an updating and upgrading of the functioning of the governance arrangements of the corporation. I think, given that there's always been a heavy need to have regulation for telecommunications companies, especially to provide universal services into the regions, it is, of course, appropriate that this be updated over time. But, as I say, I think that over the long term we want to make sure that we have an economy that is governed by dynamic rules, that isn't stuck in the past and that isn't looking to put in place arrangements which hold the country back. It's very important that this particular bill pass now, but I suggest that the chamber, the government and the parliament consider further opportunities to upgrade all of our settings in this space.

         I thank those senators who have contributed to the debate on this bill, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telstra_Corporation" rel="nofollow">
          Telstra Corporation
         </a>
         and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2021. I also thank the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee for its report on the bill and its recommendation that the bill be passed. This bill will amend a range of telecommunication legislation to maintain regulatory obligations that protect consumers and promote competition, in response to Telstra's proposed restructure. These obligations cover core parts of Telstra's longstanding regulatory arrangements, including its corporate obligations, put in place at the time of its privatisation. Without legislative amendment, there is a risk that Telstra's obligations would become less effective or cease to apply to its successor entities following this or any future restructure. While there have been significant changes in the telecommunication industry over the past decade, Telstra continues to play a key role nationally both in metropolitan and in regional, rural and remote Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         Telstra's role has long been underpinned by a range of regulated consumer safeguards, including the universal service obligation, which requires Telstra to deliver basic telephone and payphone services in rural and remote areas; the customer service guarantee; the network reliability framework; priority assistance; and the operation of the triple-0 emergency call service. The effect of this bill, if passed, is that obligations which presently apply to Telstra under its current organisational structure will continue to apply following Telstra's restructuring. This, in turn, will be important to achieving the continued protection of consumers, the promotion of competition and the support of Telstra's public interest roles in Australia's telecommunications market. I commend the bill to the Senate.
