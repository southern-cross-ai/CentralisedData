           I think we have tried to work with the Greens to amend this motion, but unsuccessfully. For the record, if the intent of this motion by the Greens party is to express support for the Indian-Australian community, we support that intent. If the intent is to oppose the jailing of Australian citizens for returning home then we support that intent. But this motion goes further than that, and that's why Labor cannot support the motion. The motion would see the Senate override the advice of our medical experts, which is not our role. The only way we can bring home the 40,000 stranded Australians, including those citizens from India, is for

           to finally roll out the vaccine here in Australia and accept his responsibility to safely expand Australia's quarantine capacity so that all Australians can again call Australia home.

              will not be supporting this motion. I feel very offended that they used the words that this is 'a racist travel ban'. It is based on the fact that India is suffering under a pandemic, and no-one will disagree with that. The fact is, decisions have to be made as to what is in the best interests of Australia and how to bring people back into Australia based on a pandemic. Over a period of time here in Australia, we have found that the premiers of states, at the drop of a hat, for one COVID infection, close the borders, which affects businesses and people in their jobs and communities. If we allow people to come into the country from a country that does have the pandemic, we are going to have to deal with that, if we can, and we've seen what's happened in the hotel quarantine accommodation. All I want to say is that to say this is racist is belittling the people of Australia, and I think it's disgusting that you put it that way as it's not based on fact.
