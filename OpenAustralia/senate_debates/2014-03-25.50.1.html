        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Social Services
        </a>
        , Senator Fifield. A large number of community organisations that deliver Commonwealth funded essential services are under service contracts or grants that are due to expire shortly and they have no idea whether these will be renewed. These organisations cover a range of essential community services including homeless services, family relationship services, family violence programs, women's shelters, palliative care, financial and emergency counselling. Many of these organisations have staff positions that are being affected by this funding uncertainty and are losing staff already. Others do not know whether to renegotiate the lease on their premises.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are thousands of organisations that do not know whether their doors will be open in three months time. In WA, homeless shelters have been told not to accept new clients from 31 March. My question is: is the government aware of the effect this uncertainty is having on the continuity and future provision of these services? Is the government going to end this uncertainty before these services close and staff are lost?

         I thank Senator Siewert for her question. I am aware that that there are a number of programs which, in the ordinary course of events, come to a conclusion at the end of this financial year. I do appreciate that this does provide a level of uncertainty for a number of organisations. This is an issue which—you are correct—is across the board through a number of programs in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Services" rel="nofollow">

         portfolio. We are taking a whole-of-portfolio view at working through these programs and grants. We do hope to be in a position in the near future to provide certainty to these organisations.

          I thank the minister for his answer but ask: when is the government going to tell the organisations about their funding? Will it be before these organisations have to close their doors and before they start rejecting clients on 31 March?

           I emphasise again that the I am aware and Minister Andrews is aware of the concerns of these organisations and of the uncertainty they are experiencing at the moment. It is a function of being a new government that comes into an environment where the budget is in deficit and where we do have significant debt that we do want to carefully and methodically work through what are the appropriate arrangements for supporting community organisations. Obviously we recognise the vitally important work that they do. We are working to provide advice in the near future to these organisations.

            I will repeat that question. I thank the minister for the commentary that he gave, but these organisations need certainty. Will the government tell these organisations the future of their funding before the budget so that they do not have to lay off staff? What do the government intend to do if these organisations do close? And what do they intend to do to support those people that will no longer be able to seek those services?

             Senator Siewert, all I can really add is that we are working to provide certainty to these organisations at the earliest possible opportunity.
