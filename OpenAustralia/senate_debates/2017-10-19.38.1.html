           Australia has condemned the violence in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakhine_State" rel="nofollow">
            Rakhine State
           </a>
           . The Minister for Foreign Affairs has called for an end to the violence, for the protection of civilians and for the safe return of those who fled their homes. We co-sponsored the establishment of a fact-finding mission through the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Council" rel="nofollow">
            Human Rights Council
           </a>
           so those responsible for crimes can be held to account. Australia is one of the largest donors to the Rohingya crisis, contributing $20 million since 25 August. We're looking at providing further assistance. We are working with regional partners including through the Bali process. Australia maintains an arms embargo and we do not conduct joint military exercises with Myanmar. Australia stands ready to assist in this process.
