        <p>
         In the four hours since we last spoke about this matter, I have had some interesting information to hand. Clearly the matter that the parliamentary secretary raised in relation to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
          RSL
         </a>
         and their lack of support for schedule 2 was correct. I also have a letter. Honourable senators will remember that basically it is the RSL, Legacy, the Vietnam Veterans Federation and the Defence Force Welfare Association who have expressed concerns about schedule 2. I will read to the chamber the following letter from Tim McCombe, the President of the Vietnam Veterans Federation:
        </p>
        <p>
         I confirm that the VVFA has not seen the complete explanatory memorandum—
        </p>
        <p>
         I received this at 2.42 today—
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Our main concern with schedule 2 is that the amendment wording would give the Repatriation Commission almost complete discretion in offsetting matters. The wording would allow it to determine almost without restriction what constitutes the elements of its decision making. It goes much further than confirming a previous practice. Whilst the wording in the explanatory memorandum may inhibit the abuse of the amendment by the Repatriation Commission, it cannot guarantee that such an abuse will not occur even now or particularly in the future. In the case of such abuse, explanatory memoranda are not consulted in tribunal and court hearings unless there is ambiguity in the wording. There is certainly no ambiguity in the wording of these amendments. Offsetting is a basic feature of our compensation system. It is far too important a process to be largely left to regulation and the goodwill of bureaucracy. We remain strongly opposed to schedule 2 of the bill in its present form.
        </p>
        <p>
         I was then advised that at 5.01 this evening—and I remind honourable senators that we commenced debate on this matter at 10 am this morning—the Vietnam Veterans Federation received for the first time the full explanatory memorandum. What a remarkable abuse of what should be good process. This is an organisation that the parliamentary secretary knows curries no favour for anyone in politics. They play their politics hard and they play fairly. If you are doing something that they do not agree with, they will let you know. They do so without fear or favour, as the minister knows and as I know. This is not some partisan group that has entered this debate. This is a group that historically, as I said, have only acted in the best interests of their members. They are not a party-political organisation. I think they pride themselves on the fact that both sides of politics keep on accusing them of supporting the other side, which is a pretty fair indication that they are doing something right. They were not given—and I hope the Greens are listening to this—the full
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EM" rel="nofollow">
          EM
         </a>
         until 5.01 this evening. I said to the parliamentary secretary that he cannot possibly tell this chamber that that is appropriate. I invite him to do so when I finish.
        </p>
        <p>
         I told the parliamentary secretary this morning that if Legacy, the Vietnam Veterans Federation and the RSL were supportive of the schedule on the back of the amended explanatory memorandum then we would support schedule 2. Well, none of those organisations support this new EM having now had the opportunity to look at it. On that basis, we will not be supporting it. I now invite the Greens and their spokes­person—who apparently ticked off on this amended wording on the basis that she thought it was going to resolve some of the issues—having been told that these organisations do not support this new EM, or that it does not allay their fears, to vote against it. For the Greens to do otherwise indicates that this has been a political decision and not a policy decision. How else can it be interpreted? Their spokesperson herself said this morning that she supported this new EM on the basis that it would allay the fears of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESO" rel="nofollow">
          ESO
         </a>
         s. Well, it does not. So on that basis they cannot possibly support it. Therefore, I invite them again to support us in relation to the schedule. None of these groups support this amended explanatory memorandum. They still have the same concerns. The Defence Force Welfare Association does not support schedule 2, even with the amended EM. The RSL does not support schedule 2, even with the amended EM. The Vietnam Veterans Federation does not support schedule 2, even with the amended explanatory memorandum. Surely this chamber is not going to proceed with approval of schedule 2 while those organisations are still concerned about it.
        </p>
        <p>
         I will give you some of the evidence that came through in the inquiry by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee into the Veterans Entitlements Amendment Bill 2011. In his evidence at the public hearing on Thursday, 11 August, Rear Admiral Ken Doolan said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I think the current arrangements give the answer. The current arrangements are the ones with which the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Returned_and_Services_League" rel="nofollow">
          Returned and Services League
         </a>
         is comfortable. We have lived with those and explained them to our members. That is why we do not see the need for schedule 2.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Fawcett then asked:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         With the increasing number of people deployed in operational service at the moment, obviously there is potential for an increasing number of people to require compensation. Is it your opinion that these changes to the legislation could disadvantage any currently serving members in years ahead?
        </p>
        <p>
         To which Rear Admiral Doolan answered:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         That is what we have said.
        </p>
        <p>
         I say to the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence and to the Greens spokesperson: if you vote against my amendment to remove schedule 2 you are effectively telling this chamber that you know more about this matter and have better judgement than have the RSL, the Defence Force Welfare Association and the Vietnam Veterans Federation. That is effectively what you are saying. You are saying that they do not know what they are talking about and that you are going to override their wishes on this matter.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is worse for the Greens, the government's partners in crime. They have signed up to an amended explanatory memorandum which they say was going to resolve the issues of the ex-service organisations. Guess what? It does not. So how can you possibly provide the government with succour in relation to the schedule 2 vote? It would be an act of gross hypocrisy, were the Greens to support the government in relation to the schedule. As others have said, the government indicates on page 327 of Budget Paper No. 2:
        </p>

         </i>
         (VEA), at a cost of $2.7 million over four years.

         </a>
         will also improve the administration of offsetting cases through case manager training and enhanced systems support.
        </p>
        <p>
         During the public hearing, Senator Fawcett asked the department to explain their statement versus their claim and the minister's claim that the amendments affect no-one and will have no cost. It is either one of the other. If, indeed the RSL, the Vietnam Veterans Federation and the Defence Force Welfare Association are right, and there will be potential impact, you cannot proceed with schedule 2.
        </p>
        <p>
         As the parliamentary secretary knows, the amended explanatory memorandum does not have the force of the act. The act will be interpreted on the back of the plain language in the act. The EM will not in any way supersede that. The parliamentary secretary knows that as well as I do. That is the concern of the Vietnam Veterans Federation and the RSL. They know that full well, the parliamentary secretary knows that and the Greens spokesperson should know that. Get your systems in place. We support your systems, but do not, please, treat the ESOs with such contempt, when they have quite clearly indicated to you that, despite this amended EM, they are still extremely uncomfortable with this schedule. The parliamentary secretary and minister know that we do not need this schedule at this time. By the department's own words, there is not a current issue. If there is not a current issue, is this not about getting the processes right rather than changing the law, potentially to the detriment of serving men and women and ex-service men and women? When you have been alerted to the issues that the ESOs have got and you know full well that there is no urgency at all in relation to this matter, when you know full well that you are in the process of having further discussions with the department, which I presume will include the $2.7 million
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT" rel="nofollow">
          IT
         </a>
         expenditure to 'improve the administration of offsetting cases through case manager training and enhanced systems support,' do that. And if you need to come back to this place for some legislative imprimatur in relation to what you find, let us talk about it then. Let us have a talk at that stage. Let us have the ESOs in a position to make some judgments about what you may or may not have found through the system and what the legislative requirements are, because no-one believes that this is required at this time. They say there will be an impact. You say there will not be. If your case is that there will not be, we do not need this schedule at this time. Get your systems in place, come back here and we will see whether this requires legislative change. As all these ESOs have said, they are not prepared to compromise a piece of legislation which they say is working at the moment for regulation which they say will not.

          Further to Senator Ronaldson's comments in relation to these amendments, I just want to deconstruct what the government is trying to do here. I am genuinely trying to understand what the effect will be in practical terms. Senator Feeney on behalf of the government has said that these amendments result in no change, that they will clarify and affirm the current position but not change it, or words to that effect. Of course, I will stand corrected if I have misrepresented the government's position in any way. The addendum to the explanatory memorandum states:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          The proposed amendments will not change the current operation of the compensation offsetting provisions. The changes are intended to clarify the operation of the legislation following the Smith decision and ensure that the established compensation offsetting practices can continue.
         </p>
         <p>
          The decision of Commonwealth v David Ronald Smith was an interpretation of section 30C of the VEA in respect of incapacity from injury. I think Senator Ronaldson and others have fairly set out the circumstances of the Smith decision. We know that the court found in favour of the respondent,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Smith" rel="nofollow">
           Mr Smith
          </a>
          .
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Senate" rel="nofollow">
           The Senate
          </a>
          committee report on this, which I thought was a very fair summary, states that the court:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          … formed the view that the Commonwealth’s submissions failed ‘to give sufficient weight to the complete operation of section 30C, in particular the reference to ‘incapacity from that injury' as found in section 30C(1)(c)' … The court decided that in Mr Smith's case, it had not been appropriate to offset 'because the condition for which he was granted disability pension was a different condition from that compensated at common law'.
         </p>
         <p>
          The report further states:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          The government was of the view that this decision of the Full Federal Court underlined the need to clarify this aspect of the legislation. In its Portfolio Budget Statements for 2011–12, the government indicated that … it intended to amend the offsetting provisions in the VEA. In its submission, the department explained further:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          It is considered that the decision of the Full Federal Court that offsetting should not have occurred applies only to the unique circumstances of Mr Smith's case. These included that, with the agreement of the Commonwealth, the common law claim for compensation was expressly changed to remove the two conditions that were being compensated under the VEA.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Nevertheless, the Government decided to amend the offsetting provisions of the VEA to ensure that the legislation is clear in its intent.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          It stated further that if passed the amendments 'should avoid the likelihood that, on the basis of the Smith case, those seeking future compen­sation payments could circumvent the offsetting provisions by exclusion of specific injuries or diseases from the terms of the compensation settlements'.
         </p>
         <p>
          So there are a few aspects of that in relation to this very first paragraph of the addendum to the explanatory memorandum. Firstly, is it anticipated that there will be changes, if not to the current operation of the compensation offsetting provisions in a direct and strictly technical sense then in the way that compensation settlements are drawn up, given what the government is seeking to do with the amendment to schedule 2 of the act? In other words, it has been anticipated, has it not, to directly quote from the department, that, 'those seeking future compensation payments could circumvent the offsetting provisions by exclusion of specific injuries or diseases from the terms of the compensation settlements'? Is that what the amendment will do in the context of how schedule 2 will operate? Given what the department has said, won't that in some way change the current operation of the compensation offsetting provisions, if not in a strictly technical sense then in a practical sense?

            I thank Senator Feeney. If it will not change the way the compensation settlements are drawn up, why is it that, in its submission, the department stated that if these amendments are passed it 'should avoid the likelihood that, on the basis of the Smith case, those seeking future compensation payments could circumvent the offsetting provisions by exclusion of specific injuries or diseases from the terms of the compensation settlements'? Does that not mean that, by virtue of these amendments, it will have an impact on the way the compensation settlements are being drawn up, because it is making it clear that certain forms of compensation settlements will no longer be acceptable by virtue of the passage of schedule 2? That is a direct question. The purpose of my questioning is not to criticise the government in terms of the policy intent or what the department has said, but it does seem to be somewhat at odds to the government's addendum to the explanatory memorandum and what the department itself has said in relation to this particular issue.

             I am advised that the longstanding practice is that compensation is offset for the same incapacity. What gives rise to the same incapacity is a medical question. The Smith decision, although unique, casts some doubt on this operation, and if different injuries give rise to the same incapacity—that is, the same effect of that condition—the basis on which the veteran is compensated may not be offset. As a result it was felt that the legislation needed clarifying.

              The addendum to the explanatory memorandum states:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              The changes are intended to clarify the operation of the legislation following the Smith decision and ensure that the established compensation offsetting practices can continue.
             </p>
             <p>
              They are the established offsetting practices, but earlier on the addendum to the explanatory memorandum says:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              The proposed amendments will not change the current operation of the compensation offsetting provisions.
             </p>
             <p>
              The department in its own submission has said that it should avoid the likelihood that those seeking future compensation payments could circumvent the offsetting provisions by exclusion of specific injuries or diseases from the terms of the compensation settlements. Does that not mean, therefore, that what the addendum to the explanatory memorandum is saying is at odds with what the department is saying? These are two unequivocal statements—we have the first paragraph of the addendum to the explana­tory memorandum and we have the statement of the department in its submission, submission 2, at page 6.
             </p>
             <p>
              Clearly the department is anticipating that it will not allow people to circumvent the offsetting provisions by exclusion of specific injuries or diseases from the terms of the compensation settlements. Therefore, is it not the case that it is not accurate for the addendum to the explanatory memorandum to state that the proposed amendments will not change the current operation of the compensation offsetting provisions? The terms of compensation settlement agree­ments must be part of the current operation of the compensation offsetting provisions.

              am missing something or the parliamentary secretary thinks I am being a dodo on this he should tell me—I will not take offence. It seems to me there are two contradictory statements. I do not know whether the shadow minister has a particular view on this, but I would have thought that there seems to be a contradiction between what the department is saying and what the addendum to the explanatory memorandum is saying.

               I am advised that there may be some confusion on Senator Xenophon's part over incapacity questions and compensation questions. The government maintains that the two statements he has identified are not incompatible. The first asserts that longstanding custom and practice in this area is being preserved and clarified by the amendments in this bill, and it is because offsetting has always been based on the same incapacity that we are trying to ensure the interpretation of provisions does not change over time.

                It seems I have been confused all along. It is already in my disclosure of interests, but I have been a lawyer for a few years and I did virtually nothing but injury law. I am not saying I am familiar with this area of law, but the government has said that there is some confusion on my part because I have confused the issue of incapacity and the issue of compensation. Guess what? If you have a bigger incapacity, you get more compensation. That is how it generally goes. So it might not be the case that incapacity and compensation are distinct issues. Usually the level of incapacity, depending on how it is assessed, is tied to the level of compensation. Does the government concede that there is a nexus between the level of incapacity and the level of compensation the recipient could receive?

                 Yes, it does. As I said a moment ago, albeit not particularly eloquently, the government maintains that the two comments identified are complementary to one another. The Smith case pointed to a possible way to circumvent these provisions, and we are preventing that. In that way these amendments are preserving custom and practice.

                  I just want to get a concession from the government that there is a distinction between what the department has said and what the addendum to the explanatory memorandum says. The parliamentary secretary, always eloquent, has stated that the government wants clarity as a result of the Smith case, even though it refers to that case as being 'a unique set of circumstances'. The practical effect of the so-called clarity that the government is seeking as a result of the Smith case is to deal with those who would circumvent, according to the depart­ment, the offsetting provisions by exclusion of specific injuries or diseases from the terms of compensation settlements. The addendum to the explanatory memorandum, though, says:
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  The proposed amendments will not change the current operation of the compensation offsetting provisions.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Surely, if you have a situation where the department is saying, 'We need to get some clarity on this,' as the parliamentary secretary has rightly pointed out, as a result of the Smith decision, that will have practical consequences. There will be circumstances where, as a result of that so-called clarity, settlement negotiations or settlements that have been reached will be affected, because they now will be excluded as a result of schedule 2.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  That seems to me to be inconsistent with the statement by the government that the amendments 'will not change the current operation of the compensation offsetting provisions'. They will do so. To say that they will not is inconsistent with what the department has said about this. The government could call it 'complementary', but does it concede that there are circum­stances where settlement arrangements that may be allowed now under the current legislative scheme will not be allowed pursuant to what is proposed in schedule 2, because there will not be an opportunity to circumvent the offsetting provisions by exclusion of specific injuries or diseases from the terms of compensation settlement? I just want to get a concession that that is the case. It is consistent with what the department says but it seems to be inconsistent with the addendum to the explanatory memorandum.

                   I am advised that I cannot give you the concession that you are seeking, Senator. The level of incapacity does go, obviously, to the level of compensation. The nature of the incapacity is, therefore, a basis of compensation. But the Smith decision talked about 'injury' not 'incapacity', thus giving rise to the potential to circumvent the settlement. So the government does not concede the point.

                    The parliamentary secretary has acknowledged what the department has said—that there is an issue about circumvention of the offsetting provisions by excluding specific injuries. The parliamentary secretary has drawn a distinction between incapacity and injuries, but I think that we know that, generally, the more incapacitated you are, for whatever reason or from whatever injuries, the more compensation you get. The department made this statement in their submission to the Senate inquiry:
                   </p>
                   <p class="italic">
                    … the amendments should avoid the likelihood that, on the basis of the Smith case, those seeking future compensation payments could circumvent the offsetting provisions by exclusion of specific injuries or diseases from the terms of the compensation settlements.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    In an operational sense—in a practical sense—does the parliamentary secretary agree with that statement? If he does agree with that statement—and this may give him some comfort—I think most people would say that, on a plain English interpretation, that is inconsistent with the addendum to the explanatory memorandum, even if the parliamentary secretary does not say it. So I would be happy now for the parliamentary secretary to acknowledge that what the department has said is an accurate reflection of the government's position.

                     Tragically, Senator, this is not about what I think. I am obviously here representing a government position. I am advised that the department does stand by its submission to the committee. On that basis, the document from which you are reading is something that the government maintains is a contemporary document.

                    <p>
                     With respect to the rest of your question, I am advised that the provisions are about ensuring people get the same amount of compensation whether compensated under more than one scheme or only one scheme—so there is no advantage to being compensated under more than one scheme.

                           No, that is certainly my word, Senator; I concede that—between the department's work and the wording of the
                           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EM" rel="nofollow">

                           . To address myself to that point: the government maintains that the department's position to the committee is not at odds with the EM. In fact, we continue to maintain that they are complementary. The amendments to the legislation to maintain current arrangements are to ensure that the Smith decision—that is, the decision of the full bench of the Federal Court—is not used to circumvent the current provisions by excluding some injuries or diseases where the incapacity is the same under more than one compensation source.

                           What the department says regarding circumventing the offsetting provisions and whether that contradicts chapter 19 of the

                           , mentioned in the EM, we say that the offsetting provisions are completely separate from chapter 19 of the guide. Chapter 19 is the guide that determines the rate of pension for a veteran. The government included reference to chapter 19 in the explanatory memorandum to alleviate the
                           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">

                           </a>
                           's concerns that there may be an overlap and to ensure that these will remain separate processes in line with current practice.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           This has no relationship to the terms of a common law settlement that might be used. This is used where possible to separately identify the relative contribution of each condition to an incapacity and then assess the appropriate rate of compensation. This is based on medical advice. However, it is not always possible for medical practitioners to assess the relative contributions of different conditions, particularly where the symptoms of the conditions substantially overlap. Where it is not possible to apportion the impairment from a non-accepted condition from the incapacity assessment, the offsetting provisions are used. Chapter 19 is never used together with offsetting; it is one or the other.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           An example of how the Smith decision might impact current arrangements is this. As you have noted, Senator, the decision was concerned with different injuries or diseases even where the incapacity is the same. These amendments ensure that no matter how the injury or disease is described, if the incapacity is the same, compensation offsetting will continue to apply to ensure that a person cannot be compensated twice. These amendments clarify the longstanding current position. They ensure that someone who simply labels two conditions differently is not compensated twice when the incapacity is clearly the same—for example, a back sprain and lumbar spondylosis.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           Offsetting is about fairness. It ensures that individuals get the same amount of compensation whether or not they get compensation from only one source or from more than one source. I hope that assists the senator.

                              Synergy; that is right. If someone has a back sprain and/or a spondylosis can the parliamentary secretary explain whether there will be doubling up, because I see them as quite distinct conditions? One is a pre-existing condition but it means that you are more vulnerable to the effects of an injury in the event that you have a back strain than someone who does not have that pre-existing condition. The way that workers compensation, or indeed common law, has worked for many years across a range of jurisdictions is that effectively you take your victims as you find them. If somebody, as a result of having a pre-existing condition, is more vulnerable to a greater level of incapacity than someone who did not have that pre-existing condition in similar circumstances of trauma then that clearly would be relevant. I would appreciate it if the parliamentary secretary could indicate what he meant by the reference to spondylosis and back strain.

                               Really the point I was seeking to make is that a person cannot be compensated twice for the same incapacity. An individual will get the same amount of compensation for an injury regardless of whether they get that compensation from only one source or from more than one source. In that sense, these amendments clarify what has been a longstanding practice.

                                But there is a difference, though, because from a compensation point of view, if someone has a back sprain without having a pre-existing condition, that is quite different from someone who has a back sprain with a pre-existing condition of spondylosis because a person who has a back strain with spondylosis would have a more significant incapacity by virtue of that pre-existing condition. There could be circum­stances where a person who sustains a back strain in the absence of a pre-existing condition such as spondylosis is able to continue to work, might have a bit of pain and is suffering a bit of discomfort but has no incapacity; whereas, if that person has a pre-existing condition such as spondylosis, the potential for incapacity, the potential for that person not to be able to work, the potential for that person to have a long-term ongoing disability that would otherwise have been quiescent but for the strain by virtue of that person's spondylosis is quite different. So I am not sure how that would work in the context of the practical application of schedule 2. I am not sure if Senator Ronaldson, representing the coalition as the shadow minister on this legislation, would have similar concerns. I do not know whether spondylosis and back strain is the most elegant example or the most useful example, but maybe I am wrong.

                                 Perhaps it is not an elegant example for someone so familiar with back pain. The point I am making here, Senator, is that a person should not and will not be rewarded for labelling the same injury differently. To borrow your phraseology in terms of double dipping, it depends on medical advice as to whether the incapacity is the same. It is something that will be determined by the compensation regime and it will be determined by that regime in the longstanding way that it has always been so determined.

                                  Parliamentary Secretary, I presume you would acknowledge that the department has viewed the differing interpretations of the Smith decision with some concern. Are you aware that the department noted the significance of the findings in the 2009-10 annual report by observing that there remain different views on the extent and application of the Smith decision? Is this legislation relating to the nature and extent of the application of the Smith decision, or is it a lack of clarity that you are effectively talking about in this schedule?

                                      The secretary of the department does not view this as relating both to the nature and extent of the application of the decision and to clarity. In fact, the secretary says it is clarity only; it is not about the nature and extent of the application of the decision. I will read from the Senate Hansard on 31 May of this year. This is a my question to Mr Campbell:
                                     </p>
                                     <p>
                                      When you say work continues on clarifying the operation of the law, what do you actually mean by that? Is that in relation to the nature and extent of the application of the decision, or is it lack of clarity that you are talking about?
                                     </p>
                                     <p>
                                      Mr Campbell : It is the issue of the clarity of the intent of the legislative provision.
                                     </p>
                                     <p>
                                      You are now telling the chamber, on behalf of the department, that it is in relation both to the nature and extent of the application of the decision and to clarity, but in Senate estimates the secretary himself said that it was not a nature and extent issue; it was a clarity only issue.

                                        I have just been reminded that the department—and I stand to be corrected on this—actually said that the Smith decision was a one-off decision. I presume that then makes sense, because if it were only a one-off decision then that would lead the department to say that there will be no impact following on from this legislation. I do not want to spend all night on this—that is not entirely true. I would be happy to do so because it is a matter of great seriousness. I am very anxious to see schedules 1 and 3 go through but I do not want to continue this debate longer than need be. The concern of the

Parliamentary Secretary, do you at least acknowledge that is the nature of the concern of the ESOs, that that is what is driving it?

                                            s—the minister, the department, staff and everyone else—because they were not consulted. As we discussed some hours ago, they were not advised of this addendum to the explanatory memorandum. In fact, one of them got it at five o'clock tonight.

                                            I want to take up your point on the clarity issue—having been told that it was actually the nature, the extent and the clarity; but you acknowledge that Mr Campbell said it was only a clarity issue. Parliamentary Secretary, are you aware of this comment from Rear Admiral Doolan: 'What we are saying is that we seek clarity, and we see schedule 2 as bringing a degree of lack of clarity. As I said in my opening remarks, we see the current status as allowing for offsetting and being reasonable and we have no difficulty with the current arrangements'?

                                            I think the matters that Senator Xenophon raised today indicate that either this is a sledgehammer to crack a nut or this is not required at all, or this is a deliberate attempt to transfer responsibility for policy and decision making in relation to this matter away from the parliament to the department. In relation to that, Parliamentary Secretary, I need go no further than the addendum to the explanatory memorandum, which makes it clear that the Repatriation Commission will be issuing appropriate policy guidance to staff of the
                                            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Veterans'_Affairs" rel="nofollow">

                                            . Indeed, that is the issue the ESOs have—that you have transferred the policy decision-making process from this place to the department. There is established offsetting legislation and practice, and effectively what you are doing is transferring that out of here to the department. Senator Xenophon, this is probably coming to a close and there will be a division shortly.

                                            The Vietnam Veterans Federation have said that even if guidelines are drawn up by the Repatriation Commission they should be spelt out in the legislation and that the Repatriation Commission guidelines are simply too ephemeral. Do you agree with those comments or not?

I want to put on the record Senator Wright's role in this. It is fair to say that her role has been quite useful in providing some clarity to the situation. Senator Wright undertook a conciliatory role in this to try and get a better outcome—and this is not a criticism of Senator Wright; on the contrary, it is an expression of gratitude for the work that she has done on this. If Senator Wright's role had been allowed to continue to bring in the

In fact, if that process had continued it might have brought some real benefit. Schedule 2 has some work to do. I think that is clear from the language of the department in its submission to the Senate inquiry, and I have referred to that repeatedly. My question to the parliamentary secretary, which I hope—and I think the parliamentary secretary hopes—will be my last question to him, unless he wants more, is this : will there be any monitoring of the practical effects of schedule 2 in terms of claims that are being dealt with differently, claims that are being rejected, fewer payments made, and what I think are shorthand ways of the government's concerns about so-called double dipping, although, depending on the circumstances, there may be a dispute as to whether in fact there is double dipping? What reassurance can the parliamentary secretary give that the implementation of schedule 2 is being monitored and reported, apart from, say, the estimates process, where of course we have the opportunity three times a year to scrutinise this? Is there any other mechanism or assurance that the government can provide, other than questions on notice, the estimates process and questions without notice, about how it works?

                                                   I guess the short answer is yes. But your question in some ways is 'How long is a piece of string?' The point and, I guess, the reality is that the department and I understand—and I am about to make commitments on behalf of my colleagues and I am sure they will take an interest in what I am signing them up for—that in this particular policy space the relationship, in my view, between the department, the minister and the

The simple fact of it is that if schedule 2 does create anything like the concerns you are describing then, yes, the minister and the department would respond. I do not know whether that would require a new consultative structure. I wonder if those that exist might be up to the task of managing such a conversation, but certainly the government would continue to have a responsive approach to its stakeholders.

                                                    Parliamentary Secretary, on that basis why would you not wait until policy guidance work had been done by Repat and then the department and why wouldn't you wait until you had had the consultation with the ex-service organisations during the development of the material and then have the schedule? Is that not the logical step? You are going to put the cart before the horse by having the schedule and then trying to address it later on. You have acknowledged that there is no urgency for this and that the process is going to be addressed by the $2.7 million. I ask this question: would you give the ex-service organisations an undertaking that if, as it says here, 'ex-service organisations will be consulted during the development of this material'—that is the appropriate policy guidance—and they are opposed to that material it will not become policy under this addendum to the explanatory memorandum?

This addition to the bill would give veterans of British nuclear tests the ability to claim for a gold card for health costs. Earlier today I referred to the need to do so, and I do not propose to unnecessarily restate that. I referred to Canon Peter Patterson, who contacted me after his application for the gold card and disability pension were denied. He was commissioned by the Australian military forces to serve at Maralinga,

Mr Patterson's claims have been fraught with difficulty, because the current rules are unfair. A delegate of the Repatriation Commission was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the cirrhotic arthropathy was related to his service. We know from the medical evidence that those who have been exposed to British nuclear tests have suffered greatly. The rates of death and disability have been significant.

                                                         I am particularly grateful to Senator Macdonald's contribution on this. He quite rightly pointed out what is being done for the children of the veterans of British nuclear tests who have been born with disabilities and significant health issues. I commend Senator Macdonald for raising that, because it is an issue that cannot be ignored. I do not believe it has been dealt with adequately by Australian governments, both past and present.

                                                         This amendment is one that deals with the gold card being given to the veterans of British nuclear tests. These men and women went to Maralinga, to Emu Fields and to Montebello and were subjected to nuclear testing without anyone telling them what the health implications would be. They have suffered, much like any veteran who has been injured in war and they should be able to access all the health services they need to treat their cancers, their skin conditions and their depression. I believe this is the right thing to do.

I do acknowledge the work that Senator Ludlam has done on this previously and the concerns that have been expressed in relation to this. But we have really dropped the ball when it comes to our veterans of British nuclear tests. There are fewer than 2,000 alive right now. They are dying off at too rapid a rate. We know that successive Australian governments have done very little to help them. We know from a media release from the law firm Stacks/Goudkamp on 29 July 2011 that Australian veterans of British nuclear tests hopes for compensation have been boosted by a

Even if veterans are successful Stacks/Goudkamp made the point that if the Supreme Court allows them to go ahead they will still have to argue their negligence case against a determined UK Ministry of Defence. Why do they have to do that? Why do they have to go down the path of seeking redress in the British court system? Why can't we do what other nations have done and provide a statutory system of compensation? The Americans, Russians and Chinese have done it for their nuclear test veterans, but here in Australia it seems we have to go cap in hand to the UK courts for an uncertain outcome and expensive, time-consuming and uncertain system of seeking justice.

                                                         Senator Macdonald has quite usefully asked me whether a costing has been done on this. We know this, and I think it is a very reasonable question. The coalition, as did the government, unfortunately opposed even a second reading amendment that would say 'let's do some costings on this.' I urge the coalition and the government to reconsider that. It is important that there be appropriate costing of that. But I still move this amendment, because I believe the principle is fundamentally right, because here we have a limited pool of people—fewer than 2,000—and what we are seeking to give them is not a pension as such but access to the gold card for health benefits, so that they do not have to go through a burden of proof in showing that they are eligible.

                                                         This is an absolute disgrace. All the other illnesses that's brought on by exposure to radiation, we don't get treated for and that in itself is justice denied. So the real thing is the recognition, full recognition, under the Veteran Entitlements Act, but they won't recognise Maralinga as being a dangerous zone that we served in.

That's another three to five years. In that time another 10 percent of the veterans are dead. Well, given another five years, there won't be any of us left, quite frankly.

                                                         This is not a radical move. This is not an expensive move. We are looking at a very small and diminishing class of people, yet we have treated them with contempt. Subsequent Australian governments have treated these people with contempt. They have served their nation. They served it in a very dangerous zone where nuclear tests were carried out, and that is why this requested amendment seeks to redress that, in part by giving them access to the gold card. It is extraordinary that the government and the opposition do not support the costing of this. They were worried about setting some precedent or about what other implications it would have. But these people deserve justice. Giving them access to the Gold Card will go some way to remedying the gross injustice that Mr Patterson and many, many others have been subjected to over the years. That is why I commend this amendment.

I think it is a sensible amendment to say there ought to be some costing but that in any event there ought to be a cut-off for when this particular measure is implemented. It cannot be put off to the never-never. This government and the opposition stand condemned for the way they have treated our veterans of British nuclear test. This issue will not go away. Even when the last nuclear test veteran in Australia has died, you will still have to deal with their children, you will still have to deal with their memories and you will still have to deal with the fact that they have been treated very shabbily by successive Australian governments.

                                                          to veterans of British nuclear testing, as a matter of right, it would not be responsible to agree to a measure that at this stage would have open-ended cost implications that have not been budgeted for. Since receiving Senator Xenophon's requested amendment, I have not had the opportunity to determine the costs involved if it were to be implemented. Today I received verbal advice from the minister's representative that the costs could be as great as $100 million. That does seem exorbitant to me, given the relatively small number of veterans involved, but it serves to highlight the need for better information about the costs before legislating for this change.

                                                          That is why I was happy to co-sponsor the second reading amendment that Senator Xenophon has referred to, to have the government examine the cost of expanding eligibility for the Gold Card to nuclear veterans within a certain time period. Unfortunately, that amendment was not agreed to. However, this amendment that I have now moved is an opportunity to determine the costs involved, to have scrutiny and then to determine whether or not it would be possible to implement this longstanding issue of justice for the veterans of the nuclear testing carried out by Britain.

                                                          This amendment would mean that Senator Xenophon's amendment could take effect if the measure has been costed and is enshrined in regulation that has not been disallowed by either house. That would ensure that the costings have been carried out, that there is an opportunity for scrutiny by the other place and the Senate and that there is a means of paying for the implementation of the reform. In my view, that is what is required to be fiscally responsible and I urge the Senate to support this amendment and then consider Senator Xenophon's requested amendment in the light of this amendment.

The automatic grant of a Gold Card is only provided to veterans with qualifying service—that is, warlike service—over the age of 70, in recognition of the hazards of being in war and incurring danger from the hostile forces of the enemy. The automatic grant of the Gold Card to BNT participants would place them in a more beneficial position than other veterans. For that and other reasons, the government opposes the amendment.

These veterans are not eligible for a gold card because their service does not qualify as warlike; it was not in a hostile environment. The fact is that they were subject to radiation from nuclear weapons. They were subject without a duty of care being given by the Australian government at the time. They were subject to levels of radiation that have led to many of them developing cancers and dying, levels of radiation that have left many of them with very serious health problems and levels of radiation that have left their children and grandchildren with genetic abnormalities, with deformities, with serious health problems. So to make some artificial distinction that these individuals were not subject to warlike service does not make sense to me. If being subject radiation, to fallout from a nuclear bomb going off, is not warlike in the hazards it exposes our veterans to then what else would be? It just seems extraordinary that this is an exemption. I would urge the backbenchers of the coalition and the government to raise this issue in their party rooms to ensure that this matter is dealt with in a way that gives justice to these veterans.

But it seems to me that the issue here is that the government is making excuses as to why it cannot act, and Senator Wright quite rightly expressed surprise at a figure of $100 million. As that is the figure that was given by the minister's office, can the government provide a breakdown of that $100 million? On that calculation, if there are 2,000 individuals who are still alive from the British nuclear tests and all of them put in a claim for medical expenses—I am sure Senator Feeney will correct me if my arithmetic is wrong—you are looking at a figure in the region of $50,000 each. Is that right, Senator Feeney? I am not sure. Tell me. Your arithmetic is probably better than mine.

If they are going to make an assertion that it is up to $110 million, for goodness sake the government ought to provide the details of that. Where does this figure of up to $110 million come from in order to try to squash this particular amendment or to be dismissive of it? I can tell you those veterans of the British nuclear tests deserve better than some glib figure seemingly plucked out of the air in order to get a fair deal and a fair go with respect to their health care.

I have just been advised that the number is based on the notion that $15,600 per person per year over four years for a total of 2,000 persons would add up to a cost of $100 million.
                                                                         </p>

They can get the gold card if their illness results in the disability pension of 100 per cent or more. Widows of course receive a pension and a gold card where the participant's death is related to service. Noting those existing entitlements, I hope that provides a little bit of illumination about where that $100 million number might have come from.

As for the notion of $15,600 a year for four years for 2,000 participants, there is no such notion here. Guess what? These people are dying off. In four years time there will not be 2,000 veterans who survived the British nuclear tests here in Australia. Who knows what the number will be, but we know that the rate of death, the rate of these people not being with us on this earth anymore, is increasing. This is simply to say that, in the same way that others who have served in warlike service get a gold card, this is warlike service and this is something they should be entitled to. This issue will not go away. I will pursue it in estimates. I will pursue it with the government. I urge my colleagues in the coalition and the government, particularly my backbench colleagues—including Senators Sterle and Bishop, for whom I have high regard—to take this matter up.

It is interesting to note that radiation is classified into two types: initial radiation, which is released by the atomic bomb within one minute of detonation, and residual radiation, which is released after the initial radiation. Those who were exposed to radiation suffered long after the war was over. It took people a long time to recognise the invisible effects of the A-bomb, of the diseases caused by the A-bomb. A group of symptoms which appeared during the first four or five months after the explosion were called acute sickness or injuries, and symptoms that appeared after a certain incubation period were called after-effects of radiation. That is what we are dealing with. That is why this matter needs to be dealt with with some urgency. I urge my backbench colleagues, of both the government and the opposition, to reconsider their position in relation to the gold card. This will not be the end of it if this amendment is defeated, as it appears that it will be. We need to deal with this. These vague rubbery figures of up to $110 million—the government really stands condemned for the way it has sidelined these concerns.

I am unsure whether the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence is aware that I do not necessarily support those figures for precisely the reason that Senator Xenophon has put on the record. Do you feel comfortable, Parliamentary Secretary, acknowledging $100 million in unmet need for a particular class of veterans who we appear to be simply sidelining on a technicality? As you said in your statement, from the information you have been given by your advisers, cancer treatment is covered, but you would be well aware that ionising radiation of the kind that was inflicted on these soldiers and the many Aboriginal people who were still on those lands can create a large number of conditions that are not cancer related at all. That is precisely where this huge level of unmet need resides. I strongly support Senator Xenophon for moving this amendment. If you do not trust the figures that you have given us, Senator Wright has given you a perfect opportunity to look at how much it will cost. I cannot believe that we would simply sideline on a technicality this cohort of people who, in the service of our country, were irradiated by British nuclear weapons. I strongly urge a rethink on, if nothing else, Senator Wright's perfectly sensible amendment that says: let us establish how much it will cost. Please, let us not just erase these people from history after what we put them through.

It is the same as a soldier who loses a limb. They are given a gold card because you can see their injury. It is no different for veterans who were injured by the nuclear tests; you just cannot see their injury, it is not so apparent. The effects are dormant, but they are there nonetheless. Given that these people have been exposed to the fallout from a nuclear test, from the British nuclear tests, and that they have this enormous risk of injury because of their exposure, this seems the only just way of doing it. Having said that, I am prepared for the vote. I am prepared for the outcome tonight, but I am not prepared to let this matter rest. Question put:
