         BER

        Implementation Taskforce, Mr Brad Orgill, has embarrassed Ms Gillard by recommending something she should have done a long time ago—that is, withhold the next $75 million instalment to the

         New South Wales

          Senator Mason has been kind enough to ask me about why this is such a wonderful program and about the $63.7 billion that is being spent on school education from 2009 to 2012 compared to the $33.5 million that the previous government invested over a three-year period. So there has been a doubling in expenditure on Australian students, Australian schools, and you have the audacity to say that this is a waste of money. What we do know is that the Liberal Party is very anxious to assault opportunities for children and schools in Australia and is in the business of actually withdrawing support from Australian schools.

             , on the point of order, the minister was being relevant. I can only assume that was the point of order being taken because unfortunately Senator Mason, although he loves theatre, seemed to be more interested in that than in question time. When raising a point of order, the issue should be raised as to what the point of order is—whether it is on relevance—and we should then go to the issue. In this instance, Senator Mason did not go to the issue. I humbly ask you to point out that it is not a point of order and should be ruled accordingly.

                  data to the Commonwealth? Can the minister therefore confirm that he and Ms Gillard have not even been able to obtain the cooperation of their own home state in the delivery and implementation of this program?

Senator Mason would also be aware of the Liberal Party’s plans to take trade training centres away from 1,800 schools.

Nothing the minister has said so far—or seems to be about to say, since he is addressing the Liberal Party’s policy—is remotely relevant to that question.

                            I can be absolutely confident that Prime Minister Gillard will pursue rigorously attempts to transform education in this country. With Ms Gillard as Minister for Education, we have seen the doubling of funding for schools in less than two years. Under Mr Abbott we will see the removal from 1,800 schools across Australia of the opportunity to access trade training centres and the removal of 120,000 computers from schools.

                            also wants to gouge $400 million out of the quality teaching program. I can be absolutely confident of what an Abbott government would do to destroy Australian education and destroy equality of opportunity for Australian children. I can be absolutely confident of Prime Minister Gillard’s commitment to quality education.
