         Freedom of Information
        </a>
        Legislation Amendment (Improving Access and Transparency) Bill 2018 is to introduce measures that make government more transparent and accountable, and assist citizens and the media to access information under the law.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill amends the
        <i>
         Archives Act 1983
        </i>
        , the
        <i>

          Information Commissioner

         Act 2010

        , and the
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_Information_Act" rel="nofollow">
          Freedom of Information Act
         </a>
         1982
        </i>
        . The Bill reflects amendments that were moved to the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill 2018.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These amendments are designed to significantly improve the effectiveness of Australia's freedom of information (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOI" rel="nofollow">
         FOI
        </a>
        ) laws. Freedom of information provides the lawful means for citizens, the media, and parliamentarians to obtain access to information that ultimately belongs to the public.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These changes are designed to address the considerable dysfunction that has developed in our FOI system which is now characterised by chronic bureaucratic delay and obstruction, unacceptably lengthy review processes and what appears to be an increased preparedness by agencies to incur very large legal expenses to oppose the release of information.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill also seeks to restore the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (O
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIC" rel="nofollow">
         AIC
        </a>
        ) with the appointment of three independent Commissioners as was the intention of the Parliament.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As Senators will be aware, the
        <i>
         Australian Information Commissioner Act 2010
        </i>
        (AIC Act) establishes three independent statutory officers; the Information Commissioner, the FOI Commissioner and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_Commissioner" rel="nofollow">
         Privacy Commissioner
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Currently, the Information Commissioner, Mr Timothy Pilgrim, is also acting as the Privacy Commissioner while the FOI Commissioner's role is vacant because Mr Pilgrim does not hold the appropriate legal qualifications.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Soon after the passage of the AIC Act, Professor John McMillan was appointed as Australian Information Commissioner, Dr James Popple was appointed FOI Commissioner and Mr Pilgrim was appointed Privacy Commissioner. All were appointed for five-year terms.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        However in 2014, the Abbott Government introduced a Bill which sought to abolish the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner. This Bill was rejected by the Senate and after the prorogation of the 44th Parliament, the Turnbull Government decided to keep the office open. However, the vacancies made by the departure of Professor McMillian and Mr Popple were never filled.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr Pilgrim performed all three Commissioner roles and was charged with the additional task of implementing the 'Open Government Partnership' which the Turnbull Government committed itself to. However he could not fill the FOI Commissioner's role because he did not have the necessary legal qualifications required by the AIC Act.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Instead he made FOI decisions through a loophole in the legislation that permits the Information Commissioner, a position that does not require legal qualification, to make such decisions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Following Mr Pilgrim's departure in March this year, the three hats of the OAIC have been worn by Ms Angelene Falk who as Information Commissioner and Privacy Commissioner also leads the agency's freedom of information function.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        has advertised the position, making it clear that it intends to continue the practice of having a single Commissioner perform all three functions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is hard to credit the Government with a very deep commitment to freedom of information while it leaves the office of the Australian Information Commissioner hamstrung in this way.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The specific changes contained in this Bill include:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>

       <ul>
        <i>
         Archives Act 1983
        </i>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        This is a comprehensive array of reforms that reflect the practical experience of constituents, journalists, researchers and members of Parliament seeking information under Freedom of Information.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The passage of this Bill will significantly improve access to government information and with that improve scrutiny of the accountability of government to the Parliament.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Freedom of Information is an absolutely vital part of efforts to ensure that the executive government is accountable to the Parliament and the people.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As a Senator, and previously as a staffer working for former Senator Xenophon, I have found FOI enormously valuable, if at times equally frustrating.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is a pity that more Senators and Members do not take advantage of our FOI laws, flawed as they may be. I would urge them to do so, both in Opposition and in Government, and urge them to look positively at the reforms proposed here.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I commend this Bill to the Senate.
       </p>
       <p>
        I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted; debate adjourned.
