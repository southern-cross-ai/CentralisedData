          </a>

           I thank Senator Bragg for his first question despite the interjections, and also acknowledge the presence in the gallery of his parents, who must be tremendously proud. Thank you very much for this extremely important question. One of the things that a strong economy does for Australia and for all Australians is it provides job opportunities, and none could be more important than providing job opportunities for people with disability, because this government, the Morrison government, believes in encouraging people. We believe in encouraging aspiration, providing opportunity and rewarding effort. We want people who live with disability to have a choice and some control around their life so they can achieve their goals.
          </p>
          <p>
           One of the things that the Morrison government has announced is an investment of $3 billion into the Disability Employment Services Program. Through this program, we particularly want to target workplace initiatives such as workplace modifications and adjustments, so people with disability can find it easier to work in their workplace, and support wage system assessments, wage subsidy schemes and a national disability recruitment coordinator.
          </p>
          <p>
           Just last year, the Morrison government changed the disability employment service program to help more people with disability find a job. I'm pleased to say that 234,000 people use the Disability Employment Services program. And through this program, we are seeing improvements in the results for people with disability achieving the outcomes that they want for themselves. We have seen participation rates increase by 21 per cent, 41,000 people are accessing the support that they need and 15,000 people have not only been assisted in finding work but also in remaining in that work. On this side of the chamber, we believe it is our responsibility to do everything we can to get all Australians back into work and that includes helping Australians who are working with disability and living with disability to get a job as well.

             There is a misconception that when you have a disability you may be less employable. What is the government doing to remove barriers to employment for people with a disability?

              Thank you, Senator Bragg, for your follow-up question. We want to make sure all Australians who live with a disability have the ability to contribute to the Australian economy to their best ability. It's not just good for them; it's good for their families, it's good for their community and it is good for the Australian economy for everybody and anybody to have a job.
             </p>
             <p>
              Last year, the Morrison government kicked off the Employ their Ability campaign, which was designed around creating awareness of the ability and the contribution that people with disability can make in the workplace. We're pleased to announce that we have already encouraged 105 large companies and organisations to recognise the benefits of employing people with disability. We went to the last election with a suite of measures that, whilst they are ambitions, we think are absolutely achievable. We've asked the Public Service to make sure that seven per cent of the people who work in the Public Service have a disability. We've announced also $45 million to develop a national disability gateway, amongst myriad other initiatives.

                 As I mentioned earlier, we really want to make sure that people with disability get the opportunity to contribute to the economy and to society to their fullest ability, but we think everybody can play a role. It's not just the role of government. I acknowledge

                <p>
                 We need to raise awareness so that we can celebrate the opportunities and contribution of people with disability. One of the things that I announced this week was the appointment of
