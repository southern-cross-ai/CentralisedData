        <p>
         The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) Generally, when claiming a Centrelink pension, benefit, allowance or service, customers are required to establish their identity by providing original documents from an approved list. The requirement for verification of identity is based on Section 8 of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security" rel="nofollow">
          Social Security
         </a>
         (Administration) Act 1999, which states that abuses of the social security system are to be minimised. The Proof of Identity model used by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Human_Services" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Human Services
         </a>
         (the Department) requires claimants/recipients to prove their identity when making new claims or when renewing or altering their claims. The model is based on providing documents which add up to 100 points. The Department provides a comprehensive list of acceptable proof of identity documents which is available to all staff and customers at the following website: (http://www.humanservices.gov.au/customer/forms/ss231).
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The Low Income Supplement is one type of benefit which requires a person, who is unknown to the Department, to establish their identity as per these requirements. This means the person needs to provide commencement of identity (proof of birth or arrival) in Australia, and other documents from the approved list that add up to 100 points. If a customer has previously met the proof of identity requirements and is claiming within 52 weeks of receiving a payment, the full proof of identity requirements may not apply to them. Customers are advised to contact the Department if they are unsure.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         An Australian driver licence is an acceptable form of proof of identity, providing it is a current driver licence, learner permit or provisional licence showing signature and/or photo and the same name as the claim. However, on its own it is insufficient to meet the overall requirement of 100 points.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) As advised in answer (1), an original Australian birth certificate or arrival documents are required, with additional documents to make up the 100 point total. This is part of the proof of identity model used by the Department.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Each Australian state and territory has its own Proof of Identity model. A range of identity documents can be used to claim a birth certificate, including a current driver licence, but it must be provided in conjunction with other documents as per the specific state or territory requirements.
