Is it true that the opposition’s policy on climate change announced today will do almost nothing to protect seafront properties in Australia from the impact of climate change? Is it true that some 700,000 properties are threatened by potential climate change damage in this century?

           Thank you to Senator Brown for the question. I had assumed that, given the build-up to the opposition’s climate change policy, the big announcement that was billed today with Mr Abbott, Mr Hunt and Mr Truss out there trumpeting their great new policy, the first incoming would be to me saying, ‘Isn’t our policy great!’ They did not even want to front up and have an argument about their policy. It falls to Senator Brown to ask the government—

              Mr President

             . It falls to Senator Brown to ask me a question about the opposition’s policy, which is nothing more than a climate con job. That is all they come up with, with all the chest-beating and all the hoopla and all the threats and all the politics. All you have come up with is a climate con job. I am sure that we will have plenty of opportunity in the coming days to just find out exactly how much your policy will cost and that it will not work.
            </p>
            <p>
             In response directly to the second part of Senator Brown’s question, I am aware of the decision of the Land and
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_Court" rel="nofollow">
              Environment Court
             </a>
             . Obviously that is a
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
              New South Wales
             </a>
             jurisdiction, but the senator would be aware that the Australian government is extremely concerned to ensure that we assist local government to gain an understanding of the risks of climate change. We released last year, as you may recall, a study into potential sea level rises as a result of climate change to enable different levels of government to better work together on a better knowledge base to plan for the future. The reality is that those opposite are now led by a man who thinks—and we know what he thinks of climate change—and I will come back to that later—

              has led the world in a planned retreat policy, making it incumbent upon landowners and builders to be responsible for building within the zone which is threatened by climate change. But the Land and

               Environment Court

              has not upheld that. I ask the minister: how many billions of dollars does local government now face in payouts to people who built within the threatened zone?

               As the senator would be aware, this is an issue that the government is very aware of. As I said, we published a study last year which looked at potential levels of sea level rise and the number of Australian buildings which could potentially be at risk. What the senator is asking about is really one of the manifestations of the costs of climate change. We know that climate change will affect, and is already affecting, our economy and our environment. We know that the Australian coasts are also under significant pressure. Certainly in my colleague Minister Garrett’s portfolio there is funding through the Caring for Coasts election commitment and, as I said, through my department we have also presented the national coastal risk assessment, which will assist, has assisted and is assisting local governments to better understand the risks. To be absolutely frank, can I say to the senator that this is an area that requires all levels of government to work together.

Is the Commonwealth going to leave local government to bear, totally by itself, the multibillion dollar tab from the erosion of Australia’s coastlines, which threatens up to 700,000 properties this century?
