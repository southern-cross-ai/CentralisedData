        <p>
         Thank you to Senator Polly for her question. As I am sure those in the chamber would be aware, I have from time to time provided some regular updates about events in our global markets that have been very fast moving. Indeed, there is a change every 24 hours given the current circumstances of the US subprime meltdown and the financial crisis that has impacted right around the world.
        </p>
        <p>
         In recent times, several large, brand name US investment banks have disappeared or have been swallowed up, and the investment model on which they operate has been discredited.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_US" rel="nofollow">
          The US
         </a>
         banking system and the financial system are in very poor shape, and the upheaval has been causing havoc on world financial markets, particularly stock markets. We operate in a global financial economy. Unfortunately we are not immune to these impacts in Australia, as we have seen with the lack of stability on our stock market in particular.
        </p>
        <p>
         But it is fair to say that we are weathering the storm better than most of our comparable peers, and particularly the United States. In the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMF" rel="nofollow">
          IMF

         article
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IV" rel="nofollow">
          IV
         </a>
         report card on Australia released this year, which my colleague Senator Conroy referred to earlier, our strengths are set out very clearly. The IMF said that Australia’s strength is the result of responsible economic management. The report said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Looking ahead, Directors considered that the sound macroeconomic framework should permit Australia to weather the global downturn and contain inflationary pressures.
        </p>
        <p>
         The IMF also confirmed that our ‘banking sector is sound with stable profits, high capitalisation and few nonperforming loans’. The report said that Australian banks have weathered the global financial turmoil reasonably well and that the four large banks that account for two-thirds of bank assets continued to report strong profits through early 2008, together with adequate capital. This is of course in stark contrast to many banks in the United States. The IMF has also commended the Labor government on the long-term reform agenda. It concluded that its successful implementation will improve the economy’s flexibility and expand its productive capacity. The Labor government welcome the IMF’s assessment, but we are not resting on our laurels. We on this side of the chamber understand the need for responsible economic management in times of heightened global uncertainty.
        </p>

         I would like to take this opportunity to inform the Senate of another example of this government taking action to protect and strengthen our financial markets in these uncertain times. Yesterday I released the draft of the Corporations Amendment (

           The amendment will actually amend the

           2001, which was passed by the previous government. Unfortunately, the previous Liberal government left a gap when it came to the disclosure of covered short selling. Unfortunately, this has become a matter of major importance given current events on the markets. So, as I have said on many occasions, despite the ill-informed views of the opposition and the ill-informed interjections that we have just heard from Senator Abetz, the government has no intention of putting in place a permanent legislative ban on—

             2001. It is a very important change in terms of disclosure in the context of current markets. What we do need to see also from the Liberal opposition, particularly during these uncertain financial times, is a responsible approach to the budget. They should cease their raid on the budget. We need a healthy budget surplus in these uncertain financial times. We need an important buffer, an important cushion, in these uncertain financial times.

              My question is to the Minister for Superannuation and Corporate Law, Senator Sherry. Does he remember saying yesterday in the Senate:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              What I have said on many occasions is that the government would not legislate to control short selling.
             </p>
             <p>
              I refer the minister also to the first line of his press release, issued yesterday, which said:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Senator Nick Sherry, Minister for Superannuation and Corporate Law, has today released the Government’s draft legislation to require the disclosure of covered short sale transactions on Australian financial markets.
             </p>
             <p>
              In view of the conflicting statements, I ask the minister: did he mislead the Senate with his answer yesterday or did he simply not know that he was about to release draft legislation doing the exact opposite of what he had said in the Senate?

               Unfortunately, there was obviously no-one listening on the opposite side to the answer that I have just given or, indeed, to the answer I gave yesterday on this matter. As I said yesterday in response to a question, I have said on many occasions in speeches, publicly, at various meetings over the last six months, the government has no intention of legislatively banning covered short selling in this country.

                      There is a clear distinction—and I would have thought that even the opposition could understand this—between a legislative ban, which we do not support, and legislative amendments to disclose covered short selling. As I have just explained—and, unfortunately, given that question, I have to explain it again—there is a very important distinction between the government saying, and as I have said on many occasions: we will not legislatively ban short selling.

                       , I rise on a point of order on relevance. We know that the minister may have on many occasions said that the government would not ban short selling, but on page 17 of yesterday’s
                       <i>
                        Hansard
                       </i>
                       the minister is quoted as saying:
                      </p>
                      <p class="italic">
                       ... the government would not legislate to control short selling.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       We are not talking about the word ‘banning’; we are talking about controlling and that is substantially different. I would invite you, Mr President, to ask Senator Sherry to be relevant to the question that was actually asked, not the one that he was hoping he might be asked.

                        On the point of order, there is no point of order. As you know, Senator Abetz, I cannot direct the minister how to answer the question or what to say in answering the question. I can draw the minister’s attention to the question that was asked and to being relevant to the question.

                           The control of short selling in this country is exercised by the independent regulator, ASIC. ASIC has the ability and has exercised that, and it is a power that your government gave ASIC to control and ban—to control the way in which it is utilised in the market and to ban it if it wished. ASIC has chosen to impose an interim temporary ban on short selling. It is controlling it. What I have indicated through my press release yesterday and in previous comments is that this government are going to act on a gap left in the

It is ASIC that has put in place an interim temporary ban and controls on covered short selling in this country.

That has been carried out independently. That is something that I have said time and time again is not within this government’s power, and we have no intention of legislating in respect of it. What we do intend to legislate on is the disclosure. I had already outlined this yesterday. I outlined it in an earlier question. Unfortunately there is a lot of conversation and debate about short sales and the opposition are just showing that they believe a short sale is a summer sale at

                             , I ask a supplementary question. The minister has mentioned the short-selling ban imposed by ASIC over the past few days. Does he support those actions, and does ASIC still have his confidence as a result of those actions?

                                 acted in respect of naked short selling on Friday. Then, in terms of the international developments by other regulators around the world, they proceeded to a full ban on covered short selling. It is an interim ban, and ASIC will reassess that ban in 30 days in respect of non-financial stocks on the ASX. I have welcomed that ban. Given market circumstances, the turmoil and the uncertainty we have seen, I welcome that ban, that prohibition, that control, if you like. This government will ensure, quite properly, that we will close the gap in respect of disclosure.
