         A government senator: Yes.

             The Morrison government recognises the leadership shown by
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
              Indigenous Australians
             </a>
             and organisations during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the particular risk presented by the coronavirus to Indigenous communities. The Morrison government funds a range of activities to complement state and territory efforts to improve justice and community safety outcomes for Indigenous Australians, including the Custody Notification Service. We will include justice targets in the Closing the Gap Refresh that focus on incarceration rates of Indigenous Australians, and will continue to address the factors that contribute to high incarceration rates, including health, education and employment outcomes. However, the Morrison government cannot endorse measures that risk compromising the independence of our police and judicial systems, or which increase the risk of community safety, including the safety of people in Indigenous communities.
