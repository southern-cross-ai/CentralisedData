       <p>
        While I am on my feet, I would like to answer the matter yesterday regarding unparliamentary language. I have reviewed yesterday’s
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        . The Minister for Ageing made an accusation against Senator McLucas which I regard as imputing an improper motive. I asked him to withdraw it, which he did unreservedly. The accusation that a senator was abusing elderly people in our aged-care facilities is open to two interpretations. The first impression is that Senator McLucas was scaremongering in relation to aged care. The other interpretation is that Senator McLucas is literally abusing aged people, presumably psychologically. On the first interpretation, the remarks definitely impute improper motives. On the second interpretation, the remarks are certainly highly offensive and unparliamentary. There is no further action necessary from the chair, since Senator Santoro has already withdrawn the imputation. However, I would like to remind senators that everything they say in the chamber is recorded and broadcast. Strong political points can always be made without resorting to intemperate language.

         , I rise on a point of order. In relation to the ruling you have made, I know that you were asked on that occasion to review the
         <i>
          Hansard
         </i>
         record and you have done so—I am not critical of that. I say to you, Mr President, that there might be occasions—yesterday may have been one—where it is also appropriate to review the tape. Sometimes these records are different.

           He has left. Senator Faulkner was rude to one of our senators and then laughed and told him not to be embarrassed. I responded, and I was the speaker at the time: ‘He’s got no need to be embarrassed. He’s not the King of Comb-over.’ I notice that that was removed from the Senate
