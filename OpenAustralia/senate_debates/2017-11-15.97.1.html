         First of all, I congratulate you,

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Diabetes_Day" rel="nofollow">
          World Diabetes Day
         </a>
         . As Minister Hunt said, this is a day about new hope and new opportunities for people of all ages with diabetes. To support this, the minister announced that the Turnbull government would invest $9.46 million through the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health" rel="nofollow">
          National Health
         </a>
         and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_Research" rel="nofollow">
          Medical Research
         </a>
         Council's grants program. This investment will support new research into type 1 diabetes, a disease for which we have no cure. This project, run by St Vincent's Institute of Medical Research in Melbourne, will see collaboration between four of Australia's top research teams. The focus of the research will be on early life and understanding why type 1 diabetes develops, prevention, seeking to identify new drugs to stop the disease from occurring, treatment and improving therapies to replace the cells that are destroyed during the disease process.
        </p>
        <p>
         This research is important because around 140,000 Australian children and adults suffer from type 1 diabetes. Yesterday's announcement builds on the Turnbull government's recent $200 million investment in world-leading medical research projects which will improve the lives of patients battling cancers, mental health illnesses and chronic disease. This will include over $400 million to be invested in cancer research, including areas like melanoma research, $29 million into mental health research, $23 million into cardiovascular disease research, $8 million for diabetes research, $5 million for obesity research, and improving the health of

         is a priority with $15.5 million for new research. Over $15 million also will be targeted at research projects that support people who suffer severe injuries. A total of 326 projects will be funded at a cost of more than $197 million.

            Medical research is a key pillar of the Turnbull government's long-term national health plan. In addition to the recent $200 million research boost, the government has established a $20 billion

            with the government investing over $4 billion across the next four years. Finally, the government has established a $500 million Biomedical Translation Fund. This fund is helping early-stage biomedical companies become internationally competitive, creating new markets for health care and producing better health outcomes. This all shows that the Turnbull government is committed to keeping Australian health consumers at the cutting edge of medical treatment.

               Australian medical research has been at the forefront of delivering life-saving treatments for patients around the world. The revolutionary human papillomavirus vaccines that help protect against four types of
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HPV" rel="nofollow">
                HPV
               </a>
               are based on technology first developed and patented in Australia. Apart from its impacts on women's health worldwide, the vaccine was one of the first Australian pharmaceutical successes to result in a fair share of economic flow back to Australia. Just last month, we announced the listing of a new and improved Gardasil 9 vaccine that will protect against another five strains of the HPV. This $460 million investment by the coalition to the National Immunisation Program is another great example of how the government is taking cutting-edge medical research to the people of Australia. This government takes the health of Australians seriously; contrast this with the record on health of those opposite.
