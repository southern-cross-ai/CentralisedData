        (d) notes that, if former Prime Minister Tony Abbott had not withdrawn from the agreement, as many as 600 refugees would have been resettled in New Zealand by now;

        (e) acknowledges the inquiry and report of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee, Serious allegations of abuse, self-harm and neglect of asylum seekers in relation to the Nauru Regional Processing Centre, and any like allegations in relation to the Manus, and in particular, recommendation 7: "The committee recommends that the

        (h) calls on the Turnbull Government to immediately accept New Zealand's offer to resettle refugees from Manus Island and Nauru and begin negotiating appropriate conditions, similar to the United States refugee resettlement agreement, to ensure people smugglers do not exploit vulnerable people.

           The coalition government is committed to Operation Sovereign Borders and the policies that have kept children out of detention and prevented deaths at sea. The government will not be lectured to by the Labor Party on border protection. Australians have not forgotten the Labor-Greens border disaster, which saw 50,000 people arrive on more than 800 boats. The tragic mistakes of those opposite saw 8,000 children placed in detention and at least 1,200 lives lost at sea. The government will not repeat Labor's mistakes. Given the close ties between
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_and_New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
            Australia and New Zealand
           </a>
           , any resettlement of refugees in New Zealand would have serious implications for Operation Sovereign Borders. The coalition will not weaken our borders and never implement policies which risk putting people smugglers back into business.
