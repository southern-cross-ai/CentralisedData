         I thank the senator for the question. As I was saying yesterday, the government has put in place the right economic framework so that businesses can prosper, grow and create more jobs for Australians. We're also a government that knows and unashamedly believes that the best form of welfare is a job. We are committed to getting Australians who are on welfare off welfare and into a job. In fact, under this government, welfare dependency in Australia is the lowest it has been in 30 years. This is because, as a government, we know you have to have in place the right policies and the right programs to assist people who are on welfare and want to get a job.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">

         , jobactive is the Australian government's way to get more Australians into work by connecting those who are looking for work, the jobseeker, with employers out there who are looking for employees.
        </p>
        <p>
         I'm pleased to advise the Senate that since 2015 in July it as achieved 1.39 million job placements. Indeed, it continues to achieve around 1,000 job placements every single day. What providers on the network can also do is connect jobseekers with a range of government services and government initiatives. This includes: relocation assistance—if somebody wanted to go to the great state of Queensland and work, they could get relocation assistance—employer wage subsidies and training apprenticeships. And, if you want to start your own business, we have a fantastic program that has been going now for in excess of three decades, known as the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme. If you're a young person aged under 25, our Youth Jobs PaTH program can help you get the skills and experience you need to secure a job. The best form of welfare is a job, and we've got in place the programs and procedures.

            That is a very good question. The government is committed to mutual obligation. Mutual obligation requirements are designed to ensure that unemployed people who are receiving welfare payments are actively looking for work and participating in activities that will actually help them get into employment. This is all about getting people off welfare and getting them into work. It is a fundamental tenet, mutual obligation, of our jobactive system. It ensures that those who are receiving welfare payments and assistance from the Australian taxpayer are taking the necessary steps they need to take to get a job. Mutual obligation includes activities such as job searchers, job interviews and, of course, meetings with the jobactive provider. It can be difficult for some Australians to do this, and that is why those experiencing greater difficulty under the jobactive system are given greater assistance.

               The best form of welfare is a job. On this side of the chamber, as this government, we understand the benefit of work. When a person gets a job it gives so many personal benefits to the individual. It gives them their self-esteem, which comes from the dignity of work. I have met with so many people in this role and in my previous role who tell me: 'Michaelia, it gave me a reason to get up in the morning. By getting that job, I now get out of bed every single day.' They have pride when they're able to provide for their family. You can never underestimate the pride that a person gets in being able to provide for their family because they have found work. But also, the parents tell me: 'I can now provide for my future generation. When my kids look at me, they see I've got a job, and that's a good thing.'
