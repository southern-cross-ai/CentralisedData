         I do not have the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Energy_Agency" rel="nofollow">
          International Energy Agency
         </a>
         document to which the senator is referring in front of me, but listening to the question I think the propo­sition is: as China has been growing, its emissions have been growing. I do not think there is anybody who would suggest that that is not the case. We have seen extraordinary growth in China over the last 20 years as well as an increase in disposable income and of course that growth is one of the strengths of the Australian economy. One of the underlying strengths of the Australian economy is the ongoing growth in China. I would have thought that the senator would not be churlish about that.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would make the point that the opposition have persisted with the proposition that other countries, including China, are not acting on climate change—amongst the array of reasons they put forward against action on climate change. Of course they neglect to remind Australians that China has the world's largest installed renewable energy electricity generation capacity—some 37 gigawatts of renewable power capacity; more than any other country in the world—and that China has also indicated it proposes to introduce emissions trading pilot schemes in a number of provinces, including the industrial centres of Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong.

         </a>
         recently indicated these schemes may be expanded to a national scheme by 2015. The fact is that there are other countries that recognise that to move ahead in the global economy and to be a first-rate economy, you need to be a clean energy economy. On this side, we understand that. Regrettably, those on the other side who did understand that are silent.

          </a>
          , in the last 20 years China has reduced its amount of carbon pollution faster than any other major economy and, as a developing country, its efforts to limit emissions have been substantial.
         </p>
         <p>
          On what basis is this claim made, given China has tripled its output of

           I think I dealt with that in the first question. I do not think there is a suggestion anywhere in the world that we will not see growth in emissions from certain countries. The question is: to what extent is growth in your economy linked to growth in emissions? Other countries have recognised that prosperity in the future will require
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
            GDP
           </a>
           growth to be delinked from growth in pollution. We cannot continue to have an industrial-age approach to this which says that every unit of economic growth that we have will equivalently increase pollution by a unit. We have to delink those. A great many economies around the world recognise that to be a first-rate economy, you need to be a clean energy economy. That is why China is investing in the sorts of things I described and that is why we need a price on carbon in Australia.

            data, China's emissions represent an increase of a staggering 194.3 per cent over just the last decade? Can the minister explain why the government is spending millions of dollars of taxpayers' money on promoting its carbon tax with information that is just simply wrong?

                 The minister has been directly answering the question. The minister has been ensuring that she meets the question. In the stretch of the question that Senator Abetz raised, it is within the ability of the minister to range a little more widely than usual. That is acceptable in providing a direct response.

                  The minister has been going 15 seconds, as has been rightly pointed out. I am listening closely to the answer of the minister. The minister knows the question which has been asked and has 45 seconds remaining.
