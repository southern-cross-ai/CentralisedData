         I thank Senator Carol Brown for her ongoing interest and support for the

          National Broadband Network
         </a>
         in Tasmania began in Sorell, just outside Hobart. Sorell is the first of seven Tasmanian stage 2 communities where construction will get under way over the coming weeks and months. The other stage 2 communities are Triabunna,

         . Importantly, this will provide access to high-speed broadband to more than 11,000 homes and businesses in Tasmania upon completion. We expect that those services will be available progressively from March 2012.
        </p>
        <p>
         The commencement of construction in the stage 2 communities follows the launch of commercial services in Tasmania in July 2010 in Scottsdale, Smithton and

          Midway Point
         </a>
         . Households, businesses and schools in these communities are already experiencing the benefits of high-speed broadband and improved competition. Just this last weekend the Principal of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_Head_Christian_School" rel="nofollow">
          Circular Head Christian School

         in Smithton told the Hobart
         <i>
          Mercury
         </i>
         thatin the past the area's students had to leave to access education beyond grade 10 and that one of the big advantages they have gained from the NBN is 'being able to provide a greater range of learning oppor­tunities for all students but particularly those in years 11 and 12'. Because of the NBN they are now able to offer their students almost any course they want. Sadly, those opposite want to take that away from them and every other school student in Australia.

           Co.'s interim satellite solution came into operation and will be available until the long-term satellite solution becomes ready for launch in 2015. The new interim satellite service will deliver substantial speed and performance improve­ments over current satellite services and replaces the Australian Broadband Guaran­tee, providing access to affordable broadband to those who need it most.

             -Minnamurra first-release site the prospect of a high-speed NBN connection is already drawing businesses to the area. Photographer Paul Gosney says the NBN was a major factor in his decision to move from Sydney to Minnamurra with his wife—also a photographer—and his young family. He said: 'I might even have an advantage over my competitors. I can shoot a job in Sydney, do the post production down here and then deliver them all to my clients.'
