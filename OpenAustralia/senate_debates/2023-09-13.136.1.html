        My question is to Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Productivity Commission
        </a>
        's role is to help governments make better policy in the long term for the Australian community. The new productivity commissioner, Danielle Wood, has argued there's no justification for how little Australian retirees are taxed and has called for a debate on inheritance tax to address intergenerational inequity. Will the Albanese Labor government rule out imposing an inheritance tax?

         In relation to the last: no, the government is not contemplating an inheritance tax. Second—
        </p>
        <p>
         Speaking of fear and fact—I'll take the interjection from Senator Cash and others on that side—it's really extraordinary, isn't it? They come in here demanding discussion about facts, but we see yet again a fear campaign. No, it is not government policy, nor are we proposing one.
        </p>
        <p>
         As the Treasurer, I understand, has said, obviously Ms Wood is a well-published economist. She has written and spoken about economic policy for many years. Obviously, the Treasurer and the government may not agree with everything she has said or published, but she is an economist of great note.

         before, and in itself it is a good thing to see a woman who is so well qualified come to head that body. I think Senator Gallagher yesterday gave some information to the chamber in relation to the selection process.
        </p>
        <p>
         I again reiterate Ms Wood has said and written many things, as you would expect from someone in her position. Not all of them are ones the Treasurer might agree with, and they certainly don't represent government policy. But the point is that we have appointed someone to head the Productivity Commission who is deeply engaged in some of today's difficult economic questions, and that is a good thing, to ensure that the government and the Australian people, as well as the parliament, can have the benefit of the advice and views of the

           Just to make sure of your answer, Australians pay 40 to 45 per cent tax on a new home built, and over their lives they are always paying land tax, capital gains tax,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
            GST

           , stamp duty and countless other government fees and charges. Everything is taxed in this country. Does the Prime Minister support continuing to tax the families of hardworking Australians, after they die, with an inheritance tax?

               Thank you to Senator Hanson for the supplementary. I would say first what I said in my first answer, which is that an inheritance tax is not part of the government's agenda. In relation to the

                Productivity Commission

               , obviously that is an independent body. We respect its independence, and we respect its contribution to the national discussion about economic issues as an independent body, obviously. Governments of the day won't always take the advice of the

                  Again, I'd say that Ms Wood wrote and spoke widely on economic and tax and fiscal policy prior to her appointment. She was entitled to do so. She is a well-respected economist. As head of the
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
                   Productivity Commission

                  , her position is one of independence. The government will make its own decisions about funding for various programs, including aged care. I would make the point, Senator Hanson, that this government has invested an enormous amount into aged care, including improving the position of the workers.
