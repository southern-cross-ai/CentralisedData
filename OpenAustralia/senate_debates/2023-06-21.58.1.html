        Two minutes is not actually long enough to list the evidence of disregard that this government has for people living in rural, regional and remote Australia. Their actions since coming into government have absolutely proven that Labor does not care for regional Australians. One of the first things they did was to expand eligibility for the distribution priority areas, a system designed to help rural, regional and remote Australia access

        Regional infrastructure spending was cut, deferred or is being reviewed. Community pharmacies: let's just rip $180,000 from their bottom line. And water! I can tell you it's not for growing food or fibre, that's for sure. I could go on and on and on, but I'm out of time.
