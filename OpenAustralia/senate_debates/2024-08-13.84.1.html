         Thank you, Senator O'Neill. I recognise your longstanding interest in these issues and in the wellbeing of communities in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         This is of course my first question as minister in this portfolio, and I want to acknowledge my predecessor, Senator Watt. His is a legacy that I am proud to build on. I also want to acknowledge the communities who are still on the long road to recovery following floods and fires, and the terrific workers and volunteers, some of whom I've already had the privilege of meeting in the last two weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
         But, as the frequency and severity of natural disasters has grown, so has the expectation that the Australian government will be able to step up and support communities when they are at their lowest. The Albanese government has risen to this challenge. Over the last two years, we have implemented a number of reforms to ensure that Australians can be better prepared for natural disasters, so these communities can respond better and recover faster when a disaster hits us. These include creating the National Emergency Management Agency, to lead a more unified and more coordinated approach to emergency management; completing a substantial upgrade to the National Situation Room; establishing and building a National Emergency Management Stockpile; and investing in Disaster Relief Australia to boost volunteers providing recovery and support to clean up after disasters.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our government is focused on working collaboratively with our partners to help communities prepare for and manage disasters. States and territories of course retain primary responsibility for these responses, but our government's approach is to show leadership, boost our capacity to coordinate and show that we are ready to support states and territories and support communities at their worst possible moments.

           Thank you very much, Minister. I know, from being at the Gundagai Show and people talking about the challenge and response in

           , they will very much appreciate the answer that you've given there. As we enter this second half of the year, my community in New South Wales is starting to turn its mind to the coming high-risk weather season. What work is the Albanese government undertaking in the coming months to ensure Australians are ready for this high-risk weather season?

            We do know how important it is to work with states and territories, work with industry and work with communities on emergency management. The work that's already underway includes plans for the Albanese government's second high-risk weather season preparedness summit, which will bring together government, industry and the community sector to prepare for the coming season. We're also establishing briefings between the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Meteorology" rel="nofollow">
             Bureau of Meteorology
            </a>
            , state and territory agencies and local governments on how to implement and use the Australian Warning System, so that communities can rely on consistent information and consistent language when they are receiving that information, and a series of national exercises are stress-testing our arrangements with state and territory governments and with industries. In this year's budget, we have also committed an additional $35 million over two years to boost Australia's aerial capability.

              Thank you very much, Minister, and I'm pleased, and relieved, in fact, to hear that this government is committed to ensuring that Australians are in fact better prepared for natural disasters so they can respond and recover faster. Looking beyond this next season, however, how is the Albanese government working with states, territories and local governments to build resilience to future natural disasters?

              <p>
               When we came into government, we promised to turn the previous government's defunct Emergency Response Fund into a dedicated fund for resilience and mitigation projects. And we have delivered. The Albanese government's flagship Disaster Ready Fund is investing up to $200 million in Commonwealth funding every year for projects across the country. Last year we announced nearly $400 million in matched funding for 187 projects. These included flood levees, evacuation shelters, fuel hazard mapping capability, seawalls and more.
              </p>
              <p>
               Now, this is in stark contrast to the former government. In three years, their $4.8 billion Emergency Response Fund did not complete a single mitigation project or release a cent in recovery funding, while it made the government over $800 million in interest. Australians expect their government to support them in times of need, and they can be assured we will do just that.
