         The government has been very clear about why it is in the national interest to act on climate change. Those opposite who were supporting Mr Turnbull will recall there was a time when you were not led by someone quite so reckless, when you also recognised the importance of acting on climate change.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have been very clear with the Australian people about the need to act on climate change. The Prime Minister has spoken at length about the reasons for the decision to move to a fixed-price system followed by a floating price—that is, an emissions trading scheme. One thing is clear: it is absolutely in the nation's interest to deal with climate change. This is not an issue that is going to go away. This is not an issue that can be chased away simply by the scaremongering of those opposite.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government understands there are a great many Australians who are concerned about this policy, who are concerned to understand the impact of the Clean Energy Future package on their households and on their families, which is why the government has worked very hard to ensure that that information is provided to the Australian people. This is, no doubt, a difficult reform. It is a reform that requires this parliament to look to the longer term and not just to the short-term politics. What you can always guarantee is that those opposite are led by a man who will never look to the long term, who will only ever look to what he believes is a short-term political advantage. He used to believe that he needed to act on climate change and that supporting an emissions trading scheme was the way forward, until he thought the politics had shifted.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Is the minister aware that the Prime Minister assured the parliament on 10 May this year that the government will be:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          … returning the budget to surplus in 2012-13, on time, as promised, as I said to the Australian people at the last election.
         </p>
         <p>
          Does the minister stand by the Prime Minister's statement that a budget surplus in 2012-13 was a promise—not an objective, not an aim, not a goal but a promise?

           Unlike those opposite, the government have a clear plan to return the budget to surplus in 2012-13 and we are determined to get there. We laid that plan out in the budget, we made the savings decisions that were required, we exercised restraint in expenditure so that, on average, the growth in expenditure is one per cent—

             I will take that interjection from the very loud senator at the end there and make the point that if you want to find that kind of restraint in expenditure over a five-year period you have to go back to the 1980s. It was not ever achieved by Mr Costello. The reality is: we have a plan; they do not. The opposition have a $70 billion black hole just to get them to the starting line. That is what they have.

             <p class="italic">
              … there’s really only one set of numbers I’m worried about. That’s making sure we get back into surplus by 2012-13 …

                   As I said, we have a clear plan to return the budget to surplus in 2012-13 and we are determined to get there. We put forward our budget to the Australian people and to this parliament. What I would say is this: I wonder if the $70 billion is a promise? I wonder if the $70 billion is a commitment? I wonder if the $70 billion will ever be delivered on?

                      I am sure the Australian people will be very interested in knowing whether or not the $70 billion is a promise. We have a budget. We have put it forward to the Australian people through this parliament, clearly costed, based on Treasury and Finance advice—the same people who found your first black hole. It is a smaller black hole—
