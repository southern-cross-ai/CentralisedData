Did you or your office seek any briefing from police or prosecutors on evidence and procedural laws to ensure that your pursuit of those allegations in the parliament and the media did not affect any investigation into this matter?

         President, I raise a point of order. This parliament and this chamber has had a lot of focus on these issues in these last days, and, as I said yesterday, I have taken the view that it is appropriate for questions to be asked and answered. But I would ask you, as chair, given the number of questions that have been asked, to recall President Hogg's ruling in 2014 in relation to the scope of questions, making it clear that questions about historical events before a senator became a minister are not in order. Now, we've not chosen till now to put that to you, but given that yesterday we had a question about a wedding, I think it's probably time that the Senate started to look at whether or not the questions in fact comply with the rulings of Senator Hogg.

          President, in considering the point of order, I would invite you to consider that, in the previous parliament, more than 50 questions were asked directly on these related issues to then ministers and that the questions that have been asked over the course of this week relate to statements that were made by Senator
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallagher" rel="nofollow">
           Gallagher
          </a>
          and by Senator Wong in the parliament and statements that they've subsequently made outside of the parliament in response to media queries as ministers—and there are a range of precedents that determine the validity of the questions that have been asked—and, through that, to consider the reasonableness of them continuing to be asked if necessary. These questions could have been curtailed had we indeed had a situation where Senator Gallagher acknowledged that she had misled and, having acknowledged that, simply corrected the record. However, that has not been the case, so the opposition has chosen to ask what we contend to be reasonable questions, consistent with existing practice and precedent and, within that, consistent very much with the type of prosecution we've seen of similar matters before.

              tor GALLAGHER (—) (): The formulation of our questions was done in the normal way, through our own processes. I would say that throughout those questions we were always conscious of making sure that our questions didn't go to issues that may be raised and considered through further or future investigations. And I have certainly not—and I can check the record on this—there was no feedback from any of those authorities that they were concerned about the questions we were asking. I mean, we are in the

                   I refer to my earlier answer, and I would say again: the allegations that we sought to ask questions about were allegations that a young woman had something dreadful happen to her in this building that we work in. Is anyone suggesting that there shouldn't have been questions asked about how that occurred? That is the issue here.

                                Order! These are serious matters. I've said that over and over again. I am being fair across the chamber. I want the questions asked in silence and I want the answers responded to in silence. It is legitimate to call points of order, but it is not legitimate to keep calling out across the chamber, and I think it's not fair to make me the arbiter of your behaviour. You're in control of whether you shout out or not, and I will keep sitting the minister down and drawing it to the chamber's attention. I'm asking you to listen in respectful silence—from both sides of the chamber. I don't think that is an outrageous ask. Minister, please continue.
