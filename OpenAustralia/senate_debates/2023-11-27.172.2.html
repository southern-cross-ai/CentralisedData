       <p>
        I wish today to talk about why language matters, why it's important, and why we, in the Australian parliament, must think extremely carefully about what we say and the images that we present to the public. Antisemitism, Islamophobia and all forms of discrimination are heinous and have no place in modern Australian society. While we live in the most successful multicultural society in the world, that achievement does not come with a trophy which can be simply accepted and placed on a mantle for admiration. It requires ongoing commitment and ongoing work in order to maintain.
       </p>
       <p>
        When, in the other place, the Leader of the Opposition cynically attempted to link antisemitism to our Prime Minister undertaking appropriate duties overseas and meeting with our most important economic and military partners, the Leader of the Opposition diminished the very real rise in hate that is being experienced by Australia's Jewish community. When, just days ago, Senator Faruqi stood beside a sign that read 'Keep the world clean', with an image of the Israeli flag being placed into a bin, I was horrified.
       </p>
       <p>
        Peaceful protest is a cornerstone of our democracy and one that I will always, always support, but that sign has no legitimate place in protest. The use of the term 'clean' on that disgraceful poster undeniably invokes the language of ethnic cleansing. Such language stokes deep fear within the collective memory of Jewish communities. The language itself is a dog whistle for direct violence against Jewish people. It is frightening and it is wrong. I understand that Senator Faruqi has subsequently deleted the post and that the posting of this photo was likely accidental. However, the point remains that we must be strident in our condemnation of antisemitism. Such evils as that advocated in that sign do nothing but divide us. Words, symbols, signs and actions can undermine the path towards enduring peace, both overseas and within our region.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is at this vital moment that we must remain steadfast in our commitment to a two-state solution to this conflict in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
         Middle East
        </a>
        . We must repeatedly reaffirm the right of all Palestinian and all Israeli people to live in safety, within recognised borders and within their own states. And we must support democratic governments. The sign which Senator Faruqi stood next to was not aligned with that endeavour. It was a call for the destruction of Israel.
       </p>
       <p>
        The weaponisation of antisemitism for political ends, as we have seen from the opposition leader and many members of the coalition in this place, is similarly destructive and must be condemned as well. Australians deserve leaders who unite us. We deserve words and actions that promote unity and peace for allâ€”all human lives. This is a multicultural, multifaith nation. We must take pride in that fact. As senators, we must hold ourselves to higher standards in this place and, indeed, in our communities and our work that stretches beyond this building. We must not elevate the words of division and violence that undermine our genuine and, I hope, shared work towards peace.
