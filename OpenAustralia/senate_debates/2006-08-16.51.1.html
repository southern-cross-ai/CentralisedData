        My question is to my colleague from Queensland the Minister for Ageing, Senator Santoro. Will the minister advise the Senate of decisions made at the recent
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
         COAG

         I wish to thank my good friend from Queensland for the question and acknowledge his very keen interest and regular advice to me on workforce issues within the aged care industry and the health industry of Australia. The Howard government has a very proud record in the subject area that Senator Trood talks about. Since 2000 there has been a 30 per cent increase in the number of first-year places in Australian medical schools. Last year there were some 1,300 medical graduates around Australia and it is anticipated that, on current policies, there will be 2,100 medical graduates by the year 2011. This represents a 60 per cent increase thanks to the policies of the Howard government.
        </p>
        <p>
         On 8 April 2006 the Prime Minister announced 400 new medical places and 1,000 new nursing places, and an increase in the Commonwealth contribution to nurse clinical training. At its meeting on 14 July 2006,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
          COAG
         </a>
         agreed to further contributions by the Commonwealth, such as an additional 205 medical places. The total amount invested by the Howard government in COAG health workforce initiatives is now around $300 million over four years. That is very significant. That $300 million includes funding for the following: a total of 605 new medical places, with 220 going to Victoria, 150 for Queensland, 110 for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         , 60 each for WA and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         and five for Tasmania; and an increase in the Commonwealth contribution for nurse clinical training which works out to about $31 million over four years. In addition to that, there is a national health workforce registration scheme which will improve workforce mobility, safety and quality and reduce red tape. The government will also expand specialist training into a broader range of settings, including the private sector, by January 2008.
        </p>
        <p>
         On the second part of Senator Trood’s question, relating to Queensland, I am pleased and very proud to report that the Howard government provides substantial funding to Queensland to assist with public hospital services. Up to $8 billion will be provided over the life of the 2003 to 2008 Australia health care arrangements, including around $1.7 billion for this financial year. That is a very substantial investment in the health care system of Queensland. Of course, everybody knows the state governments are responsible for administering their health systems. Under the Howard government, state governments like Queensland, Victoria and South Australia that are run by state Labor governments have basically wasted and squandered the money. In the case of Queensland, there have been countless examples over the last 12 months.

           One example was the example of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr_Death" rel="nofollow">
            Dr Death
           </a>
           . Just last week the federal member for Dawson exposed yet more flaws in the supposedly tough new quality controls of the Beattie government that have supposedly been put in place following a series of Queensland hospital fiascos. As the Senate can see from the statistics I have quoted, the Howard federal government provides rivers of gold to the health systems of the various states, including Queensland, through
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
            GST
           </a>
           revenue and special purpose grants—rivers of gold that are squandered irresponsibly by state governments such as the outgoing Beattie Labor government.
