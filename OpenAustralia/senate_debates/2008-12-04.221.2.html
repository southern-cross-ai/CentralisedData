          The effect of these amendments is to make interest payable by the Commissioner of Taxation. They are covered by section 53 because they increase the amount payable under the standing appropriation in section 16 of the Taxation Administration Act 1953.

          The Senate has long followed the practice that it should treat as requests amendments which would result in increased expenditure under a standing appropriation, although this interpretation is not consistent with other elements of the established interpretation of the third paragraph of section 53 of the Constitution. This has nothing to do with the introduction of bills under the first paragraph of section 53.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          If it is correct that these amendments require the Commissioner of Taxation to make interest payments which will be payable from a standing appropriation, it is in accordance with the precedents of the Senate that the amendments be moved as requests.
         </p>
         <p>
          I do not intend to speak for very long because the amendments are short and concise. Obviously I will have a few words to say about the amendments themselves.
         </p>
         <p>
          Since we last debated this matter and were about to move to a vote on Senator Xenophon’s amendments, there has, fortunately, been a reflection and consideration of these matters. The calculated cost of Senator Xenophon’s amendments was up to $860 million, as advised by Treasury, over the forward estimates. However, we did accept and reflect on the contributions of Senators Bushby and Xenophon. As I indicated, I think the difficulty that Senator Bushby faced—and I accept that his in principle attitude raised some concerns—was that the bill we are now considering was Liberal Party policy. Senator Xenophon is of course a newly elected senator and he had not given a policy commitment on this particular piece of legislation. Senator Xenophon’s issues were similar to—though not exactly the same as—Senator Bushby’s. The government has considered the points that Senators Bushby and Xenophon have made and we have been able to accommodate at least some of those concerns.
         </p>
         <p>
          The concerns expressed, particularly by Senator Xenophon, about issues going to retrospectivity and returning temporary residents was something that the government and I did think about following the debate. I acknowledge Senator Xenophon’s positive contribution. Following discussions with Senator Xenophon, we are able to accommodate in part—and I accept that it is only in part—the in principle concerns that he expressed relating to the issue of temporary residents who return to Australia. There is a category of people who leave the country, having been temporary residents, and then return as permanent residents. Many of those people who return as permanent residents ultimately take out Australian citizenship.
         </p>
         <p>
          Given that one of the principles under discussion was that the Australian system should not confer a benefit on non-Australians, the government considered that it was reasonable that, where a temporary resident leaves Australia, effectively leaves their money here and that money is moved over into the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATO" rel="nofollow">
           ATO
          </a>
          account, and then that temporary resident comes back to Australia as a permanent resident, they should not to penalised. The approach that we have come up with is that if a temporary resident returns to Australia, having elected to leave their money in the Australian system, they should not be penalised. Where a former temporary resident returns to Australia on a permanent visa, their money will be transferred back to the fund of their choice. In addition, the government will pay accrued interest at the long-term government bond rate and there will be no administration charge. We think that having no additional charges and the payment of the long-term bond rate is a pretty reasonable accommodation for this group of people. The cost will be approximately $7.5 million over the forward estimates.
         </p>
         <p>
          We considered this to be a positive recognition of, and an attempt to accommodate, the concerns that have been raised by senators while not fundamentally threatening revenue, which is obviously very important as well. With those remarks, I want to thank all the senators who have contributed to reaching this position. I want to thank the opposition and Senator Xenophon for the very positive discussions we have had on this matter since we last discussed it.

           This bill could be debated through 6.30. I am trying to work out why the other house can complain about the food in the canteen but I have not been consulted about having no dinner break. I have not had breakfast, I have not had lunch and I want a dinner break at 6.30, so I would like to know how the government can bring back the dinner break tonight so that we can debate this bill properly.

            Senator, I have some sympathy for your dietary needs, but the Senate has already voted on the matter of the dinner break and, as I understand it, has agreed that there will not be a dinner break and that we will continue through what was intended to be the dinner break.

             I was not asked about whether or not we would have a dinner break. I understood we would have a dinner break, and no-one came to see me to say that it had been agreed otherwise. I think it is a farce. With the hours that we work, a dinner break in this workplace is not too much to ask.

               I understand that others have been consulted. The issue is that I do listen to the debates in the chamber as they help shape your views on how you will vote on things, and when people say, ‘We’re going to do this or that,’ it may work but it may not work. Frankly, I was really looking forward to my dinner break tonight and I do not think it is unreasonable to expect one.

                In respect of the amendment that Senator Xenophon has withdrawn, it did, on the face of it, address an inequity that had been identified by the economics committee. The intention was that in certain circumstances a superannuant, if they so chose, should have been able to maintain their superannuation account despite having departed Australia. I have listened to the comments of the minister in support of the amendments and requests that the Senate is now considering and they do seem to me to be a fair and sensible accommodation whereby superannuants are going to be treated much more fairly. Accrued interest at the long-term bond rate and no admin charge is significantly better than what we faced when we were last looking at this. I want to commend Senator Xenophon and certainly Senator Sherry for looking carefully at this. This was entirely what we intended should happen. It is a very constructive way of dealing with it, and the coalition is very pleased to support it.

                 I will be brief. I echo the remarks of Senator Coonan. I also place on record my gratitude for the work that I did with Senator Bushby on this. It has been a good exercise. I do not want to give him the kiss of political death by saying what a good job I think he did, but I was very grateful for the constructive way in which we dealt with it. I am also grateful to Senator Sherry for listening to our concerns and being able to accommodate them, in part. I maintain my concerns about retrospectivity, but this goes a long way to dealing with the most anomalous aspect of it. I commend the government for their approach to this and I welcome and support these amendments.
