        program announced in the 2009-10 budget. There is no additional appropriation in this bill. It simply transfers $10.93 million from the Appropriations Act (No. 1) to the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act from 1 January 2010.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Sporting Chance program is an initiative of the previous coalition government and was originally announced in the 2006-07 budget. This program is successfully achieving its desired outcomes in engaging Indigenous boys and girls in school through involvement with sport. We are certainly justifiably proud of introducing and implementing this program. I am pleased to note that, as a result of this program, more than half of the academy students were reported by the schools to be improving their academic performance and many were also reported to have made significant gains with respect to behaviour and self-esteem, which is incredibly important.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government have made promises to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
         Indigenous Australians
        </a>
        through Closing the Gap yet have failed to deliver the new programs or deliver any improvements in Indigenous education outcomes. The reality is that if anything the gap is widening under Labor with the only good news coming from policies and programs implemented by us when in government. The Sporting Chance program is delivering positive results for Indigenous students, particularly from remote and rural areas of Australia. I commend the bill the Senate.
