        I rise this evening to offer my most sincere and heartfelt congratulations to those recipients of this year's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        honours. Those recognised in these honours are Australians from across our great nation who have selflessly dedicated their time in pursuit of a better Australia to be shared by all. Hailing from all walks of life, they are exemplary in their leadership, their commitment and their resolve: the three pillars of the Australian spirit. These Australians have taken to heart the words of the old proverb, which exhorts us all to 'be the change you want to see in the world'. As all the members of this chamber well know, I am an immensely proud Victorian. As is the case year in and year out, Victorians are very well represented in this round of Australia Day honours, and I wish to wholeheartedly congratulate all Victorian recipients for the recognition of their achievements, each and every one so richly deserved.
       </p>
       <p>
        More specifically I would like single out my congratulations and thanks to the following recipients who have so significantly contributed to and strengthened the fabric of our society through service and dedication in their respective fields: Professor Caroline Frances Finch, of

       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I would like to extend my personal and warmest congratulations to a diligent and conscientious servant of the

        . Mr Brian Loughnane's service has been duly recognised in this year's Australia Day honours through his appointment as an Officer of the order of Australia, AO. Brian has held a variety of positions as a business and political strategic adviser, most notably, of course, as Federal Director of the Liberal Party from February 2003 until January 2016.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate and pay my respects to all the members of Australia's Defence Force, both here and those deployed overseas. All of the members of the ADF serve as role models for the rest of our country for their unrivalled selflessness, their teamwork and their incredible bravery. It is wonderful that our great nation does not take for granted the hard work, the dedication and the sacrifice of these great men and women. This evening I would especially like to congratulate those recipients of the military crosses, the medals and the commendations, many of whom cannot be publicly named due to their ongoing operational commitments.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are two very, very special times of the year in which the government and the community can express our sincere gratitude to those exemplary citizens who represent the very, very best of the Australian spirit. It is an absolute honour to be able to stand here this evening to name and to honour these dedicated and conscientious Victorians. I thank the chamber for its indulgence.
