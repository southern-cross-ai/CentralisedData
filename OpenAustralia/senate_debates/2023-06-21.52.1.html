        Like most Australians, I am strongly in favour of recognition for

        in our Constitution. As I've said, I think most decent-minded Australians are. It is simply the right thing to do. However, that said, I strongly disagree with the Albanese government's model for a voice to parliament. I truly believe that, if Labor were actually serious about getting constitutional recognition through, they would put two questions to the Australian people at the referendum: one on constitutional recognition and one on a model for the Voice. But I agree that Australians should have their say in a referendum on this matter, which is why I supported the referendum legislation on Monday.

I want, as I am sure everybody else in this chamber wants, to see an equality of opportunity for all Indigenous Australians so that, no matter where they're born or the circumstances of their life, it doesn't mean that they are going to be disadvantaged.

        But the current voice proposal put by Labor is risky, it is divisive and I have no doubt, sadly, it will make not a jot of difference in the lives of Aboriginals in Western Australia. You only have to go to any community. They don't talk to you about the Voice; they want their current voice to be heard. At
