               I was asked about competitiveness, and I am making the point that we do believe in competitiveness and in utilising the benefits of the boom to provide tax cuts—something that the senator who asked me a question will be opposing for small business. He can explain to all the small businesses in
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                South Australia
               </a>
               why he thinks they should pay more tax and miners should pay less. He can explain how that is good for their competitiveness.
              </p>
              <p>
               If the senator cares so much about what the ESAA says, I would remind him of the comments that have previously been made about the importance of certainty and how the lack of certainty could lead to higher electricity prices. In fact, last year the industry warned that power prices would rise if the coalition carried out its threat to dismantle the carbon tax, because of uncertainty. I will quote from Ms Savage:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               We're concerned that if there is any uncertainty around a future price of carbon it will affect the ability for electricity generators to invest and that it will also impact on their ability to offer fixed price electricity contracts—

Does the minister agree that, with electricity prices in South Australia already being amongst the highest in the world, there is already a strong incentive for people to be careful and judicious in their use of electricity? Will the minister inform the Senate why, if there is already a strong price incentive to reduce electricity—

                <p>
                 Those of us who are very aware of high electricity prices support things such as increases to family tax benefits, increases to pensions and tax breaks for people earning under $80,000 a year. That is what this side of politics supports. What that side of politics supports is a policy that would add to cost-of-living pressures by increasing the tax that Australian households would have to pay by $1,300 a year.
                </p>
                <p>
                 What I was trying to describe before is this simple proposition that, if you have investment uncertainty, that can lead, on the basis of what the industry itself says, to higher prices. I would remind senators of this quote:

                 … it—

                  , I ask a further supplementary question. Will the minister advise the Senate of how it is consistent with Labor's promise to do no more and no less than the rest of the world in terms of carbon pricing for it to actually impose a carbon tax that leaves Australians with, incredibly, the highest electricity prices in the world?

                   The highest effective carbon price is the one that those opposite would impose were they elected, and it would effectively cost $1,300 a year for every household in this country. It would require bureaucracies to dole out money to big polluters and would have little environmental gain, and it would not provide the sort of investment certainty which is required not only across the economy but particularly in the electricity generation sector, where you are looking at investment in long-lived assets. These are the same policy reasons why

                   agreed to put forward a price on carbon and went to the 2007 election promising to do so.

                   got you to say. The reality is that those opposite have no policy credibility.
