        Australia is experiencing its worst housing crisis in generations. Many renters have seen their rents skyrocket by 20 per cent or more in the last year, with no end in sight. Meanwhile, there are more than three million people in Australia who are trying to survive on income support and who just cannot keep up with the cost of food, medicine and housing in a cost-of-living crisis. Labor's budget was tough to hear for these people, who just cannot make ends meet on their poverty payments. Labor's solution was an increase of just $2.85 per day to JobSeeker and youth allowance.

       <p>
        Labor, you have to come to the table and negotiate. It is time for a freeze on rent increases for two years and more funding for public and affordable housing now. Your own advice says that at least $15 billion a year is needed in investment in public and affordable housing. What you're offering is a drop in—
