        is an important step in delivering on Australia’s commitments at the G20 Leaders’ Meeting in London in April 2009.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        While the global recession had its origins in the financial institutions of the United States and Europe, its impacts have been felt right around the world.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The multilateral development banks, such as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Development_Bank" rel="nofollow">
         Asian Development Bank
        </a>
        (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADB" rel="nofollow">
         ADB
        </a>
        ), are playing a critical role in supporting recovery in developing economies and therefore the global economy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_ADB" rel="nofollow">
         The ADB
        </a>
        is also helping to ensure sustained growth and stability in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia_Pacific" rel="nofollow">
         Asia Pacific
        </a>
        region which will benefit Australian exporters and jobs for many years to come.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To ensure the ADB has sufficient capital to support recovery and ongoing sustainable growth in our region, G20 Leaders agreed to support a 200 per cent general capital increase.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The outcomes of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Summit" rel="nofollow">
         London Summit
        </a>
        played an important role in restoring stability to financial markets and restoring economic confidence.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And as we approach the next Leaders’ Summit in Pittsburgh, it is important for G20 members to demonstrate that we are delivering on all of these commitments.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Supporting this Bill will enable Australia to demonstrate its leadership globally, as well as supporting recovery from the global recession in our region.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The purpose of this Bill is to obtain parliamentary approval for Australia to take up its allocated subscription to the fifth general capital increase at the ADB at a cost of around
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        $197.6 million over 10 years.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Under the general capital increase, Australia is entitled to subscribe to an additional 409,480 shares.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Only four per cent of these shares are required to be paid-in.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As a result of the low paid-in component, the annual cost of the subscription will account for a very small part of Australia’s aid program over the ten year payment period.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia’s contribution towards the general capital increase was included as a capital measure in the 2009-10 Budget and will not impact the underlying cash or fiscal balances.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I believe the economic and political significance of the Asia-Pacific region to Australia, and the important developmental role which the Asian Development Bank is playing, both in its immediate response to the global recession and pursuit towards its long-term Strategy 2020, necessitate Australia’s continued support of the Bank.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I commend the Bill.
