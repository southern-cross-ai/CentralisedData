         I thank Senator Seselja for his question and his strong work on the community affairs committee of the Senate. Colleagues may be aware that, on 1 July, the Commonwealth Home Support Program will commence as the entry level service for aged-care services. The Commonwealth Home Support Program will bring together Commonwealth Home and Community Care Program, planned respite from the National Respite for Carers Program, Day Therapy Centres and the Assistance with Care and Housing for the Aged Program into one streamlined program. Under this program around 550,000 older people and their carers will continue to be supported with services such as delivered meals, domestic assistance and support for people with dementia, which is all core business for the CHSP. Providers will benefit from streamlined funding arrangements, less red tape, simplified grant agreements and more time to provide services. Also, older people will benefit from a standardised national assessment process and a single entry point through the My Aged Care gateway.
        </p>
        <p>
         Importantly, the government has announced that CHSP funding agreements will be extended from 30 June 2018 to coincide with the implementation of the 2015 budget measure to merge the CHSP and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Care" rel="nofollow">
          Home Care
         </a>
         Program from July 2018 to create an integrated Home Care Program. The funding announcement through to June 2018 will provide three years of certainty for CHSP providers and more than $1.6 billion annually in funding. It is an important change that will provide some certainty for providers.

           Under changes initiated by the previous government a national mandatory fees policy for CHSP was proposed to bring greater consistency to fee arrangements nationwide. A CHSP national fees policy consultation paper was circulated in March for industry feedback. Having taken on board community feedback, and in light of the planned new
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Care" rel="nofollow">
            Home Care
           </a>
           arrangements from 2018, the government has decided not to proceed with a mandatory CHSP fee schedule from 1 July. Instead, I will look at a fees framework which outlines principles that providers can adopt in setting and implementing their fees, leading to greater consistency and fairness. This will prevent fees from exceeding the cost of the service and ensure that there is a safety net for those who need it. In addition, there will be a national fees guide developed to increase transparency for consumers and providers. I have taken on board in particular the views of volunteers, Meals on Wheels and community transport.

             The changes to the CHSP fees policy have been welcomed by Aged and Community Services Australia, the Combined Pensioners and Superannuants Association and the Community Transport Organisation to name a few. The coalition broadly adopted an essentially bipartisan approach to aged care when in opposition; we lent our support to the then Labor government and the general thrust of their legislation. It is peculiar that the current opposition now seek to criticise the government for making a careful policy decision based on widespread sector feedback. It would not be responsible to implement a policy without regard for the considered views and expertise of service providers and older Australians and, in particular, it would not be good to neglect the views of volunteers, Meals on Wheels providers and people in community transport organisations. Their views should be listened to, and they have been heard.
