           This is a stunt by the opposition designed to frustrate the government's legislative agenda. There is a process in place whereby senators are able to scrutinise legislation by referring it to a committee for inquiry and report. This has happened for the three social services budget related bills that have come before the chamber this week. In addition to individual bills being referred to the Community Affairs Legislation Committee, a Senate select committee to inquire into the effect of changes in the Commonwealth budget has already been established. This is yet another example of the

              I simply note in this motion that there is absolutely no provision for crossbench representation. The motion proposes five senators from the government, the opposition and the Greens but none from the crossbench. For that reason, I will be opposing it and I encourage my fellow crossbench senators to similarly oppose it.
