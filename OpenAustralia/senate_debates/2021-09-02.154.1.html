        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Senator Colbeck. How many days is it since the Morrison-Joyce government failed to meet its own Easter target for vaccinating all—and I emphasise 'all'—aged-care workers?

            Senator Polley, I do take points of order on direct relevance. I called the minister to order at, I think, 12 seconds or 13 seconds, so I'm going to listen to his answer. You've made your point. Yes, Senator Polley?

               And Labor not only are being dishonest in their points of order but are being dishonest in their representation of the issue. We did set ourselves an objective with respect to vaccination of the aged-care workforce, but we received advice from the health professionals that we not vaccinate residents and the workforce at the same time. I've put that information on the table so many times in this chamber. I know that Labor are living in the past, I know that they're only interested in fighting us and not helping us fight the virus, but we received health advice not to vaccinate residents and staff at the same time. We took that advice. We then, through the AHPPC and through national cabinet, set a target date of 17 September for all aged-care workers to have received a first dose. We're on track to meet that target. We will continue to work to that objective. I had a webinar that was open to every aged-care provider and their infection control lead this morning to talk to them about the target and the processes that we were going through, the advice that we could assist them with and the channels that were available to them to get their workforce vaccinated. This is an important measure. We continue to work on it. We are determined to meet our objective and we continue to work cooperatively with the sector and the unions, I might add, in that course. We continue to work to support people in the aged-care sector in Australia.

                 Mr Morrison conceded this week that there were still challenges in the aged-care vaccine rollout. Was Mr Morrison referring to the approximately 60,000 aged-care workers who remain unvaccinated, with the 17 September deadline just weeks away?

                  This is a further example of the Labor Party living in the past—that's very, very old data. We continue to publish the data. It's available on the website. We've actually put on the website every single aged-care facility in this country so people can look and see what the vaccination rates are. That's transparency. That's working with the sector to understand what's going on. That's why I spent time this morning on a webinar open to every aged-care provider in Australia and their infection control lead, to work them through any issues they might have in achieving their objective and our objective.

                     Well, if that's the answer you want, ask the question, Senator. You can't even get your questions right. It's just absurd what the Labor Party are tossing up here at the moment. We continue to work with the sector to get the workers vaccinated. As of this morning, 83.4 per cent of the aged-care sector have had a first dose and 62 per cent have had a second dose.

                       It's on relevance. The question was very clearly whether the minister will guarantee that the government will meet its target. While I'm on my feet, I might also ask if you could review the transcript in relation to the dishonesty point.

                        I will. I'm very happy to, and if I'm wrong I apologise in advance, as I said. With respect to the point of order, that was the second part of the question. I can't instruct the minister to use a word or not. But the first part of the question contained an assertion about a number and a statistic that the minister is challenging. He is entitled to do that and be directly relevant to the question. He's not entitled to stray from the topic, but he is allowed to challenge it. Senator Colbeck.
