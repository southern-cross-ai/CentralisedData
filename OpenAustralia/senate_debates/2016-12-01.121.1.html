        My question is to the Minister for Regional Development and Minister for Regional Communication, Senator Nash. Can the minister update the Senate on the rollout of the coalition government's Mobile Black Spot Program?

         I thank the senator for his question and acknowledge his incredible, longstanding efforts for the people of regional Australia. I am absolutely delighted to stand here today and advise the chamber that this morning, with the Prime Minister, I announced round 2 of the coalition's mobile phone black spot program—a further $60 million invested into expanding our mobile phone black spot program.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is not only the $60 million. With the telecommunications companies and state and territory governments leveraging around an extra $150 million, we have seen a total of $213 million invested into expanding mobile phone coverage across this country. There are 266 new base stations, which is a great achievement. This will provide new or upgraded coverage across rural and regional communities—6,300 homes and businesses will now have new or upgraded coverage—and 17,700 square kilometres across Australia's land now has increased or new mobile phone coverage. We have seen 1,900 kilometres of our major roads now covered and able to get mobile phone coverage. In round 2 we have now addressed 1,400 black spots where we did not have coverage before.

        <p>
         I will take the interjection from Senator Macdonald who said, 'That is just amazing.' Thank you so much, Senator Macdonald. This is a great outcome driven by the coalition and driven initially, I might say, by the Prime Minister as communications minister and continuing to be driven by him as the Prime Minister. We have achieved great outcomes for people in regional Australia.

            One of the great things about this program is that, while we talk about the numbers and the great investment, this is improving and changing the lives of people out on the ground in our communities at places like Mount Chalmers in Queensland, where the

            has made a contribution to a base station to bring mobile coverage to 114 farming, grazing and residential properties—when completed the base station will also provide coverage to the 1,344 vehicles that move through the area on a daily basis—and at places like

            in Queensland between Rockhampton and Gladstone, where the installation of the mobile tower has been a game changer for the local Clarke Creek school. They will now get 4GX mobile broadband service under the program. I have to commend my colleague Michelle Landry, the member for Capricornia, for her tireless work in ensuring that this was delivered.

               I am indeed. I thought that this might best be done by way of a scorecard, because those opposite, the Labor Party, have a very different approach. Black spots being covered by the coalition: 4,400; Labor: zero. The phone towers being delivered by the coalition: 765; those delivered by Labor: zero. Square kilometres of new hand-held coverage delivered by the coalition: 86,300 square kilometres; Labor: zero. Funding delivered under the coalition: $220 million. Colleagues, how many dollars do we think Labor delivered? Zero! They delivered absolutely nothing. It is this coalition that will continue to deliver for the people of regional Australia.
