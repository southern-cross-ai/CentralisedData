        I rise today to speak about the informative Parliamentary Friends of Nutrition event this morning, which I co-convened with the member for Bass. I thank and acknowledge Dietitians Australia, in particular Natalie Stapleton, for their continued work. Today's event was about healthy food for a healthy mind or good nutrition for a better headspace. This is extremely timely because we know that mental health, anxiety and depression are huge issues facing communities across our country. These illnesses must be combatted with multiple strategiesâ€”seeing a psychiatrist or a psychologist, practising mindfulness, potentially medication, exercising, and eating and drinking in a healthy and nutritious way. We know that some people across communities are having to wait up to six months to see a mental health specialist, so implementing at-home strategies before you can see one of those specialists is fundamental to getting well and feeling more like your old self.

        , is acutely aware of the need for greater access to psychologists and psychiatrists. Eating a well-balanced and nutritious diet can improve mood. Studies are now proving that eating more vegetables can actually improve and lift your mood, even for people that have been on antidepressants for years. We know the full benefits that are there for those who change their eating habits. All evidence is now pointing to better gut health as fundamental to protecting you against such diseases as many of our cancers. More fruit and vegetables are crucial to a well-balanced diet. Once again, thank you to Dietitians Australia for what you do each and every day, making Australia healthier.
