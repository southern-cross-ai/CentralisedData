        I move Greens amendment (1) on sheet 5656:

        (1)    Schedule 1, item 6, page 5 (after line 26), after the heading to division 1, insert:

       <p class="italic">
        <b>

        (1)    This Part applies only in respect of attendance at a school in a declared community.

        (2)    The Minister may, by legislative instrument, determine that a community is a
        <b>
         <i>

         </i>
        </b>
        for the purposes of this section.

       <p class="italic">
        (3)    For the purposes of this section, a
        <b>
         <i>
          community
         </i>
        </b>

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b)    a region defined by geographical boundaries with a population not exceeding 10 000 people.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4)    The Minister may determine no more than eight communities to be declared communities for the purposes of this section.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (5)    A determination made under subsection (2) ceases to have effect 12 months after it commences, at which time this Part ceases to apply in respect of that community.

        This amendment relates to the trials as part of this legislation. I also have some questions that I would like to ask the government. Firstly, could the minister tell me if the Social Inclusion Board was consulted about this legislation. If they were, what were their comments and recommendations and did they in fact support the bill?

            Although the minister said this was simple legislation to ensure that all Australian children go to school, and that these were trials—and I will get to the issue of the trials shortly—this is in fact only about children of families on income support. So it is incorrect to say that it is about all Australian children.

              Minister, what you said about this program applying to all Australian children was incorrect, because it only applies to the children of families on income support. I go to the issue of it being simple; in fact, it is very complex, and I need to ask a series of questions to try and work my way through some of the complex issues this legislation throws up. One of those many issues concerns families who have their income suspended. I understand from answers that
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEWR" rel="nofollow">
               DEWR
              </a>
              have previously given during the committee inquiry that, in most cases when people are suspended, they will get their payments restored if they comply within days. Can the minister assure the Senate that, when families do have their income suspended and they then comply within days, they will have their payments reinstated by Centrelink and receive the moneys owed to them within days?

                   Centrelink will make repeated efforts within the 13-week period to ensure that people are actually attending school and that they are brought back into the system forthwith. If it is beyond the 13-week period, their payments will cease.

                    When you talk about Centrelink making efforts to address the truancy issue, my understanding from the committee inquiry is that Centrelink’s job is basically to comply with the information that is passed to them from the education department in either the
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NT" rel="nofollow">

                    </a>
                    or

                    </a>
                    . This is a tool to help the states implement a truancy program or a school re-engagement program. Do the state, the education department and the school continue the engagement with the family or is that passed over to Centrelink?

                                        A lot of the evidence we received during the inquiry indicated that there was a lot of thought that the schools in fact had insufficient resources to adequately implement an attendance strategy. It was suggested that that is why they do not have adequate attendance strategies, because they do not have the resources. What is the government’s intended approach if in fact that is the case and schools do not have adequate resources to implement an attendance strategy?

                                         The advice that I have is that it is primarily a matter of responsibility for the state, or the territory in this case. However, if it can be demonstrated that the parents and the school are doing all they can within the existing resources, there would be no penalty applied.

                                               The normal provisions of truancy arrangements apply—that is, it is the obligation of parents to ensure that children are at school. If a student is reported not to be at school, investigation will be launched as to the reasons. If it can be demonstrated that there are justifiable reasons then no action, of course, would be taken. If it cannot be demonstrated that there are reasonable reasons then the processes would cut in.

                                                I need to ask some questions about reasonable excuses in a minute. Where they are taking reasonable steps but there is a dispute between the school and a family and the school nominates the child anyway, what provisions will Centrelink use to deal with that? I am thinking particularly around, for example, a child missing school because of bullying and the school not acknowledging that as an issue. Believe me, that happens; I know from personal experience. What steps does Centrelink take then to deal with that issue?

                                                 The normal process that would apply would be that discussions would be held between Centrelink and the school authorities and the school itself. If there is an allegation of bullying, that may well in itself constitute a reasonable explanation for why children are not in attendance.

                                                  As I understand it, on the reasonableness of the reason for a child not attending, the school makes that decision. The school then tells Centrelink, and I will get to the steps it takes in a minute. But what opportunity does a parent then get to say, ‘This is the reason’? I understood it was the school doing the reasonableness steps, not Centrelink.

                                                      during the committee inquiry about parents getting help to address some of these issues, because in many of these cases the parents will be aware that their kids are not getting to school and want to start dealing with that, DEEWR indicated that a person can seek support from Centrelink social workers at any time to help them with attendance issues. What is meant by ‘any time’? Does it have to apply to parents once notification has been made? Or, if parents are recognising it as an issue that they need help with, can they go to Centrelink at any time and not have to wait for notification?

You said that there would be a leaflet sent out to people in the trial area, but can people then at any time, if they recognise that there is a pending problem, go into Centrelink and seek help?

                                                            I thank the minister for the answer. I have asked this question before but we have not received a totally satisfactory answer. It is the issue about how the transfer of information from the school to Centrelink is going to be done. I have expressed concern previously that we are being asked to vote on a piece of legislation that has quite serious privacy issues that have not been resolved. We have not to date had an adequate answer about how this is going to happen. Is the school going to be given a list of the people on income support in the area or the students who are at the school whose parents are on income support, or do they provide to Centrelink the names of every child in their school who is playing truant?

It is then the responsibility of Centrelink to determine whether or not that particular student’s parents receive income support. There should be no question of privacy involved because there is not actually a list provided to the school of students whose families are receiving income support through Centrelink.

It is Centrelink that makes the decision as to whether or not that person’s family is actually in receipt of income support. I am advised that if the student’s parents do not receive income support the records on that matter will be destroyed. It is up to Centrelink to make a determination as to whether or not the explanation for the student’s absence is satisfactory.

Attempts will also be made to evaluate attitudinal change and behavioural change within the trial area.

These are trials of a particular technique intending to encourage increased school attendance. It is a punitive approach, a sanctions-based approach. Where are you comparing this approach to a positive approach? Are you, in fact, carrying out the same sorts of trials to measure the positive impacts, which we know actually work? We already know from looking at overseas examples that the punitive approach does not work. Where are you comparing like against like to measure what works best?

That means measuring schools that have poor attendance records against schools that have good attendance records and looking at the reasons why that is the case.

You are not actually comparing this approach to a positive, incentives based approach, which a lot of Australian and overseas evidence shows actually increases school attendance more effectively. I still have a lot of questions but I think I have taken up a great deal of the Senate’s time asking these questions. I note that there are still many unanswered questions around how this trial is going to operate and how it is going to be evaluated. You cannot possibly consider these trials adequate if you are not trialling them against something else, particularly something which we know, from overseas evidence, works better.
                                                                                               </p>

The government said that this is a trial in eight communities—we are being asked to pass the legislation before we know the eighth community—and that it is a trial for 12 months. What this amendment seeks to do is ensure that that is in fact the case, because the legislation at the moment is not based around a trial. It is legislation that can be rolled out across Australia to any community. It could be coming to you anytime. So Greens amendment (1) seeks to actually do what the government says it is doing, which is making this a trial for 12 months.

So this amendment is to put in place a review of the operation of this act to ensure that there is, in fact, a legislative base for a proper review so that we can be assured that any review will be effective.
