        . Labor opposes this bill. This bill was referred to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. The committee received a number of submissions. One submission was from the

         Civil Aviation Safety Authority
        </a>
        of New Zealand. They had the audacity to tell the committee that mutual recognition would lead to harmonisation of safety standards. The

        submission totally repudiated the New Zealand regulator’s view.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill will undermine Australia’s proud aviation safety records and standards. I wish to refer to the flight attendant passenger ratios. Currently in Australia the ratio is one flight attendant for 36 actual passengers. The New Zealand standard is one flight attendant for 50 seats. For the life of me I do not understand how that could improve or harmonise Australia’s safety standards in aviation. I am totally baffled. I do not know what could have been going through the government senators’ minds when these submissions were being put to the committee. I do not know whether or not they plan on being around long enough to keep flying when this bill comes into force, but we will find out in the next round of preselections.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skippers_Aviation" rel="nofollow">
         Skippers Aviation
        </a>
        and the former airline Ansett, I know that you could not get a bunch of better trained people. There is no question of how well trained these flight attendants, pilots and so on are—not only in passenger safety but flight safety. It is a shame that this bill will undermine that.
       </p>
       <p>
        The New Zealand regulator talks about harmonisation, and I want to home in on the word ‘harmonisation’. This harmonisation will see Australian standards lowered; there is no argument about that. It will, without any doubt, see Australian jobs disappear offshore. This harmonisation prohibits sky marshals on aircraft operating under a New Zealand air operators certificate. We know how the Howard government could not wait to seize every opportunity to espouse their professionalism in Australia’s security. That is a huge undermining of our safety.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am afraid that some airlines may manipulate the new rules by servicing Australian domestic routes while operating under New Zealand regulations with lower cost burdens. Labor and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Democrats" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        senators recommend that the bill be opposed in the absence of a comparative assessment of safety standards, a full regulatory analysis of the two systems, and a detailed analysis of the cost and the benefits of the proposed regime.
       </p>
       <p>
        When you combine this bill with the Howard government’s
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_Choices" rel="nofollow">

        legislation, we have a recipe to gut the standards of Australia’s aviation industry. Australia’s air safety standards are not a commodity that is for sale—and should not be, under any circumstances. Labor opposes this bill. If any senator in this place has any concern about air safety and about maintaining our standards in this country, they should follow the

         . This bill takes into account the 2004 recommendations of the majority report of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee.
        </p>
        <p>
         Mutual recognition is restricted to air operators certificates issued by the Australian

        <p>
         The mutual recognition initiative is a major step forward in the trans-Tasman aviation market. It marks a historic development in the aviation relationship and is consistent with commitments between the Australian and New Zealand governments. Mutual recognition will provide administrative savings to airlines, and these savings may be passed on to passengers. Most importantly, there will be no effect on the safety of aircraft operations in either Australia or New Zealand by its introduction.
