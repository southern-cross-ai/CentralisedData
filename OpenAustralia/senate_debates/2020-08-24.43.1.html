            , I'll note that wasn't the full answer to my question. I did ask for the national figure. Perhaps the minister could update that as he also answers this: how many aged-care residential facilities have now recorded more than 100 cases?

             On the figures that I have, the only facilities with a current outbreak are in Victoria. That is the national figure of facilities with a national outbreak. I don't have an individual breakdown of all facilities with me at question time here now. I'm very happy to bring back to you an answer to that question. But I don't believe there is any facility that has more than 100 residents that are positive. I'll confirm that at the end of the question time for you.

                    That was just my point. That was absolutely not a point of order. It was a political point. If Senator Keneally has the answer at her fingertips because she of course knew the question that she was going to ask, why did she ask it if not for anything other than just playing politics with what is a very serious issue? She should be ashamed of herself.

                      This is a very serious issue. This involves the deaths of too many Australians, and it is entirely appropriate that the opposition ask this minister questions which go to his handling of this crisis. That is what the opposition is doing and that is what the opposition will continue to do.

                       Firstly, on Senator Keneally's point of order: Senator Keneally, you know better—that wasn't a point of order. I remind senators that, when they rise on a point of order, they have to point to the standing order they believe is being breached. It's not up to me or the Chair to go to the motives of anyone seeking an answer to a question in question time. I have allowed the two leaders to make observations on that point. I urge senators to remember the standing orders when they're asking and answering questions or raising points of order.

                        As I said, there are 126 facilities in Victoria with an active case right now. I don't have a full list of all those 126 facilities with me, but I have committed to getting back to Senator Keneally and the chamber at the end of question time with the details that she's asked for.
