           I thank the Senate. The government will not support this motion in its current form. As has been stated on previous occasions, the government objects to using formal motions to deal with complex international matters, particularly those involving other governments. This motion in its current form is unbalanced and fails to recognise Israel’s genuine security concerns. The motion is also outdated; the government’s latest advice is that the Israeli government has relaxed restrictions on a number of items listed in the motion. Australia has already made its views on the

            Gaza blockade
           </a>
           clear with both the Australian public and the international community. We have consistently registered our deep concern over the humanitarian situation in Gaza. We have called on a number of occasions for Gaza border controls to be eased for the purpose of the delivery of humanitarian supplies and aid. We have expressed this view in both the

              and various other places, including in public, but not here in the Senate. It seems as if this Labor Party—which is now on a course of attacking the Senate, as we have heard from the Prime Minister and several others in recent days—believes that the Senate is an obstruction to the discourse that should be fostered in a democratic nation like ours.
             </p>
             <p>
              Senator Xenophon drew up this motion and I have been very pleased to co-host it. It simply calls for the Senate to note that there is an Israeli blockade of essential goods to the people of Gaza and to express its concern for the social, humanitarian and economic impact of that blockade. The government, including the Prime Minister, have expressed publicly their opposition to that blockade, but when it comes to the Senate they disassemble and go weak-kneed. They seem to be affronted by the Senate debating issues of the day which affect all Australians. All Australians watched with horror at nine people being gunned down by the Israeli forces that took over the boat bringing aid to Gaza a couple of weeks ago. There was general horror and revulsion around this country at what happened there. This motion does not go to that matter. It simply expresses concern about the blockade and the government says, ‘We can’t have the Senate expressing concern.’ What do you think the people of Australia think about this? It is time you got a bit of backbone.
