         Thank you to Senator Colbeck for the question. It might not surprise him that I do not appear to have any advice in the chamber on this issue, which is obviously an issue of concern to him. I assume it is an issue of interest in the Tasmanian election; hence it is being asked today. In any event, regardless of why, I will seek advice from the minister for the environment on the issue and come back to the Senate.

           I am not sure about Prime Minister Rudd making any decisions, Senator Colbeck. I am not sure whether the question relates to the Prime Minister or whether the senator is referring to the Minister for the Environment Protection, Heritage and the Arts. Obviously I will obtain further advice on the issue. As I understand the question, though, it seems to relate to whether or not the government have delivered a coalition policy. It seems to be rather odd that I am being asked in this representing portfolio whether or not we, in fact, have delivered your policy. It was not asked of me whether or not we had delivered our policy.

                   to Senator Colbeck, to Caring for our Country decisions—decisions made under that program by Ministers Garrett and Burke—there are occasions in which money is reallocated on advice in order to obtain the best environmental outcome for the funds which are expended. I am sure those issues would have been at the forefront of the minister’s mind if that were, in fact, the decision made. As I have previously said, I will obtain advice and inform the Senate of the same.
