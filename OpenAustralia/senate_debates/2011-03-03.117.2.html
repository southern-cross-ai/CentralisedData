The Government has agreed to put in place a nationally common structure with consistent definitions. This structure was published in January 2011 with the agreement of education authorities.

           The Government does not agree to release original applications as they pre-date detailed tendering and procurement processes and buildings were not designed or costed in detail at that point.

           The committee majority recommends strengthening accountability mechanisms for oversight of state expenditure of Commonwealth money.
