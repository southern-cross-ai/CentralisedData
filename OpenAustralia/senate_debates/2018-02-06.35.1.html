        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Cormann. I refer to the Prime Minister's statement of 20 March 2017 affirming his government's commitment to multiculturalism, saying:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We are a richly diverse nation, and have flourished with waves of migration. This cultural diversity is one of our greatest assets.
       </p>
       <p>
        The newest Liberal senator, Senator Molan, has refused to apologise for propagating racist, bigoted posts from white supremacist organisation Britain First. When will the Prime Minister break his silence, show some leadership and call on Senator Molan to apologise for undermining one of Australia's greatest assets?

         Firstly, I've got to again correct Senator Cameron. Our distinguished addition to the Senate Liberal team, Senator Molan, is not the newest Liberal senator. The newest Liberal senator is actually Senator Lucy Gichuhi, who is of course a great demonstration of the multicultural richness of the great Australian nation. And, dare I say, Senator Wong and I are examples, in our own way, of the great multicultural diversity that makes up Australia. Of course I endorse the comments of the Prime Minister wholeheartedly. I know that Senator Molan—a great Australian who's provided outstanding public service to Australia in his capacity as a general in the defence forces—of course supports those remarks by the Prime Minister as well. Senator Molan handled the attack by Senator Cameron very eloquently yesterday. I think that he is strong enough to speak for himself, and I think he did so very well yesterday.

           When confronted on radio this morning about his propagating of fake, bigoted videos, Senator Molan refused to resile from his actions. Yet the Prime Minister has said nothing. When will this Prime Minister come out of hiding and show some leadership?

            I don't really have anything to add to my previous answer. What I would say is that our commitment to multicultural Australia is there for all to see; the Prime Minister's commitment is there for all to see. Senator Molan explained himself extremely well yesterday. This has just proved that Labor doesn't have anything to say about the economy and jobs. This is a Labor Party that is casting around for distractions because they haven't got anything to say about how we can ensure—

                    Order! Senator Wong, across the table there have been a number of comments about points of order not actually being matters of points of order but political debate. I think, Senator Wong, on that occasion that point you raised was not a point of order. I don't consider what was just said to be a reflection on a senator with the words used, if I'm correct on that, because it did not specify a person, or was not directed at a person. This is a matter for obvious debate. It is not a matter for points of order. Senator Cormann, did you want to continue your answer?

                     I reject absolutely any suggestion that Senator Molan is what Senator Cameron alleged. Senator Molan, as I have indicated, is a great Australian. He explained himself appropriately yesterday. There is nothing really further to add.

The Prime Minister always very carefully considers the advice of all of the intelligence and security agencies, and I know for a fact that he's very mindful of that particular advice that Senator Cameron referenced.

                         , Senator Molan, has previously called for a ban on Islamic immigration and the suspension of habeas corpus, the longstanding right to trial before detention. Now he defends sharing white supremacist material on social media by saying that he's not a racist, because he's lived overseas and, in his own words, 'he ran the war in Iraq'. That, of course, includes responsibility for the assault on Fallujah, the assault that resulted in a humanitarian catastrophe with civilians denied food, water, and aid. Minister, why have you adopted a lower standard than our allies, who universally condemned the President of the United States of America for sharing similar material?

                                            Minister, the 2003 invasion of Iraq is seen almost universally as a humanitarian, legal, political and strategic disaster. Now that we've learned that the Australian chief of operations for coalition forces during the Iraq war holds such repugnant and extreme views, isn't it finally time to follow the

                                             I want to note for the record that Senator Molan, not making his first speech, in the chamber last night made some remarks on the record in relation to the issue of contention that Senator

                                             has made. In relation to Senator Di Natale's further question, that has been discussed at length in this chamber and in the other chamber, for that matter, and the resolution of both has on previous occasions been no.

We have members of the ADF—men and women of the ADF—currently engaged in the Middle East, prosecuting the case against violent extremism and terrorist organisations who seek to use men, women and children as their defensive tool, and some people in this chamber excuse that sort of behaviour.
