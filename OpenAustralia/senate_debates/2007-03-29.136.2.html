       <p class="italic">
        Agreed.  The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet proposes to review and update the chapter in the Legislation Handbook which sets out the requirements for preparing an explanatory memorandum.  It is intended that the chapter will provide examples of the types of matters of interest to the committee.

         Recommendation
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that information relevant to the preparation of explanatory memoranda currently contained in the Legislation Handbook, Legislation Circulars and

        <b>
         Response
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Agreed in principle.  As part of the review of the Legislation Handbook, it is proposed that the chapter on preparing explanatory memoranda be rewritten to include matters raised in Legislation Circular No. 7 of 2003.  Legislation Circulars are a useful mechanism for providing current information to departments.  Material found in OPC Drafting Directions would be drawn on to the extent that inclusion in the Legislation Handbook would be of continuing assistance to instructing departments.  The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet would welcome periodic input to the Legislation Circulars from the committee or the secretariat to the committee about ways to improve the standard of explanatory memoranda.

       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Recommendation
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that, before a bill is introduced into the Parliament, an appropriately qualified person should check the explanatory memorandum accompanying that bill to ensure it explains fully the effect and operation of the proposed legislation and complies with the requirements contained in the Legislation Handbook, as amended.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Response
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Agreed.  Explanatory memoranda should, wherever possible, provide a clear, accurate and complete explanation of measures included in a bill and address matters covered in the committee’s terms of reference.  Responsibility for ensuring that this requirement is met resides with each agency.  The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet will take the opportunity of the review of the Legislation Handbook to remind departments of the need for explanatory memoranda to be checked by an appropriately qualified senior executive officer before being submitted to the relevant minister for approval.

         Recommendation

       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that consideration be given to developing a course to train departmental officers in the preparation of explanatory memoranda.

       <p class="italic">
        Not agreed at this stage.  The government considers that the changes agreed to in response to the committee’s report will result in an improvement in the quality of explanatory memoranda.  Consideration will be given to this recommendation should standards not improve.

         Recommendation 1
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In recognition of the growing importance of the Australia-Republic of Korea defence relationship, the committee suggests that Defence continues to explore opportunities to enhance participation in bilateral defence exercises.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia values our bilateral defence relationship with the Republic of Korea, which has deepened in recent years, as illustrated by the visit to Australia by Defence Minister Mr Yoon Kwang-ung, in June 2005 and then Defence Minister Hill’s visit to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea" rel="nofollow">
         South Korea
        </a>
        in October 2005.  We also conduct regular senior level discussions with South Korea and the most recent political-military talks were held in Seoul in August 2006. While there currently are no plans to engage in major joint military exercises, our shared strategic interests in the Asia-Pacific region provide a firm basis for developing practical cooperation in areas of mutual benefit – particularly in the fields of peace operations, consequence management, defence science, professional exchanges and industry cooperation. A mechanism for sharing classified information with South Korea is being developed to facilitate activities such as these.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As a first step in deepening our cooperation, we have indicated that we would welcome increased
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korean" rel="nofollow">
         South Korean
        </a>
        participation on our training courses, as we are conscious of the value that the Republic of Korea’s experience would bring to these courses. Invitations have been extended to a number of courses include the International Peace Operations Seminar, the Military Observers Course, and the Defence Management Seminar.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        South Korea has indicated a willingness to increase defence capability cooperation in areas such as our respective advanced Destroyer and

         Airborne Early Warning
        </a>
        and Control programs.  We are pursuing opportunities to engage in lessons learnt exchanges in these and other material programs. In the longer term, we will seek to identify opportunities to further increase our practical defence engagement with South Korea.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

         Recommendation 2
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        At the first opportunity, the Australia-
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
         Korea Foundation
        </a>
        ensure its board membership includes more members with an intimate knowledge of Korean society and culture.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Following head-of-government-level visits in 1988-89, the Governments of Australia and the Republic of Korea agreed to establish a group of influential members from the business, academic, cultural and media sectors of Australia and Korea to identify new directions and areas of cooperation in the relationship between the two countries. The group - the Australia-Korea Forum - subsequently met in Canberra and in Sydney and brought down a series of recommendations aimed at broadening and strengthening bilateral ties, including a recommendation that each side establish a foundation to promote the relationship.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The function of the Australia-Korea Foundation Board was initially set-out by an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order" rel="nofollow">
         Executive Order
        </a>
        -in-Council in May 1992, with the Board’s current statement of objectives being:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         to promote within Korea an increased understanding of contemporary Australia and its importance to Korea, as well as of its history, culture, traditions and languages, particularly through targeted educational and media activities;
        </li>
        <li>
         to develop within Australia a better appreciation of contemporary Korea and its importance to Australia, and to promote understanding of Korean traditional society, culture, history and language especially through educational initiatives, media activities and the promotion of Korean language studies;
        </li>
        <li>
         to promote better understanding and more extensive discussion of mutual economic and foreign policy interests between Australia and Korea, and to encourage the development of closer associations between Australian and Korean business;
        </li>
        <li>
         to foster opportunities for increased collaboration between Australia and Korea in industry, science and technology through greater mutual awareness and through collaborative ventures; and
        </li>
        <li>
         to present Australia to the Korean people as a nation capable of outstanding creative and innovative achievement in cultural and artistic spheres, and a source of high quality productions in these areas.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        To meet these objectives, the Australia-Korea Foundation is governed by a Board consisting of nine part-time members, assisted by a secretariat located within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chairman" rel="nofollow">
         The Chairman
        </a>
        is appointed by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Board members are appointed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Board meets three to four times annually to consider policy directions, and to decide on projects and grants.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Board members are drawn from a diverse cross section of the Australian community. All Board members are highly experienced in their respective fields, which include commerce, industry, tourism, science, technology, arts, media and sport. Board members are chosen on the basis of their standing in the community, their understanding of Korean culture and affairs, and their ability to contribute to the development of exchanges and understanding in their areas of expertise. Board members not only need a comprehensive understanding of modern Korea, but also the ability to project Australian values and interests. In addition to the knowledge, expertise and initiative that board members bring to Foundation, most Board members also travel regularly to Korea (generally, at least annually), which has proved useful in fostering and maintaining a contemporary knowledge of the country.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Board is an outcomes-focussed institution, with a consistent track record of meeting or exceeding its objectives. Crucial to this achievement is the Board’s ability to harness each individual member’s experience and skills in their own professional field and frame this against the greater collective understanding.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Where vacancies on the Board appear in the future, knowledge of Korea and its society will continue to be used as key criteria to identify and select successful candidates.

         Recommendation 3
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade provide all possible assistance, via organisations such as the Overseas Korean Traders Association, to small businesses exporting or wishing to export to the Republic of Korea.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Austrade assisted 257 companies to make export sales to Korea in 2005-06 including 70 companies which made their first ever export sale.  The majority of these companies are small and medium sized businesses. Austrade provided services to 77 Korean-Australian clients, resulting in export success for 62 companies, including 24 first time exporters.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Austrade Seoul has a clear strategy for servicing small and medium sized exporters in the Korean-Australian community and has regularly conducted both formal seminars and more regular informal meetings with members of these groups over the last four years.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The first seminar series was held in August 2003 in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne.  The most recent of these multi-city promotions was held in June 2006 in Brisbane, Sydney and Adelaide.  Members of the Overseas Korean Traders Association (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKTA" rel="nofollow">
         OKTA
        </a>
        ) have attended these events, all of which included information on Austrade’s services and how to access the Export Market Development Grant (EMDG) scheme from Austrade specialists in this area.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Austrade Seoul has also been in touch with local Korean language press and

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Austrade will continue to work closely with local Korean business organisations and current and potential exporters to assist in international business activities.

        <b>
         Recommendation 4
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In the event of the Commonwealth Government commencing free trade agreement negotiations with the Republic of Korea, Australian cultural industries (as well as Korean cultural industries) be protected, and issues relating to agriculture be determined at an early stage of negotiations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government pursues a combined multilateral, regional and bilateral approach to trade policy.  This means that Australia is open to concluding regional or bilateral agreements that deliver substantial gains to Australia which cannot be achieved in a similar timeframe through the multilateral system.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government examines Free Trade Agreement (FTA) proposals against clear criteria.  FTAs should:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         have the potential to deliver substantial commercial and wider economic benefits to Australia in a shorter timeframe than multilateral trade negotiations;
        </li>
        <li>
         be fully consistent with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organisation" rel="nofollow">

        </li>
        <li>
         be comprehensive, delivering substantial liberalisation across goods, services and investment, with all sectors considered at the start of the negotiations; and
        </li>
        <li>
         significantly enhance Australia's broader economic, foreign policy and strategic interests.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Comprehensive free trade agreements can complement and give momentum to our wider multilateral trade objectives.  Australia expects that any progress in regional trade liberalisation should be multilateralised, in due course, through WTO negotiations.

        Australia believes that it is important that FTAs contribute to the multilateral system. Ensuring that FTAs meet WTO rules and procedures that apply to these agreements is one of the best ways to achieve this.  Australia is an active participant in the WTO Doha Round of negotiations which, inter alia, claim to clarify and strengthen these rules.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Against these criteria, any FTA that Australia would seek to negotiate with Korea would need to be comprehensive and deliver substantial liberalisation across all goods, services and investment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The agreement would cover trade impacting on both Australian and Korean cultural industries. Such coverage would help maximise the gains to both countries, and add to the cultural and social understanding between each country. We do not envisage any particular sensitivities with respect to each other’s cultural sectors.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Korean agricultural sector is heavily protected and enjoys considerable political support.  As a consequence, Korea’s approach to agricultural trade and its sensitivity over its rural industries is well understood.  These sensitivities would need to be balanced against Australia’s agricultural interests and our need for a comprehensive agreement.
