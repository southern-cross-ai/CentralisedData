        My question is to the minister representing the Minister for Industry and Science, Senator Farrell. Is the minister aware of reports today that the Space Industry Association of Australia is asserting that there has been no substantial engagement with the space industry by any ministerial office in Canberra, that the space policy is in a vacuum and that critical national space infrastructure projects totalling $2.5 billion are stalled on departmental desks? It appears to many that space has fallen through the cracks in Canberra. Can the minister reconcile his government's reported neglect of Australia's strategic and economic importance of the space industry with the government's stated commitment to the industry sector?

         , Senator! You know all about what the Malinauskas government are doing in South Australia, and what the Albanese government are doing nationally on this issue. We're revitalising the space industry, which was left to wallow for 10 years under your former government.

I was recently in the United States and I met with a company that's looking to build a new space station at Port Lincoln. The idea of this space station—you'll like this—is that it's a centrifuge, and it spins around and around and around and fires a rocket up into space. Instead of costing—

              I thank the minister for his very comprehensive answer. Arising from that answer, I ask him to explain the Space Industry Association of Australia's revelation that no space industry representative was invited to the government's Jobs and Skills Summit last week, despite the sector employing more than 10,000 workers and contributing billions to the national economy.

               I can't quite work out the senator's line of questioning here. Either this government is doing something about the space industry and is therefore creating all those jobs or it's not. But you can't have it both ways, with due respect, Senator. The reality is that, as a young man, I can remember rockets being fired at Woomera in
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">

                  McLachlan
                 </a>
                 which did go in particular to why the government did not invite representatives of the space industry to the Jobs and Skills Summit. I find it hard to understand how Senator Farrell's recollections of what was happening at Woomera when he was a young man have any bearing whatsoever on the invitation list for the Jobs and Skills Summit.
