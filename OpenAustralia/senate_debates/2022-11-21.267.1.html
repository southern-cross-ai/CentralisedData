        2 Application of amendments
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The amendments made by this Schedule apply to a person who makes an application for a jobseeker payment on or after the commencement of this Schedule.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will speak about amendments (3), (5) and (6) and my other two amendments so that we don't take up too much time. But I flag that if we do get to vote on (3), (5) and (6) that we won't require a division on them.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I foreshadowed in my speech, we have a suite of substantial amendments for this bill. They pick up on the fact that while this bill makes very welcome changes to enable age pensioners to earn more it does not do the same for other income support recipients who are on lower rates of payment. Aged pensioners struggle to survive, particularly if they're in private rental on the pension rate. Imagine then, if they're struggling, that people on income support, who are on considerably less, are also struggling. Our amendments seek to address both of those issues.
       </p>
       <p>
        Amendment (2) is critical and core to this bill. It says: 'Okay, great, increase the work bonus for age pensioners. We want to see that work bonus extended to other income support recipients, including JobSeeker and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSP" rel="nofollow">
         DSP
        </a>
        recipients.'
       </p>
       <p>
        We know that all working age social security payments are below the Henderson poverty line. The Greens's choice is that we should be legislating to be increasing them all to above $88 a day. The very least that we need to be doing is to be allowing all income support recipients to have the same benefits that are being proposed for age pensioners in this bill, to enable them to earn more. As I said in my second reading contribution, at the moment the amount that somebody on JobSeeker is able to earn before their JobSeeker payments get slashed is $1,000 in the equivalent of the work bonus and work credit, whereas this bill is allowing age pensioners to be earning $11,800, and yet it's a double whammy because people on JobSeeker only get that $48 a day compared with $73 a day for the age pension. That's the rationale behind item 2 of our amendments.
       </p>
       <p>
        Item 3 is to provide earlier access to the age pension. We have increasingly got people who have worked hard all their lives and who up until when it was changed were able to access the age pension at the age of 65. They are now having to wait until the age 67, and we know that people approaching retirement age often have limited capacity to continue working, particularly if they've been working in heavy labour jobs and are desperate because they're no longer able to work. They're stuck on JobSeeker and are not able to access the age pension, despite the fact that the likelihood of them getting work and being able to work is very, very low. We feel that reducing the age for the age pension back down to 65 would really benefit these people.
       </p>
       <p>
        Item 4 of the amendments I've moved is to be raising the rate of income support above the poverty line for everybody, and that's in line with our Greens policy of moving towards a guaranteed livable income so that everybody on income support is able to access the money that they need in order to be able to live and not to be living in poverty. We can afford it, just as we seemingly can afford $250 billion of the stage 3 tax cuts. Instead of giving that money to the very wealthy in our society—income tax cuts that every one of us in this place will benefit from to the tune of $11,000 a year—instead of going ahead with the stage 3 tax cuts, we could actually spend the money to lift people out of poverty. We know that, by increasing the amount of income support, it actually enables people to get themselves back on their feet and enables them to seek work. It puts them in a position to seek work because if you are homeless, if you are starving, if you suffer from malnutrition, if you can't afford the medical care you need, you are not in a good place to be able to get work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Item 5 is to abolish mutual obligations. Again, we know that these are punitive conditional measure, and they don't help people who are trying to survive on a payment rate that's way below the poverty line. We know that mutual obligations are costing us a huge amount of money and achieving nothing, so let's abolish mutual obligations. We saw during the COVID pandemic, when mutual obligations were abolished, that more of the people on income support and the people on JobSeeker were seeking work. They were in a position seek work, not because they had to go and apply for their 20 jobs a week and to be jumping through the hoops of their employment agencies but because getting rid of those punitive obligations actually freed them up to be doing meaningful work. Also, they had double their normal income, which put them in a position to be looking for work. The final amendment I moved is to lower the age of qualification for JobSeeker from 22 to 18 years old, which is in line with advocacy from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Union" rel="nofollow">
         National Union
        </a>
        of Students and the Foundation for Young Australians, which called on the government to address the gaps faced by people aged 18 to 22 years who are trying to access income support. Given the time, I will leave my contribution there at this stage.
