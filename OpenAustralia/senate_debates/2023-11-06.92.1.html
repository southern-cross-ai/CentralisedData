        My question is to the Minister for Emergency Management, Senator Watt. Minister, for the past few weeks I, like many Australians, have been monitoring the increasing fire activity across Queensland, particularly the devastating fire on the Western Downs, but also of course closer to home in north-west Queensland. Can the minister update the Senate on current conditions and what the Albanese government is doing to support these impacted communities during this challenging time?

         Thanks, Senator Green; I know that you have been taking a great interest in those fires happening across Queensland.
        </p>
        <p>
         I'll start by again acknowledging the tragic deaths of three personnel in a plane crash while undertaking

         </a>
         -tasked line-scanning over the weekend, as well as the two people who died in the fires in Queensland last week. I extend my condolences to all who are grieving these tragic losses. It's a stark and devastating reminder of the danger we are facing this summer. Today, we're seeing a reprieve in conditions across Queensland ahead of extreme fire danger in parts of the state for the rest of the week, with eight fires currently burning at an advice level.
        </p>
        <p>
         The worst of the fire activity was around Tara, where more than 30,000 hectares has been burned. It's reported that numerous structures have been destroyed and damaged across the state; the full extent will only become known when damage assessments are completed. On Tuesday last week I travelled to Dalby to understand the full extent of the impact. While I was there I met with the mayor and deputy mayor, and received a briefing from local authorities. I also visited the evacuation centre and met with evacuees, as well as with representatives from housing support and a range of government and non-government services, who are doing a fantastic job of looking after people who have been displaced. We are in lockstep across all three levels of government in our support for these impacted communities.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Albanese government quickly activated the Australian government disaster recovery payment and the disaster recovery allowance. That has been open for people who live and work in the Western Downs and Toowoomba local government areas. The AGDRP is a one-off payment of $1,000 per eligible adult and $400 per eligible child who have suffered a significant loss as a result of the fires, including a severely damaged or destroyed home or a serious injury. The disaster recovery allowance provides up to 13 weeks of federal income support to assist eligible employees or sole traders who experience a loss of income as a result of the disaster.

As of a short time ago, there was one fire burning at a 'watch and act' level in Western Australia, with all other fires across the country burning at the 'advice' level or below. We're working with all state and territory governments to provide the support that they need to help the communities. In New South Wales, we've activated financial support for the local government areas of

               Since the election of the Albanese government, we've been taking many steps to ensure that Australia is much better prepared for natural disasters than we have been in the past. We've created one unified National Emergency Management Agency, rather than having the two that existed under the former government. We've created the Disaster Ready Fund, which is already investing in disaster mitigation across the country. I'm pleased to say that, a bit over a week ago, I joined with the member for Boothby in
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                South Australia
               </a>
               to announce Humanihut as the supplier of mobile emergency shelter camps. This is a key component of what will be the first ever National Emergency Management Stockpile. This capability will support the stockpile needs of states and territories. It will have three main components. The first is a physical stockpile, including, as I say, temporary housing but also, over time, things like water purification equipment and other needs. There will be a standing offer panel to be able to meet needs urgently, and we'll be entering into a memorandum of understanding with governments as well. It will provide reliable, readily deployable life-sustaining resources for communities.
