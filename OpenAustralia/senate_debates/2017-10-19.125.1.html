         's question and the briefing that Defence has provided to Senator McCarthy on this particular matter. We have a number of investigations under way across Australia—in excess of 18 at this stage. I don't have with me the date on which I was advised in relation to Katherine, but this is a very comprehensive environmental investigation program across the country, as you know. Local communities are advised as the testing is to commence in their particular area and that starts to take place.

        <p>
         In relation to matters concerning water, Defence has worked closely with Northern Territory Power and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Corporation" rel="nofollow">
          Water Corporation
         </a>
         and the Northern Territory government. In fact, I released a media statement with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Minister" rel="nofollow">
          Chief Minister
         </a>

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PFAS" rel="nofollow">
          PFAS

          ECT
         </a>
         2 water treatment plant to help reduce the amount of PFAS in the Katherine town water supply. That plant arrived in Katherine in late September and is expected to be operational at the end of this month. It's being installed, tested and so on to ensure that it can get that work underway. Its role is to treat PFAS-affected bore water prior to being blended with river water to generate the town water supply. That's obviously particularly relevant in the dry season, as you would be well aware. It will filter PFAS from the bore water before it enters the purification and blending process in the Power and Water Corporation's water treatment plant. It will be capable of processing the majority of bore water currently required for the town water supply. Importantly, the average PFAS levels in the supply remain below the

           Williamtown and Oakey residents have been able to access federally funded blood testing to determine

            PFAS

            As I think the senator is aware from her briefing—but, if not, we can augment that—the processes in Williamtown and in Oakey in relation to the human health risk assessment, the ecological risk assessment and the environmental risk assessment were completed, and then assessments were made by the health authorities—not by Defence—in relation to the provision of blood tests. Defence does not hold itself out as a health expert in this matter at all. We take our advice from the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Medical_Officer" rel="nofollow">
             Chief Medical Officer
            </a>
            and the teams in Health.
           </p>
           <p>
            I understand the concerns that are there in the community. They're not just there in Katherine, as you know; they're there in Williamtown, and they're there in Oakey. We are working very hard to ensure that we have the broadest possible environmental investigations to provide the information that we need to make those assessments. Once we better understand the extent of the contamination and, most particularly, the exposure pathways in relation to
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PFAS" rel="nofollow">
             PFAS
            </a>
            , then the health experts will be in a better position to consider the expansion of the voluntary blood-testing program.

               When the data is available, Senator McCarthy. I don't have in front of me the completion date for the Katherine testing, but it has been underway for some months now, so it will probably take, I would have thought, until towards the end of this year for the completion of that. But, when that data is available, the health experts will make the assessment on whether and how, if that is appropriate, blood testing is made available.
              </p>
              <p>
               It's important to note, I think, that the expansion of the voluntary blood-testing program, the epidemiological study itself, needs to be based on scientific fact and on the scientific evidence that is achieved through the testing process. That is what we are pursuing at the moment, not just in Katherine, frankly, but in a number of other areas, as your counterparts in other chambers also know because their electorates are also impacted. This is a legacy problem, not just for Defence and not just for Australia. It is an enormous undertaking; in fact, I think the largest in the world currently.
