        I seek leave to move a motion to vary the routine of business for today.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave not granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        Pursuant to contingent notice, I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That so much of standing orders be suspended as would prevent me moving a motion to provide for the conduct of business, namely a motion relating to the consideration of government business order of the day No. 3.
       </p>
       <p>
        The issue that the Senate faces on this final day is to deal with some important legislation. The important legislation that we want to see dealt with today is the legislation that will deal with temporary protection visas. It is legislation that will actually help get people and children out of detention to face an appropriate Christmas. Keeping in mind that people in the case load of which we speak are not people that have come to Australia courtesy of coalition policy, but courtesy of the legacy issues that we are still trying to clean up on this side.
       </p>
       <p>
        I simply say this, especially to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Labor Party
        </a>
        and the Greens who might oppose this motion: do they really want children and others in detention over the Christmas period or would they want this issue to in fact be resolved? Here they have a very real opportunity to assist in providing some legislation that undoubtedly is within the best interests of our country and especially in the best interests of that 30,000 case load legacy that the Australian Labor Party and the Greens have left us.
       </p>
       <p>
        That is all we seek. It is a relatively modest request for and on behalf of the government to at least complete business order of the day No. 3, Migration and Maritime Powers Legislation Amendment (Resolving the Asylum Legacy Caseload) Bill 2014. That is the issue that we want to deal with before we rise for the Christmas break. We believe it is an appropriate measure, it is a humanitarian measure and it is good all around. I trust that the Labor Party and Greens will see it within themselves to expedite this legislation so that we can deal with it in a manner that is expeditious and then allows us to break for the rest of the year.

         (Australian Labor Party, Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) |
         <a href="http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;adv=yes;orderBy=_fragment_number,doc_date-rev;page=0;query=Dataset%3Ahansards,hansards80%20Date%3A4%2F12%2F2014;rec=0;resCount=Default" title="The source of this piece of text">

         </a>
        </small>
        <p>
         The first point I wish to make is to place on record not only our disappointment but also our opposition to having a discussion about children in detention used in order to further the government's attempt to rearrange the business here in the Senate. It should be very clear to everybody that if the minister, Mr Morrison, chose to allow children to leave detention, he could do so. He could do so today; in fact, he could have done it yesterday.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Madigan hit the nail on the head after a profoundly important question, where he also put to Minister Cash that it was not an appropriate thing, it was not a compassionate thing and it was not a principled thing to use the issue of children in detention to try to gain some advantage for a Senate program. I want to associate myself with the sentiment that was expressed by Senator Madigan.
        </p>
        <p>
         But this is not a debate about the substantive bill. This is a debate about whether this government can suspend standing orders in order to move a motion about the hours that the Senate should sit and about the bills that the Senate should consider. I want to, in the brief time I have, just remind the Senate of the history of the way in which this government has run this chamber.
        </p>
        <p>
         As I previously indicated, I wrote to Senator Abetz on the Monday of last week. I asked him for an indication from the government as to what were their priority bills, I asked him for an indication as to what additional time would be required and I asked him for an indication of how they wanted to structure this last week and whether any additional sitting days would be required. I did not get a reply to that.
        </p>
        <p>
         A week later, along with every other leader and whip in this place, I got an invitation to Senator Abetz's office. It was very nice office. We all sat around a table. We had three meetings. In each of the three meetings, Senator Abetz's indication to us about what his priority legislation would be was changed. It changed depending on, as he said, 'It depends whether we have got the numbers. It depends what happens. We have to have a discussion.' He also refused on Monday to tell us what additional hours were required.
        </p>
        <p>
         Now, because of that frankly chaotic management of the chamber, his solution is to come in here after question time on Thursday and to up-end standing orders in order for him to be able to now move a motion, because he has finally decided which bills are actually priority and what the hours should be. We had the Manager of Government Business in this place lodging a motion yesterday that will require, if passed, the Senate to sit every day—tomorrow and over the weekend—until a range of bills were passed. That was lodged without notice to anybody. We had three meetings on Monday where you might have raised this, but you do not want to talk to anybody about how long you want the Senate to sit. You do not ever want to even approach the opposition—I do not know if you approached the crossbenchers before you lodged that motion—and say, 'Look, we would like to discuss how we might rearrange things et cetera'. No, there was nothing like that. We had a chat in Senator Abetz's office three times on Monday where none of this was discussed, and then we get lobbed with a motion, put in yesterday without notice, that the Senate is going to sit every day of the weekend for a whole bunch of bills in order to get legislation passed.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Abetz also put out a press release talking about the Mr Fluffy asbestos issue, trying to suggest that we have to sit to deal with that, when I told him on Monday that we would do that in non-controversial legislation and get that through.
        </p>

         I told him on Monday. So do not try and use children in detention or asbestos removal to cover up the fact that this Senate leadership team—and goodness knows where Senator Brandis is, because he never seems to be around on these issues—has presided over chaos and mismanagement when it comes to running this chamber and a refusal to engage in adult, responsible dialogue with other members of this Senate in order to facilitate how this last week was to be handled.

             We have heard day in, day out from Senator Wong and Senator Conroy about what they state to be the management capacity of those on this side of the chamber. The reality is that those opposite have given up any of the basic courtesies or protocols or understandings in this place that make it work. Even the worst opposition—which I think those opposite are—usually can find it within themselves to recognise that there is a public interest greater than themselves to be served in this place through agreement on certain pieces of legislation and on when the Senate will sit.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have seen a few things that I have never seen before this week. Today, there was a first, and that was seeing the Selection of Bills Committee report adoption motion filibustered. That is a new one. I have not seen that before. Even when the government indicated that we were not going to seek to divide on an amendment to that report which those opposite were moving, they filibustered the selection of bills committee report adoption. That is a new one.

                  when, during the leaders, managers and whips meeting, Senator Conroy on behalf of Senator Wong pulled a stunt that we have never seen before. He used that meeting—which is meant to be all about cooperation—as a cover for bringing on the omnibus repeal day bill so that they could move amendments to do with submarine tenders, which was countermanding the agreement that had already been reached with those opposite about the rearrangement of business.

They spent the night up-ending government business time and denying the government the time to debate its agenda. So we on this side are not going to cop that there is some lack of capacity to manage this place, because when you do not have the numbers in your own right in this place, chamber management is a shared responsibility—a responsibility that you abrogate. That is why Senator Abetz has sought to suspend standing orders so—

                          Because of how the opposition have conducted themselves, Senator Abetz has been put in the position where he is seeking to suspend standing orders so that he can move a rearrangement of business—and it is a very modest rearrangement of business. It seeks to have one bill debate—one bill—and those opposite cannot even bring themselves to allow the government of the day to have one bill debated on the last sitting day of the year. That is how low they have sunk.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          This is a very modest proposition to rearrange business—to suspend standing orders so that Senator Abetz can move a motion to debate the Migration and Maritime Powers Legislation Amendment (Resolving the Asylum Legacy Caseload) Bill 2014. That is what this procedural motion is about. It is the government seeking to make up for the acts of those opposite to deny the government of the day the opportunity to debate in an orderly fashion its legislative program. Indeed, we even saw in non-controversial business time today the opposition undertaking filibusters.

What a pack of clowns they have become. I think the best demonstration of this comes, in actual fact, from a senator on the crossbenches who votes with the government 99.9 per cent of the time. Senator Leyonhjelm said, 'The government are hopeless at negotiating.' The crossbench senator who is considered most closely aligned with the Liberal Party says the government is hopeless at negotiating. So do not come in here and say the Labor Party has tossed away all of this. You have failed miserably at your own job. The senator who votes for you—

                                          The fundamental point of this very eloquent explanation is that this government is a shambles. We see it from the head down. We see it in the way the Minister for Foreign Affairs stormed into the Prime Minister's office just this week and, I am quoting a Liberal party person, 'she went bananas.' Why did she go bananas? Because the Prime Minister's office had briefed the media that she was not up to the job of defending Australia's interests at Lima and needed a chaperone. She needed Mr Robb to attend. Senator Macdonald is on his feet again because he has lost the plot, as usual.

                                                              . Through the chair, it is a reflection on the negotiating ability of those opposite, who are incapable of managing this chamber. They are incapable of managing a simple conversation with Senator Leyonhjelm, Senator Day, Senator Lazarus and Senator Lambie, and then they come in here and complain and blame everybody else. It has been demonstrated by the statements that I have referred to. Even Senator Macdonald, Mr President, has given them a serve today. He has talked about how they will not listen. He has talked about how they have a tin ear. We have had the Liberal Party economics backbench committee refuse to consider a bill put forward for the medical research fund because they were sick of being railroaded by this government. So they have the crossbench senators sick of it, they have the backbench senators sick of it and they have the chamber sick of it, and they come in here and try and blame somebody else. They have to have an absolute good look at themselves, because they have nobody but themselves to blame for the debacle they are faced with at the moment.

The government have failed to manage this place over the last period of sitting, to the extent where they were stacking their own bills. So, when they did not have the numbers, they started putting people on the speaking list. Because of their failed management of the chamber, they expect us to sit here late. We could go through a list of the times that the government have, in fact, used up the time of this Senate because they were not managing it properly. I will note just a few of them. For a start, there was the time when Senator Brandis refused to do his job as the Attorney-General and answer questions during committee-stage debate on the counter-terrorism bill. Senator Wright and Senator Ludlam were asking totally legitimate and very necessary questions over a critical piece of legislation in this place, and what did Senator Brandis do? He sat there and sat there. In fact, the video of that particularly poor performance is rather popular on the internet at the moment. Last time I looked, there had been 40-odd thousand views of that clip—and it is probably more by now.

                                                                           </p>

So he begrudgingly started answering the odd question now and again. That cost this chamber hours, because he was refusing to do his job.
                                                                           </p>

What did the government expect—that we would just suck it up when such accusations were being chucked around? Then, of course, on FoFA, they deliberately filibustered the debate for half a day when we tried to very sensibly address a huge flaw in that legislation. That was another day lost. Now they come in here and say that we should give up more time—because they now think that maybe they have the numbers. They have been re-counting, re-counting and re-counting, putting people on their speakers' list and putting their legislation on and off the agenda. First it is top of the list; then it is down the list. Really, do not come in here and expect us, at two minutes before going-home time, to be willing to discuss hours.
                                                                           </p>

The list of what they wanted to discuss was as long as your arm. Then some form of agreement was reached on what was going to be on the list. Then we got the hours motion with more bills stacked back on. Maybe that was because they thought they had the numbers then, whereas they did not think they had the numbers earlier in the week. Now that very important list of bills—there were seven in the previous motion—has just one bill on it. There is now only one urgent bill. This is not good management.
                                                                           </p>

                                                                            We do not believe that we should be sitting here to debate this bill because the government think they may have the numbers. What happens a bit later when they do not have the numbers? That was obviously what happened yesterday, when you started adding people to the speaking list because you did not have the numbers at that time. Therefore, you started stacking it up, wasting Senate time when there was other work that could have been done. The non-controversial bills could have been discussed. Because you did not manage it well enough, we still have not got through all of those so-called non-controversial bills. For example, with the adoption bill—though I do not think it is non-controversial—we were willing to debate it at that point because we were trying to help manage the chamber. That is a bad piece of legislation. The other legislation is bad legislation. You know it. You have not got the numbers to deal with it. We will not be supporting the suspension.

I indicate that I will be supporting the motion for the suspension of standing orders. I think the government—or governments as a general principle—ought to be able to rearrange their business. So I indicate that. Secondly, in relation to the bill in question, I think it is an important bill that is the subject of passionate debate on both sides of the fence. It is important, and I also believe it ought to be debated and dealt with one way or the other.
                                                                            </p>

That is not in the motion, but I think that can be dealt with as the debate evolves. In respect of this being seen to be a gag on any debate, I make it clear that in procedural matters I think there is a clear distinction between the two. There ought not be under any circumstances a gag in terms of the consideration of this bill in the committee stage in terms of any amendments or any consideration of this particular bill.

This is a government that I recall recently went through a very widespread public relations exercise called Operation De-barnacle. We had an extensive media campaign where the government said it was going to careen the ship of state. The ship of state would be put in the dry-dock, and then all the barnacles would be scraped away. Of course, what we had was the government saying that the things they were not able to secure support for in this chamber would be jettisoned. So we had the Prime Minister's office saying that the medical co-payment bills would be scrapped. We had the Prime Minister saying that the higher education bill would be put to the Senate and, if it failed, it would be removed.
                                                                             </p>

We had speakers list after speakers list amended by government senators being added to the list in the vain hope of trying to secure the support of this chamber. That measure failed. But you cannot then say to this chamber that we need extra time at five minutes to midnight, to suggest that there is some urgent bill which they should have considered in a much earlier part of the proceedings of this parliamentary session.
                                                                             </p>
