        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Abetz. I refer to comments by new senator and senior Liberal campaign strategist,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_McGrath" rel="nofollow">
         James McGrath

        should be broadened to cover everything—and it should also be increased to 15 per cent.
       </p>
       <p>
        Is the government considering this proposal to broaden the GST to cover everything, including fresh food, school fees, child care and medication? Is the government also considering an additional hit on Australians by increasing the GST to 15 per cent?

            I am absolutely delighted to inform the electors of Queensland and all Australians that, earlier today, Senator McGrath and I and the coalition and other senators voted to abolish the carbon tax. Senator McGrath ensured that that hit on Australians to which Senator Cameron was referring was actually reduced by $550 per annum for the average—

               also commend the speech that Senator McGrath gave to all Australians—a very good speech. I might say, with respect to Senator McGrath: perfect as it was, it did canvass an issue that is not government policy, and we do not intend to increase the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
                GST
               </a>
               . This is a government that wants to try to keep the tax burden on our fellow Australians as low as possible. I understand that Senator McGrath's approach is to increase one tax and to replace other taxes, and therefore the overall tax burden would not be increased. But, having said that, I can inform the Senate and Senator Cameron that we do not intend to change the GST formula. However, can I just observe that it is an absolute delight that Senator Cameron listened to a speech without

I refer again to comments by the minister's Liberal colleague Senator McGrath who has called for the abolition of the federal departments of health and education. Is the government's $80 billion cut from hospitals and schools a down payment on Senator McGrath's grand plan?

                  Australian Labor Party
                 </a>
                 , continues to peddle this line that somehow the $80 billion to which he refers was actually funded. Every Australian knows that the promise of the $80,000 million, that was to be paid some time into the future, had no revenue base in any way, shape or form other than from borrowing from overseas. That was part of the trajectory into debt, which came to $667,000 million, something which the Labor Party seeks to deny. You cannot have it both ways. The $80 billion was part and parcel of the $667 billion. You know that, those on the other side know that and,

                  , I ask a supplementary question. Senator McGrath has also called for the ABC to be sold, echoing the calls of many over there and former deputy Liberal leader
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Brown" rel="nofollow">
                   Neil Brown
                  </a>
                  , who was recently appointed to the ABC board nomination panel. Given this growing push from within the Liberal Party and given that the Prime Minister has already broken his pre-election promise of no cuts to the ABC, will the minister now come clean about the government's secret plan to privatise our national broadcaster?

                   Let me confess, I am quite jealous. My first speech did not get the attention that Senator McGrath's has received. So I congratulate Senator McGrath for the attention that his speech has received, especially from our socialist friend on the other side Senator Cameron. Senator Cameron loves everything to be in public ownership. But what we as a government have committed to is keeping the ABC in public ownership. That will continue. There is no secret agenda. One thing we on the coalition side like is the aerating of different views and ideas. We actually allow that in the coalition, unlike those who, if they dare speak out against the carbon tax, are resigned to being silenced forever. Isn't that right, Senator Conroy?
