        ROBERTS () (): My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Wong. It's based on a constituent's inquiry. Australian journalist
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheng_Lei" rel="nofollow">
         Cheng Lei
        </a>
        was convicted in China of illegally providing state secrets to overseas parties and imprisoned. Cheng Lei was recently released and arrived back in Australia last week. Minister, can you inform the Senate what role you had personally, your department had and the Prime Minister had in the release of Cheng Lei?

         I thank the senator for his question. Obviously, as you would expect, this is an issue on which there has been a lot of discussion at various levels with the Chinese authorities, urging the return of Ms Cheng and urging her to be able to return to Australia. I can indicate to you—and obviously some of this is at officer level—that, as I said publicly at the time, this was my first engagement with the then foreign minister
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Yi" rel="nofollow">
          Wang Yi
         </a>
         , when I first met him at the first bilateral discussion in Bali. It is the practice of Australian governments to ensure that we raise consular cases with other countries, China included, at all appropriate meetings.
        </p>
        <p>
         I can indicate to the senator that Ms
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheng_Lei" rel="nofollow">
          Cheng Lei
         </a>
         was the subject of representations from me, the Prime Minister and officers, just as with other consular cases such as Dr Yang's and with those obviously facing criminal charges. We made those representations at the Prime Minister level, at the foreign minister level and at officer level, and we will continue to do so. I would acknowledge also that this has been the practice under successive governments. I spoke to former senator Payne after I had met Ms Cheng Lei at the airport to let her know before the news became public. I acknowledge that she also raised this with the Chinese authorities—

            No—not 'seriously'. It was an expression of hope, emotion and a degree of humanity, because, like all Australians, I wanted to see a mother return to her children. That was also what I said publicly.

                , there is no misinformation on our side. There is no disinformation on our side. What we have said—and if you had actually tracked every engagement I have had with the Chinese authorities, what I have said afterwards when I have articulated, at least in summary version, what I said to the Chinese authorities and what the Prime Minister said to his counterparts—you would know that we have made these representations. All I can say is this: this is not a partisan issue, and this is not a political issue. This is an issue about an Australian who is now home with her children. Behind her were many Australians across this country and across the political divide who made the same representations to Chinese authorities at all levels that Australians wanted to see a mother united with her children. I think that is a good thing. It was a great privilege to have the opportunity—
