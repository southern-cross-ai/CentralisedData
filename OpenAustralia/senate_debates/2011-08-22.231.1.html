The Strategic Reform Program (SRP) savings achieved per reform stream in the 2010-11 financial year are still being finalised.

The LNIC has spent approx $790 000 on new Time Domain Multiple Access Satellite equipment and another $2 million on network integration gateways and tropospheric scatter beyond line of sight radio bearers . These will be tested and assessed for suitability to support the ODEN network, in addition to broader network architecture and systems integration trials in support of Army further developing the Land Network Architecture .
