          Australia is now in breach of our international obligations to protect those birds, their environment and habitats as per the relevant articles in those agreements. Will the minister advise what actions are being taken to call in this project, remove Commonwealth approval and bring Australia into compliance with our international obligations?

           I thank Senator Madigan for his question. I do well remember, as we have already heard from some of the interjections during the question, the passionate debate that this chamber had about the orange-bellied parrot. We had that newborn greenie, Senator Ian Campbell, on behalf of those opposite, deciding that this had to be saved at any cost. And all of those opposite joined with him in his passion to save the orange-bellied parrot.

                I did want to remind the chamber of everybody's contribution on all sides on the orange-bellied parrot. Minister Burke's environment department is closely monitoring this project to ensure that it is undertaken in a manner consistent with its conditions of approval under the

                </a>
                1999. Responsibility, as everyone in this chamber knows who was involved in that debate—including Senator Brandis, who voted to protect orange-bellied parrots—for wind farm approval rests primarily with state and local governments.

                 , I ask a supplementary question. As the conditions of approval agreed to by the Commonwealth in 2006 focus on locating and counting birds killed by the turbines and require the stopping of the turbines and taking mitigation measures to prevent future kills if just three of the listed bird species are killed, what mitigation measures does the minister believe could realistically be taken to stop bird mortality by turbines located in the midst of a bird sanctuary, flyway and migration route other than not building the wind farm?

                  fauna management plan was approved for this project on 17 July 2012. Under this plan monitoring of AD fauna is to be carried out and a report provided to the environment departments in July 2013. I am happy to get a copy of that management plan and make sure that it is available to you, Senator Madigan. But Minister Burke is advised that the approval also contains strict conditions relating to bird mortality.

                   , I ask a further supplementary question. Considering that the research underpinning the Commonwealth's approval was so bad that the 2004 Victorian assessment panel found:

                   on what basis does the Commonwealth continue to uphold its 2006 approval?

                    Again, I will take on notice any remaining parts of your question that I did not have a chance to address there, Senator Madigan, and see if Minister Burke would like to add to that. As I was saying, Minister Burke has advised that the approval also contains strict conditions. The person taking the action must notify Minister Burke in writing of any mortality of a member of a listed, threatened or migratory species on the site of the action within 48 hours of becoming aware of the mortality. In the event of a second or subsequent mortality for certain species such as the orange-bellied parrot, the swift parrot or the white-bellied sea eagle, all operations within one kilometre of the mortality site must cease immediately. Senator Madigan, you raise very valid questions and I am happy to take on notice any further parts of the questions I have not addressed. But we should not forget that Senator Ian Campbell gave us this legislation.
