        I indicated to Senator Sterle that if there was any further information I could get in relation to his question, I would come back to the chamber. I have had the opportunity to review the Deputy Prime Minister's statement and it is, in effect, a statement of fact at a point in time, as the Deputy Prime Minister saw it. The Shenhua Watermark mine must submit a biodiversity management plan and a water management plan for approval before work can start. These plans have not been submitted yet. The preparation and submission of these plans is entirely up to Shenhua, and the project cannot proceed without a mining lease from

                   Well, that is a very interesting contribution to this chamber if that is in fact the case because that is completely contrary to what the Deputy Prime Minister said on television. We will certainly take an interest in this. What has been interesting about this set of answers, as well as Mr Joyce's contribution, is that he makes a statement on television which is effectively making an announcement about a decision that the environment minister under law has to make. I do not know how it is that the Turnbull government thinks that that is appropriate. We now have a set of answers from his representative, which appear to suggest approval has been given, which is contrary to what the Deputy Prime Minister has said.

                    The inference by the Labor Party is that the comment by Deputy Prime Minister Joyce is in fact a reflection on the approval process of the Shenhua Watermark coalmine. That approval has been given. So the inference that is being made by the Labor Party actually cannot stand. As I said, the Deputy Prime Minister was making a point; giving an opinion about mines in his electorate at a particular point in time, as he is entitled to do as the local member. The inferences that are being made now by the Labor Party are a political construct, quite frankly. Having had the opportunity to read the statements by the Deputy Prime Minister, that is exactly what they are; they are a statement of how he saw things at a particular point in time and nothing more, and not a reflection on anything else.
