They continue to trust our scientists, especially the scientific findings of Australia’s great public research institutions: our universities and our agencies such as the

                   The Australian government expressed its overwhelming support for science in this year’s budget. It included an extra $3.1 billion for research and innovation. The total research and innovation budget for 2009-10 will be around $8.6 billion. That is a 25 per cent increase on last year. It is the biggest commitment and the biggest increase on record. We have $1.1 billion for the Super Science initiatives, which involve building state-of-the-art infrastructure to support scientific research in Australia’s areas of strength, including astronomy and space science, marine and climate change and science that will drive the development of future industries. These new investments will fuel the new inventions and discoveries.

                       The industries of the future will be built on many different platforms, including biotechnology and nanotechnology. The government this week released its National Enabling Technologies Strategy to guide the responsible development of these technologies. Nanotech and biotech promise to give us breakthrough medicines, faster computers, cleaner energy, stronger and lighter materials, more abundant and nutritious food, purer water and much more besides. This government, make no mistake about it, welcomes debate on scientific questions. Our scientists devote their whole lives to the contest of ideas. But the debate has to be on scientific grounds; it cannot be based—
