         I thank Senator Lundy for the question and for her interest particularly in the employment benefits of tackling climate change. There have been some positive developments in building a clean energy future for Australia today. Today, the Prime Minister, along with Premier Rees and I, launched the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_Wind_Farm" rel="nofollow">
          Capital Wind Farm
         </a>
         in Bungendore, a wind farm by Infigen Energy that will boost the nation’s wind power capacity by more than 10 per cent. The wind farm comprises 67 wind turbines capable of supplying electricity to around 60,000 homes and is almost five times the size of any other wind farm in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         . It is a project that provided employment opportunities for over 120 people during the construction phase and that will provide ongoing employment in the local community.
        </p>
        <p>
         Renewable energy is a critical component of the Rudd government’s commitment to take concrete and practical steps to tackle the threat of climate change. As the government’s renewable energy target continues to progress, we know that, by 2020, 20 per cent of Australia’s electricity will come from renewable sources. That means that in 10 years time the amount of electricity coming from sources like wind, wave, solar and geothermal energy will be about equal to Australia’s current household electricity use.
        </p>
        <p>
         We also know that we need a price on carbon that sends the signal that we need to drive investment in further clean energy investment. That is why we need the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_Pollution_Reduction_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
          Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme
         </a>
         . There are around 50 wind farms currently in operation around the nation and that will only expand under this government’s policies. That is something of which those on this side of the chamber are proud.

           According to the Climate Institute, there is already around $31 billion worth of clean energy products either underway or planned in response to the government’s policies to promote renewable energy and to reduce emissions. These are projects estimated to create around 26,000 new jobs.

               because many of these jobs will be in regional Australia. We also have the opportunity to enable Australian business to make money by investments overseas. Those opposite might not like to hear it, but this is where the rest of the world is going. We know that China alone will be investing hundreds of billions of dollars in clean energy over the next decade. The investment around the world in low carbon growth now and in the years ahead presents enormous opportunities to Australian businesses—if those opposite can get out of the way.

                    Senator Wong, resume your seat. The time for debate is post question time. There should be no interjections across the chamber.
