        Well, let me tell you, Acting Deputy President Fawcett, the farmers of Queensland aren't laughing anymore. They're not laughing anymore because punitive regulations have been imposed on their way of farming. Those regulations are that far in front of the research there is absolutely no way these regulations can be monitored and policed, yet these farmers stand to be liable for up to $200,000 if they get it wrong. That's very scary, because there's a history in Queensland of the state Labor government imposing fines on farmers where the law has been ambiguous. A very good example was a farmer who cleared a firebreak. He rang bureaucrats 35 times and he got different responses every time. He ended up getting fined almost a million dollars because he couldn't get a straight answer from the bureaucrats. I happen to know another farmer in my home town of Chinchilla who, when he bought a property, needed to find out what was classified as white and what was classified as blue. He got a different answer from the department of environment than he got from the department of natural resources. So you can have the best intentions in the world about trying to protect the reef and everything like that, but you have to make sure these regulations are enforceable. If they're not, two of our great industries—cattle and cane—synonymous with the great state of Queensland are in jeopardy.

        This inquiry was designed to work out whether or not we could rely on the data to demonstrate cause and effect. Obviously, we all want to protect the reef. I have done almost 100 dives. I've dived on the Great Barrier Reef and in other places around the world. I dived on the reef recently, in 2018, and it looked fine, but I'll admit that it's 2,300 kilometres long and we have no way of knowing the health of the full extent of the reef. That is why my very first question to the inquiry was: do we have a database of coral growth rates across the reef that shows whether the reef is growing or whether it's declining? Likewise, I asked: do we have a database showing how much run-off to the reef there is, and is that segregated year by year?
       </p>
       <p>
        We need a centralised and consistent database so that we can demonstrate cause and effect. All knowledge is based on three major schools of thought: rationalism, empiricism and scepticism. It's all very well to say: 'We think the reef is dying. We can see a bit of coral bleaching, so the reef's dying.' What you have to do is measure observations, and you have to do it time and time again in order to prove your hypothesis. Unfortunately, we weren't able to do that in this inquiry, because there is no central database of coral growth rates on the reef, so we can't prove whether or not the water quality is a function of run-off onto the reef. It was alarming that when I asked the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Meteorology" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        about confidence intervals they told me they had a confidence interval of 60 to 99 per cent. That is scary. I can toss a coin and have a confidence interval of 50 per cent that I'm going to get heads, yet our farmers are expected to walk into a court of law with a confidence interval of 60 per cent of their measurement. It's a bit of a lottery.
