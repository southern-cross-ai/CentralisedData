        Accounting Standard AASB 2008-10: Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Reclassification of Financial Standards [AASB 139 and AASB 7]
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Amongst other things, this instrument adds a new paragraph 50B to Accounting Standard AASB 139. That paragraph states that a financial asset (as defined) may be reclassified out of the fair value through profit or loss category only in rare circumstances. The phrase ‘in rare circumstances’ is not precise. The Committee therefore seeks your advice as to whether this term has a generally understood meaning in the accounting profession, or whether it requires more precise definition.

        The Committee would appreciate your advice on the above matters as soon as possible, but before 23 January 2009, to enable it to finalise its consideration of these Standards. Correspondence should be directed to the Chair, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room

        Dear Senor Wortley
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Thank you for your letter of 27 November 2008 concerning Accounting Standards 2007-10 and 2008-10.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        You sought an explanation of the reason for the delay in registering Accounting Standard 2007-10 and the use of the phrase ‘in rare circumstances’ in Accounting Standard 2008-10.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        AASB 2007-10 affects the terminology in most accounting standards as they apply from 1 January 2009, but has no substantive impact on the meaning of those standards. The Australian Accounting Standard Board (AASB) has advised that the delay between making and lodging the standard was an administrative oversight and that measures are in place to prevent a re-occurrence of this oversight.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In relation to AASB 2008-10, the term ‘in rare circumstances’ was introduced by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Accounting_Standard" rel="nofollow">
         International Accounting Standard
        </a>
        s Board (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IASB" rel="nofollow">
         IASB
        </a>
        ) in its October 2008 amendments to International Accounting Standard (lAS) 39 and International Financial Reporting Standard (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IFRS" rel="nofollow">
         IFRS
        </a>
        ) 7.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The AASB adopted the same wording as the IASB in accordance with its policy of adopting IFRSs in their entirety. Entities and auditors applying the standards will need to decide when rare circumstances arise. The impetus for the amendments were the conditions arising from the financial crisis, and the media release issued by the IASB accompanying the amendments implies that the crisis itself can be regarded as having given rise to rare circumstances.
       </p>

        Thank you for bringing these matters to my attention.

        Dear Minister
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Thank you for your letter of 14 January 2009 responding to the Committee’s concerns with the Accounting Standards AASB 2007-10 and AASB 2008-10. The Committee considered your advice at its meeting today and agreed that it had addressed its concerns with regard to Accounting Standard AASB 2007-10.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In your response you advise that Accounting Standard AASB 2008-10 adopted the term ‘in rare circumstances’ following its introduction in October 2008 into the international standards. Notwithstanding that the phrase appears to have some common meaning in the auditing and accounting professions, the Committee would appreciate further information on this matter. You advise that entities and auditors will need to decide when rare circumstances arise. It is not clear how such decisions are to be monitored and checked and what liability will ensue if the decision that the circumstances are ‘rare’ is incorrect.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Given the recent changes to the Senate sitting pattern, the last day on which the Committee may give a notice of motion to disallow Accounting Standard AASB 2008-10 falls on 11 February 2008. The Committee proposes to give a notice on that day to preserve its position while it awaits your advice on the above matter.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee would appreciate your advice as soon as possible to enable it to finalise its consideration of this Accounting Standard. Correspondence should be directed to the Chair, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG49, Parliament House, Canberra.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Thank you for your letter of 5 February 2009 seeking further advice on the use of the phrase ‘in rare circumstances’ in Accounting Standards 2008-10.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As noted in my letter of 14 January 2009, the term ‘in rare circumstances’ was introduced by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Accounting_Standards_Board" rel="nofollow">
         International Accounting Standards Board
        </a>
        (IASB) in its October 2008 amendments to International Accounting Standard (lAS) 39 and International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 7 and this was adopted in its entirety by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Accounting_Standards_Board" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Accounting Standards Board
        </a>
        (AASB) in accordance with its policy of fully adopting IFRSs.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The phrase is not defined within the accounting standard as IFRSs are principles based standards and have a high degree of reliance on the professional judgment of preparers, auditors and regulators.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In response to your query regarding the monitoring and checking of the use of the phrase ‘in rare circumstances’, it would be treated in a similar manner to any other accounting judgement employed in preparing the financial statements. It would involve the preparers of the financial statements justifying the application of the standard, external scrutiny by an auditor and surveillance by the corporate regulator, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Securities_and_Investments_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Securities and Investments Commission
        </a>
        . As such, any disagreement over the use of the phrase would be treated in a manner similar to any disagreement about an interpretation of other accounting standards.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Any reclassifications that an entity makes on the basis of there being rare circumstances must be disclosed in accordance with amendments made to IFRS 7 (AASB 7) and would therefore be clearly evident to regulators and analysts using the financial statements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I trust this information will be of assistance to the Committee in consideration of this instrument. However, please do not hesitate to contact me if you need any further clarification.
