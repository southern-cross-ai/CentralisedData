         Climate Change

        and Water, Senator Wong. The government claims its proposed Energy Efficient Homes program will reduce cumulative greenhouse emissions by up to 49.4 million tonnes by 2020. What is the government’s estimate of the carbon dioxide that will be emitted in the manufacture and distribution of the insulation required for the 2.2 million homes targeted under the government’s program?

         It is interesting that the Liberal Party, who do not want action taken on climate change—some of them do and some of them do not—are asking a question about energy efficiency, when I understood that that was one of the things they wanted to do because they are not sure whether they will get the National Party or some of their own members of the Liberal Party to support the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_Pollution_Reduction_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
          Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme
         </a>
         . It seems extraordinary that there is some criticism from those on the other side on energy efficiency matters. That is what you were talking about: the solution to climate change. You knew it was easier to talk about that than about the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, because you are completely divided on that issue. The reality is that that assessment is made on the basis of the reduction in energy consumption that the government projects will be a consequence of insulation in in excess of two million Australian homes.

           , I rise in a point of order. Perhaps the minister simply did not understand the question. I will repeat the crux of the question: what is the government’s estimate of the carbon dioxide that will be emitted in the manufacture and distribution of the insulation required for the 2.2 million homes targeted under the government’s program? The reason I have repeated the question is that clearly she was nowhere near any of that information. I am simply giving her the benefit of that. She may not have heard the question.

             Senator Scullion, I did hear the question. I am aware of the fact that insulation does reduce energy consumption and, therefore, Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions. In terms of production and so forth, the best way to reduce emissions from those sorts of industrial processes is if the coalition deal with their internal differences and support a market based mechanism such as the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_Pollution_Reduction_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
              Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme
             </a>
             which will reduce Australia’s emissions in those covered sectors in the cheapest way possible.

              , I rise on a point of order relating to the requirement for the minister to be directly relevant. Question time is rapidly descending into an absolute waste of time. If ministers are asked a specific question about a topic that they should be right across, and having been obviously subject to some decisions in cabinet where this would have been specifically looked at, it is reasonable to ask the minister for what the government’s estimate is of carbon dioxide that would be emitted in the manufacture and distribution of the insulation that forms part of the package. The minister should be required to be directly relevant. We would certainly ask that you remind her that she has not addressed the question that has been put in a perfectly reasonable and straightforward way.

                As I was saying, the government has estimated an amount that we believe will be reduced in terms of Australia’s emissions as a result of this energy efficiency measure. In terms of the improvement of the carbon pollution of various industrial processes, such as the manufacture of insulation bats, the best way of dealing with that—

                     , I ask a further supplementary question. Further to undertaking to take the previous question on notice, will the minister now undertake to table the modelling from which the 49.4 million tonne calculation has been derived? If she is shaking her head, the rationale for the question is that I think the Senate cannot be expected to approve such significant expenditure if it is clear that there has not been even the slightest rigorous debate of the merits or otherwise of this package, even at cabinet level.

                      had a little more time, I could provide some indication of the take-up and the estimates which underpin this. I understood the opposition had referred these matters to a committee, and I am sure those matters will be properly canvassed there.
