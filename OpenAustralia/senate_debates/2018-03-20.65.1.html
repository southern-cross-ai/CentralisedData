        My question is to the Minister for Finance, Senator Cormann. Can the minister confirm that since 2001 the cost to taxpayers of dividend imputation refunds has increased from $550 million to $5.6 billion?

         What I can confirm is that this is money that has been overpaid in tax and that is appropriately refunded to the taxpayer. If the senator wants me to comment on specific numbers going back to 2001, I will take that part of the question on notice. But what I would say to you is that this is not money that is spent by the government. This is money that is reimbursed to taxpayers.

           Revenue forgone—that is a fancy way of calling it a tax hike. If you're going after revenue forgone—this reminds me of a conversation I had with Senator Cameron in a scrutiny of new taxes committee some years ago when he essentially argued that all of the money in the economy is the government's money and through the tax system we decide how much of the money we leave with the people. Our view is that all of the money is the people's money and through the tax system we've only got to take as much as necessary to officially fund the services of government.
          </p>
          <p>
           We believe in smaller government and lower taxes so that businesses across the community can grow, can prosper, can create jobs and can pay higher wages, whereas your starting position is that all of the money in the economy is yours to take and that you decide through the tax system how much you leave with people.

           Let me say that the importance of franking credits to the Australian economy is very simple: they represent tax that has already been paid by companies on shareholders' behalf. That is actually what the Labor Party used to believe. For 20 years this was a bipartisan position, and it took

             Given the minister described the blowout in the impact of the cash refundability of the imputation credits—which is now upwards of $5 billion—as 'not that much at all', is it any wonder that, under this minister, the deficit has blown out eightfold to $23.6 billion, net debt has doubled to $350 billion and gross debt has reached the highest level in the nation's history, crashing through half a trillion dollars?

               I'm surprised the Labor Party would go back there, because this is very embarrassing to the shadow finance minister and the shadow assistant minister. The question that I was asked in an interview was whether this was a blowout that cost the economy too much. The point I made was: no, it doesn't cost the economy too much at all because the money stays in the economy. Leaving the money with the people doesn't take it out of the economy; it leaves it with people that are better able to spend the money more efficiently on their own needs than the Labor Party in government would ever be.
              </p>
              <p>
               Clearly the Labor Party doesn't understand the difference between the budget and the economy. If you refund money to people that belongs to the people, does that have an impact on your budget bottom line? Yes, it means that your revenue is lower than it would be if you stole people's money, or if you stole more people's money. But it stays in the economy. I would challenge you to explain to me how that money does not stay in the economy by leaving it with the Australian people.

                  (—) (): That is a completely illogical argument. Essentially what you're saying is, if the government don't keep raising more taxes, we are imposing a cost to the budget. By that argument, you're saying, if we don't take 100 per cent of people's income out of people's pockets in tax, we are somehow imposing this massive cost on the budget. Well, do you know what? There is a limit to how much money you should take out of people's pockets, and no amount of
