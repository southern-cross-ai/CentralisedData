        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for School Education, Senator Carr. In the latest inexplicable delay in the government's response to the Gonski review of schools, will the government give an unequivocal guarantee that legislation for a more equitable funding model will be presented to the parliament in time for passage through both houses before Christmas?

         I thank Senator Milne for her question. The minister for schools has indicated on a number of occasions that it is his intention to have legislation ready for consideration by the parliament before the end of this year. The government is determined to pursue the reforms as outlined in the Gonski review. We are committed to ensuring that every child has access to a world-class education so that each student can reach his or her potential, and that is why the government has doubled the funding for Australian schools compared to that under the Howard government. That is why this government has modernised facilities in every school. That is why this government is investing in better teacher training and that is why this government has provided information about children's education through the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_School" rel="nofollow">
          My School
         </a>
         website. This is, of course, a very strong record of performance by the government and we are determined to ensure that the parliament has the opportunity to consider this legislation. We will announce our final response to the review very shortly. Until that time it is too early to talk about the various funding arrangements that are to be made with the states, but we have made a commitment from the outset to deliver on this review and we will continue to work with the states and territories and the non-government sectors to improve all Australian schools.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for his answer, but, with respect, 'every intention' is not the same as an unequivocal guarantee and, given the latest inexplicable delay—with no explanation of why—will the minister now give us a guarantee we will get the legislation by the end of the year and, secondly, will the minister say how the government intends to fund in full the implementation of the Gonski review?

           The minister for schools has indicated he will have the legislation ready for consideration by the parliament before the end of the year. He has indicated that he is working with the states and territories as to the funding arrangements that underpin that review and he has indicated that the government's final response to the review will be delivered shortly. In those circumstances it is too early to be able to determine what the funding arrangements will be until such time as those conversations are had with the states and territories. The government is determined that we can improve our education system right across this country and the government is determined to ensure that the states work with the Commonwealth to see that that happens.

            , I have a further supplementary question. The states say they have no money in this context, so will the minister say how the federal government is going to raise the additional $5 billion that is needed; and will the government consider redirecting the $3.4 billion subsidy it is providing to facilitate new coal railways in the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Valley" rel="nofollow">
             Hunter Valley

            and redirect that to school funding?

             might repeat, the government's intention is to talk to the states and territories about the funding arrangements to support the Gonski reforms. We do have great schools in this country. We want to see better schools in this country. We are determined to ensure that our education system continues to contribute to Australia having a strong economy and we want to ensure that everybody in this country gets a fair go through that education system. It is too important and too early for anybody to be ruling out what processes will be followed in regard to their conversations with the states about the way in which we will improve the school system in this country. We will be releasing more details in the coming weeks and we will be discussing those details with the states and territories and the non-government education authorities. We expect that there will be a genuine interest from all the parties to education in this country about developing better education outcomes for all Australians.
