           The Year of the Farmer comes at a time in agriculture, as National Farmers Federation President Jock Laurie has said, with 'improved seasonal conditions across most of Australia, favourable commodity prices, a weakening Australian dollar and a forecast that the value of farm exports is expected to rise some six per cent' and there has never been a better time to be an Australian farmer. I could not agree more.
          </p>
          <p>
           There are, of course, challenges in the rural area but Australian agriculture has a bright outlook for 2012. In the face of international economic uncertainty our agriculture sector is demonstrating that this government is running a strong economy that is delivering for working people in rural communities. You only have to look at the numbers to see that Australian farmers and food producers are set for a positive year ahead. The ABARES report from the latest year contained good news for farmers, stating that for this financial year, our crop, fisheries and forestry exports are all due to increase. I am positive about the year ahead for Australian agriculture.
          </p>
          <p>
           As a government we have a big reform agenda ahead of us, designed to prepare our farming sector for the future. Australian farmers are innovative. They are productive. They produce high-quality food and fibre. Our job as government is to deliver an environment and system that work for the benefit of farmers and to allow them to continue to produce and grow. This government stands for increasing skills, capacity and opportunity for Australians.

             I thank Senator Sterle for his continuing interest in agriculture and his supplementary question. The Gillard Labor government is determined to see the nation prepared for the future. We are making tough decisions to get the settings right to prepare for the new economy. The government is building a clean energy future which will militate against the risks of climate change and increasing climate variability.
            </p>
            <p>
             For farmers the Clean Energy Package is a win-win. The Carbon Farming Initiative and the $1.7 billion Land Sector Package delivers additional revenue streams for farms, opens the door for new research and technologies, and lowers the nation's carbon emissions. That is why the

             remains supportive of this innovation.
            </p>
            <p>
             The government is also developing the first ever national food plan. On 23 June 2011, I released an issues paper to inform the development of Australia's first national food plan and during the 10-weekâ€”

               I thank Senator Sterle for his continuing interest in agriculture. We hear from those opposite the challenges that they might raise around farming. But they do not want to get on board. What they want to do is run away. They want to say no to innovation. They want to say no to R&amp;D. They want to say no to the ability of the farming community to engage in the Carbon Farming Initiative. They want to say no to a food plan. They want to say no to us bringing forward logging legislation.

                 Of course, the biggest risk for Australian agriculture being ready for the new economy is the National Party and their bedfellows the Liberal Party.

                 and the Liberals have put agriculture at risk with their half-baked ideas, lack of vision and their $70 billion cut. Where is that going to come from? It is going to come from rural and remote Australia. It is going to come from rural services. That is what the National Party and the Liberals will do.
