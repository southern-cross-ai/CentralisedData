         The Australian government congratulates the people of Iran on their strong and peaceful participation in the vote held on 14 June. The people of Iran chose their President, and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_Rohani" rel="nofollow">
          Hassan Rohani
         </a>
         is the declared winner with around 51 per cent of the vote in a turnout estimated by state media at 70 per cent.
        </p>
        <p>
         Images of Iran's last presidential elections, held in 2009, have been hard to forget. Peaceful protesters in 2009 took to the streets in their thousands. Neda Agha-Soltan, a 27-year-old student, was shot dead. Footage of her final moments was broadcast across the world by social media. Again this year there was a crackdown on freedom of expression, freedom of the media and other civil liberties in the lead-up to the presidential poll. Iran's leadership determined which candidates could run. But the Iranian people have chosen a new President and it is now time to examine the country's future.
        </p>
        <p>
         Dr Rohani must show leadership and follow the wishes of the Iranian people in finding a new direction for their country. We hope that this includes constructive engagement in international negotiations on Iran's nuclear future. During his election campaign, Dr Rohani said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I will pursue a policy of reconciliation and peace. We will also reconcile with the world.
        </p>
        <p>
         He also said that there is no use in centrifuges spinning if the economy is not. It is vital that the new Iranian government addresses the international community's deep and legitimate concerns about Iran's nuclear program and that that is part of the new government's engagement with the world.

           It is simply too early to tell what effect, if any, this election will have on Iran's nuclear policy. To date, Iran has refused to abide by its international obligations or by its own international commitments. It has failed to engage seriously and constructively with the international community. Diplomatic engagement, backed by robust sanctions, is the best way to resolve the Iranian nuclear issue. Australia maintains
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
            UN
           </a>
           mandated sanctions and our own autonomous sanctions targeting Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile programs and its oil, gas, financial, transport and petrochemical sectors. Australia chairs the Iran sanctions committee in the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council" rel="nofollow">
            UN Security Council
           </a>
           and we are working to strengthen the implementation of international sanctions. We will continue these efforts until Iran can give the international community confidence about its nuclear intentions.

             Only this morning I met with a number of Australian religious organisations, including the Australian Baha'i community. Twenty members of the Baha'i community remain in prison, as do members of other religious minorities. Reports of human rights violations continue to flow from Iran. Authorities continue to target civil society, media and human rights defenders. According to
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Watch" rel="nofollow">
              Human Rights Watch
             </a>
             , Iran carried out more than 600 executions in 2011.
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
              UN
             </a>
             Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's 2012 report on Iran raised concerns about torture, amputations, floggings, the increasingly frequent application of the death penalty, arbitrary detention and unfair trials. Australia co-sponsors annual resolutions on Iran in the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Human_Rights_Council" rel="nofollow">
              UN Human Rights Council

             and the

              UN General Assembly
             </a>
             . During the election campaign, Dr Rohani spoke about the need to respect freedom of speech and other freedoms and we will continue to press the Iranian government to respect those freedoms.
