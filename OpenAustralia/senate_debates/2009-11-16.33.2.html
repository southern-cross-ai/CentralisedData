          You guys can decide because you are running the show, Senator O’Brien. The

            Oceanic Viking

          </i>
          is now in its fifth week of being tied up with this group of asylum seekers, and we know that it made a delivery to
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island" rel="nofollow">
           Christmas Island
          </a>
          at least a week before that. In his answer to my question, Senator Sherry referred to budget documents which allowed $6 million over two years for 80 extra days over those two years. In that context, their allocation for this year is already up. They have spent at least 40 additional days—most of them on this group of asylum seekers—and there are still 56 on board the ship who are giving no indication of being about to get off. The government might claim a bit of a victory with the 22 that disembarked over the weekend, and I suppose that is fair enough, but while ever there is one person remaining on that ship and refusing to leave, this remains a policy failure and it just reinforces the failure of Mr Rudd’s Indonesian solution. The floating solution is no solution.
         </p>
         <p>
          We know that this is the time of year when activity in the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ocean" rel="nofollow">
           Southern Ocean
          </a>
          is at its greatest. This country, along with its international friends, put in a lot of effort to get rid of poaching in the Southern Ocean. We do not want to go back to the situation we faced in 2005 where we were aware of at least six vessels down there fishing illegally, or in 2006 where there were nine vessels fishing illegally. We, along with our international partners, have expended an extraordinary amount of effort in that fishery to clean it up and to get rid of the poaching. As Senator Sherry said, we do not advertise where the ship is or when it is going to be sailing, but at the moment it is bloody obvious to the whole world where the ship is: it is sitting off Indonesia with 56 asylum seekers on it. So the illegal fishermen can go down there with impunity. They know that our vessel that patrols those waters, a vessel that is designed to work in those southern Antarctic waters because it is strengthened to deal with ice, is not available. It is currently a floating solution for Mr Rudd’s failed Indonesian solution.
         </p>
         <p>
          Then we come to other activities. Last summer the
          <i>
           Oceanic Viking
          </i>
          spent a lot of time—between mid-December and April—shadowing the Japanese whaling fleet. We are within four weeks of that process recommencing, but the Japanese do not have to worry about the ship this year because it is stuck off Indonesia’s northern waters. So the government may well have made an additional allocation in the budget of $6 million for 80 days over two years, but that $75,000 a day is being spent on this ship whilst it is bailed up off Indonesian waters. Where is Australia’s cop on the beat? It is certainly not doing the job that it was given.
         </p>
         <p>
          The government mentions the other vessels the Navy has, but they are not ice strengthened. They cannot go down into these southern waters to deal with the poachers. Senator Macdonald did great work when he was fisheries minister in acquiring this vessel and putting it onto the beat and, as I said before, we cleaned up a situation where in 2005 there were six vessels and in 2006 there were nine vessels poaching down there. We worked hard to clean that up and yet, because of the failed policies of the Rudd government with respect to asylum seekers, our cop on the beat is sitting off the coast of Indonesia with 56 asylum seekers on board. The sailing of that ship is supposed to be a covert operation. As Senator Sherry said, we do not indicate when the ship is at sea or where it is. But it is there for the whole world to see and the publicity it is getting makes sure that everybody knows about it.
         </p>
         <p>
          So while ever this policy failure remains, and while ever the government fails to get the asylum seekers off the ship, that is the story. It is evident to asylum seekers as a result of this that, if you can create a special circumstance, this government will give you a special solution. That is what has been offered to the asylum seekers to get off the ship. If you can create a special situation, the government will give you a special solution.

             Yes, it is an important issue, but I think Senator Colbeck incorrectly categorises the issue. He particularly incorrectly categorises the issue when he talks about victory, or for that matter defeat, in terms of getting 22 asylum seekers off the
             <i>
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_Viking" rel="nofollow">

             </i>
             . This issue is not about whether we have a victory or a defeat as a government or as a country. This is about trying to sensibly resolve an issue on our northern coast. As a government we are trying to deal with this issue in a calm and humane way. We are trying to resolve what is a very difficult issue for this country. We are doing it, I think, in a sensible way which will not lead to either victory or defeat but hopefully lead to a sensible long-term outcome for this country.
            </p>
            <p>
             Senator Colbeck suggests that the
             <i>
              Oceanic Viking
             </i>
             being in Indonesia at the moment affects our ability to deal with the issue of illegal fishing, particularly in the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ocean" rel="nofollow">
              Southern Ocean
             </a>
             . But the fact of the matter is that illegal foreign fishing in Australian waters has declined significantly over the last three years.

                              Thank you for your protection again, Mr Deputy President. We are in the process of resolving this problem. We are doing it in a humane and calm fashion, unlike the hysterical fashion of the previous government. We continue to do what we need to do to reduce the issue of illegal foreign fishing in this country. The government takes the issue of foreign illegal—

Illegal foreign fishing in this country is going down. I know it is something you like to laugh about, Senator Cash, but it is the truth. You do not like the truth; you would prefer to read a Newspoll that says you can get some temporary political advantage exploiting the unfortunate circumstances of these asylum seekers.

So you can imagine why I am a little bit stunned when those on the other side say, ‘No, in Australia we take only six months to process and repatriate someone on Australian soil’—with all the processes and resources of government, in Australia, under our law and under our governorship! But of course that is all out the window. We cannot do it in six months. But the minister has said to us today that we can promise a 90-day time frame and a four-week resettlement on the basis that it is happening in a place we have absolutely no control over.

                                   resort. As we heard in the news the other day, tragically, part of the processing is that if you arrive onshore unsure about yourself or if you make a bit of a bolt, you will get shot at or in fact shot. So I think the process they are going through on the other side is completely delusional.

                                   The problem really is that the government intend to tell Australians that it is not doing any special deal. It is okay for the hundreds and hundreds of people who have been languishing for years—not months or weeks but for years—in Indonesia either in a detention facility or on some other arrangement in the community. For those hundreds of people who did not flee to Australia recently when they changed the pull factors—the suck factors from Australia—why would you suddenly say that the 56 people remaining on the

                                   somehow have more rights to some sort of resettlement process than the UNHCR refugees who have already been processed and mandated and are ready for resettlement? This makes a mockery of Australia being a signatory to the refugee convention and this makes a mockery of the Australian people. The government are completely delusional if they think the Australian public will swallow this one.

Was Senator Colbeck suggesting we were getting the Australian people into a mess when we responded to a call to assist a vessel? It was the Indonesians who were obliged under safety of life at sea conventions to respond, but they indicated that they could not. So was it wrong for the Australian government to go and potentially save a number of people from death at sea? Is that the wrong that Senator Colbeck suggests that the Australian government performed? Was the mess that we got ourselves into in picking up the people?

                                    Yes, the vessel is detained because the Australian government said that we picked these people up in Indonesian waters and we would be discharging them into Indonesia. We said we would not be taking them to an Australian port to discharge them. If the criticism is that we got the Australian people into a mess, it is because (a) we were not bringing the people back to Australia and (b) we were not content to allow that vessel to sink and those people, including women and children, to drown because no-one else was going to pick them up. If that is the test that the opposition put to the Australian people, frankly they should be ashamed of themselves. What they are saying is that the government should have let those people drown. I reject that and this government rejects that. The Australian people are a much more generous people than this opposition gives them credit for. The Australian people would expect the Australian government to do what it could to save people on the high seas who have indicated distress. The problem is that the people on board are now saying, ‘We want to go to Australia,’ and the Australian government is saying, ‘You will get off in Indonesia’. Therefore there is a stand-off. What would we do? The Indonesians are insisting that those people need to get off the boat of their own volition. The Australian government is pursuing that path and having some success.

From that moment, we as a government took a great deal of action to protect those fish stocks for the Australian fishing industry in a very controlled way and to ensure the continuation of this species of fish.

                                     was acquired. It is an ice-strengthened vessel and it has two 50-calibre machine guns on it. It was there to protect the fish stocks in the Southern Ocean. Since it was acquired by the Howard government it has served its purpose: because the pirates knew we were serious and because we had a strong policy, patagonian fish pirating actually ceased. It is one of the great credits to the Howard government that they got rid of that pirate trade in the very valuable patagonian toothfish stock.

Have a look at the illegal immigration issue: the Rudd government laid out the welcome mat to illegal immigrants into Australia. In so doing, they have ensured that the vessel that was specifically acquired for the ice flows in the Southern Ocean is now holed up off Indonesia in tropical waters, doing something necessary because of the failure of the Rudd government’s border protection policy.

                                     I can assure you that the patagonian toothfish pirates are a well-organised, very well-intelligenced group. I can almost bet you that they are now heading back to the Southern Ocean, because this fish stock is a very valuable fish. There is a lot of money to be made, and their intelligence sources will tell them that this boat—the scourge of their lives—is holed up in some tropical port off Indonesia. So the patagonian toothfish pirates will be down there, raping the Australian fish stock, and the Rudd government has no answer for that. It is the failure of the Rudd government’s border protection policies in all of its forms that causes us to stress as a nation and to be laughed at by those who would breach our borders.
