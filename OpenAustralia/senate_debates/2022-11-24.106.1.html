       <p>
        In March this year, the former government announced that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        would be grown by 18,500 uniformed personnel by 2040. This investment is an important step in increasing our country's security, particularly considering the changing situation in the Indo-Pacific region and in eastern Europe.
       </p>
       <p>
        This growth, however, cannot occur without retaining the people that we currently have. With separation rates climbing, we are approaching a retention crisis in our defence force. Defence workers are expected to carry gaps in staffing, becoming overworked and leading to burnout, frustration and disillusionment in the work being done. Even the smallest of improvements can change a workplace.

        recently announced that men would now be able to grow a beardâ€”something that I've done recently. The collective joy of Air Force personnel was palpable, as was the collective envy of the Army. The ADF Employment Offer Modernisation Program is offering extra incentives and flexibility to entice defence members to extend their service. Retention is a complex issue so it would be so important to listen to those with the boots on the ground, to iron out the frustrations that some feel, and to continue to make our defence personnel feel valued. We need to invest in the people that we have as a first step in growing our defence force to ensure the future safety of our nation.

        In closing, I would like to acknowledge the assistance with the preparation of these remarks by Sergeant Jennifer Singleton of the

         Royal Australian Army
        </a>
        . It has been my privilege to have her in my office this week as part of the ADF exchange program. Sergeant Singleton is attached to the Headquarters of the
