           When it comes to the Caliburn report, again, this is a report that in fact has been commissioned to examine the business case robustly, as it correctly states in the contract. That is entirely what an appropriately sensible government should do. In fact, that is what those opposite did in many cases. The government has commissioned a number of organisations to look at a number of aspects of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
            NBN
           </a>
           and its operations through a range of different activities. Those opposite suddenly want to say that, on the one hand, there is no scrutiny going on and then, when they suddenly read the front page of the paper having done no work themselves—they never bother to actually ask a question themselves—they go, ‘Oh, my goodness!’

            , I raise a point of order on relevance. This, Mr President, as you must appreciate, is completely hopeless. The minister was asked one question: will the document be released—yes or no? On whatever view of the meaning of the words ‘direct relevance’ you may take, it is not possible for the minister to address that question by carrying on in the manner in which he has been carrying on now for a minute and 10 seconds.

                       As Senator Birmingham is well aware, we are not in a position to outline what cabinet decisions have been made. We are not here to provide a running commentary for the benefit of those opposite on what cabinet decisions were made, when cabinet meets or what announcements will be made. But I can say that the interest of those opposite in probity is an excellent thing. It is an excellent thing to have. It was missing with Mr Turnbull’s $10 billion water policy. It was missing when it came to the Adelaide to Darwin railway. It was missing over and over again.

He was not asked about cabinet discussions or cabinet process; he was asked whether the decision was made by cabinet, by Senator Wong or by himself and Senator Wong in collaboration. Which is it?

                         , on the point of order: the minister has been answering directly relevant to the question that was asked—to the extent of what he can make out of it. Clearly, the minister is explaining that it is a decision of government. That really underpins the ridiculousness of the question asked and, of course, what they are now arguing about. This is not a point of order that has being taken. It in fact spilled into the argument about the question and, on that basis, there is no point of order. There is no point of order that is being raised by the other side. The minister continues to be relevant to the question that was asked.
