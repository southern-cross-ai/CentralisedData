        My question is to the Minister representing the Attorney-General, Senator Wong. I refer to the report in this morning’s Fairfax newspapers that said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rudd" rel="nofollow">
         Kevin Rudd
        </a>
        toughened his terrorism blueprint to highlight the threat from jihadist and home-grown terror despite resistance from officials within his department and the Attorney-General’s Department who were concerned the language was inflammatory and counter-productive—
       </p>
       <p>
        and, further, that the Prime Minister insisted that the counterterrorism white paper should contain an ‘announcable’. Minister, why did the Prime Minister try to ‘sex up’ Australia’s counterterrorism white paper? Is this not yet another example of the Rudd government’s addiction to political spin before policy substance?

         The short answer to the question is no. I would just like to refer Senator Brandis, and those on the other side who might want to consider simply asking questions because of what is in the papers, to the following facts in relation to terror threats which have been locally generated. In 2005, nine men in Sydney were arrested and charged with terrorism offences—all nine were convicted. In 2006, an Australian national,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faheem_Lodhi" rel="nofollow">
          Faheem Lodhi
         </a>
         , was convicted of planning terrorist attacks in Australia during 2003.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_September" rel="nofollow">
          In September
         </a>
         2008, a Sydney man was convicted of collecting or making documents likely to facilitate terrorist acts. In 2006, 13 men in Melbourne were arrested and charged with terrorism offences—nine were convicted of being members of a terrorist organisation. In 2000, Australian national
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Roche" rel="nofollow">
          Jack Roche
         </a>
         was tasked by senior al-Qaeda operative
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalid_Sheikh_Mohammed" rel="nofollow">
          Khalid Sheikh Mohammed
         </a>
         to identify Israeli and Jewish targets in Australia, and in 2001 the same gentleman applied for and was granted a visa to visit Australia which was cancelled before he could travel. Perhaps the opposition could answer this question: given those facts, what is exaggerated about the fact that we do face home-grown and locally generated terrorism threats?

          , I ask a supplementary question. Minister, why does the counterterrorism white paper have virtually nothing to say about the risk to Australian security posed by people smuggling? Why was the issue ignored by the white paper at the very time the government was proposing to amend the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
           ASIO
          </a>
          Act to extend it to people smuggling? Does the government not accept that border protection is a vital element of counterterrorism policy? Is it the government’s position that people smuggling is a national security issue—yes or no?

               . I would refer Senator Brandis to the legislation that the government has introduced, the Anti-People Smuggling and Other Measures Bill, which is specifically designed to strengthen the government’s anti-people-smuggling legislative framework and support our plan to combat people smuggling. It enables

                ASIO
               </a>
               to use its intelligence and analytical capabilities in relation to people smuggling and other serious border security threats. ASIO will operate in close cooperation with Australia’s law enforcement and other national security agencies. The bill will also enable Australia’s national security agencies to collect foreign intelligence about nonstate actors, including people smugglers and their networks. We look forward to the opposition supporting the legislation and supporting the government in its plans and its objectives to protect—

Will not ASIO’s capabilities be diminished as its resources are spread more thinly? Is this not yet another example of the Rudd government’s all talk and no action style?

                 As the shadow minister knows, counterterrorism will remain

                 ’s top priority and neither the legislation which I have outlined nor the white paper will alter that. Obviously counterterrorism will remain ASIO’s top priority. The reality is that we are dealing with a whole range of matters, both on the border security front and, more broadly, in counterterrorism strategies, that do require a sensible, whole-of-government approach. The government is sensibly and responsibly delivering the legislative changes which are required.

                   I ask the minister to return to the question that has been asked. Minister, you have 25 seconds remaining.

                    , I think the Attorney-General made clear today in his public statements that obviously the counterterrorism white paper is a framework, and further decisions will need to be made in the context of the budget process. What I will say about the opposition is that their inconsistency on this position is demonstrated by the three different questions that Senator Brandis asked. On the one hand he is accusing us of talking up this issue, and on the other hand he is saying we are not doing enough.
