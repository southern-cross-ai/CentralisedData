       <p class="italic">
        (i) every week a woman dies as a result of domestic violence; according to the Counting Dead Women Project 41 women have died this year—further, one in four women have experienced abuse at the hands of a current or former partner,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) one of the biggest safeguards for women against domestic violence is employment and economic independence—too often women cannot leave a relationship or are forced to return because of economic insecurity and the fear of homelessness,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii) job losses and the withdrawal of JobSeeker and JobKeeper payments will only exacerbate this social problem which is why it is essential that these payments not be withdrawn prematurely,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iv) the Government must invest more in family violence services, and social housing and reduce insecure work to address this issue,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (v) the Government's abject failure to respond to the recommendations of the

         Australian Law Reform Commission
        </a>

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (vi) the proposal to abolish the Family Court by merging it with the Federal Circuit Court will only increase the risk of harm to children and victims of domestic violence; and

           Domestic and family violence is a scourge and its impact is horrific. The government swiftly committed $150 million for the domestic violence specific COVID-19 support package, now fully distributed to states and territories. This funding is on top of the $340 million that the Commonwealth has already invested in the fourth action plan initiatives and the 1800RESPECT ongoing funding. The government also continues to invest in the family law system and courts, with more than $140 million in additional funding in this budget, and is committed to structural reforms to the family law courts that will help families, including women and children, resolve their family law matters faster and more effectively.

              The COVID pandemic has turbocharged already prolific violence against women. The
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Institute_of_Criminology" rel="nofollow">
               Australian Institute of Criminology
              </a>
              found that one in 10 women in a relationship experienced intimate partner violence during the pandemic, many for the first time or with increased severity. The women's safety sector expects that demand for crisis housing, counselling, safety and support services will continue to increase even further and it has called for an investment of $12 billion over 12 years to meet this demand. Due to a lack of resources, women's legal services are currently unable to service nearly half of the people who seek their help. Yet, despite rising violence and services having to turn people away, the 2020-21 budget did not include any new funding for frontline domestic and family violence services. Violence against women is a national security crisis and the government must drastically increase funding to ensure that all those seeking safety can access the services when they need them.
