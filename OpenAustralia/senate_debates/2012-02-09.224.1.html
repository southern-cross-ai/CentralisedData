         The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) In the 2009 Defence
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Paper" rel="nofollow">
          White Paper
         </a>
         , the Government announced its intention to prepare new White Papers at intervals of no greater than five years. To ensure that the development of future White Papers is as comprehensive as possible, a strategic risk assessment, a force structure review, and an audit of the Defence budget are to be conducted in the year prior to any White Paper.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The Minister for Defence has announced the Government's intention to deliver a new White Paper in early 2014. In order to meet this timeline, Defence has commenced preparation for a force structure review, which will be conducted in 2012. The results of the review will be reported to Government by early 2013.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) The Force Posture Review Expert Panel, Dr Hawke and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Smith" rel="nofollow">
          Mr Smith
         </a>
         , are on track to provide me with a progress report in December 2011. The final report will be provided to Government in the first quarter of 2012. Government will respond once the report has been received and considered. It is too early to pre-empt the report's findings.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) One of the key elements of the Defence Procurement and Sustainment Review, conducted by Mr David Mortimer AO in 2008, was to consider progress in implementing the 2003 Kinnaird Review of Defence Procurement.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The Mortimer Review noted the success of the Kinnaird reforms and provided a detailed analysis of the implementation of those reforms which can be found at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annex_B" rel="nofollow">
          Annex B
         </a>
         to the Mortimer Review report.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The majority of the Mortimer recommendations have been implemented. In particular the following key initiatives are in place:
        </p>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <p class="italic">
         Ministers also noted in August 2011 that the Kinnaird and Mortimer reforms have improved the rigour applied to the capability development process. Ministers noted that there had been 20-25 per cent reduction in schedule slippage for those projects subject to the Kinnaird and Mortimer reforms as compared with earlier projects.
