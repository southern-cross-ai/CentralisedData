        My question is to the minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Brandis. Yesterday the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea" rel="nofollow">
         North Korea
        </a>
        n regime undertook its sixth nuclear test, which it claims was an advanced hydrogen bomb. Obviously North Korea's continued nuclear testing is deliberate, dangerous and provocative. Can the minister update the Senate on this event?

         Thank you, Senator Wong, for that very important question. I can confirm that on Sunday, 3 September the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea" rel="nofollow">
          North Korea
         </a>
         n regime claimed to have conducted a successful test of a nuclear device. The seismic event of approximately 6.1 magnitude is consistent with a nuclear device of significantly higher yield than previously tested by the regime. It was detected at a site where previous nuclear tests have been conducted. North Korea has subsequently claimed this event was the successful test of a hydrogen bomb. This would be the sixth illegal test conducted by Pyongyang. This action represents a serious escalation of tensions in the region. Australia is working with our regional partners to determine the precise nature of the test conducted by North Korea.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia utterly condemns this flagrant defiance of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council" rel="nofollow">

         -un's regime. This nuclear weapons test is designed to advance North Korea's illegal capabilities and test regional and global resolve. North Korea continues to pose a completely unacceptable threat to global peace and stability. It must instead focus its resources on the welfare of its impoverished people. All nations need to fully implement existing

            Yes, I can, thank you, Senator Wong. Australia implements a sanctions regime aimed at limiting
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea" rel="nofollow">
             North Korea
            </a>
            's ability to develop weapons of mass destruction. Australia does so in collaboration with our regional partners and indeed with the global community. We deliver a very clear message to North Korea: your interests are best served by ceasing your nuclear and ballistic missiles programs and engaging positively with the international community. Like our regional partners, we say that North Korea must end its provocative behaviour, and we continue to work with the United States, the Republic of Korea, Japan, China and our other friends and partners to ensure the strongest possible response to North Korea's defiance of international norms. We have repeatedly said we are committed to the path of diplomatic and economic pressure to resolve the crisis, and we will continue to work with those partners to change North Korea's behaviour.

               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korean" rel="nofollow">
                North Korean
               </a>
               economy. These are by far the toughest sanctions yet and will be fully implemented by all countries, including Australia, as soon as possible. When fully implemented, the sanctions will place unprecedented pressure on the North Korean economy and significantly increase the costs on Pyongyang to cease its illegal activities and freeze and eventually abandon these programs. We welcome the robust response from China to this provocation and we call on China to put its words into action and use its unique leverage over Pyongyang.
