        My question is to the Minister for Employment, Senator Abetz. I refer to a formal complaint against Fair Work Commission vice-president Michael Lawler, received by the minister. Can the minister confirm the complaint was made by an industrial relations advocate who was on the receiving end of inappropriate and improper comments from Vice-President Lawler about the support Mr Lawler has provided to his partner, Ms Kathy Jackson, before the commission, and an unwelcome offer to represent the advocate's client while on sick leave?

         As the honourable senator would be aware from media reports, I have received a complaint. I am working through that complaint in a methodical, purposeful manner, and I am not going to engage in the sort of language that Senator Conroy invites me to engage in, because what we have to do is deal with this matter in a proper and fair manner to all concerned. That is what I have dedicated myself to doing and that is why I will not say anything further on the matter, other than that it is being investigated and proper regard is being given to the complaint to ensure that all matters are appropriately canvassed prior to any announcement being made.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Can the minister confirm that his office contacted the complainant to confirm the complaint against the vice-president was being acted on? How is it being acted on; what role are the minister and his office playing; and when will it be resolved?

           When somebody makes a complaint to our office about a matter, unlike the former Labor government, do you know what, we actually do respond to them and say, 'Yes, message received. We are looking into it and we will deal with it in due course.' As to any further matters, I will not canvass those, as I indicated in my previous answer. It is appropriate that due regard be had to process and that is the course that I have set myself in this matter and that is the course that I will continue on.

             As the honourable senator ought to know, there is a difference between a formal complaint and concerns. There are, from time to time, letters provided to ministerial officers expressing concern and one notes them and leaves them. In relation to actual complaints that might excite my interest under special provisions of the Fair Work Act, they fall into a different category and, as I have indicated, I will deal with the particular matter to which the senator referred in his primary question in a proper manner.
