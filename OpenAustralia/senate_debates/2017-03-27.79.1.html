        My question is for the Minister for Defence, Senator Payne. Justice Mohr, a former Navy stoker who rose to become a major general and later a judge in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court" rel="nofollow">
         Supreme Court
        </a>
        of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        , was perhaps the most appropriate person to conduct a review into warlike service and service entitlements and, as such, was appointed to conduct a review to be later known as the Mohr review. Because of his deep understanding of service life and his analytical skills, Justice Mohr found that either the Navy got it right and the Army and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Air Force
        </a>
        got it wrong or the opposite was true. By this I mean that, in correcting the allocation of servicemen to zones attributed to war service or active service, the Clarke review was accepted by the government because it allowed the deception to continue that combat troops were not deployed to hostile environments outside of Vietnam. Minister, can you advise the house why the government commissioned the Mohr review and the recognition of service for veterans in 2000 and then, when it did not like the outcome which was in favour of the veterans, commissioned the Clarke review in 2002?

         I thank Senator Burston for his question and for giving me some notice of that. I do recognise that this is a matter of significant interest for the senator and acknowledge the adjournment speech he gave to the Senate on this matter last week. All

         service is appropriately classified in accordance with the legislation and the policies that existed at the time of service. Defence is aware that there are claims of perceived anomalies with regard to classification of past service. Where these are brought to Defence's attention, they are investigated and remediated as appropriate.

         Representatives of the major ex-Service organisations that made submissions to the Review indicated their general acceptance of its independence, and any subsequent recommendation.

        <p>
         The second review—the Clarke review of veterans' entitlements of January 2003—encompassed a review of repatriation legislation and some perceived anomalies in the entitlements legislation. It consulted extensively with the ex-service community, held many meetings between May and September of 2002 and considered over 3,000 submissions. It became, at the time, very clear to the committee that there was much misunderstanding about the system and the applicable legislation. The committee made 109 recommendations across the range of issues it considered in terms of those perceived anomalies, access to veterans entitlements and level of benefits and support provided to—

           Can the minister explain to the chamber why the government continues to take a position that soldiers deployed outside of Vietnam on war service or on active service but with the same rules of engagement as in Vietnam are not afforded the service entitlements consistent with soldiers who have been deployed on war service or on active service yet affords full war service entitlements to other who have served in Thailand and

               I can advise the Senate that all those claimed anomalies in relation to ADF service, including those which have been raised by Senator Burston, have indeed been reviewed by independent committees. I have referred to the work of both the Clarke committee and the Mohr committee. While reviews have been established by the federal government, as they must be, they comprise independent experts outside of Defence. Just to reinforce that, the Mohr committee comprised Judge Mohr, as referred to by the senator, and Rear Admiral Pete Kennedy, AO,

               , retired. The Clarke review, as well as having the Hon. John Clarke

               as the chair, had Air Marshal Douglas Riding, AO,
