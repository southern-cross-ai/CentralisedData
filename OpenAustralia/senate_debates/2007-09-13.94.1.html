        Pursuant to standing order No. 74(5), I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Education, Science and Training for an explanation as to why answers have not been provided to 69 questions on notice asked by me at the Senate estimates hearing of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Education on 1 June 2007.

          I move:
         </p>
         <p class="moved">
          That the Senate take note of the minister’s response.
         </p>
         <p>
          Minister, it is my understanding that your office was approached this morning and advised that I would be asking this question. It is my understanding that the normal custom and practice here is that you would be advised that I would be asking this question. I am therefore surprised that you are now in the position of saying that you will follow this matter up with the Minister for Education, Science and Training. I would have thought that the fact that I have asked the question was an opportunity for you to explain why these questions have not been answered. It is further to my understanding that, of the questions asked on 1 June, there is the situation that 84 per cent of the questions asked are still outstanding. This is a pattern which, it suggests to me, does not bring great credit upon the minister. It ought to have been addressed before this time.
         </p>
         <p>
          Further, I draw your attention to a debate in this chamber concerning an education bill in the previous session, where I asked a similar question about questions being answered by this committee. I recall that on that occasion you said that you would take steps then to have answers returned to the Senate. So this has become an occasion on which, nearly three months after the inquiry, I am asking for these matters to be attended to. I am therefore surprised, Minister, that you are in the position of not being able to give us an explanation as to why 69 questions remain outstanding.
         </p>

           I have not been advised that you contacted my office this morning. This is the first I have heard of it. I will inquire into that as well. Given that, all I can do to assist you, Senator Carr, through you, Mr Deputy President, is to pursue with the Minister for Education, Science and Training the matters which you have raised. I can tell you, though, Senator Carr, that I am aware that there are no questions outstanding in relation to the portfolio for which I have direct ministerial responsibility—Arts and Sport. In relation to the portfolio of the minister I represent, I will pursue the matter.
          </p>
