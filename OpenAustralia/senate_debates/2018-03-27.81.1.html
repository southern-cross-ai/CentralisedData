        How is it fair that, at the same time, the Turnbull government's freeze on family tax benefits will leave a family with a household income of $60,000 a year and two primary-school aged children around $440 a year worse off, while giving big business a $65 billion handout?

         The reasons that we are giving company tax cuts—and what we are proposing to do—is to create more jobs in the economy. And the best form of welfare is a job. We all know that. You keep saying that's the situation, but you don't actually believe it. When it comes to pensioners, we won't be introducing policies that are going to hurt them and make them worse off. We are not going to increase taxes on part-pensioners; we are not going to do it to self-funded retirees. This government is making sure that we have a sustainable budget, which means that we will be able to look after those people who are most in need. We will also encourage people off welfare and into work. This is the best thing that we can do. When it comes to pensioners, we will not be introducing the types of policies that those opposite have just released, which will make pensioners and part-pensioners worse off. All you want to do is tax and spend. We want to make sure that we get people working, that we encourage people to work, that we are encouraging companies to employ more people. That way we can make sure that we won't be doing to pensioners and part-pensioners what you opposite will be doing to them if you get onto the Treasury benches. But those opposite have backflipped, but they bungled their own backflip. They can't even execute a humiliating retreat properly.

                  I haven't seen Cassandra Goldie's comments, but, again, I will take that part of the question on notice and refer that matter to the Minister for

                  s. If he has any response to Dr Goldie's comments, I'm sure he will instruct me to provide them to the Senate.

                  Labor's election policy from 20 years ago, in 1998, when Labor was on a unity ticket with

                 <p class="italic">
                  Low income older people will be able to use their imputation credits even if they do not pay tax. This will mean that they can effectively 'cash out' the value of their imputation credits and increase their disposable incomes.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  So I ask those opposite about that policy then. What was an act of compassion and fairness then, according to those opposite, is now a tax rort, a loophole and a scandal that has to be put to an end. They're the scandal, and the Australian public will not believe them.
