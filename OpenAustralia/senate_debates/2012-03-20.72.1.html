She raises the very important issue of the deregulation agenda of COAG. I will have to take part of the question on notice in the sense of getting an update on the progress of each of the 12 key reforms …

       <p class="italic">
        The COAG Reform Council (CRC) report released on 3 February noted that good progress has been made on COAG's 27 deregulation priorities, and that 15 priority reforms had been implemented—including one ahead of schedule.
       </p>

        I am pleased to say that since the CRC report was released, Personal Properties Securities reform commenced operation on 30 January 2012—taking the number of implemented reforms to 16.

       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government is committed to leading the national regulatory reform agenda through COAG, and will continue to work with all States and Territories to drive accountabilities and ensure that the States deliver on their reform commitments in a full and timely manner. Further, the COAG Business Advisory Forum, announced by the Prime Minister, will provide an avenue for business to raise its concerns on progress in delivering these reforms more directly with governments.
