       <p>
        I have been asked to read from four heartbreaking resignation letters written by people who recently left the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Human_Rights_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Human Rights Commission
        </a>
        . The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AHRC" rel="nofollow">
         AHRC
        </a>
        is a crucial institution, but all institutions need to be held to account, especially when it comes to how they treat their staff. After much thought, I have decided to read from these letters in the hope that it will encourage the AHRC to address the alleged behaviour.
       </p>
       <p>
        One letter describes an unsafe workplace, saying:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Indigenous staff, people of colour, LGBTQIA+ people and those with disabilities were frequently dismissed in their attempts to address a lack of cultural safety, accessibility and inclusion in the workplace and were treated very poorly by senior management.
       </p>
       <p>
        It continues:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Institutional racism and hostile working conditions at the AHRC is an issue that starts at the very top of the organisation. At one point, it was suggested that the then-President was actively promoting a safe and inclusive workplace by 'doing the rounds' of the office to greet staff in the morning. I experienced these 'morning rounds' many times and saw the President repeatedly use the names of employees of colour interchangeably—a racist and dehumanising act that never occurred with white colleagues.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Racism and a lack of care for staff wellbeing is systemic at the AHRC … White people are hugely overrepresented in the organisation (particularly at the executive level and above) and little is done to address structural barriers that might prevent Indigenous people and people of colour from entering, and staying safely, at the organisation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Hiero Badge's resignation letter speaks of 'the internal suppression of pro-Palestinian perspectives and voices and a cavalier disregard for the psychosocial safety and wellbeing of staff'. It reads:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In one instance, I was informally cautioned by a senior official for using the phrase 'From the River to the Sea' on my personal social media. Similarly, I was informally reprimanded for summarising a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
         UN
        </a>
        press release on the situation of women and girls in Gaza.
       </p>
       <p>
        The letter also speaks of poor working conditions stating:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Staff members are overworked and unsupported … Last month, I worked 12 consecutive days without a weekend break including, a 15-hour day over a public holiday.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I have experienced symptoms of anxiety, burnout, chronic stress, and depression, leaving me miserable and dreading work. I do not feel safe to continue.
       </p>
       <p>
        If this isn't disturbing enough, Sara Saleh's resignation letter spoke of how her identity was viewed as a risk by senior management and how a right-wing hit piece on her was circulated. The letter reads:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The deliberate circulation of a defamatory and racist news piece about me to all staff was egregious, detrimental to my reputation and hurtful. This also sent a message to staff of colour that the Commission is willing and capable of circulating vitriolic commentary about them in the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sara shared details of how their departure was leaked, stating:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The decision to leak news of my departure against my wishes allowed radio shock jocks, among others, to publicly humiliate me and attack my reputation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sara also states that at least seven people have resigned in the last quarter alone, citing the commission's inadequate stance on Palestine as the primary reason behind their departure.
       </p>
       <p>
        These people have shown immense courage in speaking out, and they must be listened to. The allegations in these letters suggest a pretty toxic and silencing culture at the AHRC, one which is at odds with the role of the commission. The AHRC has the opportunity to reset with new president Mr Hugh de Kresta, who commenced his five-year term less than a month ago. I would encourage the new commissioner to read these resignation letters carefully and chart a new course for the commission, one which ensures a safe workplace, including for people of colour, LGBTQIA+ people, and also a place which involves taking a loud, fearless and staunch stance on the greatest moral injustice of our time Israel's genocide of the Palestinian people in Gaza.
       </p>
       <p>
        Acting Deputy President, I seek leave to table these letters.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave not granted.
       </p>
