         I would like to thank the senator for his question and acknowledge the advice that he has provided to government over some time with regard to Indigenous affairs, particularly his experience with Indigenous people in his home town of St George. On Tuesday I informed the Senate of a suite of measures totalling some $740 million that are going to address the longer term needs of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         : some $540 million to repair and build housing in remote communities over the next four years; $100 million for more doctors, nurses and allied health professionals and specialist services; $78.2 million over three years to convert CDEP positions to real jobs; up to $30 million to be matched on a dollar-for-dollar basis to assist the Northern Territory government to meet their obligations in this regard; and $18.5 million over two years for 66 additional

         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Today I am also pleased to announce the negotiation on another 99-year lease, this time over the township of Ski Beach, which is adjacent to the mining town of Nhulunbuy, in the north-east of the Northern Territory. Negotiations will proceed with the Gumatj people to bring better services and economic development to the region. The negotiations are proceeding at the urging of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galarrwuy_Yunupingu" rel="nofollow">
          Galarrwuy Yunupingu
         </a>
         , who took the initiative to approach the minister over a 99-year lease over his home community. This 99-year lease to the Australian government over the township will bring a solid foundation to take advantage of the economic opportunities, allowing residents to participate in the Australian economy and provide for normalised land based tenure. This will also be their first chance for homeownership. This is the reality, given what we know from places like Nguiu, in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiwi_Islands" rel="nofollow">
          Tiwi Islands
         </a>
         . This has also been agreed to in principle on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groote_Eylandt" rel="nofollow">
          Groote Eylandt
         </a>
         , which is not far from Nhulunbuy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Negotiations with the aim of having the new arrangements in place by early 2008 will commence immediately. When it proceeds, the secure tenure that the 99-year leases will bring will remove the need for the statutory five-year lease that was provided for under the emergency response act in the Northern Territory. This lease will move land from ownership in a collective sense to individual ownership and control. So, for the very first time,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_Australians" rel="nofollow">
          Aboriginal Australians
         </a>
         will be able to directly control what happens on their own land and will be able to invest in their future, their family’s future and in economic prosperity. There are many opportunities in and around Nhulunbuy. Ski Beach faces the water and on the other side, as you look across the bay, you can see the mining township. There are many yachts and there is an emerging maritime industry there. There is currently not a small slipway, so there is an opportunity for a slipway, for a chandlery, for boat hire businesses and for other tourist enterprises. The bottom line is enterprise. The government is more than happy to support Aboriginal communities and their aspirations for economic independence. We have a plan that has been developed in consultation with

           and we have another interjection from Senator Crossin, who disappointingly again asks if we are going to be providing money for that. We are providing an environment where

           enjoy the same level of opportunity as other Australians. This is a fantastic initiative by a government that is happy to provide leadership, not froth and bubble and media stunts. This government is about making absolutely sound decisions, sticking to them and implementing them.
