        My question is to Senator Ludwig, the Minister representing the Minister for Ageing. My question relates to the recommendations arising out of the recent Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration inquiry into residential and community aged care in Australia.

          A very good report. A significant proportion of the 31 recommendations refer to an all-encompassing review of the residential and aged-care sector to be conducted by the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health_and_Ageing" rel="nofollow">
           Department of Health and Ageing
          </a>
          in conjunction with a task force to be established by a newly formed national aged-care forum. I note that there were no dissenting comments to this report and the committee unanimously supported these recommendations. However, the report did not stipulate the preferred time line for this all-encompassing review. My questions to the minister are: when will the government provide its response to the recommendations made by the finance and public administration committee inquiry; does the government support the recommendations of the inquiry; and, if so, what is the proposed date for the establishment of a national aged-care forum and subsequent task force to conduct this all-encompassing and urgent review?

            I thank Senator Xenophon for his question. I understand that he does have an interest in residential and community aged care in Australia. I am aware that the report from the Senate inquiry into residential and community aged care in Australia was released on 29 April. My advice from the Minister for Ageing is that the report is currently being considered in detail and a response will formally be made in due course.

              I can only reiterate what my advice is to date, which is that the report is currently being considered and a response will be made formally in due course. Senator Xenophon of course is aware that the budget did increase funding by the Australian government, which will provide financial support for aged- and community care providers who care for older Australians, to a record level of $34 billion. That is more than $2.5 billion over previous projections for aged and community care. This government does have a significant interest to ensure that those in residential and community aged care in Australia are cared for. In 2009-10 the Australian government will provide a total of $9.9 billion to support the aged-care needs of older Australians. That is 9.9 per cent more than in 2008-09.
