        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Abetz. Yesterday, the foreign minister, Ms Bishop, said: 'I think people have been very frank and blunt in their assessment of the performance of the Prime Minister's office.' What frank and blunt assessment have ministers and backbenchers expressed to the Prime Minister about the performance of his office?

         We in the coalition believe in open discussion, frank and blunt discussion, and so it should not surprise the Leader of the Opposition in this place that we are willing to enter into such a dialogue.

          Can I

         also say to Senator Wong that as colleagues we give each other frank and blunt assessments of each other as well. But in no way does that mean that because we give each other frank and blunt assessments our friendships are in any way undermined or damaged—because we are the mature adults in the room and we can deal with those sorts of issues, unlike the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Labor Party
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         We have it here from the Leader of the Opposition, today, saying that somehow having a frank and blunt discussion or assessment is something that a government should never get involved in. Of course it should, because unless you have those frank and blunt discussions you will not perform to your very best ability for the people of Australia whom we at least, on this side, are dedicated to serving.
        </p>
        <p>
         Can I say to the senator opposite that if Ms Bishop made those comments—I am willing to accept that she made those comments—it would be fair and reasonable to say that we in the coalition do engage in frank and blunt assessments with each other, and long may it continue.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I refer to the Prime Minister's commitment that backgrounding against members and senators of this parliament, by his staff, is a sackable offence. Were the staff, in the Prime Minister's office, who leaked details of Senator Sinodinos's resignation from the frontbench sacked and, if not, why not?

           </a>
           to try to come in here and talk about leaking against each other, really, is taking credulity to a new limit. The Prime Minister has said, very clearly, that if a staff member in his office engages in leaking, then there are consequences that will follow, and that is only appropriate.

               What a devastating assessment of somebody, to say that they have a lot of opinions! I would have thought that would be a requirement of any first-class chief of staff—to have a lot of opinions, to have a lot of ideas, to be able to assess agendas and submissions made to the prime ministerial office. To say that somebody has a lot of opinions is somehow a criticism, I would have thought that was a compliment—

                              . Before you deal with Senator Moore's point of order, there have been a number of occasions when you have called another senator, and the microphone is not switched off, and the minister simply continues to speak. So can we at least have, if the minister is no longer supposed to be speaking, the microphone switched off when you direct so?

                               I paused the clock, so the time clock is correct, when the point of order was taken. I appreciate your point, but I can tell you that the noise in the chamber is usually when Senator Abetz is on his feet and it is a loud amount of noise, and it is very difficult for me—let alone the minister—to hear. All senators need to exercise some restraint when the questions get a bit excitable. Senator Moore, you have the call, on a point of order.
