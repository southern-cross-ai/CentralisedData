         I thank Senator Hume for her question. I am pleased to say that, last night, the government delivered on its election commitment to protect the volunteers in the

         I would like to thank the Senate crossbench, including

This has been a very long and a very sorry saga. The Country Fire Authority is one of the largest and the most effective volunteer based organisations in the world. It is something that Australians and in particular the Victorians in this place should be so very proud of.

            Despite the interjections from those opposite, perhaps they would like to listen to former minister Jane Garrett and what she had to say about the proposed enterprise agreement. The last time I checked, she did not sit on this side of the chamber in Victoria. She did not sit on the Liberal government's side; she sat with the Labor government, those who are in power. She was so disgusted by what
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Andrews" rel="nofollow">
             Daniel Andrews
            </a>
            and

             Bill Shorten
            </a>
            are endorsing in Victoria that she stepped aside. A senior minister was so disgusted with what she was being asked to do that she put her principles first, unlike those on the other side, who are prepared to trample all over the 60,000 volunteer firefighters in Victoria. Quite frankly, shame on Mr Shorten. Mr Shorten is allegedly a member from Victoria.

               Unfortunately, I can. What we have seen over the past few months in particular is a shameless power grab by the United Firefighters Union wholly endorsed by the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Andrews" rel="nofollow">
                Daniel Andrews
               </a>
               Labor government. And, of course, last night we saw it on full display in the Senate when those opposite refused to support the 60,000 volunteers and instead were prepared to defend the actions of the United Firefighters Union every step of the way. You are talking about tens of thousands of Victorian men and women who selflessly put their lives on the line because they believe in their Victorian communities. The Labor Party have shown they do not care for volunteers and they will not show them respect, and shame on them.
