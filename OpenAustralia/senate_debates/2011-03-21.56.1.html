        and Mr Bowen, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, as to the status of those asylum seekers who forcibly broke out of detention during the recent week of protests on Christmas Island, can the minister definitively advise how many of those asylum seekers remain at large and roaming the island?

             Christmas Island
            </a>
            detention centre is, I am advised, under control and is being jointly managed by the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
             AFP
            </a>
            , the immigration department and Serco, the department’s detention service providers. Over the weekend, the AFP deployed 70 officers to Christmas Island to support those already present on the island, taking the total number of AFP officers to 188.
           </p>
           <p>
            Senator Cash asked about the number of people at large. My advice was that a small number of people had not been returned to the centre. However, just before question time I heard the briefing, as you did, by officers on Christmas Island indicating that all personnel had in fact been returned to the centre. I can get further information for you but it is my understanding, based on what has been explained to me, that there had been a small number of people not in detention. Shortly before we came into this chamber, however, a briefing was provided indicating that all personnel had now been returned to the centre.

             … the situation on Christmas Island … is calm.
            </p>
            <p>
             Given the nature of the violent protests, which included the use of tear gas and beanbag rounds, mass break-outs, fires, rock throwing and protests, is this what the Gillard government defines as a situation that is ‘calm and under control’?

              From time to time one is somewhat surprised by the nature of questions in this chamber, and this happens to be one of those occasions. Is the senator seriously suggesting that anyone in this chamber would do anything other than condemn the violence by personnel on
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island" rel="nofollow">
               Christmas Island
              </a>
              —the attempts to inflict violence on officers of the Commonwealth? And would anyone seriously suggest that anybody in this chamber would do anything other than say that that is totally inappropriate? For any question to propose anything to the contrary is, I would say, to insult the intelligence of every senator in this chamber.

                I do not think it can be seriously argued that the minister has been anything other than very frank and open with the Australian people about the nature of the circumstances in Australian detention centres. My reading of the minister’s statements is that they have been very frank about the difficulties faced as a result of the increasing numbers of people placed in detention. Under no circumstances would one suggest either that the government condones this action or that it will be doing anything other than treating these issues with the utmost seriousness. The minister has indicated that criminal charges could certainly be laid by the
