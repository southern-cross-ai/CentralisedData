           is a fantastic tradition that honours the role that father figures play in our lives and, particularly, in the lives of children. Free

            TV

           has clarified in a statement that it asked for an authorisation to be included at the end of a proposed advertisement by Dads4Kids, but Dads4Kids declined, so the advertisement did not run. During debate in the other place just last night on a government bill to expand authorisation requirements, authorisations were described by the government's own members as 'necessary to ensure our democracy'. Dads4Kids actively advocates against marriage equality and
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBTIQ" rel="nofollow">
            LGBTIQ

           rights. At a time when Australians are about to participate in a postal survey on marriage equality, it is understandable why Free TV believed it was appropriate for it to include an authorisation. If anyone is politicising Father's Day, it's the senators who have moved this motion.

               Father's Day
              </a>
              . We think Father's Day is a terrific institution, but the motion, as worded, is factually incorrect. A father singing a lullaby to his child is not political, and any notion suggesting that honouring the role of the father on Father's Day as political is incorrect. However, Dads4Kids, the organisation behind the advertisement, has campaigned heavily against marriage equality and also advocates in support of gay conversion theory. So it is very clear in the context of the current debate about marriage equality, the campaigning about marriage equality and the postal plebiscite, that this advertisement needed an authorisation. We are in a different environment this year than at the same time as Father's Day last year. It is very clear that an authorisation is needed. It's standard practice for political broadcast advertising.

                 I rise in response to the objections to this motion of the Labor Party and the Greens, and in relation to what Senator Gallagher had to say. Those ads have been running for many years, uncontroversially it seems. Any objective observer looking at those ads would say that something simply promoting fatherhood and
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father's_Day" rel="nofollow">
                  Father's Day
                 </a>
                 and encouraging men to be good dads is not political. To suggest now that that is somehow political and therefore needs a political authorisation is ridiculous. That's what this motion is highlighting. I find it extraordinary that the Labor Party and the Greens wouldn't support this. I think the vast majority of Australians would look at the idea that Father's Day is now a political statement, and supporting Father's Day is now a political statement, as being absolutely absurd.

                    I'm supporting the Greens and the opposition on this issue.

                    is not political and should not be political. Dads4Kids is political and conversion therapy has been disproven around the world. I'm more than happy and proud to support the opposition on this motion.
