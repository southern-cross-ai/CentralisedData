         I thank the senator for his question. The biosecurity CRC’s application is a matter that was dealt with by an independent committee of the CRC, just as it was under your government. The assessment of the quality of the biosecurity CRC’s application was of course undertaken independently of government, and I am advised that the CRC bid was not of high enough quality to earn another round of funding. I am also advised that a number of key potential partners such as
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AQIS" rel="nofollow">
          AQIS
         </a>
         and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Customs" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Customs
         </a>
         were not part of the bid. So I would caution senators against taking simplistic views on this matter. This CRC program is highly competitive, and opposition senators would of course be the first to scream blue murder if it were suggested that the government had intervened in the selection process. However, it is wrong to assume that the biosecurity CRC, as it is currently known, is the only way in which the government addresses critical national biosecurity issues. That position is plain wrong.

              Australian Customs
             </a>

              CSIRO
             </a>

                The opposition’s claim that no-one else is addressing the issue of research on the Hendra virus other than the CRC for biosecurity is wrong—plain wrong. The issue of the Hendra virus is being pursued by the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
                 CSIRO
                </a>
                , which is the nation’s premier public research agency. CSIRO conducts most of the Hendra related research in Australia. It does so through the

                 Australian Animal Health Laboratory
                </a>
                , which has also attracted competitive grants from other research agencies, including the United States National Institute of Health. This is a facility which is first class and has the highest possible security rating, along with top-level research on high-level infectious disease. The management of emerging infectious diseases such as the Hendra virus is a long-term—

Given that the government provided a special $15 million grant to the bushfire CRC to keep it operating after it failed to gain further CRC funding, is the government now also considering a special appropriation for the critical biosecurity CRC; and, if not, why not?

                  The senator is wrong again on fact—wrong on fact. The $15 million that was given to the bushfire CRC was provided before their application was dealt with by the committee. The CRC committee assesses applications independent of government. The CRC committee assesses them against a range of criteria. If the applications are not good enough in terms of the CRC committee’s assessment, what would you have the government do? The CRC program is intended to provide funding to tackle major challenges for definite periods and with definite outcomes. The advice I have from senior
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
                   CSIRO
                  </a>
                  staff is that alternative funding models are probably more appropriate to address emerging infectious diseases such as the Hendra virus. It is inappropriate and dead wrong for you to suggest that we should politically intervene in the assessment process.
