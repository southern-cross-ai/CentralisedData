        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Brandis. I refer to former Liberal Premier Mr Kennett, who says that this government does not have a plan for the future of the country. It is Mr Kennett correct?

          , I ask a supplementary question. I refer again to Mr Kennett, who says that this government is trying to use this talk of a double dissolution—an early election—simply to cover up their own failings. Is Mr Kennett correct?

           Senator Collins, a lot of talk has been expended on when the election might be and whether or not there might be a double dissolution election, but no decision has been made. Mr Kennett is a private citizen and of course he is entitled to engage in all the commentary that he likes. But I can assure you of one thing, Senator Collins: when the election occurs there will be two very, very different visions for the future of Australia represented by the government and the party which you represent. We will be presenting a vision for the Australian people based on growth, prosperity and jobs. Growth, prosperity and jobs! Whereas, Senator Collins, all your side of politics have been able to come up with over the last year—throughout 2015, which was badged as the 'year of ideas'—are five new taxes. That is all you have been able to come up with—five new taxes! So we look forward to the election campaign very much, whenever it may be.

            , I ask a further supplementary question. I refer again to Mr Kennett, who says that Mr Turnbull took over the leadership for one reason only, and for one reason above all else, and that is his own self-interest. How can Australians trust a leader who puts his own self-interest first and the interests of all Australians last?

            </small>
            <p>
             I must say, Senator Collins, even by the standards of political combat in this chamber that is a very mean-spirited question, because there are very few people in public affairs in this country who have contributed more than Mr Malcolm Turnbull over a very long life. There are very few like Mr Turnbull who, before he embarked on a political career—a parliamentary career—contributed significantly in the 1990s as the leader of the Australian Republican movement, whose family has contributed vastly as personal philanthropists to a variety of charitable causes and who could have lived out a very comfortable life without committing himself to public life but has chosen to do so.
            </p>
            <p>
             We will be inviting the Australian people to compare Mr Malcolm Turnbull—the quality of the person that he is—to your leader, Mr Bill Shorten.
