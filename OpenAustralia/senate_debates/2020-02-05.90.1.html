         I thank Senator Davey for her question. I think one of the most tragic things that occurred during the bushfires was not only, obviously, the loss of life but also the devastating impact that these bushfires have had on the backbone of so many of these communities, the small and family businesses. I have met with a number of them. I have spoken with so many of them.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
         I've met with the peak bodies. And, as a result of their feedback, the government has put together a comprehensive suite of measures to support small and family businesses that have been impacted by the devastating bushfires.
        </p>
        <p>
         In terms of the package, what it is designed to do is make it easier both for those who have suffered direct damage as a result of the fires and for those who've also been, indirectly, economically impacted following the bushfires. It's all about assisting them, the backbone of these communities, get back on their feet. As a result of listening to the communities, listening to small businesses, the package deals with the challenges that we know these businesses are facing at this point in time.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our immediate priorities include grant fundingâ€”including top-up grant funding of up to $50,000 to eligible small businesses and not-for-profit organisations. This was really important, providing the access to concessional loans, up to half a million dollars for businesses that have suffered significant asset loss or significant loss of revenue as a result of the fires. What we have done with the loans is ensure that there is a two-year repayment holiday, and no interest will accrue during this time. This is a comprehensive package and it is designed to get them back on their feet.

            We're also providing them with much-needed tax relief, by deferring the lodgement and payment dates of business activity statements, income tax returns, through to 28 May. This was something that the small businesses told us that they needed. We're also allowing them, though, to vary their
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAYG" rel="nofollow">
             PAYG
            </a>
            instalments for the December quarter and claim refunds for the September quarter instalments. We're also providing them with much-needed financial advice, and small businesses can contact 132846 for information, in terms of what is actually available to them.
           </p>
           <p>
            Ultimately, we need them to get back on their feet and we need to help these communities build back better. What we're doing in that regard is putting in place local economic recovery plans. These local economic recovery plans are going to be led by the community. We're going to work directly with those communities so that they can build back better.

               As Senator Payne has just said to me: go to the regions; they are open for business. And that is exactly the feedback we are getting from small businesses in those affected regions. We heard from Pierre from
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangaroo_Island" rel="nofollow">
                Kangaroo Island
               </a>
               . He said, 'Yes, there have been bushfires on Kangaroo Island,' but, as Senator Ruston and Senator Birmingham know, they are open for business. I recently visited Bilpin. They make the most fantastic apple pies and apple ciders. They were also impacted by the bushfires. And guess what? They are open for business.
              </p>
              <p>
               I have to say, I received an email from Senator Bragg today, as so many of us would. Tomorrow, the Empty Esky campaign is coming here to
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
                Parliament House
               </a>
               , so we can all go and have that opportunity to meet some of the small businesses that have been impacted by the fires. You can also go online. If a small businesses is not necessarily up and running yet, guess what? They may have a website and you still might be able to go online and actually do some business with them.
