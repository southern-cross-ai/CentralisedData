        My question without notice is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Abetz. Is the Prime Minister aware that the Iraqi government of Nouri al-Maliki is fighting alongside Shia militias accused of ethnic cleansing, beheadings and death squads against the Sunnis in the fight against the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State" rel="nofollow">
         Islamic State
        </a>
        , which is committing the same gruesome crimes against the Shias? If so, what guarantee can you provide that the weapons Australia is delivering into northern Iraq will not end up in the hands of Shia militias and be turned on the new Iraqi government if it is a unity government including Sunnis?

It really beggars belief that the Leader of the Greens would come into this place and ask the sorts of questions that she has—

            I do find it a bit strange that the honourable senator should complain about rhetorical attacks, really. But setting that aside, the reality is that the world is facing a gruesome situation in Iraq. Sometimes when you are faced with those circumstances, very tough decisions need to be made.

              I accept Senator Di Natale's interjection, and put it on the record, that our involvement could make it worse. That is a possibility. But the Secretary-General of the United Nations does not agree with you.

              do? They would say, 'Don't be involved at all. Don't provide the wherewithal for minority ethnic groupings and minority religious groupings to be able to protect themselves from the barbarity of ISIL. As a government, we will do all we can, in lock-step with the international community, to protect these minorities from what would otherwise be an absolute slaughter.

               I have a supplementary question. Will the minister detail the direct contact the Prime Minister has had with the Iraqi government to date and say whether Australia has exerted diplomatic pressure to ensure that it will be inclusive of Sunnis and other minorities in the new government of Dr al-Abadi, or are we leaving that to the United States?

                 Australian Greens

                —or indeed anybody else—the direct contact that may or may not have been held in these very difficult circumstances, where it may well stand to reason that logistical and operational matters may have been discussed. Of course we are not going to divulge anything of that nature.

               <p>
                But I think what the Australian people can be absolutely assured of is that the Australian government—and, if I might say, especially through the leadership of our Prime Minister—has shown international leadership in relation to this issue, and we have seen support from diverse administrations from the United States, the United Kingdom and the other countries I previously mentioned, saying this is the right thing to do. What is more, it is supported by the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_and_the_United_Nations" rel="nofollow">

                . It seems the only ones not supportive are the Australian Greens.

I ask now: what contact have we had with the Turkish government regarding sealing its borders to prevent the movement of jihadists through Turkey to Syria? Have we had direct contact with them?

                   Australian Labor Party
                  </a>
                  taking a bipartisan approach, and the United Nations, the European Union and a smattering of democratic, peace-loving countries all on board, one wonders in what parallel universe the Australian Greens are actually residing. It really is very disappointing that we have got a cohort of senators in this place that cannot for once put politics aside on such a very important issue, when all the other senators and parties in this place can.
