         I thank Mr Farrell—Senator Farrell—very much for his note. Sorry to demote you, Senator Farrell; I didn't mean to do that! I think it's important to note that, as a government, we are absolutely committed to ensuring that Australians have the right skills for the workforce of today and, importantly, the workforce of the future. We know that it is necessary to ensure that our

           They're not the wrong notes, because if you had listened to the esteemed senator's question about the skills, then you would know that is exactly what he asked. So where are we investing? We're investing in the states and territories through the National Agreement for Skills and Workforce Development's specific purpose payments. We're investing in the Skilling Australians Fund—

             On relevance—the minister has not addressed the question whatsoever, which is: how have they managed to oversee skills shortages and wage stagnation at the same time? That is quite an achievement, and we're very interested in the answer.

              On the point of order, I don't think that points of order are appropriately used if it's to mislead the Senate. If Senator Watt had listened yesterday, he would know that real wages growth is higher than it was under Labor, and it's higher than it has been over the last 20 years.

                We have taken note of your exhortation not to simply repeat the question, but for the purposes of articulating a direct relevance point it is necessary to reference the question. Senator Watt didn't simply reference the fact that the subject matter—that is, skill shortages and wage stagnation at the same time—was not a matter that the minister had gone to.

                 I appreciate that. I'm listening carefully to the minister. I believe the material she is dealing with is directly related to the question. It may not be the answer in the form, the type or the substance of that sought by those asking it, but I think it is directly relevant. There are supplementary questions and a time to debate it after question time.

                  I am absolutely happy to concede that my error in commencing my answer was not to say that I reject the premise of the question from Senator Farrell, but it was very nice of Senator Watt to help Senator Farrell with his remarks. Most importantly, as I was indicating about our $3 billion investment in
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VET" rel="nofollow">
                   VET
                  </a>
                  , it includes the national agreement, the Skilling Australians Fund and our own skills program—including employer incentives and support for Australian apprenticeships—and the list goes on. Most importantly, I don't intend to take a lecture on skills from those opposite, because we know that the decline in apprenticeship commencements began under the former Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government. We know that the greatest fall in apprentice numbers on record occurred in 2012-13, when the number of apprenticeship commencements fell by 85,000 in a single year. Why did that fall happen? I'll tell you in a moment.

                             Thank you. On, I think, the leader of the government's point of order—who seems to now simply be dismissing every point of order that the opposition has—there is something in the standing orders called direct relevance. If the government doesn't want points of orders on it, perhaps their ministers could be directly relevant to the question.

                              On the point of order raised by Senator Watt, conceding his opening statement, I do, however, believe that the minister, by talking about wages growth, was directly relevant to the question. Again, I ask senators—I cannot instruct the minister how to answer a question. If the minister's talking about wages growth, in the context that she was, I believe that is directly relevant to the question. Senator Payne.

                               Thank you very much. I was saying that real wages grew by 0.7 per cent through the year to the June quarter. It was above the 20-year average of 0.6 per cent, above the rate of 0.4 per cent through the year of growth when Labor left office. Indeed, average weekly ordinary time earnings for full-time adults rose by 3.1 per cent over the past year, which is the strongest growth in six years.

                                      Order! First of all, I'm going to rule on the point that Senator Wong made. If senators don't like banter across the chamber, they shouldn't start it by

Those opposite would not be familiar with that concept. I understand that. But we also are very, very cognisant of the fact that there are significant headwinds, that the economies the world over are facing challenges. We are being prudent and careful in our management of the economy, led by the Treasurer and led by the finance minister, and Australians are looking forward with the opportunities that are ahead—including job creation, which is, of course, a key fundamental of our economic plan and our record.
