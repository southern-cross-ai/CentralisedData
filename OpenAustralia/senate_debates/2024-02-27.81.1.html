        My question is to the minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Gallagher. From 1 July, the Albanese Labor government is delivering a tax cut to every Australian taxpayer which is designed to help address the continued cost-of-living pressures Australians are facing. This will mean that working Australians will keep more of what they earn. Why is it important that the government's plan is delivered and how will it provide tangible relief to Australian households who are doing it tough?

         I thank Senator Bilyk for the question and for her advocacy for the people of the great state of Tasmania, where she comes from. From 1 July this year, the Albanese Labor government will deliver a tax cut for every Australian taxpayer—13.9 million people. Our tax cuts will deliver a bigger tax cut for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Middle Australia
         </a>
         to help ease the cost of living. The Albanese government is responding to the pressures that Australians are under here and now. Under our plan, more Australians will get a tax cut and more Australians will get a bigger tax cut.
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to Senator Bilyk's state of Tasmania, every taxpayer in Tasmania will receive a tax cut—all 280,000 Tasmanian taxpayers—and 260,000 of those taxpayers will receive a bigger tax cut under the government's tax cut policy. And 140,000 Tasmanian women will get a tax cut, and 130,000 of these women will get a bigger tax cut than they would have under the former government's proposal.
        </p>
        <p>
         Nurses, teachers and truckies are some of the most likely to benefit, with more than 95 per cent of those taxpayers getting a bigger tax cut. A person on an average income of around $73,000 will get a tax cut of $1,504—$804 more than they were going to get under the Liberal and National plan. A person earning $40,000 will get a tax cut of $654, compared with nothing under the Liberal and National plan. And a person earning $100,000 will get a tax cut of $2,179—$804 more than they would have received under those opposite. For a family on an average household income, they will receive $2,600, which is about $50 per week and $1,600 more than they would have received under the old plan.

           We know that Australians living in the regions face unique challenges and cost pressure associated with distance. Can you outline how the Albanese Labor government is committed to supporting these many and varied regional communities and how Labor's tax cut plan will benefit regional Australians?

            The Albanese Labor government's tax cuts overwhelmingly support regional Australians. For example, 86 per cent of taxpayers in western

             New South Wales

            will get a bigger tax cut under Labor's plan from 1 July. In

            , 87 per cent of taxpayers will get a bigger tax cut. In regional Victoria, 87 per cent of taxpayers will get a bigger tax cut. The vitally important workers of nurses, teachers, retail assistants, labourers, truckies and agricultural workers that live in regional Australia are some of the most likely to benefit. We recognise the contribution of these workers to our nation and to their local communities. Around 1.2 million people in

              Don't worry about running out of time, Minister; I've got a second supplementary. Why is Labor's tax cut plan superior for Australians living in regional Australia, and how will they be better off from 1 July when compared to the Morrison government's plan?

               Where I left off: in the Hunter, 250,000 taxpayers will be better off under Labor's new tax cut plan, with the region receiving an average tax cut of $1,564. In regional Victoria, 370,000 taxpayers will be better off under Labor's new tax cuts plan, with the region receiving an average tax cut of $1,467. In

                I don't know why those opposite hate hearing about people getting a tax cut. For tax cuts they support, they're very vocal when they're hearing all of this good news about the investments and support going to regional Australia through tax cuts.
