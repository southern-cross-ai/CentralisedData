             Papua New Guinea
            </a>
            . I ask the minister whether it is true, as stated in a new report from the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Conservation_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Conservation Foundation
            </a>
            and the Papua New Guinea Centre for

             Environmental Law
            </a>
            and Community Rights, that $400 million of illegal logging material is imported into Australia each year? Will the government stand by its pre-election commitments and statements from the current Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Abetz, that it will bring an end to this illegal influx of wood into Australia, which has some pretty terrible community consequences back in Papua New Guinea?

              , I raise a point of order. I will take your direction on that. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Abetz, is responsible for forests within this country. My question is to do with forestry in another country and the trade in goods. Senator Coonanâ€™s portfolio covers both those areas and the question is properly directed.

                 , I ask a supplementary question. A report does not deal with the question of whether the government is going to move to end the import of illegally logged material from
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
                  Papua New Guinea
                 </a>
                 . That is what the minister can give an answer to the chamber about. Is the minister aware that last week four non-government organisation staff were beaten by police while doing fieldwork in Papua New Guinea? Is she aware that a senior lawyer representing communities fighting logging issues has received death threats? Is she aware that several Greenpeace activists have been threatened with arrest on trumped-up charges in that country? Is the government prepared to use its undoubted huge diplomatic strength to bring an end to the corruption in this industry in Papua New Guinea?

                  I again thank Senator Brown for the supplementary question, which contained a number of assertions and assumptions. I am astounded that Senator Brown seems to know what is in the forthcoming report. With the greatest of respect, I suggest that Senator Brown wait for the report so that he can see the issues that will be dealt with.
