        Over the last few days we have again heard such strong and loud calls from young people, from women, from climate activists and from the Pacific islands leaders for Australia to act on climate. Devy, Sikha, Flora Vano, Rabia and Rhiannon are some of the women leading climate solutions across the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia_Pacific" rel="nofollow">
         Asia Pacific
        </a>
        . The climate crisis is not gender-neutral. Women and girls are impacted first and worst, particularly in the poorest countries, which are least responsible for it. It is affecting their lives every single day. It is affecting their ability to be educated as school are closed due to extreme heat, as funding for their education is used for disaster management and recovery. As access to water in schools becomes harder and harder, there is no water for girls' sanitary needs and during menstruation. I thank these women for their tireless activism for climate justice. Every day that the Labor government delays ending new coal and gas is a day that worsens the impacts for these women and girls.

       <p>
        We also had a display in parliament of artefacts created by communities from across the world, including the Pacific,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia" rel="nofollow">
         South Asia
        </a>
        and South-East Asia, the Caribbean and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait" rel="nofollow">
         Torres Strait
        </a>
        . These artefacts are such important reminders of the unique aspects of culture and tradition that we are set to lose if we don't tackle the climate crisis. Each piece was a testament to the unique customs, beliefs and practices that have defined generations of communities. Those on the front line of the climate crisis bear a disproportionate burden, and wealthy colonial countries like Australia bear profound responsibility. So we must do more, and that means no new fossil fuels. That means contributing our fair share to the loss and damage fund. That means paying climate reparations. This is not charity. This is a debt owed for the harms that we have caused.
