              The Liberals

             are demonising thousands of people for cheap political purposes—cheap political purposes. One person is before the courts, and it would not be appropriate to comment further on that case. All people in Australia are subject to Australian law. The opposition's campaign of misinformation cannot be allowed to continue, and the member for McMillan is making that point.

            <p>
             These are the facts: before anyone is released from detention, they are subject to a security assessment, including identity checks. People on bridging visas are required by law to report to the immigration department regularly and to advise of any change of address. Any person in Australia is required to abide by the law. Failure to do so should result in criminal proceedings, no matter who they are. The opposition are cynically exploiting the incident which is before the courts, to cause fear and unrest in the broader community. And this continues their relentless negativity in opposition, in which they supported offshore processing but voted against it; they supported the increase in the humanitarian intake to 20,000 people and then changed their minds—

                It is hard, I know, Senator Hanson-Young, to believe that they could sink to a new low! It really is hard to believe that on this issue, above all else, they could sink lower. But I have to confess I suspect you could be right. I suspect you could be right that they have found a new low. We have seen the opposition today continue its negative, knee-jerk approach to immigration policy. The party which brought us temporary protection visas now wants an immediate freeze on all bridging visas. We know that the former government had no qualms about leaving people, including women and children, behind razor wire for years while their claims were assessed in Australia. The opposition must now explain how they would pay for their new policy of scrapping bridging visas and keeping people in detention. Those opposite—
