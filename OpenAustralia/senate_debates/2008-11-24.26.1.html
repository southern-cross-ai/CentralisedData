        My question is also to Senator Carr, both in his own right as Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research and also representing the Minister for Trade, Mr Crean. I wonder if the minister could tell the Senate by what percentage investment in Australia’s biotechnology sector has collapsed since the government axed the vital Commercial Ready program, thereby breaking another one of its election promises—this one to revitalise Australia’s innovation system?

         The question that the senator asked me in relation to biotechnology is an important one. The portfolio that I administer spends some $390 million a year on research and industry support for biotechnology alone. This expenditure on biotechnology varies from year to year, as much of it is provided through investigator driven programs or the National Competitive Grants Program. I would expect that support provided through the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
          CSIRO
         </a>
         , the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Research_Council" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Research Council
         </a>
         , the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy and programs under AusIndustry like the Innovation Investment Fund would also continue to provide a broadly equivalent level of support. The new Climate Ready Program of $75 million over four years can provide support for biotechnology projects as well. They contribute to tackling climate change and the environmental challenges that are facing Australia.

         Recent media coverage indicates that local investors are shying away from high-risk technology start-up companies in response to the global financial instability. There is an indication that the focus of the biotechnology and other high-tech sectors may shift away from fundraising activities and turn instead to licensing in technology. So the government is considering the recommendations of the report of the

          Review of the National Innovation System

         and is now developing a white paper outlining a 10-year plan for promoting innovation across the country. The changes proposed by the national innovation review to introduce tax credits and extend the Innovation Investment Fund should be also welcomed by the innovation sector in that regard.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I wonder if the minister could indicate whether he accepts that the shying off of investment which he referred to in his answer is because the Commercial Ready program was axed by his government? I am pleased that the minister mentioned Dr Terry Cutler’s

           The proposed competitive innovation grants program, recommended by Dr Cutler and his review panel, is different from the former Commercial Ready program. The panel identified a gap in assistance for innovative small and medium sized enterprises with limited access to capital in the high-risk proof of concept and development stages of projects. If such firms do not have the necessary capital to test new concepts, they would not be able to use the tax credit arrangements that are being proposed in other parts of Dr Cutler’s report, nor for that matter the existing arrangements—and, of course, they would need to spend a lot more money than they currently spend to achieve that outcome. So the associated high risk of investment means that third-party investors are very unlikely to assist such firms. The proposed competitive innovation grants program targets support to national priorities—

            Senator Carr has accepted that there are now two gaps in the program in his department, but the minister would be aware that the Export Market Development Grants Scheme, for which he has responsibility in this chamber, also encourages investment in innovation. Will the minister guarantee that the government will not further harm Australia’s investment in innovation by axing the Export Market Development Grants Scheme—like it did to the Commercial Ready program? Further, will the Minister for Trade,

But I would point out that Senator Macdonald, in his primary question, quite clearly referred to Australia’s innovation system. That was the premise of the question and it was the premise of the supplementary question, and I therefore believe it is entirely in order.

                  , on the point of order: I ask you to rule on the point made by Senator Abetz. It seems to me that the proposition the opposition are now advancing—after having said that the ‘new’ question time is about homing in on relevance—is that they can in the same question ask a minister a question that goes to both their own responsibilities and responsibilities that fall to other ministers whom they may not represent. It seems to me that Senator Abetz has just advanced the proposition that one could be asked a question in one portfolio and that the supplementary question, or indeed the primary question, could be asked with both hats on. But fundamentally he has proposed that a supplementary could then be asked of a different portfolio. That is not my understanding of how we have operated over the years. Mr President, I would ask you to rule on that because it seems to me quite a departure from how we have operated in the past.

                   , on the point of order: the issue that is currently before you and which we are debating in the Senate is about whether or not it is permissible to ask a question that encompasses a minister in their portfolio capacity and also in their representative capacity. Minister Carr did not at the commencement of his answer take any point of order in relation to the relevance of the question and how he would deal with it in either capacity. The question as framed and the supplementaries are directly relevant to the capacities in which he chose to commence his answer, and he ought to be asked to complete it.

                    , on the point of order: clearly, we have now got to a position where Senator Evans has asked you to rule on the issue, and I encourage that course of action, if I may, with respect. We do have the second issue, though, which I would also ask you to look at, which relates to the relevance of the supplementary—that is, the final supplementary—to the question itself. Senator Evans has asked in relation to the issue that revolves around cross-portfolio matters, but there is also the additional matter about the relevance of the second supplementary question to the primary question, because the rules in relation to relevance have not changed with respect to supplementary questions under the new system.

                          Order! Can we have silence. On the point of order: we are in a trial, as I outlined in the statement to the Senate at the start of question time. I have been pretty fair, I believe, in allowing question time to flow, and I have tried to listen very carefully to the points that have been made in the questions by all those who have asked questions today. There will be issues that arise out of the new system, which I would be very reluctant at this very early stage of the trial to make a pronouncement upon. Suffice it to say that, on the points of order that have been raised at this stage, all I will rule at this stage is that Senator Carr is obliged to answer that part of the question that applies to his portfolio. I will review the points of order that have been made today. I will review the primary questions, the secondary questions and, as a matter of fact, all questions that have been asked to check the issue of relevance and to make sure that, as we progress through this trial, there is a little bit of patience and that we iron out these chinks, if there are chinks there in the first place.

                             , I raise a point of order. My point of order, respectfully, goes to the last phase you used, Mr President, and a little earlier in your ruling. I appreciate the point you make about the trial, and that is why I raised the point of order in the spirit I did. My point of order in response to your ruling relates to Senator Carr’s representational responsibilities. I think that is a critical element, because surely the ruling that you have made would also apply to any representational responsibilities that Senator Carr has—in other words, it is not just a question of his portfolio; it is a question also of a portfolio that he is representing, which is part of—

                                 , in relation to your ruling, I would just ask that, as you have indicated, you will take away and consider a number of matters from today. Could I ask you to also ponder on your ruling that the minister is required to answer a supplementary on any parts to his portfolio. I thought the primary objective was for the supplementaries to be relevant to the primary question. Perhaps you could consider that as an issue as well in terms of the ruling that you have just given. I think it bears on the general conduct of question time.

I believe that I will give due consideration particularly to the latter points that have been raised—even though Senator Abetz did not get to his feet—and that were raised by Senator Faulkner. I believe that, if this question time is to operate, it needs to operate in good faith, and people need to understand the terms by which it operates. I am not going to see anyone placed at a disadvantage either as the questioner or as the person who responds to a question when it is raised in this chamber. I will take a close look in particular at the issue that has been raised by Senator Macdonald as well. I have asked Senator Carr to proceed at this stage to answer that part of the question that applies to the portfolio responsibilities of Senator Carr. Senator Carr, you now have time to answer that question.
