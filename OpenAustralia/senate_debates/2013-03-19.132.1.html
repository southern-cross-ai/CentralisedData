       <p>
        I rise tonight to speak about the coalition's technophobia and how the Leader of the Opposition refuses to grasp the many benefits that will flow from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network" rel="nofollow">
         National Broadband Network
        </a>
        . Recently the Joint Standing Committee on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        released its fourth report examining the NBN's rollout performance. I note the typically misguided comments of Senator Simon Birmingham during the tabling of the report and the confused, directionless content of the coalition's dissenting report. But, of course, when it comes to distorting information and presenting few viable alternatives for Australia's broadband policy, those opposite me in the chamber have form.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the last several years the opposition leader has embarrassed himself on numerous occasions when it comes to discussing the NBN. Few of us could forget his clumsy performance on
        <i>
         7 30
        </i>
        when he confessed that he was not a 'tech head'. In fact, when quizzed on the basics—the absolute basics—of roughly how many towers the opposition would have to build to implement his plan, he responded that he was no
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates" rel="nofollow">
         Bill Gates
        </a>
        . Well, for once, Mr Abbott, I agree with you—you are no Bill Gates. In fact, you do not have any real understanding of broadband policy and your own party's plan is not good enough.
       </p>
       <p>
        If you are confused about the coalition's broadband policy, you are not the only one. At various points the opposition leader has indicated that he will demolish the NBN, but the opposition's plan has at some points drifted closer to the government's NBN model. In fact, in June last year his communications spokesman indicated he would 'complete the job of NBN Co', but Mr Turnbull has consistently failed to flesh out the coalition's telecommunications policy, promising something different every week. As the communications minister commented last year, Mr Turnbull made 684 tweets, issued 23 press releases and delivered seven public speeches in 2012 but did not release a broadband policy. Also, Mr Turnbull says he cannot yet quantify the cost of his plan, and I use the term very loosely.
       </p>
       <p>
        As we stand, Australia's telecommunications infrastructure just has not kept pace with the needs of Australians. Many other countries such as Japan are moving ahead with fibre-to-the-home broadband options, but the coalition does not seem to recognise that this is the future. They just are not up to speed—pun intended. I think the following comment from the opposition leader in July last year says it all. Asked about Australia's state of infrastructure he said the NBN was—and this is a direct quote—a '$50 billion investment with borrowed money that we don't need'. What we do need, he said, is 'much more money being spent on our roads, our rail and our ports'. Of course Australia needs continued development of its roads, rail and ports—another area neglected under the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Howard Government
        </a>
        —but in the 21st century fibre-optic cables are absolutely essential to the modern Australian economy. The NBN is not a 'white elephant', Mr Abbott; it is the future of this country's telecommunications policy.
       </p>
       <p>
        It would appear that the opposition leader's primary concern is opposing the NBN to gain a perceived political edge. He is opposed to it because his party is intent on thwarting what will be a valuable infrastructure development that will revolutionise the lives of Australians. Like any other policy initiative announced by the government, when it comes to the NBN the opposition leader is a wrecker, not a builder. He cannot explain the basis of his own broadband policy, not only because he is not a 'tech head' but because he does not genuinely believe in it or understand it. As long as he can criticise the government's NBN for being too ambitious and expensive, nothing else matters to him.
       </p>
       <p>
        There was another scheme which in its time was criticised for being too big, too expensive and a waste. It was the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme. At the time, Australians heard that it may prove irrelevant, a white elephant even, because atomic power would completely replace the hydro scheme. This is just the same sort of argument we are hearing now from those opposite when they flail their arms around and doubt the value of fibre versus wireless.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australians rely on capable internet speeds for a variety of commercial and personal uses. Overall, we are enthusiastic users of the internet. The problem is that, after 11 years of infrastructure neglect under the former coalition government, we have fallen considerably behind in terms of global internet speeds. It is a fact that those opposite me in the chamber should be ashamed of. This was a key factor in why the rural Independents did not back the opposition leader.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independents" rel="nofollow">
         The Independents
        </a>
        knew that the NBN was vital for remote and regional Australia and they knew that the opposition leader did not understand the NBN. It must keep the opposition leader awake at night. Depending on who you listen to, he was willing to offer everything to

        ; he was willing to double our refugee intake; he was willing to offer a $200 million zonal tax trial; he was perhaps even willing to sell his own backside. But you cannot fake sincerity, you cannot fake awareness and you cannot fake an appreciation of why fast—

          On the point of order, Madam Acting Deputy President: I think that terminology about what Mr Abbott was prepared to do is actually a quote from Mr Windsor. I think it is on the public record that he said that Mr Abbott was prepared to sell himself.

             Thank you very much, Madam Acting Deputy President. But you cannot fake sincerity and you cannot fake awareness and you cannot fake an appreciation of why fast broadband speeds are so vital. He begged for the top job. He pleaded. He cajoled, he demanded and he did everything he could think of. But he never understood the importance of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
              NBN
             </a>
             and he had no alternatives to offer the Independent MPs. In the end, of course, NBN was the clincher. It was the issue the Independent MPs kept coming back to and it was the issue where the Labor Party held such a clear advantage over the coalition. It must keep Mr Abbott awake. Certainly in Tasmania it was the clincher for why we were so successful at the last election. Shame on you, Mr Abbott, for seeking to cynically exploit the NBN and lower the standard of public debate once again. Shame on you,
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Turnbull" rel="nofollow">
              Malcolm Turnbull
             </a>
             , for ignoring your better judgment and betraying the sort of moderate conservatives who value the NBN—the same people who consider you their leader in exile. Shame on you, National Party members and senators, for not speaking up and not pushing harder against the stance adopted by your partner in arms, the Liberal Party, particularly since you know that the NBN will benefit your targeted constituents in remote and regional Australia more than anyone else. Shame on you.
            </p>
            <p>
             The people of Tasmania, along with Australians everywhere, are eager to take advantage of the NBN, construction of which recently commenced in a number of new locations including
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Launceston" rel="nofollow">
              South Launceston
             </a>
             in my home state of Tasmania. Over 14,500 homes and businesses can now connect to the NBN fibre network and work is underway to connect a further 70,000 premises. When it comes to broadband speeds, Australia can afford to be bold. One of the disadvantages that Australia faces competing in the global economy is the tyranny of distance. That is why we need to be embrace a broadband strategy that features fibre optic cables delivering world-class internet speeds straight to homes and businesses. For too long people living in regional and remote areas in my home state of Tasmania and, in fact, around Australia have had to put up with slow, unreliable
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADSL" rel="nofollow">
              ADSL
             </a>
             services. Some have endured the frustration of not being able to connect at all. Labor believes that fast broadband should not be seen as a privilege enjoyed by some but rather as an essential utility, just like water or electricity, that should be available to everyone. The NBN will keep the Australian economy expanding and lead to innovations and improvements in the lives of Australians that were not considered possible until now. Look at the benefits not only to businesses and to us as private citizens but for our schools and as far as health is concerned. The only complaint I get when I move around Tasmania—and, in fact, other parts of Australia—is that people want broadband and they want it now. I am very proud that this government has taken the lead after 11½ very long years of the Howard coalition government being in there and not investing in Australia's future or our economy.
