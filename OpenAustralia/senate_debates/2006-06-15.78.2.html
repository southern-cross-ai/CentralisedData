        by leave—I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Turkey and Ireland, which took place from 16 to 28 October 2005. I seek leave to move a motion to take note of the document.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That the Senate take note of the document.
       </p>
       <p>
        The delegation conducted a successful and enjoyable visit to Turkey and Ireland, meeting all its agreed aims and objectives. I thank my fellow delegation members: Senator Stephens, the deputy leader of the delegation, who is Irish-born, which made her an instant celebrity in Ireland; and Senators Andrew Bartlett and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Marshall" rel="nofollow">
         Gavin Marshall
        </a>
        , together with Mr
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerry_Bartlett" rel="nofollow">
         Kerry Bartlett
        </a>
        and Mr Phil Barresi from the House of Representatives. The camaraderie between members of the delegation made this a very enjoyable group to lead and it contributed to the overall success of the delegation’s visit.
       </p>
       <p>
        Prior to departure, the delegation received very valuable and comprehensive briefings from the Irish Ambassador, Mr Declan Kelly, and the Turkish Ambassador, Mr Tansu Okandan. While Mr Okandan has now completed his posting to Australia, the delegation was pleased to meet his replacement, Mr Murat Ersavci, at a formal reception hosted by the Australian Ambassador, Ms Jean Dunn, while in Ankara.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia enjoys a strong and friendly relationship with Turkey. While the relationship has a strong foundation with the events of Gallipoli, and the shared experience which played such an important role in the developing nationhood of both countries, recent high-level visits to both countries have seen a broadening in the scope of the relationship. Prime Minister Howard visited Turkey in April 2005, and this was reciprocated by Prime Minister Erdogan who, accompanied by senior ministers, visited Australia in December 2005. These and other ministerial and high-level visits have led to many developments, including enhanced trade opportunities, agricultural cooperation, a work and holiday visa arrangement, defence cooperation and dialogue on a range of international, political and security issues.
       </p>
       <p>
        Before commencing its formal program, the delegation visited
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kemal_Ataturk" rel="nofollow">
         Kemal Ataturk
        </a>
        ’s mausoleum and participated in a wreath-laying ceremony. The delegation held a number of valuable meetings with members of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Grand_National_Assembly" rel="nofollow">
         Turkish Grand National Assembly
        </a>
        , including Minister Osman Pepe, who has visited Australia, the chairmen and members of a number of parliamentary committees, and the Turkish-Australian Parliamentary Friendship Group.
       </p>
       <p>
        Prospects for trade and opportunities for an increased business relationship with Australia and Australian companies were discussed with members of the Ankara Chamber of Commerce, as well as at meetings with the governorships of Istanbul and Canakkale. Austrade now operates a post in Istanbul and, with the work of Senior Trade Commissioner Damian Fisher, a number of key growth areas have been identified as providing opportunities for Australian companies—including infrastructure programs, oil and gas production, education and training, information and communication technologies, and health care and medical products. The delegation also met members of the Istanbul arts and cultural community with Mr Fisher, and discussed opportunities for cultural exchange and film and project investment.
       </p>
       <p>
        The delegation felt honoured and was deeply moved by visiting the sites at Anzac Cove,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lone_Pine" rel="nofollow">
         Lone Pine
        </a>
        and other places that play such an important role in our national history. It is truly difficult to grasp the enormity of the courage and the sacrifice that was displayed in gaining, and ultimately losing, such small areas of land. Gallipoli Peninsula Peace Park, which includes not just Anzac Cove but other sites of importance to the Turks and the British, is now attracting an increasing number of visitors, and that has resulted in the need for development to improve access and facilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian embassy had compiled a most valuable and interesting program of meetings and visits in Turkey. On behalf of the delegation, I particularly thank Ambassador Jean Dunn for her wise advice and assistance at formal meetings and for hosting the delegation. I also thank Mr Brian Dunn for his support of the accompanying spouses and all the embassy staff, but especially Libby Petrovic and Elif Wade, who capably and professionally assisted the delegation to ensure that the visit ran smoothly.
       </p>
       <p>
        The program for the visit to Ireland was organised by the Irish Parliamentary Association and consisted of a busy schedule, with a balance of official meetings, interesting and informative visits and social occasions. I particularly thank Dr Rory O’Hanlon, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceann_Comhairle" rel="nofollow">
         Ceann Comhairle
        </a>
        or Speaker, who provided so much of his valuable time to be with the delegation at official and social occasions, including hosting a visit to his home county of Monaghan. I also thank Mr Seamus Pattison, the Deputy Speaker, for the visit to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Kilkenny" rel="nofollow">
         County Kilkenny
        </a>
        . To Cait Hayes and Jackie Leavy of the Irish Parliamentary Association office goes our special gratitude for accompanying the delegation and ensuring that the visit was a success. Cait and her staff certainly exemplify the famous generosity and warmth of Irish hospitality.
       </p>
       <p>
        The relationship between Ireland and Australia is based on an old friendship that arises from over 30 per cent of Australians claiming some Irish ancestry. Many of the people that the delegation met had visited Australia, had family in Australia or had children who worked or studied in Australia. In the case of Senator Stephens, many of her family still remain in Ireland.
       </p>
       <p>
        The delegation was able to discuss a range of international and domestic economic, social and political issues with political leaders, including their gracious and charming President, Mary McAlese;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Harney" rel="nofollow">
         Mary Harney
        </a>
        , the Tainaiste or Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Children; Senator Rory Kiely, the Cathaoirleach or Chairperson of the Senate; leaders of the main political parties; and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Joint Committee
        </a>
        on Foreign Affairs.
       </p>
       <p>
        The economic growth in Ireland in recent years was reinforced through visits to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_Docklands_Development_Authority" rel="nofollow">
         Dublin Docklands Development Authority
        </a>
        and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Financial_Services_Centre" rel="nofollow">
         International Financial Services Centre
        </a>
        , which has attracted major global banks and insurance companies to locate in Ireland.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Foundation_Ireland" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        also successfully attracts international and local researchers by investing in academic researchers and teams who can generate new knowledge and leading-edge technologies in fields underpinning biotechnology, information and communications technologies and emerging opportunities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The delegation visited the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Studies_Centre" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Studies Centre
        </a>
        at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College" rel="nofollow">
         University College
        </a>
        of Dublin. This centre offers courses in Australian history to undergraduates. It also conducts Australian studies research seminars and occasional conferences, although it does not have the funding or resources to support other projects such as a visiting speakers program. The centre plays a valuable role in providing a background on Australia and Australian history to students who, upon graduation, will enter influential fields within the commercial, legal and political arenas. The delegation was pleased to be able to gain an appreciation not just of the pride with which their links to Australia are held but also of Irish rural life through visiting and meeting with people outside the capital city and experiencing the diversity that is Ireland’s culture and heritage.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also thank Elton Humphrey, the secretary of the delegation, for his dedication, for making sure that everything was done for us as delegation members and for the efficient manner in which he conducted himself. He made our trip more enjoyable. Finally, I should mention the accompanying spouses, because this was, it is fair to say, a very happy delegation, due in no small part to Senator Stephens’s husband, Bob, who, being the only male spouse, was a very good shopping companion of my wife, Anne, and Kerry Bartlett’s wife, Christine. They contributed very much to the success of this visit. Their contribution, both in Turkey and in Ireland, added to the impact of the visit of this delegation to both countries. I thank them for their contribution on what I think has been a worthwhile exercise.

        <p>
         I would like to speak very briefly in support of the comments by Senator Ferguson. It was a great privilege to participate in the parliamentary delegation to Turkey and to Ireland. For me, it was a very special trip to Ireland because, as Senator Ferguson said, I was a celebrity wherever I went as soon as they realised I was born there. It was very special.
        </p>
        <p>
         One of the most moving experiences that any delegation can have is to visit Canakkale to look at the graveyards there. It makes you appreciate the significance of the whole Anzac story. That was certainly the case for the delegation this time. I join with Senator Ferguson in thanking Her Excellency Ambassador Dunn and her husband, and all the embassy staff in Turkey. They did an amazing job. They kept us on our toes. We were briefed extensively on cultural, economic and political issues. We were there at a time when there was a heightened security alert, and we got to understand what the impacts of that were on the country, and that was very significant and very important for us to understand.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to speak briefly today, because I know we have a lot of business ahead of us. I want to make some comments about the trip to Ireland and the fact that for me it was very significant. We went back to where I was born, Wicklow. That was an emotional experience, but it was also fascinating to be able to show the delegation where I was born and the people who are so significant to me. We were able, by visiting Wicklow jail, to make a very concrete connection between our earlier visit to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Monaghan" rel="nofollow">
          County Monaghan
         </a>
         and the Carrickmacross poorhouse in County Monaghan, which was where many people gave up everything and then finally were accepted on ships for Australia. It was where a lot of Australia’s Irish immigrants came from. To see that and then the Wicklow jail, which is a very significant historic jail, demonstrated the connections with Australia. It was graphically demonstrated as well, as we had a re-enactment of floggings and drama to get us into the atmosphere. That was very significant.
        </p>
        <p>
         Most significant too, though, was the engagement that we had with the members of the Irish parliament. We met members of all parties and had side meetings. We had a meeting with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fianna_Fail" rel="nofollow">
          Fianna Fail
         </a>
         ,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_Gael" rel="nofollow">
          Fine Gael
         </a>
         , the Greens and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party" rel="nofollow">
          Labour Party
         </a>
         . Some of us met with some
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinn_Fein" rel="nofollow">
          Sinn Fein
         </a>
         members, which was also very important. Listening to the political dynamics of what is going on in Ireland was very significant as well. That is something you do not get to do very often and it was much appreciated.
        </p>
        <p>
         We were very well looked after by Dr Rory O’Hanlon. We were overwhelmed by his hospitality. First of all, informally, when we arrived in Ireland very late one evening—I think it was almost midnight by the time we got to the motel—there was Dr O’Hanlon waiting to greet us officially. Not only did he do that and meet us the next day but he also picked me up for mass at 7 o’clock on the Sunday morning. It was just lovely to do that and to experience an Irish mass. It is exactly the same as a mass in Australia, I have to say, but it was beautiful, and it was very thoughtful of him and his wife. Then I went back to his house and actually had morning tea with him—that was an extraordinary personal gesture that he made.
        </p>
        <p>
         He looked after us so well during the delegation. On the final evening we had a dinner. I just felt that it was such an extraordinary experience that I wanted to express my appreciation for all that had been done. So I did, in Gaelic. I would actually like to put on the parliamentary record what I said in Gaelic, if I may. What I said on behalf of all of the delegation members was:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Ta athas an domhan ar an toscaireacht a bheith anseo inniu_go haraithe me fhein, mar ta me arais i mo thir dhuchais.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Rugadh I gCill Maintain me agus ce go bfhuil conai orm anois san Astrail, mothaim go bfhuil me abaile abhus in Eirinn.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Is cuis bhroduil idom a bheith libh mar ionaidhi de mo thir nua, an Astrail

         -tir in a rinne munitir na h Eireann sar-obhair o bunaoidh i nios mo na dha chead bliain o shoin.
        </p>
        <p>
         Basically, what I said on behalf of us all was that our delegation was delighted to be there and that I was especially pleased to be back in Ireland. I was born in Wicklow and, even though I live in Australia, I still felt very much at home in Ireland. I was very proud to be there that day as a representative of Australia, a country to which Irish people had made such a huge contribution since its foundation over 200 years ago. It was a wonderful trip. I concur with Senator Ferguson. The company was fantastic, the support we had from everyone was wonderful and I think we all learned immensely. I think we did something good about strengthening the relationship between Australia and those two countries.
