        My question today is to the Minister for

         Climate Change
        </a>
        and Water, Senator Wong. I refer the minister to comments she made yesterday when she told the ABC that a call from scientists to return 700 gigalitres of water as environmental flows to the dying Lower Lakes and Coorong River system in our home state of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        would not be a responsible way forward. Given scientists have warned that the Lower Lakes and the Coorong will collapse if this action is not taken, does the minister consider doing nothing to be more responsible? Is it responsible to ignore the science?

         What is irresponsible would be for senators from our home state of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         to argue for a position which essentially says that we will not draw any drinking water for Adelaide from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_River" rel="nofollow">
          Murray River
         </a>
         . The report recommends some 3,800 gigalitres be delivered to the Lower Lakes but fails to note that because of climate change and drought we are at record low levels. To get that amount of water, Senator Hanson-Young, would be more than all the water for six out of seven years—all the water that was diverted for drinking, farming and environmental purposes. That is what this would require. I absolutely stand by my proposition that it would be irresponsible.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course we are acting on the science. That is why we have taken over basin-wide planning. That is why we will ensure that this government will deliver what we said we would deliver, which is, for the first time in the nation’s history, a cap on extraction from the Murray-Darling Basin based on science—something no party in this chamber has previously delivered. We are acting on the science, but if we are going to talk about how we handle the extremely low levels of water that we currently are experiencing, particularly in the southern Murray-Darling, then we should get the facts on the table. I would say this to the senator: does she believe it is responsible for her to lobby for the imposition of a total ban on

             <p>
              If the senator is not aware, water restrictions are not a matter for the federal government. They are matters either for the state or, in some states, for local government to impose. They are certainly not matters that the federal government deals with.
             </p>
             <p>
              I want to come back to this issue of rejecting the science. Rejecting the science is a proposition that pretends not to notice that we do not have enough water. That is what rejecting the science is. Responsibly acting on the science is ensuring we have policies to recognise that we have a significant reduction in water, to impose a limit based on science and to purchase water and invest in irrigation savings to return water to the river. That is the responsible course of action and an action absolutely predicated on the science rather than pretending that we can simply conjure up water that anybody who looks at the facts knows is simply not there.
