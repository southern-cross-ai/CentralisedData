        In troduction
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government welcomes the opportunity to respond to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee report: Adequacy of Australia's biosecurity measures and response preparedness, in particular with respect to foot-and mouth disease and varroa mite, tabled on 8 December 2022.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government takes very seriously the increasing risk of pest and disease entry into the country as the climate changes and global trade and travel patterns shift. While Australia remains free of foot and mouth disease, the Australian Government is working with other governments, industry and internationally to mitigate the risks to Australia of further spread of the disease and strengthen our collective preparedness and response capability.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We will continue to work with other governments and industry on the current eradication response for varroa mite and will consider the views of the Committee as this work progresses.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government's response to the report is set out below. The response addresses the recommendations contained in the report and takes into account additional contextual information provided by the Committee subsequent to the report's release in relation to the intent of some recommendations.

        Response
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government supports this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry is responsible for assessing the biosecurity risks associated with the import of a range of goods from overseas. Regular reviews are undertaken, and risk analyses may be conducted, in response to new information about biosecurity risks, or to an import proposal. These reviews aim to modernise Australia's biosecurity measures for imported products to reflect the current and future trading environment. They take into account new and relevant peer-reviewed scientific information, international standards, relevant changes in industry practices and operational practicalities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 3

         PHA
        </a>
        ) to develop a national plant health surveillance co-investment model as part of its scoping of a Nationally Integrated Surveillance System for Plant Pests (NISSPP). The government will consider the implementation of the NISSPP, once finalised.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Governments are also considering how the current varroa response experience can help inform future surveillance programs noting that all national cost-shared responses under the Emergency Plant Pest Response Deed (EPPRD) must undertake an after-action review led by PHA and involving both government and industry parties. The outcomes of the review and the response itself will be used to inform the National Bee Pest Surveillance Program.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 7
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

Five of those 10 have been completed and all 5 were high priority, 4 DAFF actions have been started and 1 is to be commenced. The NIABP is scheduled for a mid-term review in 2023 when remaining actions will be re-prioritised and assigned to DAFF, state and territory authorities,

       <p class="italic">
        Response
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government does not support this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        State and territory governments hold the legislative responsibility for the management of feral animals in Australia. The Australian Government provides support, including funding, for management where this is in the national interest or on Commonwealth land.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government uses a variety of funding models to assist state and territory governments, natural resource management groups, Traditional Owners and land managers to effectively control feral animals in Australia, reducing impacts to provide economic and environmental benefits. These include the National Landcare Program, National Environmental Science Program, Supporting Communities Manage Pest Animals and Weeds Program and other grant programs. These programs have reporting and review mechanisms.

       <p class="italic">
        With the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) we continue to work to improve understanding of the distribution, abundance, as well as impacts (including economics) of established pest animals on primary production and the environment.
