        My question is to the Minister for Finance, Senator Cormann. I refer to the minister who yesterday said in relation to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        Liberal Party's preference deal with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Nation" rel="nofollow">
         One Nation
        </a>
        : 'I have seen comments from the Premier which describe the arrangement entered into by the WA Liberal Party organisation as sensible and pragmatic. I would agree with the Premier's description.' Does the minister consider One Nation's economic policies to be so fiscally responsible that they should be preferenced above his mates the National Party?

         I thank Senator Sterle for his question. Of course I do agree with the Premier of the great state of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         ,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Barnett" rel="nofollow">
          Colin Barnett
         </a>
         , in relation to those comments. What I would say to the Senate is what I have said publicly—unlike at the federal level, in Western Australia the Liberal and National parties operate as independent parties, not as a coalition. My personal preference always is for the Liberal and National parties to act as we do here at the national level, as a strong and united coalition where we direct preferences to each other. But in Western Australia that has not been the circumstance for a very long time. Indeed, since 2008 the Nationals under Brendon Grylls's leadership, and we respected that this was their right as a separate party, have preferenced other parties ahead of Liberal Party candidates. They have done so at every election since 2008 in the upper house, and indeed they are doing that at this election. This is nothing unusual. It has been business as usual for a long time. In fact, the WA Nationals preferenced
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Nation" rel="nofollow">
          One Nation
         </a>
         ahead of Liberal Party candidates in the upper house back in 2008, and in this election the WA Nationals are preferencing the Greens ahead of Liberal Party candidates, believe it or not.
        </p>
        <p>
         While my own personal preference and the experience at a national level and in all other parts of Australia is that there is a strong and united coalition, in Western Australia there is an alliance arrangement between independent parties and as such each party makes its own decisions on preference allocations. Our priority, incidentally, is to convince as many Western Australians as possible to support their Liberal Party candidates in the legislative assembly and in the upper house with their primary vote, with their first preference. If they cannot vote for our candidates with their first preference, we encourage them to give us their second, third or fourth preference—as long as it is ahead of the Labor Party and the Greens, because of course they would be disastrous for Western Australia.

                    Let me be very explicit. Firstly, these are matters that are of course entirely within the purview of the WA Liberal organisation. Let me confirm for Senator Sterle, given his great interest in these matters, that I had absolutely no reason to discuss these matters with the Prime Minister because these are not my areas of responsibility at a national level. These are entirely matters for the WA Liberal Party organisation.
