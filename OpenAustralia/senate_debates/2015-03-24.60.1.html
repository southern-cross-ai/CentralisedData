Why has this recommendation now been sitting on the industry minister's desk for 10 months? Given the CRC's current funding expires at the end of June, why is the minister putting at risk 20 science and engineering jobs because of his failure to act?

             Apparently, taking it on notice is amusing. I will take it on notice. What I will say in relation to the CRCs— the shadow minister for industry probably does not know, so I had better tell him—is that a review of the CRC program was announced on 16 September. Mr David Miles AM is leading that review. We are talking about what the future will be for the CRCs. I expect, from what I have here, that he will be reporting back to the minister in the next month or so. When we get Mr Miles's report then we will have a look at it. The trouble is that these are questions that were asked at Senate estimates, and Senator Carr knows exactly what the process is. He has been shamed into asking a question after nearly nine months. He knows what the answer is. He knows Mr Miles is conducting this review. When Mr Miles has finished his review then Senator Carr will be advised accordingly. I also understand that in February of last year we provided over $100 million in funding to extend the CRCs as well as $75 million to establish three new ones.

              , I ask a supplementary question. Given that the 18th CRC round was due to start in December 2014, can the minister explain whether the failure to commence the round is an indication that this program is actually under threat or simply reflects this government's general chaos and incompetence?

               The failed industry minister over six years, who was in and out on three occasions, is talking to me about chaos. What a nerve, coming from this man who was renowned as the worst industry minister this nation has ever had! What I can tell the chamber is that we are investing $1.6 billion into industry programs over the forward estimates. We are serious about the future of industry in this nation. We are serious about creating a number of funds which will maximise the opportunity for industry in this country to grow, invest and employ. We are not going to be lectured by the worst industry minister on record in relation to what is required to drive industry growth and manufacturing growth in this nation.

                 I will take that on notice. I am actually not the minister making those decisions, but I will take that particular aspect of the shadow minister's question on notice. I will just repeat that when you wait nine months or 10 months to ask a question you had better make sure that it is actually a question that is worthy of asking. All the shadow minister is doing is what he always does: creating a scare campaign in relation to the future of these. When Mr Miles comes back with the report the government will respond accordingly. When we are in a position to do so we will make the announcements about it.
