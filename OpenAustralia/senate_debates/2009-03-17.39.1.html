          Given that not one of the current proposals relating to the Lower Lakes—that is, weirs and flooding the lakes with salt water—sitting currently in Minister Garrett’s in-tray does anything to save the Lower Lakes or to ensure that we do not have the Lower Lakes delisted on the Ramsar listing, what is the government doing to ensure we do not lose this Ramsar listing? What is the plan to save the Lower Lakes?

              </a>
              has lodged and which Minister Garrett is considering, I am sure, in accordance with his statutory discretion under the legislation. I am sure Senator Hanson-Young and other members of the Greens would want to ensure that he undertook his consideration of any application—whether it is about the Lower Lakes or otherwise—carefully and prudently, and I have no doubt Minister Garrett will. We are absolutely clear on this side of the chamber about the difficult situation in the Murray-Darling Basin, of which the Coorong and Lower Lakes are a part. The reality is we remain at historically low levels of inflow and storage, particularly in the southern Murray-Darling, and there are environmental pressures across that region, particularly in the southern part of the basin. The federal government and state governments are seeking to manage what is an extremely difficult situation.

              government in determining a long-term solution for the Lower Lakes. The good senator would be aware that we have committed $200 million for the long-term plan for the Lower Lakes. We have committed some $120 million to piping to ensure—

               , I ask a supplementary question. In order to save the Lower Lakes we actually need fresh water released downstream. Why does the government continue to flatly refuse to purchase temporary water that is available on the market to save the Lower Lakes and get it through this 12-month period so that, when the government’s long-term plan does come into effect, it has something to save?

                I am reminded of a press release from Mr Turnbull, who said he did not want us to purchase water, except he wanted temporary water for the Lower Lakes. The point is this: we have a $3.1 billion investment to purchase entitlement to reduce the ongoing extraction from the river. As Senator Hanson-Young knows, we have pressures across the basin. We also know that where we are likely to end up in terms of the Murray-Darling will demonstrate that our extraction levels are significantly above what a sustainable cap will be. So the policy question is: how do we reduce that? The fact is that purchasing entitlement is the best way to reduce that. If we purchased temporary water, I am sure that the Greens would also be critical of the government for not reducing extraction at other parts of the river. We have to think long term, we have to reduce how much we are extracting, we have to achieve maximum environmental benefit for that money, and the government is focused—

                   South Australia

                  to undertake a feasibility study into the long-term management options for this Ramsar listed site. To my recollection, that is the only expenditure to date approved under the $200 million. Of course, there is the additional funding, of which the senator is aware, for pipelines to supply irrigation water and potable water to communities who are doing it tough. There is also an additional $10 million for bioremediation, which the senator knows was one of the matters sought by the Greens.
