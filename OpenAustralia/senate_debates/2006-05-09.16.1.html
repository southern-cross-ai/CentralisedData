         I thank Senator Payne for her important question and acknowledge the work that Senator Payne has carried out in relation to the Solomons, leading an observer group to the election which took place in April this year. It was a very good process, I might add, and it was marred badly by the violence which occurred after the election of the Prime Minister, Mr Rini. Such has been the work of our Australian men and women in the Solomons that I think it is important to place on record the deep appreciation of the Australian government for the great efforts put in by our people in the Solomons. This has been demonstrated by the visits by Minister Downer and me to thank people personally, and the visit last Sunday by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence to thank ADF personnel for the great effort they have put into restoring order to the

         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Some 33 police from

         were injured during the rioting that occurred on 18 and 19 April this year. I saw first-hand the damage in Chinatown and elsewhere, which was caused by mob violence—the victims of which are the people of the Solomon Islands. During the visit that I made to the Solomons, I spoke to both sides of politics. I think it is fair to say that there is still overwhelming support in the community and politically for the continued presence of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAMSI" rel="nofollow">
          RAMSI
         </a>
         . You must remember, however, that RAMSI is a regional assistance program which is not just made up of Australian and New Zealand personnel. It has been a regional response to a regional problem, and it occurred at the request of the Solomon Islands government. Great work has been done in the retrieval of weapons and the charging of people and restoring law and order to the Solomon Islands to such an extent that we now see health and educational services being restored to the people of the Solomons. That is why it was so frustrating and saddening to see the outrageous violence perpetrated on 18 and 19 April this year.
        </p>
        <p>
         The new Prime Minister, Mr Sogavare has indicated that he supports the continued presence of RAMSI, and the Australian government have indicated to him that we are willing to work with him. But we have indicated very clearly that corruption is a high priority in relation to addressing the problems in the Solomon Islands. We appreciate fully that the governing of the Solomon Islands is a matter for the people of the Solomon Islands but, if there is to be any progress in the delivery of essential services and any permanent restoration of law and order and good governance, we have to address the question of corruption. I think that is something which is realised by many in the Solomon Islands government and in the community. It will be a big challenge to implement that. That is a challenge which the Australian government are intent on working to achieve with partners from the pacific and, in particular, those people in the Solomon Islands who want to work to achieve that end.
        </p>
        <p>
         I add that we have done great work in a short space of time. I heard first-hand about the acts of bravery by personnel—men and women—of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Federal Police
         </a>
         and the ADF to protect the lives of others in dangerous situations. Of course, we are working to ensure that their efforts do not go unacknowledged. This is a challenge for this government, the region and the people of the Solomon Islands. We are there for the long haul. We are totally committed to assisting the restoration of law and order and good governance in that country, which will in turn benefit the people of the Solomon Islands.
