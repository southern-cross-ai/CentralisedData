          Mr President
         </a>
         , I rise on a point of order. I drew this to your attention last week: increasingly the opposition are using their questions not to state a question but to denigrate the minister to whom the question is directed. Given that I know how much the opposition are concerned about parliamentary procedures and proper behaviour during question time, I ask you to draw attention to their continued abuse of question time and the phrasing of questions.

            I commiserate with Senator Birmingham for not receiving an invitation or being offered an opportunity to sign the confidentiality agreement. The question is like the chicken and the egg. If you tell me what is not in it, I might be able to tell you what is in it—by process of elimination. You are now asking me to identify by omission what could or could not have been there. It was a confidential briefing and, in the same way that those who signed the agreement are keeping the confidences, I intend to keep the confidences. The letter that Mr Quigley sent, which was publicly released last week, made it quite clear that there is a variety of information, both directly and that can be unpacked from the numbers within the

              Co. such that, if numbers were made public, companies could increase their prices and make higher bids against the NBN. If we complied with the idiocy of those opposite, taxpayers would pay more for the rollout of the NBN. Just a blanket, ‘Release it!’, but—

                  is only making its final report on 30 November and those recommendations from the ACCC will have a material impact on the business case that has been presented. So let us be clear: Mr Quigley has made it absolutely clear that there is key information in the document that will potentially change if a different recommendation—

                   , isn’t this failure to release even non-confidential aspects of the business plan a further demonstration that the government is trying to release as little information as possible as slowly as possible about this project? Why is the minister doing everything he can to keep the Australian public in the dark? Is it any wonder the public and the markets are losing confidence in the minister?

                      I thank Senator Hurley for her question. Occasionally you see during election campaigns some truly enlightening matters brought to public attention. I recall watching
                      <i>
                       The 7.30 Report
                      </i>
                      where the Leader of the Opposition indicated to his audience, ‘Again, if you’re going to get me into a technical argument, I’m going to lose it, Kerry, because I’m not a tech head.’ That was the response of the Leader of the Opposition when it came to the question of a technical understanding of the
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
                       NBN
                      </a>
                      . He went on to say at the people’s forum at
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooty_Hill" rel="nofollow">
                       Rooty Hill
                      </a>
                      that ‘for me broadband basically is about being able to send an email, receive an email’. Further on he said ‘it’s about downloading movies, downloading songs, all that kind of thing’. But, of course, Australian business knows that the NBN is about so much more than that. If you take, for instance, the situation within the automotive industry: you have Toyota, you have Holden and you have Ford, all of which have very significant design and engineering capabilities in this country. They send very complex and very detailed digital files all around the world, and without the NBN they are at a distinct commercial and competitive disadvantage.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      The NBN will allow us to be amongst the world’s best. It will allow us to maintain our competitive advantage and ensure that we keep high-skilled, high-wage jobs in Australia. But it is not just in private companies. If you look at what is happening with Australian universities and the Australian research community, you get to understand how huge an advantage the NBN will be to ensure that we are able to maintain the prosperity of this nation. We will be able to get Australian researchers and businesses to go global and to be competitive globally. That is what Australians want—they want to be able to work with the very best in the world in real time, and they want to be able to ensure that they have the capabilities to maintain living standards.

That is why the Labor government is building that infrastructure as part of the $250 million Regional Backbone Blackspots Program, and we are putting in a crucial fibre-optic link from Perth to Geraldton to allow that to occur. That is also why we are employing businesses and building local skills.

Did neither the minister nor the Prime Minister realise the business plan contained, to quote Mr Quigley, ‘highly sensitive and commercial-in-confidence information’ when they were promising to release it last week? Is this not just another excuse for blocking release?

                                    Those opposite continue to try and build the case that the business case is flawed; the business case is a problem; the business case includes rising prices. Mr Quigley’s letter on the public record makes it quite clear: the business plan reinforces that it is financially viable. On the question of prices, Mr Quigley is very straightforward: the business plan is based on decreasing prices. It is stated there in black and white. Either Mr Quigley is misleading the Australian public—
