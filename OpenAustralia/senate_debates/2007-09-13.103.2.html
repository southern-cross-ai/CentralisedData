       <p>
        by leave—When I raised a question under standing order 74(5) to Senator Brandis following question time today, I indicated that it was my understanding that my office had approached Senator Brandis’s office about raising that question. It has now been brought to my attention that my office did not do that. I said it was my understanding that it had happened and I have since been advised by my office that that did not occur. It had been expected to occur. Senator Brandis has also advised me that in the last half hour he has undertaken steps to have the matter pursued with regard to the answers to the outstanding 69 questions. I look forward to further advice on that matter.

         by leave—I thank Senator Carr for his explanation. It was obviously an innocent mistake on his part. The matter will be, as I indicated earlier, pursued with the relevant minister.
