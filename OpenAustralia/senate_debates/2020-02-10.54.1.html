         I thank Senator Stoker for the question. Globally, we know that the coronavirus continues to expand. As at 10 February 2020 there are approximately 40,546 confirmed cases, and 910 deaths have been reported. The majority of cases have been reported from mainland China, with 375 cases reported from 27 countries and regions outside mainland China. Of the 910 confirmed deaths, 908 were from mainland China and one each was from the Philippines and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong" rel="nofollow">
          Hong Kong
         </a>
         . Of the confirmed cases confirmed globally, the case fatality rate is approximately two per cent. In Australia, we are in a position where, as at 10 February 2020, there are 15 confirmed cases of coronavirus: two in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">

         , five in Queensland, four in Victoria and four in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         . Of the reported cases, five of the earlier cases have recovered, with the remaining cases understood to be in a stable condition.

         The second Qantas flight to assist the departure of Australians from Wuhan has arrived home. The Qantas flight arrived in Darwin at approximately 11.51 local time, and passengers are now at the temporary quarantine facility at

          Howard Springs

            and the Minister for Health visited the temporary quarantine facility at Howard Springs on Friday and report that there is no threat to the community from people being housed at the Howard Springs facility. The government Chief Medical Officer, Professor Brendan Murphy, said:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            â€¦ people staying at the Howard Springs Accommodation Facility were unlikely to become infectious and their health would be closely monitored.

           <p>
            He stated:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            It is important people living in and around Howard Springs know the novel coronavirus can only be transmitted by close contact with an infectious person and cannot be spread through the air.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Chief Medical Officer has also said:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            â€¦ I am confident the security and public health measures put in place will prevent any risk to the communityâ€™s health.

               . They are being provided all necessary health care throughout their stay by a highly skilled and well-equipped Australian medical assistance team. There have been no confirmed cases of coronavirus amongst these people. The Australian people should be reassured that we are taking all necessary measures to contain this virus and protect Australians. We are continuing to enact enhanced border measures, and the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee is continuing to meet daily to provide expert medical advice to government. We are prepared, we are acting and we will continue to follow the expert medical advice.
