        My question is to the very responsible Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Senator Ronaldson, representing the Minister for Industry and Science. Can the minister outline to the Senate any actions the government is taking to protect and grow jobs in the resources sector?

         I thank Senator Williams and acknowledge his longstanding interest in regional and rural Australia and jobs. We are getting on with the job of creating employment: this year, 163,000 jobs; over the term of this government, 335,000—four times Labor's. And, unlike those opposite, we actually believe in the resources sector. We actually believe it is vital to the Australian economy. We believe in the future of coal as a reliable and abundant form of energy in this country. We believe in the jobs of the 54,000 people who work in the industry directly. We believe in the 145,000 who work indirectly in this industry. And we believe in the exports of some $36 billion in 2012-13. We believe in the $3.2 billion in royalties. And that is why we want to see these resources projects proceed and proceed without the sort of intervention that the Attorney-General has so well articulated over the last two days.
        </p>
        <p>
         We do not agree with those with a philosophical objection who want to oppose every coal project. We want to allow jobs. We want to allow mining to continue. We want growth in this sector and we want those opposite to actually start acting in the best interests of Australian workers, and they are showing no indication at the moment. As the Attorney-General said, there will be 10,000 jobs if the Carmichael mine continues and $22 billion in mining taxes and royalties in just the first half of the life of this project.

           I again thank Senator Williams. Yes, there are threats, and it is those opposite and it is the Leader of the Opposition,

           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC" rel="nofollow">
            EPBC
           </a>
           Act, opposed to amendments that would have guaranteed jobs in regional and rural Australia, would have guaranteed the jobs of the workers that those opposite ostensibly support. They want a carbon tax to drive up electricity prices. They want the bullying and the intimidation in the construction industry to continue. They are on the side of the wreckers, not the builders. They are on the side of the radicals, not on the side of Australian workers. What has happened to this group of people? You have now given new meaning to Paul Keating's description that we are all so aware of. You start protecting workers. You work with us to protect an industry that is absolutely vital to this nation and its families and its workers.

             Regrettably, I can. We actually believe that a strong resources sector is vital for a strong manufacturing sector. That is why we were utterly amazed to see Senator Rhiannon move a motion earlier this week in relation to a 'Save our steelworks' campaign in relation to
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Kembla" rel="nofollow">
              Port Kembla
             </a>
             , saying it has been 'the backbone of the Illawarra economy for more than 80 years'. Of course, 12 months ago Senator Rhiannon was in here saying, 'We've got to close this industry down. We've got to phase it out—the product the world no longer needs.' But, remarkably,
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
              Mr President
             </a>
             , guess what: manufacturing of steel actually relies very heavily on the availability of coking coal. Who provides the bulk of the coking coal to the Illawarra steelworks? Port Kembla. It is Illawarra. So, on the one hand, we have got this unholy partnership between the wreckers on that side and those who want to grow the nation on this side—
