        My question is to the Minister for

         Climate Change

        and Water, Senator Wong. Minister,

        is very concerned that the Gippsland farmers are disadvantaged by falling water levels in the Latrobe aquifer, mainly due to offshore oil drilling and nearby coalmining. The farmers have been pinning all their hopes on a report commissioned by the federal government to calculate a figure for compensation. Individual farmers have spent as much as $150,000 each in lowering their bores to survive and have been waiting for more than 10 years for action from the previous government. Minister, this report was promised for release by June last year. When will this report be finalised and when will the government compensate farmers for their losses?

         I thank
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_Fielding" rel="nofollow">
          Senator Fielding
         </a>
         for this question. I was aware that he has been interested in this issue, and obviously there is some media commentary about his concerns about these issues. I have also had a discussion with Senator Fielding in which he raised these concerns with me.

         I am advised that irrigators in the Gippsland region of Yarram are concerned about falling levels in the Latrobe aquifer. I am also advised that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
          CSIRO
         </a>
         2004 study into the aquiferâ€™s falling water levels indicated that offshore oil and gas drilling and, to a minor extent, open-cut mining and irrigation practices have contributed to the lowering of the watertable. The government, together with the Victorian government, is funding further research into the falling groundwater levels in the Latrobe aquifer. This research will include a report on the socioeconomic impact on Yarram irrigators and the provision of information on assistance measures to address the impact on these irrigators. I am further advised that a report is due to be completed by the end of March this year. Senator Fielding referred to a commitment that the report be released in June last year and, for the completeness of the record, I indicate that that was a commitment by the previous government. I am also advised by my department that there is a local stakeholder group providing input into this study. In relation to the compensation issue raised by Senator Fielding, the government will reserve judgement on the issue of compensation until the study is complete.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Minister, the key here is that farmers are concerned about the long-term viability of their farms if the Latrobe aquifer water levels keep falling. These farms are their livelihoods and their homes, and the community relies on them. Minister, will the government commit to fixing the problem of falling water levels in the Latrobe aquifer, given that the farmers feel they have no voice against the interests of the big oil and coal companies?

           As I indicated to

            Senator Fielding
           </a>
           , there is a study underway. There is also, I am advised, a local stakeholder group providing input to this study. I do understand that there are sections of the community, particularly the irrigation industry, who are very concerned about this issue. As I said, we will consider the issue of compensation after we have received the report. As I previously indicated, the advice I have to date is that the study will be completed in March this year.
