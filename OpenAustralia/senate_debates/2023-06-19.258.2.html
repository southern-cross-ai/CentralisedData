        Tasmanian aquaculture and, in particular, the salmon industry across Tasmania continue to be world leaders, despite concerns raised by vocal minorities. I proudly stand by the many Tasmanians and their families who work in this proud industry. Aquaculture now provides more than 50 per cent of Australia's seafood and is acknowledged around the world as being the fastest-growing food sector, with global production still expected to double by 2030.
       </p>
       <p>
        As an island, Tasmania is so fortunate to have the pristine
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Ocean" rel="nofollow">
         Southern Ocean
        </a>
        on its doorstep. Sustainable aquaculture is fundamental in providing a sustainable food supply for the entire world, and the Tasmanian seafood industry is now the most valuable across Australia. Further to this, Tasmania really is the food bowl of the nation, with more than 80 per cent of seafood products sold domestically, with the possibility for export to expand way beyond what we are enjoying at the moment. Eighty per cent of seafood products sold domestically come from Tasmania.
       </p>
       <p>
        The aquaculture industry's economic contribution to Tasmania should not be underestimated. Independent economic analysis shows that, on average, annual turnover or total value of industry production exceeds $1.2 billion. From pretty humble beginnings over 20 years ago, the Tasmanian salmon industry now generates 5,200-plus Tasmanian jobs, directly and indirectly. These jobs are in highly specialised areas, and the most important thing is that they're full-time jobs in regional Tasmania.
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact is that this industry has the potential to support many more local families. Tasmania is blessed to have five large primary producers of high quality fish. These include Huon Aquaculture, Tassal, SALTAS, Van Diemen Aquaculture and Petuna.
       </p>
       <p>
        The industry has had its critics over many years and some have tried to undermine and destroy the industry, but it has been a resilient industry and has gone from strength to strength. And I know my Tasmanian colleagues here tonight would agree with me.
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact is: this industry is a world leader. The industry is known around the world for having world's-best environmental practices and is regularly contacted and consulted by international companies for advice on sustainability measures. An independent inquiry has determined that the environmental concerns raised were not supported by expert advice and objective scientific data. The state government was overseeing a comprehensive and robust monitoring regime. Tasmania is known nationally and globally for its clean, green product, and we are proud, as a state, to produce such high quality Atlantic salmon and ocean trout for people at home and abroad, just as we are proud of our agriculture and viticulture industries.
       </p>
       <p>
        I stand with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Workers_Union" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Workers Union
        </a>
        in their support for the salmon industry and the Tasmanian workforce. As I said, in excess of 5,000 Tasmanians in regional areas are working in the salmon industry. That is so important to those regional economies, and we know how important that is to our economy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tasmania is well placed to capitalise on the growing demand for high-quality and sustainable fish, especially amongst the growing Asian middle class and those in a new powerhouse like India. The export opportunities are endless, which is why our industry must be supported. We know that sustainable practice is crucial to securing those jobs and the viability of the industry. Tasmania needs sustainable, long-term jobs, and aquaculture can provide them. By supporting Tasmanian aquaculture, we are supporting local jobs—local jobs in regional Tasmania.
       </p>
       <p>
        We know that this industry is only going to grow. We know how important Tasmania is in the food bowl of this country—what we're able to supply domestically—and internationally. I can't emphasise enough how important those regional jobs are to those local economies because the money keeps going round and round in those communities. For once my Liberal colleague—I find it hard to say this, but my Liberal colleague supports me.
