        My question is to the Assistant Minister for Health, Senator Nash. I refer to the Prime Minister's promise of 'no cuts to health'. Can the minister confirm that the Prime Minister is breaking his promise by cutting $377 million from preventive health, including abolishing the Australian National Preventive Health Agency? Why is the government sacrificing the health and wellbeing of Australians in order to pay for the Prime Minister's broken promise?

         The government is committed to action on preventive health, but a focus on prevention is about more than creating a new bureaucracy with 'prevention' in its name. This is the agency that funded studies into fat taxes nobody wanted, sponsored the Summernats burnout competition and funded fake music festivals—hardly a good use of taxpayers' money.
        </p>
        <p>
         Preventive health issues can still be progressed without the need for another Commonwealth-funded agency. And we will do so. Abolishing the Australian National Preventive Health Agency will streamline and better coordinate preventive health efforts that are currently spread across the Commonwealth health portfolio agencies.

           Abolishing ANPHA will streamline and better coordinate preventive health efforts that are currently spread across the Commonwealth health portfolio agencies, removing unnecessary duplication, regulation and costs. It will cease operations and we will reintegrate essential ongoing functions into the

            Department of Health
           </a>
           , where most of their functions originally came from. The Department of Health is more than capable of providing these functions
          </p>
          <p>
           The government does not need a separate agency to continue working with jurisdictions and other stakeholders, seeking expert advice or forming productive working relationships with other bodies. These collaborations will continue where necessary.
          </p>
          <p>
           The government has a strong track record in supporting preventative health. Previous coalition initiatives include graphic health warnings to reduce smoking rates. We supported breast screening and introduced the National Human Papillomavirus Vaccination Program and the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program. The best prevention is investment in services, including vaccines, medicines and doctors.

            , I ask a supplementary question. I refer again to the Prime Minister's promise of no cuts to health. I also refer to the government's decision to cut $360 million from programs to help children increase physical activity, to tackle obesity and to improve healthy eating. Given the minister has already shut down the Health Star Rating website, are there any programs that the minister has not cut that will help keep our children healthy?

             The Australian government will continue to invest in prevention through activities targeted at specific needs in the population and will support people to take personal responsibility for their lifestyle actions to reduce their health related risk factors. Funding to jurisdictions through the National Partnership Agreement on Preventive Health has not been an efficient way for the Commonwealth to achieve preventative health outcomes and has led to the duplication of effort and programs. We have seen a number of measures undertaken to ensure that we will have focus on preventative health into the future. This government is absolutely focused on tackling obesity and ensuring particularly our young people have every educational opportunity they can to improve their lifestyle and health choices.

              , I ask a further supplementary question. Again I refer to the Prime Minister's promise of no cuts to health. Given that smoking kills over 15,000 Australians each year, why is the Prime Minister breaking his promise and cutting the National Tobacco Campaign? Can the minister further advise the Senate which tobacco companies, donors or lobbyists she met, or her office met, before budget night?

               The government is absolutely focused on reducing smoking. We have the Prime Minister that led the way, as a previous health minister, when it comes to reducing smoking and tackling that very important issue across the nation. We have moved from the existing agency, ANPHA, some of the programs, some of the arrangements, around smoking. That will still be a targeted social marketing campaign aimed at Indigenous and lower socioeconomic people, because the research shows that that is where it is most effective. That is coupled with the existing $5 million for the tobacco campaign—

                     <p>
                      My question is to the Minister for Finance, Senator Cormann. In his budget speech last night, the Treasurer concluded by saying:
                     </p>
                     <p class="italic">
                      As Australians, we must not leave our children worse off.
                     </p>
                     <p class="italic">
                      That is not fair.
                     </p>
                     <p class="italic">
                      That is not our way.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      At the same time, your budget introduced staggeringly punitive measures for young people, especially those struggling to find work. My question, on behalf of the 730,000 young people affected by changes to Newstart, is as follows: how is a younger person who is currently looking for work but lives in an area of high youth unemployment and has received no income at all for six months supposed to eat, supposed to pay rent and supposed to clothe themselves? Minister, is condemning someone to poverty now 'our way'?

                       I thank the Greens for a question on the budget today. It seems that the other side over there is not all that interested in asking questions directly about the budget. Let me just say this. The Treasurer is of course absolutely right. We do need to do the right thing by our children and by our grandchildren. And guess what: funding our consumption today, funding our lifestyle today, funding our quality of life today, based on borrowing, on debt and deficits, forcing our children to fund the cost of our standard of living today and pay it back with interest is not doing the right thing by our children and grandchildren.

                         As a result of the waste and mismanagement of the Labor Party in government, we are in a situation now where we have to borrow $1 billion a month just to fund the interest on the debt that they have accumulated in government. Just imagine. That is like a family putting their groceries on the credit card, putting their wine and their utilities or whatever onto the credit card and getting their children and grandchildren to pay the price for it. Actually it is worse. It is the same as putting your groceries on the credit card, running the credit card up and borrowing more money to pay the interest on your credit card so that your kids eventually, down the track, have to pay the bill. That is reducing opportunity for our children and our grandchildren. We want to create opportunity for our children and grandchildren. We want to build a stronger economy, where everyone has the opportunity to get ahead. We want to build a stronger economy, where people have more opportunity, not less.

                            , I ask a supplementary question. Minister, your budget carries with it the strong message that this is a budget for future generations and that you want to see young people either earning or learning, but changes in the budget mean that the cost of a degree from some universities will now skyrocket, with some courses soon to cost more than $100,000 and with young people facing a further hit with the interest to student loans set to become more expensive. Minister, if this is a budget for future generations, why have you punished them and let the big end of town off scot-free?

                             I completely reject that last assertion, but let me just make this point: this is a budget which ensures that today's generation funds its own costs. When it comes to education, what we are doing is pursuing a very exciting reform in higher education. We do not have a single university right now in the world's top 20. We want to have a university in the top 20 in the world. We should have a university in the top 20 in the world.

                                       I would ask the Senator to have a close look at our budget papers. What he will see in the budget papers is that the spending growth trajectory that we inherited from the Labor Party is unsustainable. This generation right now is living beyond its means. This generation right now is forcing future generations to fund our cost of living. This generation, as a result of the waste and the mismanagement of the Labor Party, is forcing our children and grandchildren to pay the price for our entitlements—with interest. What we want to do is replace the old age of entitlement with a new age of opportunity where everybody has the opportunity to get ahead. That is what I am here about, that is what every one of my colleagues is here about and that is what we will achieve in government.

                                                 . We always have to remind ourselves that the Labor Party, in 2007, inherited a strong economy and a strong budget with no government net debt, a $20 billion surplus and money in the bank. The government was collecting more than $1 billion a year in net interest payments. We are now having to pay $12 billion just for the interest on the debt that Labor has accumulated. We inherited $191 billion of deficits in Labor's first five budgets, another $123 billion in the projected deficits in Labor's last budget, and debt is heading for $676 billion without corrective action. The good news is that this government is turning the situation around. We are reducing the deficits before going back into surplus and we are paying off and reducing Labor's debt.

                                                    . In last night's budget we did ask the Australian people to contribute. We did ask the Australian people to help us build a stronger economy. We did ask the Australian people to help us repair the budget mess that we have inherited. It is not a budget mess of our making but a budget mess that we will take full responsibility to repair, and we do ask that the Australian people help us. We know that people will not be excited about some of the measures in this budget. We do know that some people will find it difficult to make their contribution. We do ask people across Australia to accept that what we are doing, what we are putting on the table, in this budget is something that we are doing in the national interest. It is something that we are doing to strengthen our country. It is something that we are doing for the right reasons, because we have no choice. The spending growth trajectory that Labor recklessly and irresponsibly put our country on is not sustainable. There is no alternative to the job that we are doing.

                                                     , I ask a further supplementary question. Can the minister inform the Senate why it is so important to get our budget back on track?

                                                      It is so important to get our budget back on track because we do not want to leave our country in a weaker position than we found it. We do not want to leave our children in a situation where they have less opportunity than we had, because this generation has spent beyond its means, because this generation was governed by a government over the last six years which did not know how to manage money. An ongoing deficit of $191 billion in their first five budgets and another $123 billion of projected deficits are reckless and irresponsible. We want to build future opportunity. We want to build a strong Australia. We are asking people to join us and to contribute. We are all in this together. It is so important that we get this right, because we do not want to be the generation that our children and grandchildren point to and say, 'What did you do to our country? You inherited a strong country from your predecessors. What did you do to keep it going?'
