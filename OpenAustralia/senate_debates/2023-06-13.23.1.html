        Thirteen years ago last Saturday, soldiers from the Australian Special Operations Task Group, supported by the United States and Afghan units, began an offensive against the Taliban stronghold in

         Kandahar Province
        </a>
        . The fighting was intense, especially on the second day, 11 June, after Australian forces were reinforced by a troop from the

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Many acts of great courage were performed on that day. One act of courage stood out. Corporal

        single-handedly charged and destroyed two Taliban machine gun positions. For this, he was awarded Australia's highest military honour, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Cross" rel="nofollow">

        . I want Ben Roberts-Smith and every Australian listening to parliament to understand that nothing which has occurred since that day will ever erase or tarnish his remarkable act of bravery. It will be remembered for a long time after the names of people sitting in the Senate and the

        Afghanistan has a well-deserved historic reputation as a place where armies go to die. It is a hard land with a hard people. I visited with Australian forces operating in Afghanistan and I left that hellish environment with nothing but the greatest respect for the courage, capabilities and personal sacrifices of our people in uniform. They earned it then, and they continue to earn it now. The outcome of the defamation case brought by self-serving media outlets against Ben Roberts-Smith will not diminish this respect.

        I am confident I speak on behalf of many Australians when I say he has my support. Hold your head high, Ben. You haven't been charged or convicted with war crimes. Today's news is tomorrow's fish and chip wrapper, and I know that better than anyone.
