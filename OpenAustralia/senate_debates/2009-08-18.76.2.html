        I seek leave to amend general business notice of motion No. 517 standing in my name by amending paragraphs (d)(iv) and (v) to omit ‘13 May 2008 and 17 August 2009’ and substitute ‘13 May 2008 to 17 August 2009’.

           (iii)

           chemotherapy drugs are delivered in standard vial sizes, while different cancer patients, with different body weights and different physiological requirements will need different dosages of a particular life saving chemotherapy drug,

         Mr Deputy President, I seek leave to make a very short statement.
        </p>
        <p>
         Leave granted.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government opposes the previous motion. We understand that it has the support at least of the coalition and the Greens, which means that it would have a majority in this chamber. On that basis we will not call a division.
