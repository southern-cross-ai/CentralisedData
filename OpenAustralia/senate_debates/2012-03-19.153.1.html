         The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship has provided the following answers to the honourable senator's question
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         In line with the Prime Minister's determination on Secretaries remuneration and conditions of 30 June 2012, applications to take recreation and long service leave must be made to a secretary's minister. Mr Bowen has approved Mr Metcalfe's request for leave and supports his plans for further studies.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Arrangements for appointing acting Secretaries are a matter for the Prime Minister. Accordingly, advice was sought from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet on 7 February 2012 in relation to this question.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I am advised that the Public Service Act 1999 (the Act) provides that the Prime Minister may appoint a person to act as the Secretary of a Department during any period when the Secretary is absent from duty. Following advice from the Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Dr Ian Watt AO, the Prime Minister agreed that Mr
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Bowles" rel="nofollow">
          Martin Bowles

          PSM
         </a>
         act as Secretary in Mr Metcalfe's absence. Dr Watt consulted the Public Service Commissioner, Mr Stephen Sedgwick, before recommending the acting appointment of Mr Bowles to the Prime Minister. He also canvassed the acting appointment with the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, the Hon Chris Bowen MP and Mr Metcalfe.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Mr Metcalfe will commence his leave in late March 2012 and return to duty on 1 October 2012. Apart from 9 days as study leave approved by the Prime Minister, approximately 40 days will be taken by Mr Metcalfe as recreation leave, and approximately 103 days will be long service leave. Mr Metcalfe has worked for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Public_Service" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Public Service
         </a>
         since January 1980 and during that time he has accumulated substantial amounts of unused leave.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Management Circular 22/2011 was sent to staff of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Immigration_and_Citizenship" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         advising of the acting arrangements. A copy of the circular is attached.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Mr Bowles is currently undertaking a significant briefing program across the Department, including close involvement with Mr Metcalfe and Deputy Secretaries on all senior management issues, as well as being involved in major policy issues in his own right. There is no specific role description for the position of special advisor.

         I am writing to you today to provide details of my personal plans for 2012.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         As you may recall, last year I was named the "Federal Government Leader of the Year" in the Leadership in Government Awards supported by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Chartered_Accountants_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Institute of Chartered Accountants Australia
         </a>
         . The award included a substantial prize to be used for my continuing professional development. For some time now I have been looking for opportunities to pursue further study and to combine this with a period of recreation and long service leave, and this award will assist me to do this.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Following discussions between Dr Ian Watt (Secretary,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_the_Prime_Minister_and_Cabinet" rel="nofollow">
          Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet
         </a>
         ) and Stephen Sedgwick (Australian Public Service Commissioner) and myself, it has been agreed that I will be able to undertake further study overseas and access a period of several months leave commencing in late March 2012. Minister Bowen has approved my request for leave and supports my further studies.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Given the substantial time that I will spend overseas for my study and leave, it has been decided that Martin Bowles (Deputy Secretary, Department of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
          Climate Change
         </a>
         and Energy Efficiency) will transfer to the department to act as Secretary for that period of time. Prior to his current role Martin has served as a Deputy Secretary in the Department of Defence, and also in several senior positions in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         and Queensland State Governments.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         In order to better familiarise himself with our work, Martin will transfer to our department from the beginning of December 2011 and undertake a significant briefing program across the department, including close involvement with the deputy secretaries and me in all senior management issues.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I look forward to Martin joining us in December, and I am sure that you will make him feel very welcome, and will no doubt enjoy working with him.
