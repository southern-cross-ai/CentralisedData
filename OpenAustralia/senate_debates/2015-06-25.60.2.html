        SELECTION OF BILLS COMMITIEE
       </p>
       <p>
        Proposal to refer a bill to a committee:
       </p>
       <p>
        Name of bill:
       </p>
       <p>
        Voice for Animals (Independent Office of Animal Welfare) Bill 2015
       </p>
       <p>
        Reasons for referral/principal issues for consideration:
       </p>
       <p>
        This Greens private members bill establishes the Office of Animal Welfare as an independent statutory authority - with its
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        responsible for reviewing and advising upon the protection of animal welfare in Commonwealth regulated activities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Animal welfare is an important issue to Australians across political divides. It receives regular media coverage and commensurate outrage from community and large animal welfare networks. The recent inquiry into National Senator Back's Ag-gag private members bill received over 2,000 responses.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the face of continuing animal abuse, this government has responded by dissolving the federal Australian Animal Welfare Strategy and its independent advisory committee, and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspector_General" rel="nofollow">
         Inspector General
        </a>
        of Animal Welfare and Live Animal Exports.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2012 Labor endorsed the developing of a model for an Office of Animal Welfare, which was then set aside when Labor gained government. Last week Labor tabled a motion in the House noting the Government's abolition of Inspector General of Animal Welfare and Live Animal Exports. This inquiry can provide an opportunity to test Labor's commitment.
       </p>
       <p>
        The inquiry will also provide an important animal welfare campaign hook, especially if an early election is called.

          Bear with me a moment, Senator Fifield. Senator Siewert, my advice is that your amendment is actually in the form of an amendment to Senator Moore's amendment. So I might call on you now—and I will see how I deal with your amendment to those two amendments. We will see how we go.

            Senator Fifield, I understand that you have foreshadowed a further amendment. What I intend to deal with first is Senator Siewert's amendment to Senator Moore's amendment, and then I will come back to you for a further amendment to the amendment. The question before the chair now is that Senator Siewert's amendment be agreed to.

                Australian Greens
               </a>
               on the vote that just took place, when the government and the opposition and a significant number of the crossbenchers voted not to refer the citizenship bill, also known as the allegiance to Australia bill, to the full scrutiny of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee" rel="nofollow">

               of the Senate.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Prime Minister indicated that this significant legislation, which will be looking at the revocation of one of the most fundamental rights in a democracy—that of citizenship—would be given a full inquiry, but that means it will only go to the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Joint_Committee_on_Intelligence_and_Security" rel="nofollow">

               . The only members of that committee are government and opposition members, and all nine men on that committee have had past associations with the military, security and spy agencies through government. This means that those other MPs in this parliament who represent people who have voted for the Greens and Independents will not have the ability to ask and inform ourselves properly, and it will not be transparent for the public. It is a shame and it should not keep happening.

                I move an amendment to Senator Moore's amendment in respect of the Shipping Legislation Amendment Bill 2015:
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                omit "Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee" rel="nofollow">
                 Committee
                </a>
                ", substitute "Economics Legislation Committee"; and
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                omit "the first sitting day of 2016", substitute "12 August 2015".
               </p>
               <p>
                Let me just emphasise that Senator Moore's amendment seeks to have the inquiry into this legislation report in 2016. I know that it will not have escaped your attention that it is currently 2015. In fact, we have yet to reach the middle of 2015. What this amendment from Senator Moore seeks to do is to put the consideration of this legislation out into the never-never. The government is not adverse to an inquiry. We are very comfortable with an inquiry. In fact, we would have understood if the opposition had elected to have a date later in the year, but they have chosen not to.
               </p>
               <p>
                The Deputy Prime Minister, who has responsibility for this legislation, has repeatedly stated the government's intention to ensure that the bill be subject to scrutiny by the parliament. We do not have an issue with that, but, as I have indicated, an inquiry process that will take more than six months is not reasonable, is counterproductive and will do nothing but further damage the shipping industry in Australia. We have already seen the number of major Australian registered ships with coastal licence plummet from 30 vessels in 2006-07 to just 15 in 2013-14. I pose the question: do Labor and the Greens want to wait until the industry is past the point of no return before action is taken?
               </p>
               <p>
                The government has been consulting with stakeholders for more than a year on coastal shipping policy. Their response has been resounding. They want Labor's overly bureaucratic, deliberately cumbersome and inflexible legislation changed. It is also interesting that Labor would propose such a long committee process when this is the complete opposite of their behaviour when they introduced their own legislation when last in government. Labor rushed the legislation through the parliament, dumping a significant number of amendments on the parliament and without providing the then opposition or industry the opportunity to consider them in any detail to determine their impact. Such significant economic reform that will have such wide-reaching positive impact on the Australian economy warrants the consideration of the Senate economics committee, we propose. It warrants a reasonable time to be considered, but it does not need more than six months. This bill is broader than just shipping companies and our transport network. This is about the cost of doing business in Australia. This is about our sugar industry, our cement industry, aluminium, mineral sands, the resource sector, fertiliser industry, gypsum and petrol refineries to name but a few.
               </p>
               <p>
                The government would like to send this bill to the Senate economics committee for a report date after the winter break, which would provide adequate time for consideration of this. If the opposition has proposed a date between that which we are nominating and next year, I could have understood that, but they are not. They have nominated 2016. That is unreasonable. We are proposing that this legislation is referred to the Economics Legislation Committee for report on 12 August 2015. We think that is an entirely reasonable proposition.

                <p>
                 We are seeking that this piece of legislation go to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee" rel="nofollow">
                  Committee
                 </a>
                 . We are doing that for a number of reasons. One is that this is the committee under which most of these issues around shipping and transport are normally heard. We have Senator Sterle, behind me, who works in this committee. The important issues of shipping in Australia are already the subject of an extensive Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee hearing, so it makes sense for the people who are working and negotiating all the time in this area, as an effective Senate committee, to have the same issues that they have been looking at to go to the same committee, which already has the estimates process for this industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                 We know that this is an extraordinarily complex area. We know that there was a long history of engagement in this process when Labor was in government
                </p>
                <p>
                 There were extensive considerations in the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Reps" rel="nofollow">
                  House of Reps
                 </a>
                 looking at the whole area around national shipping, and we know that it has important environmental, national security and freight transport efficiency implications.
                </p>
                <p>
                 This is an important issue. There have been a number of reviews in the past, all of which reinforce the need for these issues to be considered carefully. They need a wide range of engagement. Sensibly, if you already have a committee process operating that has a reporting date in the first sitting week of next year, we truly believe that this is a more effective way. It will use the expertise best and respond most effectively to the industry if this matter is referred to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee with the same reporting date as the references inquiry so that the work can be done together, all the issues can be looked at and we can maximise the efficiency of the debate. It is an important process. In speaking against Senator Fifield's amendment, I am also speaking to mine to minimise the length of the debate.

                    Thank you. The crossbenchers are a little concerned. August is too early, but 2016 is too late, so we are asking that some other compromise be made. Like you said, Senator Moore—and I respect you for it—it is a really important matter and it needs to be dealt with. I just think that leaving it to 2016 is too long.

                         , as I never stop telling people. Some of the big industries up there, such as sugar, aluminium and cement, are industries which use coastal shipping. Because of the actions of the Labor government in previous years, industries are being forced to ignore Australian product and import product—in sugar, in cement and in lots of things—because they simply cannot afford the cost of domestic shipping in Australia. This has been an issue for a long, long period of time and the government intends to do something about it. The opposition will no doubt oppose it, but, more than oppose it, they want to delay any real consideration of the bill out into the never-never. Suggesting that this be put out to next year is just incredibly dishonest. It shows that the Labor Party have no real interest in it. They are frightened that an earlier consideration by the committee and report to the Senate would encourage the crossbenchers to support the government's legislation. Labor do not want to take their chances, so they put it out into the never-never.

                        <p>
                         Senator Moore's contribution was full of hypocritical jargon. She was talking about sending things to another committee when a different committee is looking at it. Of course, the Labor Party have just facilitated another one of the abuses of the committee system by referring a matter that was being dealt with by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation
                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee" rel="nofollow">

                         —the Monis letters. It had come up in estimates and a request had been made. The legislation committee had moved to have a spillover so that people could be questioned about that. But, in the meantime, the Labor Party introduced a motion to send this to a references committee—the exact same issue.

                        <p>
                         As I said earlier today, this makes just a complete mockery of what was once a revered and respected Senate committee system. When I first joined the Senate 25 years ago, Senate committees worked cooperatively. They worked in a nonpartisan way. They actually achieved results that were good for governments. They alerted governments to obvious errors. Be they Liberal or Labor governments, the Senate committee system used to work in a bipartisan way. Today, I say with a lot of regret, the Senate committee system has just become a tool in the armoury of the Labor Party and the Greens political party to use them for purely political purposes—no real gain and no real policy commitment but purely for political purposes. That is what brings these committees into disrepute.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         I think that Senator Fifield's motion is a good one, but perhaps I could foreshadow a further amendment that would, as Senator Lambie suggests, be a compromise that would involve something between August and next year. Rather than me foreshadowing an amendment, perhaps others in the chamber will.

                          Mr Deputy President, I seek to move an amendment to Senator Fifield's amendment, and seek your guidance as to how we do this. The first part is that I move that the amendment be put in two parts. The question of which committee it ought to go to should be a separate question to the issue of the date, and, in respect of the date, that I move an amendment to Senator Fifield's amendment that the date be amended to Monday, 12 October 2015. I hope that is clear enough, Mr Deputy President.

                             The question now is that Senator Xenophon's amendment, which is amending Senator Fifield's amendment, which is amending Senator Moore's amendment, which is amending the motion moved by Senator Bushby, be agreed to. The trouble is that I do not have any of these amendments in front of me, and I should have, so maybe we will get that and I can then put them in two parts for you, as requested. Your amendment, Senator Xenophon, is seeking simply to amend the date on Senator Fifield's amendment. That does not need to be put in two parts. That can just simply be done. Your amended amendment will then be put, Senator Fifield.

                                 This is part of the problem when senators simply get up and move amendments verbally without having them circulated. It does make it difficult for the chair. We are all trying to keep up, and we all know what we are trying to achieve. I am sure that will be the final outcome.

                                 The part of Senator Fifield's amendment relating to the committee is the question before the chair. So everyone is clear on that. The question is that that motion be agreed to.

                                <p>
                                 The problem we are facing is that we are trying to sort out an amendment, which everyone agrees to, as an amendment to an amendment that may not succeed. So the way through this I suggest—and this might be a first for the Senate—is why don't we see if Senator Moore will accept the change to the date as part of her amendment, and then Senator Fifield's amendment simply deals with the committee. Is everyone happy with that course of action? Senator Moore, could you indicate for the record that you would be happy with that.

                                    Senator Moore's motion went to more than that. It said that it report by an October date. She has reframed her motion, as I understand it, to say it goes to the transport committee by 10 October. Senator Fifield is moving an amendment to say it goes to a different committee. That is the motion. That is what I was asking be read out to make sure it is absolutely clear. Perhaps I could ask again whether Senator Moore's motion, which she has accepted an amendment to, be read, and then Senator Fifield's motion be read.
