         , for your question. I agree—and I would like to think that everyone in this chamber would agree—with Senator Dodson that, 32 years after the

         adults and youth are unacceptable and the rates of deaths in custody among First Nations adults and youth are unacceptable. There are many members of our government, and those across the chamber, who have said before—and will I'm sure keep saying—that First Nations incarceration rates and deaths in custody are a national shame.
        </p>
        <p>
         Coming into government, it was clear to us, unfortunately, that for the past nine years First Nations justice was just not a priority for the former government. That's why last year the Attorney-General worked closely with his colleague Ms Burney to form a First Nations justice task force with officials from the Attorney-General's Department and the National

               On the point of order and the handling of points of order, this is a seemingly new practice—to rule before a senator has even had a chance to put their case. On Senator
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorpe" rel="nofollow">
                Thorpe
               </a>
               's first point of order, she had no more than got the word 'relevance' out of her mouth than you ruled against her, without hearing the basis upon which she was claiming relevance. I would, President, invite you to reflect upon that, in terms of your handling the points of order. I understand it where they are repetitious or take approaches that are disorderly in the chamber. But in this case, I think a first point of order from a senator on a question deserves the opportunity for that senator to have the chance to make their point.

                 Perhaps I could make a couple of points in relation to your ruling. The first is that it was in fact Senator Ryan who first started to truncate the submissions on points of order, because his view what that a number of us—and I may have been one of those!—made too many contributions on our feet on points of order. I was cut off on a number of occasions by Senator Ryan, as the President, being of the view that he had already come to a view about the substance of the point of order. I have to say, Senator, I thought you were saying the word and then sitting down. We have no objection, if the President wishes to call you, to you making your submission if you wish to do that.

                   Thank you for the indulgence, President. My point of order was on relevance. The question was relating to if the government is going to implement the 339 recommendations that will save black lives today.

I know that he's making a very strong contribution as a member of the Albanese government to deliver on those recommendations and to improve the position of First Nations people in our country every single day. I've come to regard Senator Dodson as a friend. I've learnt a lot from him. I know that he is someone of incredible goodwill and puts the needs and rights of First Nations people at the centre of what he does every single day. We can all learn from him, and we can all take up his call to do more in this area.

                           Of course, our government is doing everything it possibly can to rebuild Medicare after years of destruction, whether that be in the general community or in prisons. We have been on the record on many occasions saying that, after nearly 10 years of Liberal-National government, Medicare is broken. That applies whether we're talking about people seeking to go to a
