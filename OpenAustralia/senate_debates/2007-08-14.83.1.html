         On behalf of the opposition, I am a bit surprised that we are going to deal with that bill first. I understand that there was a procedural reason for dealing with that bill first; however, it made sense to me to deal with the major bill first, which is the

          The opposition amendments to that bill are the difficulty and why it was put to me that that bill should be dealt with first.

           I understand that. But it will be close to 6.30 pm, which is when we suspend for dinner, and we will not have got to the first amendment. I am seeking some indication from other parties on this. If the minister is happy with this proposal, as he indicated to me earlier, we will suggest that we adjourn a couple of minutes early and come back after the dinner break to deal with the major bill.

                     That is why it would make some sense to do that. I understand there are some problems about running sheets and a couple of late amendments, including one of ours, and I apologise for that. But if we do it that way—and I thought the minister might indicate how he wanted to go in terms of the following bills—by the time we suspend for dinner at 6.30 we would all know what the rules of the game were, where we are going to start and the order. Then we would all come back less confused than perhaps I was a few minutes ago. I am suggesting we do it in that order, but I am open to views from other senators.

                      Yes, we should do it in that order. We are very well aware, by the way, that the guillotine will be used on this legislation within the next 24 hours or so and that the proper debate of this monumental legislation and its impact on this nation will be cut short by the government using its numbers to gag the Senate from such a debate. Let us not beat around the bush here. The measures that would protect children, including the movement of police into the communities, that the government set underway some weeks ago can and will continue.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      This legislation we are dealing with now, and which it is proposed by the opposition should come on first, which we agree with, brings up a raft of very contentious matters, including the takeover of
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous" rel="nofollow">
                       Indigenous
                      </a>
                      communities without their consent and the end of the ability of Indigenous communities to regulate access to those communities. We saw just yesterday the police saying that that is a bad thing and that it is not going to give them the control with communities that they have had in the past to safeguard those communities. The legislation includes the taking away of just compensation when communities are taken over under this legislation. This is in breach of the Constitution, and people will have to go to the High Court, because there will be no appeal to this parliament.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      This legislation will have been guillotined through here in the rush to the election, for the electoral purposes of the Howard government, supported by the Rudd opposition. It includes giving the coercive powers of the
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Crime_Commission" rel="nofollow">
                       Australian Crime Commission
                      </a>
                      over to be used against black Australians but not white Australians. These powers, which were there to help safeguard this country from international drug smugglers, triads and international criminal outfits, are now being used against individual Indigenous people, households and communities—provided they are Indigenous. You cannot do it if they are non-Indigenous, if it is the rest of Australians. This racist legislation, which, the indication is, the Labor Party is going to support—can you believe it?—will be guillotined somewhere in the next 24 hours. I would not be surprised if that is with the support of the Labor Party either, because, as Mr Rudd said in Tasmania on another matter—the support for the pulp mill and the burning of forests in Tasmania—’I am behind Prime Minister Howard 100 per cent of the way.’ Ditto this legislation.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      What a failure of the democratic system. Where are the opposition when this nation needs them? Where is opposition leader Rudd when a stand should be taken for decency in the application of the law, in the parliamentary process and in the democratic relationship between the parliament and the people? All of that is out the window. The best the Leader of the Opposition can do is say ‘me too’ to Prime Minister Howard, this Prime Minister who marked his first month in office by cutting $400 million from what was required in Indigenous spending back in August 1996. And the Prime Minister this year defunded Aboriginal language wherewithal in this country.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      This legislation is the death of culture. We know it and you know it. It has not even been debated in this place, and it will not be debated in this place because the guillotine is coming. Is that going to be regretted down the line? Let nobody in this chamber say they did not know—because they do. Everybody knows. Hands up anybody in this chamber who has read the 600 pages in this legislation. Let us see. Not one. Nor has the Prime Minister. Nor has the cabinet.

                        and their rights as equal citizens in this country. Rights are being ripped away from them by this government legislation, supported by the Rudd opposition—can you believe that in 2007? There is no choice with the Labor opposition, because there is no backbone there when it comes to difficult decisions like standing for the rights of

                        and making sure that they do get the health, the education, the job opportunities and the security that they have been denied under Labor and Liberal governments and that would safeguard their communities but also honour their culture. There is none of that from Labor here tonight. This is a Howard Labor opposition. One of the worst, if not the worst, pieces of legislation brought before this parliament is being endorsed by the Rudd Labor opposition here tonight. They say, ‘12 months down the line, we’ll have a look at it.’ We will see about that.

                           Before we proceed with some of the amendments, I am keen to ask the minister to respond to the Scrutiny of

                           s Committee report on these bills and to some of the concerns raised by the committee in that report, which was tabled yesterday. I wondered whether the minister wanted to make a general response to it, or I could take him through some of the concerns raised. One of them relates to alcohol and the concern of the committee that the legislation might trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties in relation to the references in clause 12(6) and clause 20 to the volume of ethyl alcohol in liquor. I would be interested in the minister’s response to those concerns raised by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee.

                            The committee recommends that a public information campaign be implemented as soon as possible. This is already underway. Advance communication teams have visited all prescribed townships and most have been visited by departmental survey teams. Government business managers are starting to be deployed and will provide pertinent Australian government presence in the townships.

                            communication measures are being rolled out, including written publication and electronic media. I was pleased that Senator Crossin complimented magistrate Dr Sue Gordon on radio advertisements that she participated in. The task force and the government will be working to build on these communication efforts in the coming months.

                            The committee recommends that explanatory material be developed to help people understand the phrases ‘a quantity of alcohol greater than 1350 millilitres’ and ‘unsatisfactory school attendance’. The Australian government accepts this recommendation and the department is meeting with representatives of the liquor industry tomorrow to begin to develop comprehensive information strategies and other tools in relation to the provision of takeaway alcohol. Steps will be taken to ensure that students, children, and parents and teachers understand exactly what is meant by ‘unsatisfactory school attendance’.

                            provided additional comments in the committee’s report. The $587 million funding package for the first year demonstrates the magnitude of the problem we are facing. The government will be considering at the earliest opportunity the level of funding required for future budget years. I should point out that funding for remote Indigenous housing was substantially increased in this year’s budget—$1.6 billion over four years will be provided for Indigenous housing and infrastructure in remote areas and much of this will go to the Northern Territory.

                            I assure the Australian Labor Party that the intervention will be part of a long-term strategy. The Labor Party provided additional comment to the committee that the intervention is silent on many recommendations set out in the
                            <i>
                             Little children are sacred
                            </i>
                            report. I point out to senators that this report was to the Northern Territory government and not the Australian government, and that the Northern Territory government had been sitting on that report for around three months. The Australian government intervention in the Northern Territory responds to the first recommendation of that report, that Aboriginal child sexual abuse in the Northern Territory be designated as an issue of urgent national significance. I say, though, that, whilst the findings of the report were very distressing and compelling, the recommendations contained in that report were just proposing more of the same. They did not even recommend additional sworn-in police officers, which is a fundamental ingredient in our intervention.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            I have already outlined that the government is leaving the permit system in place for some 99.8 per cent of Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory. As well, I have outlined the reasons for lifting the requirement for permits in the townships and the roads that give access to the townships. The government therefore rejects the Australian Labor Party’s recommendation in respect of the permit system. I am pleased that Labor senators will not oppose the compulsory acquisition of five-year leases for prescribed townships; however, the government stands by its position that the recommendation for a 12-month review would not be appropriate. The recommendation of a 12-month review of welfare reform and income management systems specific to the Northern Territory would not take into account the fact that the measures would be applied progressively over a 12-month period, and the government would therefore not support that recommendation.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            The government will not accept Labor’s recommendation in respect of the

                            . We believe our obligations, including through international treaty, to protect the children are the priority. The Australian government are pleased that the Labor opposition has joined coalition senators in recommending that the Senate pass these bills; however, the government do not propose to go through the

                             . I asked him whether it is true that the powers used there—which are normally kept for surveillance and information gathering on international criminals and were specifically forbidden to be used against Australian citizens because they set aside all sorts of important provisions of the law—will now be used against people in the

The Australian Crime Commission has a range of special coercive powers similar to a royal commission—for example, the capacity to compel attendance at examinations, the production of documents and the answering of questions. It also has an intelligence-gathering capacity and a range of investigative powers common to law enforcement agencies, such as the power to tap phones, to use surveillance devices and to participate in controlled operations and, moreover, is able to coerce people to answer questions and to produce information and property in a way which is outside the usual law of this country.

                                report, which did not indicate that we were dealing with large numbers of child abuse victims outside of Indigenous children in those communities. Whilst I accept your comment, this legislation is clearly targeted at providing for further protection of children in prescribed communities in response to a report that indicated that there was widespread, unreported and, in effect, serial abuse of Indigenous children in those communities. This legislation is specifically in response to that report.

If they are in Redfern, they have no escape from those powers, unless they are white. That is the racist nature of this legislation. And it is not any accident; it is laid out in the explanatory memorandum that these coercive Star Chamber powers can be used against black perpetrators involved in child sex offences anywhere in the country. I ask this: if you are going to justify intervening to protect children—and we all want to protect children—using these Star Chamber powers, why not children in the white community? What is it in the white community that makes a crime against a child matter less than a crime against a child in a black community?

                                 ; it applies to black people across this country—Indigenous people. It does not apply to any other community. I ask why that is the case. What is it about crime perpetrated on Indigenous children that should invoke these laws when they are not invoked in the white community? Is it that the government thinks that sexual offences against children in the white community are of a lesser nature or do not matter as much as sexual offences against children in the black community? Frankly, Mr Temporary Chairman, you and I and the minister know that that is not the case.

                                 What we have before us is pure, unmitigated, inexcusable racist legislation. If this coercive law is required for the Indigenous community and not for the more than 80 per cent of the rest of the community where this crime occurs, it is outrageous racism against

We are concerned about children, communities, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, the breakdown of communities and the failure to act on this for so long. We want action, but we do not want racist legislation like this. It is beyond the pale. This is not the Botha government; this is the Howard government, and we should not have this legislation before this Senate. It should never have been conceived this way. That is why we say that we should take time over this and let the community look at it. It is a downright shameful piece of legislation, in just the dimension I have put—but there will be more.

To glibly say that this is about 20 per cent and 80 per cent really flies in the face of the fact that only two per cent of our population is Indigenous yet 20 per cent of the cases of child abuse happen in that tiny demographic. And, of course, there is all of the underreporting; so the figure could be a lot higher. We are responding specifically to this particular disaster. We could be responding to a disaster in another context and you could criticise: ‘What about the other side of the world?’ This is very targeted legislation in which our clear intent is to provide further and appropriate protection for the children of our First Australians.

I put it to the minister that underreporting of child sexual abuse is not confined to Indigenous communities; it is right across the community. The rapid increase in the number of reports of child sexual abuse in recent years attests to that. This is a racist application of laws which allow surveillance cameras and recording devices to be secretly put into people’s houses and which strip away people’s legal protections so that even if they are not suspected or charged with a crime they face interrogation. If they do not accede to that, they will go to jail. The minister knows that. If their property is requisitioned they must give it over or go to jail. This is legislation meant for international criminals, not for households in Australia. But it does apply now to households in Australia provided they are black. You cannot do it if they are white. There are no territorial borders in this. It does not matter whether they are in

There is no point in me debating this further into the night. Those are the facts. The minister can correct any of them but he has not so far. I am going straight from the provision of information from the government itself, and it is appalling. It is disgusting. It should never be and we should not be supporting it in this place.

                                        It would be interesting to return to the original question that was asked by Senator Evans, which Senator Scullion, the minister, did not answer. He may have misheard and gave the government’s response to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional

                                        I would like to outline the approach the Democrats are taking here. As I indicated at the end of the second reading debate, we believe that this is an issue of great importance. A window of opportunity has been opened here, for whatever reasons, by the federal government to get a lot of public focus, public debate and commitment made about genuine, ongoing, long-term and effective action to address a wide range of areas of disadvantage faced by

                                        Australians. But the key problem here, and the reason why there is such anguish around this legislation and such torn views by many Indigenous peoples themselves, is that there is almost a ‘Sophie’s choice’ being put to them—a cleft stick. The people who have been calling for so long for concerted action are now apprehensive about the nature of many aspects of the action being put forward. I find it astonishing when this is an issue where you have such common ground across the community and the political spectrum about the need to take concerted, comprehensive and long-term action with dramatic increases in resources and support to address significant areas of disadvantage for

Yet somehow, on an issue where we have a massive area of common ground, the approach the government has taken to date has had the quite extraordinary and terrible effect of putting bazookas into every part of that common ground that they could find. They are forcing people to either side of the chasm and would have us throwing rocks at each other again. On an issue of this importance, where there is so much common ground, to end up in a situation where we are forced on one side of a great divide is a terrible outcome, and it is a particularly terrible outcome for

                                        In the face of that, the approach and efforts of the Democrats in this debate are focused on continuing to point to that common ground and to maintaining some common ground so that when we get to the end of this process there is still an opportunity to move forward collaboratively and cooperatively as much as possible. That is the reason we are seeking information and clarification from the minister and seeking a response from the minister on issues such as the many points raised in the Scrutiny of Bills Committee report. That is the reason we are putting forward amendments. There are two things that I need to say. It is really important that the government show good faith in this process for the longer term. This is not just about what piece of legislation we end up with; it is about the views that people—not only senators but people in the wider community—will take away from this debate about whether there is genuine intent here to listen and to walk forward together in what needs to be a long-term commitment down what will be an arduous path.

                                        I heard in amongst some of the various speeches that were given in the second reading stage of this debate—particularly in those from coalition senators—regular quoting of

                                        as a person putting forward justification for what the government is doing. I will draw attention to his comments as well, and specifically his comments from last weekend saying that this legislation ‘needs to be decisively improved in some crucial respects’. I will also raise his final comment, which was:

                                        It will be a grave mistake for the federal Government to be as intransigent to amendments to its bill as those who have opposed the intervention entirely.

                                        Unfortunately, as I said before, that is the divide that we have: total opposition to any form of intervention is the position some wish to take, while others are giving no consideration at all to any amendments, any change, any comments or any concerns. To have that sort of polarised outcome on an issue where there is such widespread agreement is a terrible result.

                                        who I have spoken to, but they would all agree with this one—is that there is a real risk here of a grave mistake being made if the government takes that attitude, and it could be the difference between disaster and success. There is the potential for improvements through intervention, through a genuine long-term increase in resources and through a genuine willingness to work together, but there is also a potential for disaster, and let us not kid ourselves about that.

                                        Having said all that, I know in my head and in my heart—or what passes for it—that the amendments that the Democrats and others put forward will almost certainly be rejected with total intransigence by the government. That will be a tragedy. But it is important to make the effort and at least provide the opportunity. It is also important to emphasise that, whatever happens in this chamber, the debate will continue and needs to continue. We need to continue to provide support to Indigenous Australians, who want to have effective solutions to the enormous disadvantage and hurdles put in their way.

                                        report, the federal government felt the need to intervene. I was therefore perplexed to hear the minister then say that the government rejects the report because the report recommends more of the same. That is what I thought I heard him say; I hope he did not say that; I hope I heard wrong. But I do not see how you can justify all of this intervention on the basis that the

                                        government did not respond and then reject the recommendations by saying that they are more of the same. Imagine if the Northern Territory government had responded with that and just said: ‘We reject all this; it’s just more of the same. We’re going to do something completely different.’ The howls of outrage would have been enormous, and justifiably so.

                                        The report does not outline every single thing that needs to be done; the report was not presented that way; that was not its terms of reference. But the report recommends 97 things that need to be done. I hope I misheard that the government is saying that all these 97 things would just be more of the same. How can the federal government not respond to all of those? The federal government justifies its intervention because the Northern Territory government has not responded, and then does not respond either, saying, ‘It’s just a report to the Northern Territory government; it wasn’t a report to the federal government.’ Then it says that it is justifying itself by relying on the first recommendation, which specifically requests action from the Australian government. We at least need some consistency.

                                        The government continually says that it is responding to the first recommendation, when it is in fact responding to the first sentence of the first recommendation and not responding to the second sentence, which says that it is critical—and I emphasise that word—that both governments commit to genuine consultation with Aboriginal people in designing initiatives for Aboriginal communities. Is genuine consultation just more of the same? Is that part of the recommendation being rejected as well? If not, when is this genuine consultation in designing these intiatives going to start? It certainly has not happened to date. I repeat that, if this intervention is to have any hope of succeeding, there is an absolute need for there not to be an instransigent attitude and there is an absolute need to work with the leadership in the Northern Territory. They are Noel Pearson’s words, not mine.

The concerns raised by the committee were raised unanimously, including by government members. Let me emphasise that these are not policy criticisms; they concern the fundamental legislative approach of the government on core principles that should be applied across any type of legislation, whatever the policy intent. Those concerns go to issues like insufficiently subjecting the exercise of legislative power to parliamentary scrutiny. We all know that this bill and the accompanying bills provide enormous power. Minister Brough has said himself that he has more power than anyone has had in history. I am not sure he is quite accurate there, but that is basically what he said. He has enormous power. I do not know whether it is more than ever before, but it is certainly a hell of a lot. It is more than anyone has had for a long time, certainly in this area. Concerns were raised about excluding merits review, where major decisions by bureaucrats can be made affecting people’s lives with no merits review of those decisions. Concerns were raised about inappropriate delegation of power and about what are known as

Concerns were raised about whether the phrase ‘reasonable amount of compensation’ is actually consistent with the Constitution, and so were concerns about unacceptably trespassing on personal rights and liberties, particularly in relation to the

                                        Those categories I have just outlined are part of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee’s terms of reference, which they assess every single piece of legislation against. They are not going to the policy intent or otherwise of this legislation. The government simply say, ‘It is an emergency, so we need to be able to do whatever we want.’ How long will that excuse last? Five years? Does that justify doing whatever you want without reference to these basic fundamental core principles, albeit, ‘It is for the protection of children; therefore, we need to be able to do whatever we want.’ I would like to think all legislation we pass in this place is done with the aim of not harming children. I do not see any reason why most of these principles cannot still be applied, regardless of an emergency. In fact, sometimes they need to be applied specifically in an emergency because it is precisely in those sorts of circumstances where, if you give people an enormous amount of power, you have the extra risk they will misuse it.

                                        If the government are to show any sign of being genuine here or any indication they will not just take an intransigent approach to every amendment then they should respond to reports such as this, with its concerns. My understanding is this is about a record number of concerns. Senator Ray, the Chair of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, said that. He has been around this place for a long time, so he would know whether or not a record number of concerns were raised about a package of legislation by this particular committee. It is a non-partisan committee. You cannot just slap it down and say, ‘They do not care about the kids,’ or, ‘They’re trying to hold it up,’ or all of the excuses that have been thrown at any of us who raise any concerns. It is incumbent on the government to respond to these concerns in a comprehensive way on the basis of the concerns themselves and for the broader purpose of demonstrating some semblance of good faith, some semblance that they will take an attitude that is less than totally intransigent and some recognition that they will work cooperatively with people across the board in recognition that the stated goal of all of this is better protection of children. It is something that is held by virtually everybody as a desirable goal. But you need to do more than agree to the goal; you have to work together cooperatively if you are to have any chance of achieving it.

                                         Senator Bartlett has spoken about a suite of issues with regard to these bills. But the notion that the government have created such anguish, the notion that we have created an extra burden upon these communities is a false one, because the fact is that, two or three days after the intervention occurred in the communities, the communities themselves were very happy with that. They were very calm. The notion that people would be fleeing into the sand dunes was as a result of some very mischievous misinformation. It was a tragedy that people brought that into the communities. Tragically, the principal resisters in the communities have been some of the white advisers. They are the sort of people who do not want change, for whatever reason.

                                         Communities such as Elliott have rung up and said: ‘We’re excluded from this process and we want to be involved. Please let us also be involved. It is so important that we do not want to be seen to be left out of this opportunity.’ The notion that we have created anguish does not seem to me to reflect what is happening in the community.

                                         We have spoken of the recommendations in the

                                          Little children are sacred

                                         report, and I hope I will not be regarded as being flippant in making the throwaway line that these recommendations were not important. The substance of the report was that there was serial child abuse, if you like, which was happening throughout these communities and it was largely underreported. I do not think anybody is questioning that part of the report. They acknowledged that something has to be done. You talk about the second recommendation, Senator, where it says that we have to go out and consult. I can recall travelling with the minister for more than 14 months. There were six visits to Wadeye and four to Galiwinku—and the list goes on. We were not just having tea at all those places; we were talking to the community at all levels to find out how we could make the lives of those Indigenous people, particularly living in those communities, better across a whole suite of issues.

                                        <p>
                                         I find it very difficult to say what sort of questions we should have been asking. Perhaps we should have consulted and said, ‘There is child abuse happening in the communities,’ and I am sure they would have said, ‘Yes, we want that to stop.’ Would we have said, ‘Do you want alcohol to keep coming into the communities?’ Depending on who you asked, they possibly would have said, ‘We’d still like to have our alcohol.’ We could have said: ‘What about the provision of the infrastructure? We’re unable to do it.’ In Wadeye we did 14 months of discussion simply to provide infrastructure so that, when somebody pushed the button on top of the porcelain, that particular day’s breakfast went away. Everybody takes it for granted: push the button, it goes away; it is not part of your family forever, it is not part of the household. Of course, we should not be taking that for granted because when infrastructure is ageing and has not been maintained then you need to fix it, but after 14 months of negotiating and consultation we cannot get to a basic agreement to be able to repair this infrastructure.

                                         In terms of this emergency, we know it is absolutely essential that we ensure there is a clear path so that we can do it swiftly. In fact, we are saying that we think we will be able to repair the infrastructure in the community in five years, and then this will just lapse automatically—it has a sunset clause. There is no mischief in that. It is simply the practical application of something we found out throughout our consultation process and through trying it the other way, the way of, ‘We’ll keep spending; we’ll keep talking,’ when we could not even put in basic infrastructure that way. Part of the challenge has been putting in the governance arrangements and the time that that takes. If we are fair dinkum about an emergency response we need to ensure that we have the capacity to make a difference now, not to simply be saying, ‘Well, what we’re going to do is try to achieve just the basic levels of amenity that we all take for granted.’ We have said that we will achieve this. While it is important that we listen and consult widely, we have already done that. In terms of the report, if you look at this whole suite of recommendations I think you will see that they are behind us.

                                         government. I have to say that the senator has made some good points. It is extremely complex legislation and in many ways it is unique. It is very rare that we would have legislation that says: we will apply this legislation, but if the Northern Territory applies legislation then ours will lapse. It is very complicated, and it is not the normal way we would provide legislation. We would prefer most of the legislation with regard to the alcohol, for example, to be a provision of the Northern Territory legislation. That would make sense, and that is the way that would be. But in the interim, to show that this is something that needs to be done, we have rolled it out in this fashion. We have worked very closely with the Northern Territory government so that if they are prepared—and we believe they are in most of the fundamentals—they will be putting in legislation that reflects these things and then our legislation will lapse.

                                         For all those reasons, yes, the legislation is complex, but this is necessary. Senator, the way you have to see this is that we need to get something done in our own lunchtime. For years and years, part of our failure has been that we have said: ‘We’ll think about it. We’ll take time.’ Clearly, that is not working. It has not worked. I am delighted to say that, in the communities where the intervention has moved in, people are in there helping other people in a practical way. That is all we are doing. I have heard the notion repeated in this place and in the media about the involvement of the

That was what that was about. Senator, you are quite right when you say people do get a bit anguished, but they will not be anguished when they actually understand what we are doing.

It is important that people understand exactly what our terminologies are and exactly what we as an Australian community are intending by these things. That is why we will be continuing to invest in those things. There will be a more comprehensive response to the report. In the first line of my response I said we will be supporting either in full or in part all of the recommendations in the report. The vast majority of the recommendations in the report are, I think, of most significance. But we will be properly responding to this report, and the minister is considering that response at the moment. But, again, with regard to the anguish on the ground, when people have learned the details they have welcomed it.

I have read the bill, and this is where I may be misinterpreting either what the minister just said or the bill. The bill identifies Indigenous violence or child abuse as serious violence or child abuse committed ‘by or against or involving’ an Indigenous person. My interpretation of that is that that means ‘by an Indigenous person’, not ‘by a non-Indigenous person’. Can the government please clarify what it means? Does this actually relate specifically to Indigenous people? The

The committee report was unanimous across the parties with a record number of concerns touching on its terms of reference. They are not policy based but are based on fundamental principles that should be applied to every piece of legislation that is considered and passed by this chamber. Is there any recognition from the government that this even exists? We are talking about fundamental breaches of civil rights and freedoms. You can put forward a rationale and justifications for it, but do not just ignore the whole thing as if it did not exist, and do not just give us a bunch of assertions and a few travel stories.

It is incomprehensible that there is no recognition of the role of this committee, which has been in existence for decades, and the importance of the issues that it looks at day after day. You are a minister now, Senator Scullion; you are supposed to look at this stuff. I know you are not the primary minister, but you should know that that is what it is there for. I am sure you have not been a minister long enough to forget what it is like not to be a minister and to forget about the role that committees play. These are fundamental, non-partisan, basic issues before we get into some of the policy detail. Is there going to be any response to that? Can the Senate expect that response whilst we are still considering the legislation or will we get some perfunctory piece of rubbish some time down the track when you can be bothered?

                                                If Senator Scullion thinks that he is the first person on the planet who can design an initiative to assist any community in a colonised society, let alone an Indigenous community, without consulting the community and that it will work, then he really has a messiah complex. That is not even basic public policy 101; it is whatever comes before that—it is high school stuff.

                                                There is a notion that consultation means delay. I guess for a government that are not used to consulting it is understandable that they do not comprehend that it is possible to consult as you are doing things—working with people continually and moving forward. We had some indication in the Senate committee process that there was some intent to do that, and I know that there has been some consultation happening here and there. Consultation does not equal delay; consultation means making sure your implementation is more likely to work, because you are working with the people that you are implementing for.

                                                report? Many of the people in the Territory who put a lot of trust in the people putting this report together and who opened up on very difficult issues and provided the data that has been used to highlight the concerns and the need for action are still working off this as something of a guide for the way forward—obviously in conjunction with what the federal government is now doing and in conjunction with what the Territory government is now doing. Is that now all behind us? Has that now been superseded? Is that the understanding that people out in the wider community should have?

We have to try and get some common ground here. I am sure we will not get common ground on the legislation but we have to have some common ground about where we are going forward from. We need some clarification about what the government’s relationship, understanding and attitude is towards the

                                                 , frankly, I think that most people who have had much to do with this debate and those who have considered both the shocking content of the report and the recommendations could not help but be underwhelmed, Senator. I do not think that you should be anything but disappointed. As for it being very bureaucratic and having more consultation, you say that consultation does not mean delay. We have been consulting. If you look back over time, in July 2006 we had a summit that everybody contributed to about child abuse and violence. There was a series of reports, and Senator Heffernan made an excellent contribution earlier in which he referred to another report, and we are now saying: ‘We won’t really delay, but let’s go and talk about these things again. Let’s go and have another round of consultation about something we already know about.’ If we read the report, we are all, as Australians, absolutely horrified and shocked by it—and so we should be. Whilst the report talks about advisory bodies and frameworks and reviewers and coordinators, one of the things that it seems to lack, fundamentally, is action. Perhaps that is the difference between how this government views it and how others view it. We have spent years on consultation and there has been no action at all. I am very cautious and respectful, but, if you consulted with the kids or women who are being abused or the families of those people, they would say: ‘Act now. Act yesterday.’

The key point that Senator Bartlett is making is not whether you have consulted but whether you actually listen to anybody or whether you press on in this determination that you know best and that no-one else’s opinion is of any value. Your having just trashed the

                                                    There has been a lot of concern in the community about failure to listen to

                                                    report, and I know from the treatment of parliamentarians in the opposition what has happened. The opposition offered bipartisan support for the emergency response yet they saw the bills when the parliament resumed. Who did you talk to in between times? Who was consulted as you drafted the legislation? As I understand, it was all driven inside FaCSIA. The question is not whether you have consulted or have been engaged, but what happens next.

                                                    I think the minister has engaged with Indigenous issues in a way previous ministers have not, and I give him credit for that. He has actually taken a keen interest, while I think that some of the others prior to him did not do that. So I am the first to give him credit for that. But what worries me is his absolute conviction that, having come to Indigenous affairs in the last 18 months with no knowledge or interest before that, somehow he has got a magic solution to every problem and he knows best. I find that frightening. The one thing that I understand about Indigenous affairs is that the solutions are complex, difficult and hard to achieve. If there were a simple solution to all the issues in Indigenous affairs, someone would have come across it before Minister Brough. Certainly when I was shadow spokesman it struck me how enormous the task was and how complex the challenges were. I reject and cannot accept that somehow there is some simplistic solution, particularly when it means the minister taking over complete control.

It gives the minister some of the widest powers in any legislation to override the act, to take powers unto himself that have traditionally not been powers that this parliament has granted. So it is a very serious question, but we get no answer. We do not get a sense that anyone is listening.

                                                    The government have said that they will pass the bill and look at that later. But people say: ‘Are you listening? Do you understand and are you responding? Or are you so convinced that you know everything that no-one else has anything to contribute to the debate?’ I would like the minister to indicate, for instance, whether the government are going to accept or support any of the amendments moved. I notice that for the first time in living memory, I think, on a large set of bills there are no government amendments. I cannot recall the last time on a set of large bills drawn up so quickly that we did not have any government amendments. Usually the government—even this government, unrestricted in the Senate, having the numbers to do what they want—move large numbers of amendments as they realise the faults in the legislation, as they listen to responses and as they listen to what people say to them. Therefore I would like to ask the question: will the government support any amendment moved by the opposition, the Democrats or the Greens and will the government respond in any way in terms of the legislation to the legal and constitutional committee report? They say they accept many of its recommendations, but there are no government amendments reflecting that—nothing reflects that report.

                                                    I do not want to know whether you are consulting, Minister. I want to know whether you are listening, whether you think anybody else has a view of any value in this debate, whether or not the Senate is going to play any useful role today or whether, as seems apparent, no amendments will be entertained. I know the minister was forced into having the Senate inquiry by other ministers concerned about another example of the government’s abuse of Senate power, so we had the farce of a one-day committee. It has been the minister’s practice in bringing legislation before this place that everything has to be passed within a week. Labor accepts this as urgent. We have given you the cut-off; we have brought it on and we have indicated that we are going to deal with this urgently. I think there is not enough focus from some of my colleagues in the Senate on the enormity of the threat to children and the need for an urgent response. Labor absolutely accepts that.

I am not going to score cheap political points about all the times the government has not responded in any way, let alone urgently or adequately, but I think it is important that we understand whether or not the government is at all interested in listening to anyone—be they senators, be they Indigenous people or be they anyone who has taken an interest in the matter.

I met with the local people not long after his first visit, and they were certainly very offended by the manner in which he treated them—I think he got some national

This was the last one before this one, not the one before that or the one before that in the 11 years of the Howard government, which has found the solution to Indigenous affairs. The last one before this one was what was termed the ‘quiet revolution’. Dr Shergold indicated it was a bold experiment in implementing a whole-of-government approach to policy development and delivery.

The trial was a complete failure, as were the other seven, and the bureaucracy and government failed to deliver on its promises to those people. If you are going to talk to me about Wadeye, Minister, talk to the chamber: let us have the whole story. Let us have the story about this government’s failures in Wadeye as well and about its failures to deliver on the promises made by previous ministers and by the government.

I did not make myself too popular with a few of my colleagues by saying so a while back, but you have got to admit the reality. I do not want to be lectured about FaCSIA’s engagement with Wadeye, given their failure and the government’s failures there. We have got to admit that government has been part of the problem and has failed these people in the past. Having got that off my chest, the key question—

                                                        I apologise, Mr Temporary Chairman. The reason I rose is to say: do not tell the Senate that the government have consulted. The question is: are they listening? I suppose the best way of bringing that question to a head is by asking: will the government move any amendments following the Senate legal and constitutional report on the bill and will the government accept or support any of the amendments to this legislation proposed by anyone other than the government and their own department?

                                                         The Leader of the Opposition  in the Senate accuses us of perhaps not listening, even if we have consulted, and reflects upon me not lecturing people, particularly about the circumstances of Wadeye. Senator Evans, it is tremendous to see that someone like you has gone out on the ground and has met people. I acknowledge the work that you have done in that area and I think it is important, but I cannot let some of those comments pass when you talk about FaCSIA going into these communities. I know that the minister has been in Wadeye five or six times, and I have been with him on a number of occasions and I was there on the first occasion that you reflect on.
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                         The minister visited Wadeye in very troubled times—I think that has been well enough reported—but on a number of other occasions I know that he has gone out of his way to sit down for long periods of time, not in the council surroundings but under a tree with the women and the children. When you go to Wadeye now with Minister Brough, he is nothing less than loved because of the effort that he has put into sitting down and listening to the people on the ground—not necessarily the leaders, but at every level including the women and the children. He has spent a great deal of time there.
                                                        </p>

                                                         I am not being glib, Senator Evans, when I say that the minister has consulted and he has listened, and I think he has a very clear idea of the needs of the communities. That is why it is not an unsophisticated intervention that just deals with issue of child abuse. Those opposite, including Senator Crossin, remind us often that you cannot just deal with one part of this. This is a suite of challenges: infrastructure, education, having enough food on the plate and having a community store where you can buy food are all fundamental elements of this. That is why the intervention has dealt with this solution over such complex areas with a sophisticated and complex response.

I agree: the trials can reasonably be described as a monumental failure—and I was on that program. So we cannot keep doing the same sort of stuff. The circumstances in Wadeye often reflect those in many of the other areas around the

We have been listening not only to the senators opposite but to the many commentators in the media and, for a very long time, to the people on the ground. Senator, we have been listening. That is why, when we acted, we did things that we thought would make a great deal of difference on the ground.

I dismissed out of hand the recommendations of the report, and I stand by that. The report was not a report on us. The report, which was a series of recommendations, was given to the Northern Territory government. As I said, I am delighted to see that the Northern Territory government will be responding to those recommendations in a few days. What we have done is respond to the fundamental elements of the report. We knew that we needed to again provide the rule of law. We knew that we had to stop the amount of alcohol going into the communities and the degree to which that alcohol was impacting on the interaction within families. We also needed to deal with the issue of infrastructure, as well as the long-term issue of education: ‘You cannot have a passport to the front gate unless you have an education.’ There are a whole suite of issues that we have dealt with comprehensively.

                                                         I can understand your perspective on this. You would not have the intimate knowledge that I have of the minister’s capacity to listen and to interact with the community. He did that so many times, not just in one community but right across the Northern Territory. He has taken a personal role in this, as you acknowledge, which is rare. It has been a real privilege to be with him. He is very much a listener. Much of the response is a result of what he heard. It is an emergency response. The fundamentals for changing the nature of those communities are contained within that response. I acknowledge the fact that, principally, Labor are not debating those issues and that you support us on those fundamentals. I particularly acknowledge that you recognise this as a matter of urgency and that we have to get in there and move things. All I can recommended, shadow minister, is that you speak again with those communities. I am sure you will, because you have contacts in the

                                                         community. Certainly Senator Crossin has contacts in those communities.

                                                         All the feedback from the communities—which is unfiltered feedback—is that the intervention has been delightfully received. It was reported in the newspaper that a 10-year-old in Maningrida had been raped. This occurred some two weeks into the so-called ‘break’, but maybe it was about 10 days after the announcement. The article in the paper reported that the entire community surrounded the house where the incident occurred and had to be dissuaded from taking things into their own hands. I am not sure whether that would have happened before the intervention. I feel a sense that these communities are becoming empowered, particularly the women. This will ensure that the circumstances that we read about in the report will be a thing of the past. Senator, while I accept that those on the other side are allowed some cynicism and some leeway, I would assure you that the intervention is in the best interests of our most vulnerable

We know that people in Wadeye and in other places need help—they need assistance—with their governance arrangements. It is not interdicting; it is not saying, ‘We’re going to usurp you and you are going to be moved aside.’ The manager of government business in the community will add another layer of assistance to ensure that communities have the administrative capacity. It will ensure that they can get assistance with any of the management arrangements. So it is not about usurping any of the original arrangements; it is about working alongside people and assisting and supporting them with those governance and administrative arrangements.

We accept that one of the most important parts of the intervention is to recognise the diversity of the communities and where they are up to. Many are wonderful, strong, vibrant, operational communities and, at the other end of the scale, there are dysfunctional communities, with very few governance arrangements that one could put any trust in. So, when the government business managers move in to improve the delivery of the services in the prescribed communities in the

You may not be aware of this, but we would anticipate another 25 to 30 applicants who will be offered the government business management position. We have not determined the destinations, the designations and the deployment dates as yet. They will be affected by release dates from the current agencies. You can imagine the challenges with housing in some of these areas. There is no set time for these to be rolled out. The principle is that there are different circumstances in each community, and those circumstances will be taken into consideration in terms of the role of the government business manager.

The individual is an asset of FaCSIA. The capacity for that particular individual to be able to interact as successfully as he has in that community will continue. I have no information about his actual delegation, whether he has been blessed as a government business manager or not, but I know he remains in the community and he continues to assist us. But I am not able to provide you with information about his exact status. He has been in the community for a long time. We expect a valuable asset like this particular individual to remain in the community for some time to generally assist with governance arrangements, as he has, and no doubt in the future it will be in the context of the intervention.

As I said, it is unclear in each community whether or not a particular delegation of one individual in one community is made. Frankly, I do not know how helpful it is in terms of the consideration of the legislation. As I said, at this stage my answer is that I am unaware of that. If you insist I take it on notice, I will. I just am not really sure of the context of the question in relation to the legislation.

We have a situation where we have been given legislation less than 10 days ago and we have a very rare opportunity to drill down into how this legislation is going to work on the ground. I am asking for a specific response to how this will work on the ground at Wadeye, seeing that you already have a FaCSIA member there. My question is: will this person become the government business manager? I do not think it is unreasonable to take that question on notice and give us a response to that.

That has already commenced. That is going to include cross-cultural training, particular occupational health issues that one would meet in a community that one may not have experienced in other parts of their lives, four-wheel drive defensive driving—whilst one may raise their eyebrows about that, it is very important for those people who have not driven a four-wheel drive; it is a very different experience, particularly on some of the roads in those areas—and financial management. Some of the experienced applicants, as I said, will simply require a top-up in a whole range of those skills. But the orientation is to prepare individuals so that they can provide the very best level of amenity that they would normally provide outside the community. They will be able to provide that as best they can in a community context.

I am unaware of any conversation that provided information that they were, in fact, a town camp. As I said, the most important point with regard to Elliott is that they have contacted us and we are in active consideration of ensuring that they have the same level of amenity provided to them as to others on the list.

I am happy to table a copy of it; I am sure they would not mind. Minister Scullion, what you say reaffirms to me that these communities have been chosen for anything other than their level of child abuse. I do not know the answer to this, but I understand that, in Elliott, 12 children were identified as being alleged victims of child sexual abuse. It begs the question as to whether this government really has the objective of tackling child sex abuse when Elliott is known to have had 12 cases and yet is excluded from the mix. I seek leave to table the letter.

The government decision was not to exclude Elliott but, in the nature of a decision, sometimes things are excluded. In the description we said that there would be four major towns that have a strong association with camps. There was no intent at any stage to exclude towns or any

The clause says that the Commonwealth minister may declare that this division, or specified divisions of this division, cease to have effect. Could you give me an indication of under what circumstances this unprecedented action may occur from the minister?

On page 22, clause 26 talks about filters on computers. Again, the minister will determine what kind of filter is to be installed on computers and it is an offence not to have a filter. Why would this determination be authorised in the minister rather than delegated powers? My second question is: I have a computer issued to me through the federal Public Service, so when can I expect someone to come and install that filter on my computer before I go out bush again?

As you would be aware, there are a number of different filters. I am the standard Luddite but I am told that there are a whole range of different filters and the minimum level of filter that is required was to be determined by the minister and was not to be a choice, as I understand. Should you be travelling into the community, Senator, I would recommend that you get in touch with my office. I am more than happy to ensure that FaCSIA are directed to your particular equipment and they will make some sort of an assessment of it. I am quite sure that other individuals travelling through the community would have access to the same level of amenity. I am unable to provide any further information on the particular aspects of your computer or how we can provide you with a filter.

We will be travelling to a community on Saturday, so I hope I am not in breach of this legislation if I happen to take my computer with me. We would like to comply as soon as possible if that is the case. On page 45, clause 53 exempts the Public Works Committee from examining any work under this legislation for five years. Why is that the case?

While the intent of the Public Works Act is, in normal circumstances, to provide a series of standards and processes under which you may need to move to dig a ditch or to plan something, we think in the nature of the emergency we need to ensure that we can do this in a timely fashion. As with the other governance arrangements that I touched on in a previous submission, it is clear that we do need to move swiftly. We want to ensure that standards will be maintained, but we also need to ensure that we do not have to refer to some other piece of legislation that may not assist us in that matter. With regard to your previous question, I understand that we will not be enacting this legislation for some 28 days. So one would hope, as we will be sitting again before that time, that I can provide information to you. You will not be unlawful travelling to the community on Saturday, and it gives us some time to provide you with this highly technical piece of information.

I could probably say pretty much anything that you would build on a community is within the scope of public works. The general infrastructure that we are dealing with is housing and associated infrastructure. So the infrastructure that we would put in is the houses and the supporting infrastructure. It is the intention that that would be the basic and principal activity that we would wish to be exempted from the public works process.

I am not sure that I was aware of that. I understood that we had to deal with the bill this fortnight because of the urgency, and Labor supported the urgency of these measures. In fact, we were going to have the parliament recalled. Am I now to understand that it will not be enacted for 28 days?

I am not on the Public Works Committee, but I understand they only kick in and look at work to be built by the Commonwealth if it is above a certain threshold. I am not entirely sure what that threshold is, but I am pretty sure it would not be the cost of a house on a community—I am pretty sure it would be many more hundreds of thousands of dollars beyond that. Minister, I still ask what it is you might envisage you would build on a community that would exceed that large amount of money and that this would prohibit the Public Works Committee from looking at.

As you would know, a large amount of infrastructure is required on these communities, and it may well be a large number of houses and associated infrastructure. Like you, I have no knowledge of the threshold required by the Public Works Committee, but I would imagine that the nature and the size of the infrastructure required in this particular challenge would be something that might well fall within their purview.

I intended to discuss the appropriation bills at the time they were discussed. I recognise that this is in general discussion but, if you can give me leeway of a few minutes, I will do my best to find out exactly what that particular part of the clause refers to and perhaps give you some more information with regard to the consolidated revenue fund.

This is under division 4: ‘Compensation for acquisition of property’. Are we talking about funds that will be appropriated accordingly under this section and which will be released with the passage of these bills, or are we talking about funds that are yet unknown which will need to be released over the course of the next five years because the appropriation bills before us are only for 12 months?

However, I think it would be more useful if I provided on notice the answer to your question.

We do not know what the parliament is committing the taxpayer to, and we should know. Before moving on from the appropriation clause, the committee needs to know the limit of the appropriation that the government can assure the parliament of. If the government cannot make that assurance by giving us the sum, what will the mechanism be for coming back to the parliament to properly account for the appropriation that would then be made by the government? Or is it that the government is planning to simply appropriate money without reference to the parliament by dint of this clause, which is open-ended and has no limit to it?

We have said that will be the case. But we do not have a capacity at this stage, as you have indicated, to come up with a dollar figure for that amount. In terms of a further appreciation of what that sum may be, we will not be able to know that until such time as the negotiations are entered into or there is some sort of settlement.

                                                                                                          </p>

I think there is little doubt that the Commonwealth has the power to do that under the Constitution—but, when it does that, it must come to a just terms arrangement. And the basis of a just terms arrangement, as the minister will know, is an agreement coming out of a mutual discussion and understanding between the parties. But there has been none here. The government are simply saying: ‘We’re coming to take your land; end of discussion. What’s more, instead of discussing what would be just terms, we are going to go outside just terms—we’ve got that in our legislation—and we’ll pay a reasonable amount.’ This is unconstitutional behaviour, drawn up by unreasonable people, saying, ‘We will resort to our reason, not the other party’s rights under the Constitution to be involved in the just determination of compensation.’

Is the minister not aware that property is not just land value according to the big end of town; that, for Indigenous people, property, amongst other things, has an inheritance. For Indigenous people, there is a deep bond with the land which cannot be duplicated somewhere else. It has an extremely valuable non-tangible component for the people who are being dispossessed here. You cannot simply go to the Valuer-General as if that bond means nothing and simply say, ‘Give us a value of this land,’ as if some itinerant real estate agent wanted to sell it to somebody. That is not how it works. The minister may not understand it and Prime Minister Howard may have no idea of the relationship that there is between

In fact, the committee was furnished with Mr Walters’ opinion. The end of that opinion states:

Rather, the legislation purporting to authorise the acquisition of the property would be struck down as void.

This is the conservatives breaking the highest law of this land, which is the Constitution. This is a conservative government—and isn’t it so often the case?—saying, ‘We are above the Constitution.’ The Prime Minister stands in front of the flag and uses all the symbols of this nation, but when it comes to Indigenous people he wants to override the Constitution through this legislation. Chair, you will understand, even if the minister and the Prime Minister do not, that you cannot do that.

It says: ‘If you want to get your constitutional rights you’re going to have to go to court. The parliament is not going to fix it up.’ Why isn’t the parliament going to fix it up? Because the government has the numbers and the parliament is being used as a rubber stamp by the executive office of Prime Minister Howard. They are saying: ‘We’ll fit out the Constitution. We’ll put it on the shelf because we have a political aim here.’ Not to put too fine a point on it, that aim is to defraud the Aboriginal people of their land using a valuation system which ignores their relationship with their own land. It ignores their rights and it ignores 60,000 years of cultural heritage and puts it in the hands not of the Constitution, justice or fair-mindedness but of the Valuer-General of the

                                                                                                            I was just musing on a contribution from Senator Bartlett when he said that it is very sad on this occasion that we seem so split on this. I agreed that it was very concerning, but it is because of the sorts of submissions that we are getting from Senator Bob Brown. We come up here to look at something and he has to throw in ‘dispossession’, ‘unconstitutional’ and ‘the hall of injustice’. Maybe Senator Brown will get a moment on television and no doubt that is what he is here for. But, in terms of clarity, he could not have misled the Senate more on any of those issues. But he did ask two questions which I think are important. He asked how you reflect on ‘just terms’ and ‘reasonable compensation’ and those issues. Whilst I am not a lawyer, the government would not bring legislation into this place that is unconstitutional. We know that it would not get the support of our own members.
                                                                                                           </p>

                                                                                                            Perhaps I should go to the particular question of reasonable compensation and just terms. I am advised that that these terms are interchangeable for legislative drafting. When I made the inquiry I was told that the requirement is an objective one enforceable in the courts and is not left to the discretion of an official. By ‘an official’ I mean any legal authority. This formulation has been accepted by the courts and in particular was approved by the full bench of the Federal Court in the Minister for Primary Industry and Energy v Davey, which held that reasonable compensation fulfilled the requirement to pay just terms. While I am sure that you have had some legal advice that this is unconstitutional and this is a ‘hall of injustice’, Senator Brown, the facts of the matter are that we have checked this and ensured that this is not unconstitutional.

This is a very unique circumstance. We will not own the land. We are not taking the land away. We are simply ensuring the governance arrangements for the swift provision of housing and infrastructure. We have specifically said that after five years, which is the general intent, we will have completed the job and the land will be automatically returned. It would need no act of parliament as it is simply a sunset clause and the land would be returned. They are very different circumstances.

In fact, the Valuer-General is not some assistant to some grubby real estate agent, as perhaps Senator Brown would have us think.

It takes into consideration spiritual issues, cultural issues and sacred sites. Even between

Senator Brown has the notion that this is something that is unconstitutional or somehow dispossessing people. He well knows that they still own the land. Let us take away for a moment the cloak of mischief that you place on the legislation currently before the Senate. We are not there to create mischief; we are there to help provide the rule of law and order. We will help to provide the ordinary amenities, services and houses that the rest of Australia takes for granted.

But all Australians know—and they have carefully watched the interdiction process and are widely supportive of it—that there is no mischief intended by this; none whatsoever. I hope that that provides some clarity and specifically answers your question.

Specifically in response to that effort to answer my questions—which ducked the central point of those questions—could he turn to clause 60(1), which says:

Why is there this clause, then, talking about land that has been resumed or in respect of which a lease has been forfeited? Clause 60(2) reads:
                                                                                                            </p>

                                                                                                            </p>

What on earth is that clause doing in there if it is not meant as it is written? Can the minister answer that?

Leave should be given. Teori Tau did not rest upon any principle carefully worked out in a succession of cases. Rather, it is contrary, at least as regards this tenor, to the reasoning which underlay Lamshed v Lake and Spratt v Hermes. Where the question at issue relates to an important provision of the Constitution which deals with individual rights, such as s 51(xxxi) or s 117, the “Court has a responsibility to set the matter right”. Ultimately, it is the Constitution itself which must provide the answer.

As I have indicated, Teori Tau does not appear to have been significantly acted upon by the Parliament or territorial legislatures. It did not represent a fully considered decision which was reached after full argument by both sides. It has been overtaken by subsequent developments.

                                                                                                              </p>

It will only be if a law can be truly characterised as a law for the government of a Territory, not in any way answering the description in par (xxxi), that Teori Tau will constitute such an obstacle. And that is an unlikely situation on the view I take of the operation of the paragraph. If that be right, any implications overruling Teori Tau would have would likely be for the past rather than the future.

For example, clause 61 of the Bill requires the court to take into account certain things in determining a reasonable amount of compensation payable in relation to land - including rent paid by the Commonwealth, amounts of compensation paid under the Special Purposes Leases Act or the Crown Lands Act and any improvements to the land funded by the Commonwealth, including improvements to buildings or infrastructure. However, when the Valuer-General is to determine what is a reasonable amount of rent to be paid by the Commonwealth the Valuer-General must not take into account the value of any improvements in the land (clause 62(4)).
                                                                                                              </p>

                                                                                                               In public statements, the Minister has referred to “in kind” compensation, including by way of education grants, and renovation to buildings. This novel concept is quite distinct from what has normally been regarded as “just terms”, but whether or not it would be considered “just terms” must depend on the content, which at present is not clearly set out in the legislation.
                                                                                                              </p>

In some cases, “a reasonable amount of compensation” probably would, in terms of content, amount to “just terms”, but much will depend on factual detail. For example, the provision of educational services—which normally are available to all Australians of learning age—is unlikely to be seen as something which satisfies the requirement of “just terms”. Native title rights are of particularly profound significance to the holders, and the acquisition of those rights—often over land of little commercial value—is unlikely to be on just terms if the compensation offered is the mere payment of the monetary value of the real estate, in circumstances where there is no viable real estate market for the land in question in any event.

                                                                                                              </p>

I say “the individual” because what is just as between the Commonwealth and a State, two Governments, may depend on special considerations not applicable to an individual.

The purpose of the guarantee o f just terms is to ensure that the owners of property compulsorily acquired by government presumably in the interests of the community at large are not required to sacrifice their property for less than its worth. Unless it is shown that what is gained is full compensation for what is lost, the terms cannot be found to be just.

This evinces a drafting intention to provide protection other than the constitutional guarantee of “just terms”.

But that is what is happening here. Of course, there will be long, expensive, heart-rending efforts by people to get just terms, as under the Constitution. Ultimately, one would hope that the court would understand the complexities of appropriating land owned in communal bond by Indigenous communities in the Territory. What a terrible thing that this legislation says to them: ‘We’re coming to take your land. We’ll give you what we think is reasonable recompense and then you have to fight to get your constitutional rights.’ Can the minister cite any piece of legislation which does that to non-

I now completely understand the question, and the answer goes to the answer that I have already provided. Partly in answer to your last question: with the process that is laid down here for finding an alternative to ‘just terms’, there has to be a trigger. If you cannot come to an agreement on ‘just terms’, what do you do? You then go to the independent judicial system that we have and go down that path. It is consistent with, for example, the Customs Act; the same words are used. This is just a red herring.
                                                                                                               </p>

                                                                                                                You are trying to assert that ‘reasonable compensation’ suddenly means something different from ‘just terms’. I refer you to my earlier submission on that: in terms of drafting, they are interchangeable. I have cited a specific case of precedent under which this was ascertained. There has to be a process. Can you imagine circumstances where we would say: ‘We’re going to acquire this on just terms and we will not have a trigger system. We will not have a fallback position, so, if a negotiated circumstance is not able to be arrived at, we will have no circumstances under which people will be able to exercise their rights’? Of course we have to, which is why we have relied on the judicial system. I suppose we can continue to fool around with words but, at the end of the day, if it is an acquisition under our Constitution it will be paid on just terms.

Why don’t we just interchange them?’ Labor has an amendment which seeks to interchange them, so there is no problem. I expect you to vote for it. Given there is serious concern in the Indigenous community that somehow their compensation will be undermined or the capacity to gain compensation will be undermined by this particular phrase in the bill, why do you not just listen to those concerns and provide the reassurance by using the term which you say is interchangeable? If your answer is correct and that is the extent of it, then you should have no problem. You would be happy to say: ‘Senator Brown, Senator Evans, we are happy to help. We will make you feel more at ease. We will make all those Indigenous people who worry about this more at ease and we’ll interchange it. There is no problem because it does not make any difference.’

But if you are so convinced and are able to so reassure us that there is no difference and that the terms are interchangeable, then why do we not go with a term that everyone else has understood and which has been in other legislation for years? That would provide the level of reassurance to the chamber that you say we ought to have anyway.

I have been advised that you can also find these words in other legislation. The reason that they use these words is that they are well understood by the courts, and this has become the pro forma for how we do this. It has been tested and it is the best way to reflect exactly what we wish. It is not just a matter of turning something around. The advice was that that was part of the discussion process to arrive at this circumstance. Certainly, they have said, ‘Not only do they enjoy a similar role, when we stuck to the legislation in another matter, precedent decided that we were in fact correct.’ I am simply taking the advice of the legislative draftspeople: this is the standard procedure and this is the wording that should be used, simply because the courts understand it, and if the trigger is that it goes to the courts then they will be able to deal with that. That is the advice I have. We take advice from the legislative drafting people, as you well know. They give very good advice, they are very experienced in these matters and the advice I have is that the courts understand this matter very well and this is in fact the standard drafting process of this sort of legislation.

It is not something that just comes out of drafting people in some back room. They get instructions from the government of the day as to the outcome that is required, and that is the problem here.

If the government were in a mood to be just about that and felt that the need to do that was compelling—and we have heard no argument here at all as to why taking land off Indigenous people is going to protect the children in the way that Mr Brough or the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, would have it—then why isn’t there a description of the values that ought to be taken into account in the just terms arrangements, including the Indigenous values that we are honour bound to respect in this situation? They are swept aside as if they do not exist—well, they do not exist in this legislation. The minister says there is a provision in the Customs Act that is similar to this. Nobody’s land is being taken away in the Customs Act, I can assure you—certainly no land with which people have had a relationship for thousands of years, which is their spiritual heartspring, their ancestral land. There has never before been anything in legislation that is like this. Land has been taken in Australia from Indigenous people. That is part of their history that has led to the horrendous circumstances we know about that are part of the reason we are dealing with this legislation here tonight. But this legislation is compounding that.
                                                                                                                  </p>

                                                                                                                  </p>

It says so in the government’s legislation, for goodness sake. There is not going to be an answer out of this. Do you know why? Because the government and the Prime Minister, in their arrogance and disdain, and in the racism that is written right through this legislation, say: ‘Oh, they can go to court. We’ll use the might and power of this government to take from them, and they can go to court and see what they can get back on that.’ We know the trauma that that will cause. We move the balance here off their land—Indigenous people’s land—and put it into our courts. What a dreadful thing to be writing into legislation and asking this Senate to pass. But there it is, and the Prime Minister has got the numbers. This chamber is being used as a rubber stamp, despite the entreaties in today’s paper from Indigenous people not to do that, but that is the morality of this government.
                                                                                                                  </p>

But, no, there are other agendas at play here. This is unjust. It is unconstitutional. I would have thought we would never see a piece of legislation like this in the 21st century in the Australian parliament, but here it is. We will live to regret it. The government will live to regret it.

                                                                                                                    </a>

As the minister knows, there is a great deal of cynicism among many in the community about the government’s motives for including these land acquisition proposals in what is supposed to be a child protection measure. Labor accepted on face value the bona fides of the government in saying that we need these acquisitions to make the adjustments to housing and infrastructure that will allow us to address the underlying issues, which are effectively of poverty, that beset those communities. But, if these terms are interchangeable, why can’t you provide the reassurance of using the term that, from the evidence I have seen, is much more broadly understood in the community and among the legal community—that of ‘just terms compensation’?
                                                                                                                   </p>

                                                                                                                    There is cynicism about your motives. There is concern that proper compensation will not necessarily be paid. If the terms are interchangeable there should be no problem with the government accepting the well-established legal term ‘just terms compensation’. You defend your position, Minister, on the basis that ‘this is what the draftsman likes’. Well, bully for the draftsman! This is about what the parliament likes. This is about whether the parliament is reassured. The draftsman, as Senator Brown indicated, receives instructions from the government, and the government tick-tacks with them about how the legislation is drafted. If you want to table the advice from your draftsman that says there is a problem with ‘just terms compensation’ I would be happy to see it. But this parliament and senators in this parliament are very concerned that you do not seem to have any particular legal argument that says ‘just terms compensation’ has to be replaced by the term that, I concede, is in the Customs Act.

I do not particularly care what the draftsman does or does not like. What I know is that the legal advice Senator Brown has received and the submission from the Law Council raise concerns about the approach you are adopting. We are concerned that the terms are not interchangeable. The Law Council expressed the view in their submission that the drafting of the bill may shield the Commonwealth from a requirement to pay compensation. Their submission said:
                                                                                                                   </p>
                                                                                                                   <p class="italic">

                                                                                                                   </p>

If you are really interested in building support more broadly for these propositions and if you are really interested in reassuring people about your motives it seems to me that you could support the amendment that replaces the term ‘reasonable compensation’ with the more broadly understood ‘just terms compensation’. While you refuse to do so people will be confirmed in their doubts and concerns. If, as you said to this place, those terms are interchangeable and there is no difference, why not provide the reassurance that changing the term to ‘just terms compensation’ would provide for the Senate, the

If not for me or the Indigenous people, do it for the Law Council of Australia. Provide some reassurance that somehow the provision that you are proposing does not shield the Commonwealth from meeting its obligations for just terms compensation.

I have been informed that the modern use—probably over the last nine years—in all of the applications is the term that is referred to in front of you. I do not need to table advice. The advice is the exact words that are used in the legislation.

                                                                                                                       We have taken on the comments by the Law Council, and the advice that we have received is that that is not correct. The reason that the precedent I quoted exists is to put clarity behind that. This is the modern way of everybody who writes the legislation for this place. We may not have time to go through different pieces of legislation but I am assured that the reason for that is that it is the way the legislation is currently crafted in any of these matters—and has been for a number of years.
                                                                                                                      </p>

                                                                                                                       In relation to the terms used beforehand, I am not sure of the history of the change. When I first made a speech in here and reflected on what we were doing I used the words, ‘We will compensate on just terms.’ We have provided a precedent of a case—’What would happen if you put this word in here?’—and the court, which will be making any judgement on this matter, found that ‘reasonable compensation’ means that. I am sorry that I cannot go into the history of that but it is not just that in this case somebody said, ‘I know; we’ll use this term and not this one.’ This is the normal term which has been used for some time in drafting of this type.
                                                                                                                      </p>

This discussion has been had. It is not something that applies just to this; it has been used in all legislation for probably nine or 10 years. For those reasons the government accepted the advice of our legal section in this regard.

The boarding schools were provided for in the most recent budget; that is not part of an appropriation for this legislation. If you just give me two seconds I will find out the answer to the other aspect of the question. Perhaps I could take the second part of your question on notice, Senator Allison.

I do not have, off the top of my head, the exact numbers that will be catered for, even for the boarding school that is well into development. I can take that on notice but I say again that there is no particular or prescriptive number of people that we are catering for. Clearly, different catchments will have different demographics. There will be larger or smaller amounts according to the forward estimates of the numbers of people who will be requiring those facilities. So I do not think we will be able to place some sort of particular prescription and say that each boarding school will have so many people. The boarding schools would be required to be flexible enough to reflect the existing facilities and boarding facilities in the region, and also the projected use of the boarding school. I am sure that will differ from area to area.

Each model varies according to its resources, particularly the human resources that are available. They provide what I think is an excellent model for a breakfast and a lunch program. Will kitchens be built? It will all be about an assessment of the availability and capacity in each community. There will obviously need to be some level of amenity, and you will assess whether that amenity is there. If it is not, it will be provided. If it is, it will have to come up to a particular standard. It may well have to be adjusted for the number of children who are going to school, which we hope very much, as part of the interdiction, will increase. So we will need to ensure that the capacity is there for all those people who, we believe, should be going to the school.

Is it just a sum of money and you have yet to figure out how you are going to distribute it, or is there something more by way of detail on how this works? Like you, Minister, I have been into many schools and I know that there are lots of models for providing schools. What is being proposed in this case? How soon will it be rolled out? How is the available funding going to be distributed? Will all schools be entitled to it or expected to do it? What exactly is the plan?

Parents will be expected to pay for the food itself, as in those other models. The salaries for the preparation of the food—and that will also be a function of how many meals are being prepared and how many salaries are required—will be paid for by the Commonwealth. The equipment used to prepare the meals will also be paid for by the Commonwealth. The amounts will differ as a function of the number of people we will be catering for.

I will offer a more comprehensive briefing than I am able to give you here. In terms of the timing, there is a sense of immediacy. As part of the intervention we are ensuring that we will go and assess the schools. Some schools have quite a level of amenity; some have none. So we will make an assessment of the level of amenity. We will assess what level of amenity is needed and we will make up the difference. We will provide the salaries required against the assessment and the amount of equipment that is required to provide those meals to a standard. It is probably best for me to provide a more comprehensive briefing on exactly where we are up to in what communities, and we are more than happy to provide that.

What is the government’s plan to vouchsafe Indigenous culture and languages? These are important. Our own culture and language is part of who we are and part of the essence of our pride in ourselves and the wherewithal to be fulfilled in life. There is very great concern about this move by the government, integrating Indigenous people into non-Indigenous culture in a way that sheds their Indigenous culture out behind them. That would be an absolute and cruel tragedy. The whole world is full of experiences where you do not do that, including in this country. We know that the government has defunded programs for Indigenous languages in the last year or two. What is the funding base and the plan in this comprehensive and quite historic move to skill Indigenous people to be able to have a more rewarding role in the Australia of the 21st century to ensure that the price isn’t the further loss of Aboriginal culture and languages?

No part of this legislation says that we are going to take away culture or that we are going to take language away. I have not read any part of this legislation where I have seen that, nor has there been any indication that that would be the case. This is about providing safety and a better level of amenity for communities and families.

The same goes for the culture. I am not asking where this legislation says it is going to damage culture or language. I am saying that this enormous move is, by dint of the announcements made by the Prime Minister and the minister, one of reacculturation to have Indigenous people become integrated more into the prevailing and dominating Australian culture and to be schooled to take part in it. Where are the guarantees that that will not be at the cost of Indigenous language and culture, and where are the provisions for promoting language and culture in this legislation?

Perhaps you will have a word to Senator Crossin. There are a number of boarding schools that already do this. One of the fundamental tenets of being at the boarding schools is ‘both ways and cultures’. These boarding schools have been funded by the Commonwealth—almost every level of government has something to do with them—and they are not characterised by people losing their culture or losing their language.

I understand that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee normally table their reports on Wednesdays, but, in fact, they tabled this report yesterday specifically on these bills and it was sent under a covering letter to the minister in time for his consideration and response prior to debating this legislation today. My first question is: why is there not a response from the minister in relation to this

When I chaired that committee, and when the committee went out of its way to meet specifically and specially on certain legislation that was deemed to be highly important and to unprecedentedly table a report earlier than it normally does in a sitting week, it was customary, if not courteous, for the minister to at least respond prior to the second reading stage of the bill.

It highlights problems or deficiencies in legislation and usually alerts the minister in time for the minister to respond to or amend legislation accordingly. My experience, having chaired that committee, is that ministers usually take advice from the Scrutiny of Bills Committee very seriously, and it is not a matter of responding to that committee report like normal Senate committees. The response is usually by way of amending legislation or otherwise.

That clause makes a special appropriation out of consolidated revenue. The committee seeks the minister’s advice regarding why this special appropriation is considered necessary. I ask you now why you believe that this appropriation is considered necessary, whether any limit has been forecast as to the total amount of such an appropriation and why an explanation could not have been included in the explanatory memorandum on this provision.

Still concentrating on that clause, can I just get you to clarify this for me: a person who is merely suspected by the secretary of the department of having contravened a civil penalty provision is termed a wrongdoer, as I interpret it—you could tell me whether I am right or not—and that person is then obliged to produce information. Subclause 4 provides for an application for a Federal Court order to comply, but subclause 5 appears to make the wrongdoer subject to a penalty for failing to produce information, even in the absence of a Federal Court order. Can you explain to me why there is that inconsistency?

There appear to be significant seizure powers here on the part of police. What system will be employed? Will every household be systematically searched for pornographic material and will all that material be automatically seized and removed, or will people be invited to give it up?

Perhaps the minister could indicate how this will work in practice. Will all these three stages take place within a couple of days? Also, can you tell us what the education process is? Are people going to be given leaflets or brought together in the nearest hall? What form will that education take? I notice that there is provision for appeal and request for seized materials to be returned. Is there a warrant required before police officers can go into households and search if they suspect that all of the pornographic material has not been handed up?

Exactly how that will take shape, I will have to take on notice. But I am informed that it will be as any educational process would be. There would be a whole suite of ways you would help and assist the community to understand what our intent is. That would be done through a variety of ways. It is normally a suite of either media or interaction. One would imagine that in these communities most of the time it would involve public forums. So there would be networking and interaction of individuals who had a better understanding, who would be able to talk to other members of the community. There is a whole suite of consultation processes that take place quite often in these communities, and we would be utilising those processes.
                                                                                                                                                                  </p>

That is a matter for the police, and the police will have to behave lawfully in that matter. When the police are ensuring that there is no pornography in the community, it will be in the same way as if there was alcohol in the community. It is a matter for the police. The police have processes of investigation—people will tell them, and they have processes of networking. It is the same way that police would operate in any criminal matter.

Is that the conclusion you have reached on the basis of research that has been done in communities?

The reason for the education is not that we want to describe what pornography is; it is simply about having a clear understanding of exactly what the legislation says you can and cannot have—for example, what the penalties are and the whole process of introducing new legislation. That would be done at the same time as having a clear understanding about alcohol and other prohibited substances under the act. It would be an educational provision. But it is not only about saying, ‘So, you understand what pornography is.’ That is not the intent. It would be a discussion about what were the prohibited items so that everybody would have a clear understanding of what was a prohibited item and what was not. That would be the clear intent of the educational process. As I have indicated, it would be done township by township. There are some townships, for example, that we have not gone into yet; and there are some townships that would require, simply because of our knowledge of the assessment, an interdiction later in the piece than those with a much higher level of requirement. We will rolling them out as a matter of priority, but it will also be in the context that some communities are extremely dysfunctional and the people in those communities are at a higher level of risk than those in the other communities that have been assessed. We will be doing it in terms of the priority of protecting those townships that have been assessed as being most at risk.

But can I ask a question to follow up from Senator Allison’s. If you actually read the Anderson-Wild report, you will see that their concern is not the level of pornography; their concern is access to Austar, and adult channels which are available on Austar, and the fact that they are on day and night and there is no understanding or appreciation from adults that it might be a channel that you should only access after kids have gone to bed or they are not around. Quite clearly, I do not believe you can prohibit people from purchasing those channels on Austar. So, in the government’s attempt to get on top of this in communities, what focus will there be on educating people or focusing people’s attention on the access to Austar that they currently get? My understanding when I go to communities is that it is not actually pornography that is sent into communities that is very explicit that children are being exposed to; it is just the average viewing that you would see on adult channels on Austar that is being made available during the afternoon and early evening. What are you planning to do to get on top of that problem?

We are currently discussing ways of ensuring that there are some adult channels that you can purchase at the moment that you will not be able to purchase. We are having discussions with the providers of those services, to look at ways that we can have more control of that. We are in a discussion process at the moment. The current provisions are for specifically classified pornography. It is quite a clear classification. As I understand it, those channels, whilst they may well be harmful—and we understand that may be the case—are not the intention under the existing provisions. But we are looking very carefully at ensuring that we do have provisions, community by community, to ensure that there is some capacity to ensure that they cannot be delivered in certain areas, should that assessment be made. We are in the middle of discussions on that particular issue.

On the original question of the wrongdoer, I understand that the term is simply used to refer to the person who, it appears, may have contravened a civil penalty, and there is no express definition. That is the intent of wrongdoer. In terms of a discrepancy, I am advised that there are two matters. In the first matter, if a person is not a wrongdoer and is requested to give information and they do not give information then it is an offence, and, in the second matter, a person can be compelled by a court to give information.

We have been over some of these questions, but for the benefit of the senator I will go over the two aspects. The first is the present consultation. I think you were referring not to consultation right now but to the consultation leading up to the interdiction. I understand what you are asking. There was a large process of consultation that, as a consequence of a whole range of government inquiries over many years, was effective. Senator Heffernan was referring to a substantive report he chaired on the matter some years ago. We could all recognise that this has been an issue for a number of years and, in the media, this government has been roundly criticised for what it has done in 11 years.

When we have gone into the communities, we have been welcomed. As we move into the communities, we are providing an education package to ensure that people understand exactly what we are trying to achieve and to explain what the legislative changes will mean to them, including particular aspects of the requirements—it might be alcohol or pornography; it might be a whole range of things. It is very important that the intervention teams have a good network and are able to communicate to the communities what their roles are and exactly what is going to happen. This has been happening and, I have to say, I am very heartened by the reports back from the intervention teams that they have been very welcomed in the communities.

As people become more aware of the interdiction, we will have a sharper package and we will have a package that, I suspect, becomes more and more effective. At the moment, every aspect of the package that we are rolling out comes with an education system, ensuring that everybody in the community understands what we are on about and particularly understands some technical aspects of the law in what we are trying to achieve. They can then have an understanding, for example, of what the 1,350 millilitres of alcohol means. It is very important that we can explain it in ways that people understand. We can talk about personal penalty points, but we have to explain exactly what that means, so part of the role of the intervention team is an education role. We have been rolling that out and it is a fundamental plank of the intervention. We will continue to ensure that people are as completely informed of the intervention as they can be.

My second question is about pornography. This is obvious but needs to be restated because there are some minor queries brought by some. Why do you believe that pornography has a detrimental affect on the kids who are exposed to it? I am stating for the record that I have clear beliefs about how it affects them and why it is detrimental, but I think it is very important to get on the record why we have made a specific statement against pornography and are getting it out of these communities.

That is a fundamental concern for me. I wonder how people thought that this behaviour could be normal—that children of 11 and 12 years of age could be perpetrators. It is a difficult area to even understand, let alone talk about, but some of the experts say that the use of pornography grooms young people—that, if they are exposed to explicit pornography, it is perhaps seen as a function of a normal physical relationship. If young people see that as being the norm—as something people do all the time—it is a great problem.
                                                                                                                                                                               </p>

                                                                                                                                                                                There has been much documentation on the impact of pornography on young people. As Senator Crossin pointed out, it is not so much that it is explicit pornography but the fact that it is available to such young people. We have laws in this country that prohibit young people from accessing pornography and laws that prohibit the showing of pornography to them. The laws in respect of protecting people from pornography are often related to age. These circumstances are no different. I think the nature of the isolation of the communities and the length of time that people in some of these communities are exposed to television put them at an even higher risk. That is why removing pornography is a fundamental part of the intervention. Pornography is a very negative aspect of their lives and, as with alcohol, we need to remove pornography whilst we provide some normalisation to the community.

Do you believe these issues are also prevalent in the states? If so, how do we deal with that? Should we explicitly concentrate on children in a certain part of Australia when the same maladies are present for other children of other races and Indigenous children in other parts of our nation?

I am sure that the Commonwealth government would be more than happy to work with any other state and territory should they need assistance with a similar intervention. The government has a great deal of experience in these matters. One would hope that the states and territories that have communities of a similar demographic would move swiftly to ensure that those communities get the same level of safety that those in the Northern Territory communities will shortly enjoy.

They give the government the power to exclude anyone from the land—and I would like the minister to confirm that—including the people who live there, which is quite extraordinary. I would therefore like to ask a couple of questions. As I understand it, the reason that the government wants to amend the permit system is so that Aboriginal communities cannot exclude people from the communities, yet the government wants that same power for itself. What sorts of laws does the government envisage that the Commonwealth would be able to exclude itself from applying on lands that it will be administrating under this bill?

Perhaps that was a circumstance of their legislation. We are not sure of this, but we suspect it was probably more resource driven and that there was no mischief about it as it happened for a long time over different governments. These extraordinary powers are necessary to deal with an extraordinary situation. In terms of the capacity for the minister to exclude a particular person, it is recognised that there may be somebody who should be expelled from the community—for example, a recidivist smuggler or a paedophile. It may seem inconsistent with our moves in respect of the permit system but the permit system is too broad a footprint and with it come a lot of disincentives for business and for tourism. I am sure you will cross-examine me about all those issues when we get to them but this is simply a power that is provided to the minister to exercise over a particular person. Fundamentally, these powers that are provided to the minister are there to protect the children. That is what we are about. So the purpose of the power of the minister to exclude a particular person is to ensure that children are further protected by not having that person in the community.

All the communities that are mentioned in the report were supposed to be protected by the permit system—and it simply has not been enough.
                                                                                                                                                                                     </p>

You do not need the permit system when you have the rule of law and order. The other thing is that there are benefits in having an open community. There are not only the obvious benefits that come from tourism, business and the opportunities of an economy but also the benefits that come from job opportunities. When we lift the permit system, it will only be from the road into the community and a specific discrete area of the township itself. As you would be aware, the permit system applies in all other areas.

I would like to follow up on the question I asked earlier on what operations of Commonwealth laws the government envisages will be potentially excluded under regulation from applying to the lands that the Commonwealth controls.

So I ask why it is not specific. Why is it so wide open? What guarantee does the community have that the power will not be abused—maybe not by this minister but by a future minister? I am not casting aspersions on any particular minister; I am just saying that the provision is there and, because it is such an extraordinary power, it could be abused in the future.

Senator, I do not have the answer to your question. Since I have been here, I think there may have been one. I think that probably reflects more on the responsible attitude of this particular government than any incapacity of somebody to disallow a motion. This is a regulation. It could have been done in another way. I believe it reflects your concerns. It is a broad-ranging power and, as such, should be disallowable in this place and the issues should be able to be brought back before the Senate.

It has impacts on health, on violence, on all aspects of life. If you are living in housing with 18 or 20 other people then that is fundamental to all the other aspects of your life, including health and educational disadvantage, and leaves people more prone to the issues of domestic violence and child abuse. I have always accepted that housing is central to resolving the terrible issues of poverty that affect many of these communities.

They are concerned about why these leases are necessary. Their argument has been that the government can provide housing and infrastructure without needing to take control of the leases and they argue that there are other provisions that could allow this to occur. We heard the minister talking before about the need to act more quickly, that he has been frustrated by consultation and that the government believes that the lease arrangements are necessary to be able to drive the investment in infrastructure. I am a bit concerned that the funding for housing does not seem to be specified, and that is something we will come to later. We support the need to make serious investments in infrastructure and housing and the need to take action to resolve those things and to provide better opportunities. You cannot provide security for children if they are living in houses where there are 18 or 20 people to a two- or three-bedroom house. The whole nature of that living arrangement puts those children at risk. There are questions not only of violence and sexual abuse but also of health.

Just imagine 20 people using the same toilet. Domestic bathrooms are not designed to deal with that number of people. All of those things are central to people’s lives, and housing is at the core of many of the issues we are seeking to address.

People say, ‘Well, if you are interested in child abuse what has acquiring land got to do with that?’ The connection is not nearly as obvious as police, pornography and measures to tackle those things. It is not unreasonable for people to say, ‘Explain to me what the link is and explain to me why this has to occur.’ People want some reassurance on those matters. One of the things that is most important is that action on Indigenous affairs is based on evidence and not on ideology. While the government and others often accuse Labor of being driven by ideological obsessions, there is some suggestion that perhaps a sort of anti-self-determination flavour to government action has been driving a lot of the approach of government. I listened to some of the second reading debate speeches and there seemed to be a bit of an ideological tinge to some of the addresses by government members, which concerns me.

We think that by moving for a review after a year we can look at what is occurring, whether the objectives of the intervention are being met and, if not, what steps have to be taken to correct those. It holds us accountable. We are taking measures to intervene. We ought to be held accountable for whether those measures are working and whether or not they are delivering what we say they are going to deliver. Labor takes that very seriously. We are taking a very big step. We are making a huge intervention in people’s lives and communities. We think it is for good reason, but we have to test whether or not that intervention has worked, whether or not we can do things better or differently and we have to assess whether there are unintended consequences. This stuff has been done in a rush. The legislation is going through in a rush. I would like to think we will get it perfect but we will not. We know we will not get it perfect. I hope the minister does not think we will get it perfect. That is not a reason to necessarily delay; urgent responses are needed. But it is a reason for caution. It is a reason for assessing whether or not we are meeting our objectives. The best way to do that is to have a proper review of whether these measures are meeting the objectives we have set for them.

We are going to charge in and do a whole range of things but what are we going to measure those against? The 12-month review at least provides an opportunity for the intervention to be formally assessed, for a report to be made public and for that assessment to hold the minister, the government and this parliament accountable for the measures that we take. It is important that we give people reassurance that we are going to assess whether we are meeting our objectives. It will help to allay concern about the intervention and we will get much better public policy. I know the minister indicated that the government was sympathetic to some sort of two-year review but he is not prepared to put it into the legislation.
