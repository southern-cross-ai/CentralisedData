        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Wong. Media reporting on 7 May revealed that on 4 May a Chinese military jet intercepted and deployed flares in front of an

        . It was reported that the ADF helicopter needed to take defensive manoeuvres to avoid the dangerous incident and the practice of the Chinese military jet. Minister, on what date did the Albanese government first raise Australia's concerns to the Chinese government regarding the incident that occurred on 4 May?

         Thank you to Senator Birmingham for the question. The Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and I have been very clear publicly about the unacceptable and unsafe conduct which took place while the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Defence Force
         </a>
         was contributing to international efforts to enforce
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
          UN

         Security Council sanctions against
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea" rel="nofollow">
          North Korea
         </a>
         . My recollection is—and I will check this—that the Deputy Prime Minister made public Australia's concerns on the day that we were advised of this incident. But I will check the precise date.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to make some broader points about what messages we have been clear about with the Chinese foreign minister and the Chinese government. When I engaged with the Chinese foreign minister,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Yi" rel="nofollow">
          Wang Yi
         </a>
         , as well as Minister Liu, I made clear two points. One was that Australia will continue to operate in international airspace and international waters in accordance with international law. The second point I made clear is that we will continue to express our concerns about unacceptable conduct. I'd also make the point that, unlike Mr Dutton, we're not just talking about this; we are doing it. In addition to transits and sanctions enforcement, you would be aware, Senator Birmingham, that we recently conducted joint sails with Japan, the Philippines and the United States for the first time.
        </p>
        <p>
         I again express publicly our concern at this incident and our care for the safety of Australian personnel who were operating in accordance with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council" rel="nofollow">
          UN Security Council
         </a>
         sanctions against North Korea. We would continue to urge that all militaries in the region, including the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLA" rel="nofollow">

           The Prime Minister told media in six different press conferences from 7 May that Australia had raised the incident 'at every level' with the Chinese government. He said, 'We've made the appropriate diplomatic representations,' and, 'We won't be shy about taking the opportunities to raise these issues, to make the strongest representations possible.' Can the minister please inform the Senate which ministers have sought or conducted calls with their Chinese ministerial counterparts since the incident on 4 May?

            I can be clear that the ambassador has been spoken to by my department. I can be clear to you that we have raised the points I have raised with the Chinese directly. I understand that Senator Birmingham and Mr Dutton—we've seen his transcripts—would like to try and generate some partisanship on this. We all stand in support of the ADF—all of us. I don't think there's any doubt that China has heard the message of the Deputy Prime Minister, who publicly made these statements very soon after advice was received, because they have responded. I say to Senator Birmingham: we continue to deal with these issues consistently and in a mature way. Like all Australians, we support the ADF in these operations as in all operations.

               We have dealt with this matter appropriately and consistently. I know that part of being in opposition is that you set these sorts of tests. We have made public our concerns to the Chinese authorities, including from the second-most-senior member of the government. I hardly think the implication that Senator Birmingham is seeking to make is correct. We have made this public. And I will say, certainly for my part, that this is something I have raised, as I said, with Foreign Minister
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Yi" rel="nofollow">
                Wang Yi
               </a>
               and with Minister Liu, and I will continue to raise. It is a matter of principle. It goes to Australia's bipartisan position in relation to international rules and norms. Australian personnel will continue to operate in accordance with international law in international waters and international airspace. We would look to all militaries in the Indo-Pacific and globally, but certainly in this region, to act in accordance—
