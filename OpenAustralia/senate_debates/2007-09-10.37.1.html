        My question is to Senator Ellison, the Minister representing the Minister for Defence. It concerns the extraordinarily successful
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APEC" rel="nofollow">
         APEC
        </a>
        , which concluded yesterday in Sydney. Will the minister inform the Senate how bilateral agreements signed during APEC Leaders Week will enhance Australia’s defence capability and also deliver benefits to Australia’s defence industries?

         I thank Senator Sandy Macdonald for a question which is an important one for Australia’s security and also its defence related industries. That is an area to which Senator Macdonald has made a lot of contributions and in which he has had an interest over a long period of time. In fact, I think he was even at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APEC" rel="nofollow">
          APEC
         </a>
         for part of the time.
        </p>
        <p>
         During the course of bilateral meetings at APEC, Australia progressed important defence agreements and also agreements relating to defence industries. These were with two of our most important allies, the United States of America and Japan. Firstly, in relation to the United States, the Prime Minister signed with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_George_Bush" rel="nofollow">
          President George Bush
         </a>
         an Australia-United States treaty on defence trade cooperation. That was signed on 5 September this year. This is essential for Australia’s security and defence, but also it spells good news for those many businesses involved in Australian defence because what this will do is open up new avenues for industrial cooperation between defence industries in both the United States and Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         As an indication of the benefit of this treaty, it has been indicated by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
          US
         </a>
         Department of State that 2,361 export licences and 312 technical data agreements were approved for Australia in 2006. That demonstrates the level of interest that Australian industry has in the defence industry area in the United States. Many of these approvals, which can take three months or more, will no longer be required under the treaty. Again, that is a great step forward for the Australian defence industry. But, apart from improving the timeliness of our access to US technology, this will also strengthen the cooperation between the United States and Australia in relation to defence articles including equipment and spare parts, services, related technical data and a range of other aspects of defence materiel. This is a comprehensive agreement for two-way trade between Australia and the United States. Of course, this will have to go through the domestic processes in both the United States and Australia but this is an essential step forward in relation to trade and defence as well.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Macdonald asked about agreements and our security generally.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
          Can I
         </a>
         say that, as well as the agreement with the United States, the Prime Minister announced yesterday an agreement with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Japan" rel="nofollow">
          Prime Minister of Japan
         </a>
         in relation to the endorsement of an action plan to implement the joint declaration on security cooperation, which was signed in Tokyo back in March this year. This action plan identifies a range of cooperative activities to deepen the strategic partnership between Australia and Japan, which is based not only on shared values but on the interests that we have in relation to the region.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is a new era in the relationship that we have with Japan and history will adjudge this endorsement as a key step forward in engaging Japan in the national security and defence of our region. We have been cooperating with Japan over a period of time but it is this sort of agreement between the two countries’ leaders that takes it all that much further. Of course, it also relates to the trilateral strategic dialogue which brings in the United States, so you have a strengthening of that trilateral relationship, which is also essential to the Asia-Pacific region. This was a great success, just one of many that came out of APEC. It is one which the Australian community should realise is a step forward in protecting this country and enhancing its industry.
