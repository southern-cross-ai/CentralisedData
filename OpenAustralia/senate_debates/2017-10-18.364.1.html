        I present an interim report of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Tape" rel="nofollow">
         Red Tape
        </a>
        Committee on the effect of red tape on environmental assessments and approvals, together with the
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ordered that the report be printed.
       </p>
       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the Senate take note of the report.
       </p>
       <p>
        This report considers the issue of environmental regulation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ironically, the origin of the term 'red tape' is generally attributed to the 16th century administrative system of the Holy Roman Emperor
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_V" rel="nofollow">
         Charles V
        </a>
        , which used red tape for priority documents which required immediate action.
       </p>
       <p>
        Given that red tape is now considered to be pernicious, corrosive and difficult-to-eradicate regulation, it seems highly appropriate that Charles V is more notable for his army spreading syphilis across Europe and thence to the rest of the world!
       </p>
       <p>
        In its efforts to cure the Australian economy of its own administrative social disease, the Red Tape Committee has made a number of recommendations which we hope, not to mince words, will beat the clap out of environmental overregulation!
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee's first recommendation responds to the many concerns expressed regarding the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_Protection_and_Biodiversity_Conservation_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act
        </a>
        . The committee recommends the Australian government expedite its review as required under section 522A of that act, by bringing it forward to 2018.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee further considers the inclusion of uranium mining as a matter of national environmental significance in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC" rel="nofollow">
         EPBC
        </a>
        Act is duplicative and unnecessary and recommends it be removed.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee noted that only three states or territories—
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        and Queensland—permit uranium mining in their jurisdiction, and all have well-established assessment and approval processes to which Commonwealth involvement adds little value, if any.
       </p>
       <p>
        In fact, duplication between the Commonwealth or states and territories was a major focus on the committee's inquiry.
       </p>
       <p>
        Currently, states and territories conduct environmental assessments and propose conditions of approval which must then be approved by the Commonwealth under the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC_Act" rel="nofollow">
         EPBC Act
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        This dual regulation perpetuates duplication, inconsistencies, high implementation costs and extended delays.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Productivity Commission and the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee have supported the establishment of a one-stop shop concept, and this is something that the Red Tape Committee strongly supports. The National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority, NOPSEMA, provides a model by which this might be achieved.

                      , for example, argued that the increasingly risk-averse approach of governments has resulted in unnecessary and lengthy environmental assessments, whose information requirements have no regard to materiality or level of risk. The committee learnt that, in contrast with this norm, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority's Environmental Assessment and Management Risk Management Framework follows a risk-based approach. The committee supports the broader adoption of a risk-based approach as a means of reducing unnecessary, expensive and burdensome red tape.

I don't have any problem with senators having a discussion in their seats or at sufficient distance so that the speaker is not distracted and other senators are not distracted. It's highly unusual, in all the time I've been here, for a frontbench minister and a crossbencher to be sitting so close to a speaker, certainly at this time of night. It's just bizarre that it has to be done in that area. You've brought that to his attention, and you should—

I was sitting quietly in a chair at the other end of the chamber. Senator Bernardi was not speaking to me, and I wasn't speaking to Senator Bernardi. I ask you to draw to the attention of Senator Cameron that he's making a very frivolous point of order not based on fact.

                                      That would be much appreciated. The IPA estimated that this 'anti-development activism' has caused delay and disruption valued at more than $1.2 billion over the past 17 years. Some projects never go ahead due to heightened risk of legal challenges and consequent higher capital costs.

                                      The committee found that section 487 of the

                                      Act is clearly being misused. Given that other legislative and judicial processes already provide an avenue for legitimate appeal at the state/territory level, the committee recommends the government repeal this.
                                     </p>
                                     <p>
                                      The committee also heard a range of concerns relating to the adverse effect of native title regulations on project developments, the manipulation of land councils by environmental activists, and the causal effect of this on the impoverishment of Aboriginal people.
                                     </p>
                                     <p>
                                      Accordingly, as a means to materially assist both Aboriginal development and economic development more broadly, the committee recommends the government amend the Aboriginal Land Rights (

                                      ) Act to remove the ability of land councils to arbitrarily veto applications for exploration and/or mining licences.
                                     </p>
                                     <p>
                                      The committee also urges that Commonwealth, state and territory governments develop guidelines to assist with the clear identification of the costs and benefits of proposed projects to landowners and other stakeholders. That includes shared economic benefits such as royalties.
                                     </p>
                                     <p>
                                      The committee identified that Queensland landholders received $238 million compensation as at 30 June 2015 for land access by the onshore gas industry. This clearly demonstrates the industry's ability to compromise with landholders, something which, according to the letter of the law, they do not have to do.
                                     </p>
                                     <p>
                                      In particular, the committee urges that state and territory governments consider whether landowner royalties might facilitate environmental assessment and approval of projects.

                                      The red tape committee found overregulation at the early stage of securing land tenure. Leasehold title in particular was identified as being a key problem for project proponents, with even more complicated regulatory pathways than freehold title.
                                     </p>
                                     <p>
                                      In an effort to respond to these concerns, the committee recommended that state and territory governments review land access policy and identify opportunities to facilitate the conversion of leasehold title to freehold title. The committee also recommended that regulatory oversight of activities on leasehold land be removed, to put it on the same basis as freehold.
                                     </p>
                                     <p>
                                      Throughout the inquiry, the committee heard again and again that environmental red tape is excessive and that, thanks to this, project approval processes are complex, convoluted and confusing.

                                      The committee heard that the Roy Hill iron ore mine in the Pilbara required more than 4,000 licences, approvals and permits for its preconstruction phase. And the Adani Carmichael coalmine in
