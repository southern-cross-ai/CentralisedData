            Firstly, I completely reject the premise of the question and the characterisation of the question. Secondly, the government's policy has not changed, as the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and I have now consistently stated. In fact, the policy is reflected in legislation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let me point out to the Senate that the question really is: what has happened to Labor's policy? They went to the last election proposing to increase taxes on Australians' retirement savings by more than $30 billion.
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Shorten" rel="nofollow">
             Bill Shorten
            </a>
            was preparing to put his hands into the pockets of Australians who have worked hard and were saving for their retirement. We don't know what Labor's position is in relation to that $30 billion tax hike. Does Mr Albanese still support the Shorten position of higher taxes on superannuation?
           </p>
           <p>
            We went to the last election making very clear commitments. We stand by the commitments we made before the election. Our government's policy hasn't changed.

              Minister, with the open revolt and division of government members on full display, along with the Liberals' long record of opposition to superannuation, how can Australians trust the Morrison government to protect their retirement incomes?

               -National team is, of course, a very strong and united team which went to the last election with a clear agenda to build a stronger economy, create more jobs and, indeed, ensure that Australians can be safe and secure. If only there was a bit more division on the Labor side when it comes to protecting people's superannuation savings. If only there was a bit less unity on the Labor side behind this proposition that there should be higher taxes on everyone that moves across Australia. The truth is: if Labor had been successful at the last election, Australians saving for their retirement would be $30 billion worse off right now. It's to the great relief of Australians right around Australia saving for their retirement that the Labor Party was unsuccessful and that we have been successful, because taxes across Australia will be lower as a result, the economy will be stronger and, indeed, Australians will be safer and more secure.
