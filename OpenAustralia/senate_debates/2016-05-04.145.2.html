           should not presume to tell local governments in Australia how to manage their affairs. They are, after all, creatures of state parliaments. I am advised that the Commonwealth moneys provided were to upgrade the fire protection system and develop the necessary documentation for the conservation of the

           . Further, I am advised that no final decision on either the plan or the associated development has been made. This is just a flippant Labor-Greens stunt to distract electors in the eastern suburbs of Sydney. Council has the responsibility in this area and the decision should be left to them.

              Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has trouble in his own backyard.

               Bondi Pavilion
              </a>
              , in his own seat of Wentworth, is a wonderful cultural and community centre, but the children who use the first floor of that centre stand to be evicted under the Liberal plan of the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waverley_Council" rel="nofollow">
               Waverley Council
              </a>
              . At 8 am last Saturday more than 300 people turned up to a special meeting at Waverley Council, which erupted in anger over these plans that would result in the first floor becoming a commercial precinct. They are developing a plan that is really nothing more than privatisation by stealth.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is a very simple motion that urges the Prime Minister to stand with his community, not with the developers, who so often bankroll the Liberal Party; to stand with the community for their cultural and community centre. What he should be doing is ensuring that the money is only released once there is a guarantee that the community-to-commercial mix remains and the community activities on the first floor remain.
