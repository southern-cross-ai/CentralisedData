        The Australian Government has considered the recommendations of the Committee's Interim Report and has provided the response below.

       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 1
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that to limit the drivers of faunal extinction, the Commonwealth develop new environmental legislation to replace the
        <i>
         Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.

         The Government
        </a>
        welcomes the opportunity to improve the effectiveness of environment protections under the
        <i>
         Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999
        </i>
        (the Act). An independent review of the Act is currently underway, and the interim report of the review has been published.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In the interim report, Professor Graeme Samuel
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC" rel="nofollow">
         AC
        </a>
        proposes a number of key reform directions to improve the effectiveness of the Act. Professor Samuel will now consult on the interim report before submitting a final report to Government in October 2020.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In response to Professor Samuel's interim report, the Australian Government has announced that it will commit to a number of priority areas for reform, including:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Work is already underway on a national digital transformation program commencing with an initial partnership with the West Australian Government. This will mean access to one online portal to submit an application through both tiers of Government and access to a single database of biodiversity studies that can, in turn, be rolled out nationally.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The biodiversity database will provide better access to information such as wildlife surveys, allow faster and more comprehensive data for project assessments, and provide a baseline that can be used by Government to better measure conservation outcomes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government has in place several important measures to safeguard Australia's fauna. This includes protection under the Act, policies such as the Strategy for Nature and the Threatened Species Strategy (lead by the Threatened Species Commissioner), investment in research through the National Environmental Science Program, and programs to support

       <p class="italic">
        on-ground activities including through the $1 billion National Landcare Program, the Environment Restoration Fund, the Communities Environment Program, and more recently through the Wildlife and Habitat Bushfire Recovery package.

        The Australian Government looks forward to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Report" rel="nofollow">
