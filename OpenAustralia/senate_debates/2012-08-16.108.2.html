        Introduction
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 3 March 2011 the Senate referred the Combating the Financing of People Smuggling and Other Measures Bill 2011, for inquiry and report.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         The Committee
        </a>
        held a public hearing on 16 March 2011 taking evidence from officers of the Department and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AUSTRAC" rel="nofollow">
         AUSTRAC
        </a>
        . The Committee tabled its report on 21 March 2011 with three recommendations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 1: The committee recommends that, as a matter of priority, the

        establish appropriate memoranda of understanding for the sharing of intelligence with the new designated agencies outlined in the Bill.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 2: The committee recommends that the Attorney-General's Department review relevant options with a view to introducing an appropriate oversight mechanism to monitor the handling of credit information for the electronic verification of identity pursuant to the Bill.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 3: The committee recommends that the Senate pass the Bill, noting recommendations 1 and 2.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill was subsequently passed by both

       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 2
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that the Attorney-General's Department (AGD) review relevant options with a view to introducing an appropriate oversight mechanism to monitor the handling of credit information for the electronic verification of identity pursuant to the Bill.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        AGD has reviewed relevant options for an oversight mechanism to monitor the handling of credit information pursuant to Recommendation 2.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A breach of the verification of identity provisions contained in the Bill will constitute an interference with privacy and a person affected by an alleged breach may complain to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) in accordance with the

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Privacy Act 1988 has specific mechanisms in place to regulate the use of credit reporting data by credit reporting agencies. AGD does not consider that the

       <p class="italic">
        Accordingly, AGD considers that no further action is necessary.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 3
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that the Senate pass the Bill, noting recommendations 1 and 2.

        Government response to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee Inquiry into the National Classification Scheme
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        At the time of the Senate Committee undertaking its Inquiry, and prior to its report being finalised, the Government referred the National Classification Scheme (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCS" rel="nofollow">
         NCS
        </a>
        ) to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Law_Reform_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Law Reform Commission
        </a>
        (ALRC) for review. Recommendation 30 of the Committee's report is that the ALRC be directed to consider the findings, proposals and recommendations of the Committee's report.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The ALRC review was considered necessary to modernise the system of classification in Australia and allow it to keep pace with developments in technology now and into the future. When the current NCS commenced in 1995, classifiable content and the way it was delivered to consumers was relatively static.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The ALRC review was designed to consider not only classification categories, but the whole classification system including the legislative framework to ensure it continues to be effective in the 21st century.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The ALRC was considered the most appropriate body to conduct the review as it had previously conducted an inquiry into laws relating to classification and censorship in 1991. The ALRC's 1991 Report established the basis for the current NCS.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The terms of reference for the ALRC's 2011-12 review (which were subject to public consultation prior to being finalised) stated:

        Given the likelihood of concurrent Commonwealth reviews covering related matters as outlined above, the Commission will refer relevant issues to those reviews where it would be appropriate to do so. It will likewise accept referral from other reviews that fall within these terms of reference.

        Such referrals will be agreed between the relevant reviewers.

        The ALRC reported to Government on 29 February 2012 and the Government released, via tabling in the Parliament, the final report on 1 March, 2012.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The current NCS is a cooperative scheme between the Commonwealth and all state and territory governments. Under the Intergovernmental Agreement that underpins the scheme, the Commonwealth has agreed to consult states and territories about any meaningful changes to the scheme. Indeed, the current Commonwealth legislation has unanimous agreement requirements in relation to certain aspects of the scheme such as proposed changes to the classification categories and Classification Guidelines.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Consequently, the Commonwealth has sought the views of all States and Territories about the ALRC Report. Once those comments are received, the Commonwealth will be able to further develop its position on the ALRC recommendations (incorporating consideration of Senate Committee recommendations where appropriate) and, in due course, finalise the Government response to the ALRC Report.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In developing its response, the Government will also give consideration to how the ALRC recommendations interact with those of the Convergence Review. Although there are discrete components of each report, there is also substantial overlap in some key respects.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Since the tabling of the ALRC Report, the Government has been able to consider how the Senate Committee's recommendations might interact with those of the ALRC. The comments in relation to each recommendation below are made in that context.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 1
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that an express statement should be included in the National Classification Code which clarifies that the key principles to be applied to classification decisions must be given equal consideration and must be appropriately balanced against one another in all cases. Currently, these principles are:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>

       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Government Response – noted
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The National Classification Code (the Code) states that classification decisions are to give effect, as far as possible, to the four guiding principles that the Committee outlines in Recommendation 1. This requires the Classification Board to give equal consideration to the principles in the Code to the extent possible in each decision-making circumstance. What principles should underpin classification legislation, and whether those considerations should be weighted, or not, will be considered in the context of the Government's response to the ALRC Review of the NCS.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 2
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Further to Recommendation 1, the committee recommends that the fourth key principle in the National Classification Code should be expanded to take into account community concerns about the sexualisation of society, and the objectification of women.

       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 3
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee notes that there has been no further consideration by the Senate of the Senate Environment, Communications and the Arts Committee's 2008 report, Sexualisation of children in the contemporary media. The committee recommends that the Senate should, as a matter of urgency, establish an inquiry to consider the progress made by industry bodies and others in addressing the issue of sexualisation of children in the contemporary media; and, specifically, the progress which has been made in consideration and implementation of the
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        recommendations made in the Sexualisation of children in the contemporary media report.

       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 4
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that the Guidelines for the Classification of Films and Computer Games and the Guidelines for the Classification of Publications 2005 should be revised so that the preamble to both sets of guidelines expressly states that the methodology and manner of decision-making should be based on a strict interpretation of the words in the respective guidelines.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Government Response – not agree
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Classification Guidelines (the Guidelines) are not 'self-standing' but are part of a package of legislation consisting of the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995 (the Classification Act), the Code and the Guidelines. In Adultshop.Com Ltd v Members of the Classification Review Board (2008) the Court discussed the relationship between the Act, the Code and the Guidelines and confirmed this view noting that the Guidelines need to be read in conjunction with the Code.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Section 9 of the Classification Act provides that publications, films and computer games are to be classified in accordance with the Code and the Guidelines.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Act" rel="nofollow">
         The Act
        </a>
        contains certain matters that the Board must also take into account in making decisions on the classification of a publication, film or computer game, including those set out in s11.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The ALRC has made recommendations about future classification instruments, recommendation 9-3 in particular.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 5
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that the emphasis on context and the assessment of impact should be removed as principles underlying the use and application of the Guidelines for the Classification of Films and Computer Games.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Government Response – not agree
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Consideration of context and impact are crucial to the making of classification decisions. In the media classification environment, context refers to the circumstances that surround a particular event or situation and impact is the influence or effect upon an audience (for the purpose of determining whether content should be classified at a lower or higher classification). A classifiable element such as nudity in the context of a documentary about the anatomy of the human body would warrant an entirely different classification rating to nudity in a film mainly concerned with sex. Similarly, a classifiable element such as drug use will have a different impact, and warrant a different classification, depending on the type of drug and whether the depiction is discreet or explicit.

They view media content and carry out classification exercises by the same methods and using the same decision-making tools as the Classification Board. CAPs have been engaged periodically to test the degree to which the decisions of the Classification Board are in line with community standards.

       <p class="italic">
        The National Classification Scheme should be based on a new Act, the Classification of Media Content Act. The Act should provide, among other things, for:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) what types of media content may or must be classified;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

       <p class="italic">
        (e) the development and operation of industry classification codes; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (f) the enforcement of the National Classification Scheme, including through criminal, civil and administrative penalties for breach of classification laws (Recommendation 5-2)
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Classification of Media Content Act should provide a definition of 'exempt content' that captures all media content that is exempt from the laws relating to what must be classified. The definition of exempt content should capture the traditional exemptions, such as for news and current affairs programs. The definition should also provide that films and computer games shown at film festivals, art galleries and other cultural institutions are exempt. Providers of this content should not be exempt from obligations to take reasonable steps to restrict access to adult content (Recommendation 6-3)
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Beyond these, the ALRC did not specifically recommend that artworks be classified.

        Section 5B of the Classification Act already allows for films to be exempt from classification if they are of a community or cultural type. There is also a film festival exemption scheme that allows festivals to screen unclassified films under certain conditions, however, exemptions are generally granted under the condition that each film is to be screened a maximum of four times during the course of a film festival/event and that audiences are restricted to age 18+.
