       <p>
        The Albanese government is delivering our ambitious agenda, focusing on taking the pressure off Australians that are feeling the stress of the cost of living. We were elected to grasp the opportunities presented to us as a country, and we are continuing with that Labor story to create fairness and opportunities for all.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a government, we're putting more roofs over the heads of Australians with the Housing Australia Future Fund, to build 30,000 social and affordable homes. We must build more houses to create a greater supply so that young Australians can believe that homeownership is within their grasp. We are strengthening Medicare, with urgent care clinics across the country providing greater access to health care when people need it. We have a plan to secure full-time jobs and we're closing the loopholes that create unfair workplaces. Australian workers deserve dignity in work and our closing the loophole workplace relations legislation will ensure that workers are treated with respect and that they will earn a fair day's pay for a fair day's work.
       </p>
       <p>
        We can be a country which builds things right here, which is why we are making record investment in Australian jobs and Australian manufacturingâ€”growing our economy. We are the party who is providing access for education, which is why we announced last week that Labor will create another 300,000 fee-free places in 2024. We are putting downward pressure on electricity prices, with energy bill relief delivered to households when they need it through their winter and spring electricity bills. We will be a renewable energy superpower. We're investing in renewables because we believe in the future of this country, and we are investing in Australian people to give them more opportunities and a fairer society.
