         I understand from Senator Barnett that what he has indicated to the Senate is that at, an earlier stage, he has provided the normal courtesies and explained this to the relevant government chamber management. I take Senator Barnett at his word and on that basis I am happy to grant leave.

          I note the response from Senator Faulkner and the government. The National School Chaplaincy Program is a tremendous program; it is a great success. The petition that has circulated widely in Tasmania—and indeed in other places—has been very successful. There were 1,515 non-conforming petitions from Dr Sharman Stone’s office, which were forwarded for presentation here in the Senate. There were 1,223 from my own office from supporters in Tasmania, and I note there were 558 copied signatures and 18 letters in a similar format in support of the National School Chaplaincy Program.
         </p>
         <p>
          The chaplaincy program has been built on the excellent history of school chaplaincy in Australia. It was introduced by the former coalition government under Mr Howard in 2007-08, with a commitment of $165 million for its first three years. It was endorsed by Prime Minister Rudd, who said, ‘They’—the chaplains—‘are actually providing the glue which keeps school communities rolling.’ The program offers pastoral care and spiritual guidance to all. Chaplains necessarily have religious beliefs that underpin their work. These beliefs are representative of the school communities that the chaplains work in and do not hinder chaplains from working with those of other beliefs or none. At the time of the petition, the program was operating in 1,915 schools, but now it is in 2,700 schools or thereabouts—in that vicinity. In the state of Tasmania, it is currently operating over 100 schools. It enjoys strong support among principals and schools and in the community generally.
         </p>
         <p>
          Unfortunately, the Rudd Labor government extended the funding for the program at a reduced level until the end of 2011, after which time there may be no more funding, despite the program’s social benefits, its sound administration and strong community support. The coalition has announced that if elected it will continue funding the national school chaplaincy program in its current form at its current level of $165 million over three years. That is to be commended and is excellent news. I thank our leader, Mr Abbott, who I know is a strong supporter of the program, and Mr Pyne for his advocacy of this program and support for it over many years.
         </p>
         <p>
          I moved a motion in the Senate, together with
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Mason" rel="nofollow">
           Brett Mason
          </a>
          , the shadow parliamentary secretary for education, on 25 November last year. That motion was passed by 33 votes to 31. But the Rudd Labor government voted against it. That motion called for support of the national school chaplaincy support and continued funding in the terms that I have expressed. It was very disappointing that the Labor Party voted to oppose that motion, which would have ensured ongoing funding for that program into the future. That was a disappointment, because it is such a successful program.
         </p>
         <p>
          I indicated that it started in the year 2007-08, with a commitment of $165 million for its first three years. It offers pastoral care, spiritual guidance and counselling in a range of areas, such as bullying, mental health, family relationships, drug and alcohol abuse and other related matters. It deals with relationships and it ensures that those relationships can operate to the best degree possible. I am proud to be part of the group, which was named the gang of five at the time, that lobbied former
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
           Prime Minister John Howard
          </a>
          to establish the program for that initial three-year period. I want to commend the other members of that group, who were the Hon. Greg Hunt MP;
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Laming" rel="nofollow">
           Andrew Laming
          </a>
          , MP; and the shadow minister for veterans’ affairs, Louise Markus MP; and former MP David Fawcett. We were very pleased and privileged to have had the opportunity to promote such a worthwhile and fantastic program.
         </p>
         <p>
          The program seems to be going better and better in Tasmania. I want to commend the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripture_Union" rel="nofollow">
           Scripture Union
          </a>
          of Tasmania. They employ 95 per cent or more of the school chaplains in Tasmania. They are a wonderful organisation. They have been around for many decades and do a great job. I want to commend Ruth Pinkerton, who is the executive director of the Scripture Union and who is a feisty young Scottish lass who is living in Tasmania and leading the Scripture Union in regards this particular program and its other programs. My wife, Kate Barnett, is on the Scripture Union council, together with many other hardworking volunteers.
         </p>
         <p>
          I understand that the federal department is currently undertaking a review of the program. That review includes consultation with stakeholders. I want to indicate that in Tasmania there are some new chaplaincies operating. Three schools have recently been granted chaplains through local funding—this is without federal funding. That is fantastic. That means that the local community is responding and saying, ‘Yes, this is a good program.’ I want to congratulate those schools for doing this and undertaking that effort. They are the Table Cape Primary School, the Hillcrest Primary School in Devonport and the Mowbray Heights Primary School in Launceston. Congratulations and well done to all those schools and those involved in establishing those school chaplaincy programs in those schools.
         </p>
         <p>
          Two more schools have secured or are working hard to secure funding local and are looking for a suitable chaplain. They are the Dunalley Primary School and the Triabunna District High School. So there is a lot of growth in Tasmania. It is working well. This proves that this program is a great success.
         </p>
         <p>
          I was also advised by Ruth Pinkerton earlier today that across the state chaplains are setting up groups to take part in programs dealing with self esteem and decision-making issues. They are also helping many school staff and parents with their issues. Apparently, after a chaplain wrote in a school newsletter about anger and anger management in relationships, some of the fathers of the kids in the community have come to that particular chaplain for help in dealing with this. That is wonderful. The community is pulling together. The chaplains are the glue that holds this program together. They have the support of the principals, the school community and the mums and dads—the parents. I hope that this program will continue well into the future.
         </p>
         <p>
          I note that the Prime Minister made an announcement on 21 November last year at the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Christian_Lobby" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Christian Lobby
          </a>
          national conference. That particular announcement was to continue funding through to the end of 2011. In my view, that is simply not good enough. That is why the coalition responded and said, ‘No, it deserves better and more should be done.’
         </p>
         <p>
          One of the reasons we on the coalition side are convinced of the worth of the chaplaincy program is that research was conducted into the program early last year or thereabouts, and it showed that 97 per cent of principals think the program is a good thing and want it to continue. That is a very high percentage. That means that the schools are getting behind the program, and that is fantastic. The school communities are very, very supportive of it. Mr Rudd seems to be using a smoke and mirrors approach suggesting that supporters of the program should not be so quick to rejoice.

            That is correct, in a way, Senator Williams, but I know it is a tongue-in-cheek comment from you. We have reaffirmed our commitment. We are right behind it. I commend all those who support it. I commend those in the community who know about it and I encourage them all to be involved, get behind it and get behind your local chaplain, because it can deliver only positive benefits. I commend this program to the Senate and to anybody who is listening.
