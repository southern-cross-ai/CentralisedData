Or Phil Jones’ statement that he ‘cheered’ at the death of John L Daly in Launceston, a scientists and climate sceptic, in 2004? Is the minister also aware of the culture within the East Anglia University Climate Research Unit that has strong links, as demonstrated, with the IPCC of intimidation towards the free expression of views on climate change, referring to sceptical colleagues—

                            , a further point of order: it is not a major point of order but four or five times now during question time senators from around the chamber have taken what have been described as points of order. You have given them the call, but they have not said their points of orders. With respect, I would suggest that the call should not be given to a senator who just stands up and starts to speak during question time.

                               I am fairly tolerant of the way in which I conduct the business of the chamber. I do like people to identify that it is a point of order. I have ruled on the point of order that was raised by Senator Joyce initially. My aim is to get through the questions, and as many questions as is possible, so I am asking the minister to respond with 49 seconds remaining.

I am absolutely happy to debate that. I do not think anyone in this chamber would suggest that I have not been happy to debate the merits of the Australian government’s scheme.

                                    This government has been very willing to put into the public domain information about the latest climate science. We have put out a whole range of reports on this issue. I referred to one in answer to the question from Senator Moore, that had been put out by Professor Will Steffen. I released a report last Saturday—or possibly the Saturday before—in relation to the impact of climate change on Australia’s coast. These are factual reports which are put out and individuals within this country are very welcome to consider the science in those reports. What is happening here—and we all need to be very clear—is that those who oppose action are continuing to oppose action. That is it, clear and simple. You do not want to act on climate change and you never will.
