        My question is to Senator McKenzie, representing the Minister for Health. There were 745 deaths from the flu last year. It was a shocking season, with many young and healthy people dying. What were the key lessons learnt from last year to prepare for this year's flu season?

         , for the question and for the advance notice. Indeed, that was a tragic result of the flu season, and immunisation is critical for maintaining public health and preventing the outbreak of infectious diseases such as the flu. The National Immunisation Program provides a free seasonal influenza vaccine to a range of at-risk cohorts, including those over the age of 65 and pregnant women. Through the NIP, distribution of over 4.6 million doses of seasonal influenza vaccines occurred in 2017, and, as a result of last year's flu season, Minister Hunt tasked the

         </a>
         with investigating ways to ensure all aged-care workers are properly vaccinated against seasonal influenza.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government is also committed to exploring enhanced vaccination program arrangements through the NIP, including making available advanced vaccines for those aged 65 years and over.

           One of the flu vaccines that was not available last year was the high-strength vaccine that is indicated for people over 65. Given that people over 65 accounted for 91 per cent of flu deaths last year, will the high-strength vaccine definitely be available in Australia and will it be made exclusively available for over-65s or available to all who request it?

            Thank you, Senator Griff. I have sought advice from the Minister for Health on your question. As you may be aware, in order for a vaccine to be included on the NIP, it must be registered by the TGA and recommended by the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_Benefits_Advisory_Committee" rel="nofollow">
             Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee
            </a>
            . The committee has agreed to expedite its consideration of this vaccine ahead of the flu season for this year, and the outcome of their consideration will be communicated publicly as soon as it's finalised.
           </p>
           <p>
            The government worked with companies to ensure that expedited submissions were provided to the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBAC" rel="nofollow">
             PBAC
            </a>
            so that they could be made available to the Australian community as soon as possible. In January 2018, the committee considered applications for the two strengthened vaccines for use in Australia for adults aged 65 years and over. Following the announcement of the outcomes of this PBAC meeting, administrative arrangements will be progressed for listing on the NIP.

              Does that actually mean that the high-strength vaccine will effectively be registered—unlike last year, when the issue was that because companies hadn't registered it it wasn't approved? Will it be actually registered ahead of any company application to ensure that it is definitely available for over 65s?

              <p>
               There are two advanced trivalent influenza vaccines currently available internationally that elicit an increased immune response from the elderly. The government has been working with companies to make these available to Australians aged 65 years and older. One is FLUAD, which contains an immunity-enhancing ingredient and is for specific use in individuals aged 65 years and over. I note that you're writing that down—it's F-L-U-A-D. The other one is Fluzone High-Dose, which contains four times the antigen of the standard seasonal influenza vaccine and is also indicated as being specifically valued for people aged 65 years and over.
              </p>
              <p>
               All the vaccines registered in Australia by the TGA have been evaluated to make sure they're safe for use, and that's our primary concern. The government and the department have worked with sponsors of these vaccines to have them registered on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods, and I'm pleased to confirm that the TGA has registered both of these vaccines. And when speaking to the minister he's assured me they will be available for this flu season.
