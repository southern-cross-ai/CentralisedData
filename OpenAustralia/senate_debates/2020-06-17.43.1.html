        As we've made clear in this debate, Labor supports choice in superannuation, but we are committed to making sure that every worker is in a high-performing fund and that adequate information is available to empower consumers with the information they need to make choices that are in their best interests. We are concerned that there is a significant risk that this bill poses to defined benefit offerings, and we're concerned that the effect of this risk will be to lessen choice and to achieve the opposite of what this bill purports to achieve. These amendments specifically address the issues raised by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UniSuper" rel="nofollow">

        when they appeared before the Senate Economics Legislation Committee in its inquiry into the bill. They address issues relating to defined benefit schemes in order to ensure that the bill does not inadvertently threaten the viability of those schemes.
