        My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig. Can the minister update the Senate on the government's review of Commonwealth fisheries and can he outline how the government is supporting the future of Commonwealth fisheries?

         I thank Senator Sterle for his question and his continued interest in fisheries. Last September I said my responsibility was to make sure our fisheries remain some of the most sustainable and best managed in the world and that they are served by the best system possible. Today I am doing that by releasing the Borthwick review into Commonwealth fisheries and our response.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government broadly supports the direction of the Borthwick review. I hope, unlike on cuts to research and development funding, all sides of the chamber can support this reform. The review found that while our current fisheries management system is good it could be improved by greater transparency and by a broader policy framework clarifying objectives and roles. The job now for government is to engage with all stakeholders and the community to build an implementation plan for the Borthwick review.
        </p>
        <p>
         The review has made a number of recommendations aimed at strengthening our fisheries management system. Our legislation is now over 20 years old, so it is time for an update to reflect the changes in technology, in industry and in community expectations. Borthwick has recommended in his review, specifically, that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFMA" rel="nofollow">
          AFMA
         </a>
         Commission remain as the independent authority to make fisheries decisions separate from government. I agree with that recommendation. One key area of consultation will be to include a broader ecosystem pillar to fisheries management. This would mean a more holistic approach to management plans. Quite frankly, this is an extension for our fisheries to be managed to world-class standards now and into the future.

          , I ask a supplementary question and I thank the minister for his answer. Minister, how does the review consider the role of the community in fisheries decisions? How is the government strengthening community confidence in our fisheries for the benefit of the industry?

           The review has outlined ways to better involve the public in fisheries management decisions. Our oceans and our fisheries are public resources. They are owned by the community and the community should have a say in what occurs with them. The Borthwick review has made a number of recommendations to increase the community's involvement and confidence in fisheries. The government will consult widely on revised objectives for the fisheries acts, enhanced public discussions, transparency by
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFMA" rel="nofollow">
            AFMA
           </a>
           and ministerial oversight for emerging issues. These measures should add to the community's confidence in AFMA and in our fisheries management system.
          </p>
          <p>
           I will be releasing the details of our public consultation process after the release of the harvest and bycatch strategy reviews.

             I thank Senator Sterle for his second supplementary question. The Borthwick review has recommended a
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
              Productivity Commission
             </a>
             study into state and territory interactions with our fisheries, and I will consult with the Assistant Treasurer on that proposal. It is important that we do look through how we can encourage the states and territories to manage the differing systems that we have.
            </p>
            <p>
             Senators would be aware that some states do have a poor track record when it comes to supporting our fisheries. In Queensland, Premier Newman's government actually defunded is contribution to fisheries research and development, pulling out $1.2 million in forgone research and development activities—a shame for a government, but it does sound familiar. Just like the secret list from the IPA, Mr Tony Abbott has a blueprint to follow: say nothing before the election, then bring Premier Newman style cuts to bear.
