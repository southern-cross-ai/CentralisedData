           This amendment seeks to make the transition from the income management scheme in the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
            Northern Territory
           </a>
           , from the BasicsCard to the cashless debit card, a voluntary scheme. It will allow those people who are currently on the BasicsCard in the Northern Territory who wish to transition to the cashless debit card to do so as a voluntary scheme. If they choose to remain on the BasicsCard they will also be able to do that.
          </p>
          <p>
           The reason that the government has chosen to proceed with this is because we believe that when people in the Northern Territory are given the option of the advanced technology that is provided by the cashless debit card that they will actually choose to take up this technology. In a sign of commitment to this and the belief that this technology has improved, we are happy for the people—

           We firmly believe that the cashless debit card will enable participants to have the opportunity to choose the enhanced functionality and the increased flexibility that is offered by the cashless debit card. That is on the basis that currently the income management system of the BasicsCard allows participants to be able to transact at around only 16,000 terminals, whereas the cashless debit card provides them with the opportunity to make transactions at over 900,000 terminals around Australia. It enables them to use online purchasing. In fact, they can use their card wherever an

           terminal exists, and the only things that they will be restricted from being able to get access to when using this particular card will be alcohol, gambling products, some gift cards and cash.

            I rise to indicate that the opposition will not be supportive of the government's amendments on sheet
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TK" rel="nofollow">
             TK
            </a>
            264—which involve two parts, I think. I just want to take issue with one of the things the minister said, because she asserted that this would somehow make this all voluntary. Well, it won't. The amendment will effectively make it a Hobson's choice between a grey card and a green card. So Labor isn't supporting the government's amendment, because it isn't making income management voluntary. What it is doing is simply providing a choice of a different coloured piece of plastic. So, for the reasons that were well ventilated in the second reading debate, we do not support the government's amendments on TK264.

              The BasicsCard is an ongoing measure. It is legislated as an ongoing measure. It has an instrument, and I'm actually holding the existing instrument in my hand. I will just take the opportunity whilst I'm answering your question to say that I was a tiny bit disappointed at Senator Wong's accusation that somehow this is entirely a choice between a silver card and a green card, as if the government's going out there and saying, 'You can have a silver card or a green card.' I remind those in this place that there was a bipartisan approach to this and in fact the instrument that you're referring to, Senator Lambie, was actually signed by a member from the other place, Mrs Macklin, when she was the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and the Minister for Disability Reform. So, we would continue—this is the instrument as it relates to the

               Senator Lambie, the instrument has a 10-year life. It was signed in 2012. A disallowable instrument will be introduced into this place in 2022 at the expiry of that 10-year period for this place to vote on again. But the measure, of itself, is an ongoing measure.

                Let me get this right: does the cashless debit card itself include that it is on a two-year trial in the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
                 Northern Territory
                </a>
                as well? Are you going to swap that straight over, and is it going to have an instrument? I know it's only got two years. So I'm asking you: if they move over to the cashless debit card in the Northern Territory, does that get two years as well? If that's the case, I'm going to encourage them to get over to it now, because it's not going to survive after the two years. That's what I want to know.

                 The same situation exists whether it be the BasicsCard or the cashless debit card. We haven't actually moved the amendment as yet in relation to the two-year time limit on the cashless debit card. That is the next amendment. But, for the purposes of effect, the cashless debit card or the BasicsCard will still be affected by the same instrument as I just described, which is a disallowable instrument that will be brought into this place in 2022.

                  , but it's on trial everywhere else in the country—correct? So, in those trial sites, it'll be on trial for a further two years but, in the Northern Territory, the CDC will be ongoing?

                       Senator Lambie, as I explained earlier, the extension to the cashless debit card that we're seeking to make with the next amendment that will be put before the chamber is for a two-year extension on the cashless debit card. Income management, as it exists in the
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
                        Northern Territory
                       </a>
                       , has a number of measures that are contained within the instrument that currently oversees or encompasses income management. This instrument to which you refer applies to some of them. Some of the other measures are actually not encompassed by this particular measure. The ongoing measure of income management in the Northern Territory is subject to other legislation. What we are seeking to do today is to give the people in the Northern Territory the opportunity to be able to use a different technology. The income management that they are operating under remains the same. It's just that they will be able to use a different technology. It doesn't actually change the income management. Everything that applies to the existing BasicsCard income management legislation remains in place, as it was yesterday.

                        So let's be clear here. The government just won the second reading vote here because Centre Alliance didn't turn up. I'm naming it. Centre Alliance did not turn up for the vote, folks. For those people listening to this debate—and I know there are many of them—we could have ended this five minutes ago with that vote. Centre Alliance didn't even have the guts to come in here and vote with the government; they just did not turn up. So why is the government circulating these amendments? It is because you've done a deal with Centre Alliance, haven't you? That's because you know that you won't win on the third vote unless you make these amendments—which, make no mistake, keep the cashless debit card running. All those people listening tonight, thinking they were going to be off this card because Centre Alliance had said they didn't support it, are now hugely disappointed. And the person who made that decision didn't even have the guts to turn up here and face this Senate. So why, Minister, are you moving these amendments? Please name it.

                         Before I respond to Senator Siewert's question, I also table the two supplementary explanatory memoranda relating to the amendments that I'm currently in the process of moving. Senator Siewert, I acknowledge your position on this measure and I respect your position on this measure. The reason the government has sought to move these two amendments, I would have thought was fairly obvious. We absolutely stand by the belief that the people of the
                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
                          Northern Territory
                         </a>
                         , when given the choice as to whether to change the technology—and that really all it is, Senator Siewert, and I think you acknowledge it is nothing more than a change in the technology—will see the benefit. I can tell you from firsthand experience: I spent a number of days in the Northern Territory earlier this year and I went out to communities and I spoke to a lot of people who were on the BasicsCard. I sat with them and I explained to them the differences between the BasicsCard and the
                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDC" rel="nofollow">
                          CDC
                         </a>
                         , and almost without exception the people I was speaking to said, 'I would rather have the CDC than the BasicsCard.' This is not a debate about whether you have income management or not. It is merely a technology upgrade, and that is what this measure seeks to do, Senator Siewert.

                          were very clear. This morning, in my contribution to the second reading debate, I read out a letter that had been sent to Senator Patrick and the crossbenchers. That letter made it very clear that Aboriginal organisations, who represent thousands of Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory, did not support the cashless debit card. They don't support compulsory income management. In fact, some organisations in the Northern Territory that originally supported compulsory income management have changed their position. Why are you not only bringing government amendments that change the conversion to the cashless debit card in the Northern Territory to a voluntary position but also—and I've got to say, of course, I voted to get rid of the cashless debit card with that vote on permanency—suddenly changing your mind about permanency? Name it up.

                                   Senator Siewert, the deal that I did on this legislation was with the people I spoke to who asked me to continue this—the people of Ceduna who told me that their communities were better, safer, stronger and were moving forward because of this card and a number of other measures. I said this in my second reading speech and I will reiterate it: this is not a silver bullet; it is one of a suite of measures that we are working on with communities to assist them in their desire to be able to make improvements in their communities. These communities have asked the government to assist them with these measures.

                                     Thank you. I actually don't agree with you over the BasicsCard, and the reason I don't is that I've spent quite a bit of time in
                                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnhem_Land" rel="nofollow">

                                     . I was quite disappointed. I would have thought that, after nearly 10 years of being on that card, they would accept it. They were quite resistant to it and they were not interested in going to a new card. I guess these people have another five years ahead of them at the main trial site, in Ceduna. If things are working in the community, it's not because of the damn card; it's because the community is making it work. It was hit-and-miss up there as well. Through the chair, I have a feeling that you may want to get up and say a few things. There are things that haven't been delivered and that card could have done so much better and delivered so much more, but you put them on that BasicsCard and you forgot about them. This is the same pattern of behaviour that I am seeing with the

                                     , the cashless debit card. If that's anything to go on and that's the most success we can admit to in 10 years, it really hasn't had much of a bite. Some of the guys are in dry camps, and that's great. The community has done that, not the card.

                                     You can keep on the road you are travelling with that cashless debit card all you like, but, unless you put in effort, it's going to end up like that and you won't get the results. There are no more jobs than there were eight or nine years ago. They're still struggling to understand even the basics of the card. If someone else wants to get up and say something more about that, that's fine. What I would like to know, though, is this. We have the

                                         You've just brought in this amendment now, and we have been working on your legislation since it was introduced into the House. It went through the House and came to the Senate. You must have spoken to those organisations in the last two hours. Surely you would know who you've spoken to in order to bring this amendment in so late—now.

                                          My consultations in relation to this particular legislation have been ongoing for over a year. I have listened to what people have had to say and I have listened to what you and others have said in this place. My decision to seek to make this amendment was on the basis of wideranging discussions that I've had. I must admit, I'm somewhat surprised that, after listening to the contributions that have been made by those opposite, you appear not to be supportive of the proposal that's before the chair.

                                           I'm not sure how you could be surprised about my position, Minister, given all the statements I've made in the Senate on it. You've now said that you're bringing in an amendment to make going from the BasicsCard to the cashless debit card voluntary whereas earlier today it was about completely moving everyone, over 22,000 people, directly to the cashless debit card. You used the term 'voluntary', but, if we all look at the definition of 'voluntary', it is about choice. People who are on income management in the

                                           are not there by choice. There is no 'voluntary' here. So who did you speak to in the last hour or two in order to bring this amendment in around what you perceive as being a voluntary movement from the BasicsCard to the cashless debit card?

                                            I think I've already answered that question. The voluntary nature of this amendment is, as you rightly point out, a voluntary decision to move from the BasicsCard to the cashless debit card. That is the only thing that I was referring to when I was referring to it being voluntary.

That was discussed last night with Centre Alliance, and that is where that has come from. I'll be honest, because I'm not going to sit here and lie to the Australian people. It's shameful that you're doing that over something like this. Be honest. You haven't gone out and consulted about this, and yet I understand you want all of the

Good on Centre Alliance for at least lowering it to that scale, not making them all go on it. But that's exactly how it went down just over 24 hours ago. I'm not going to sit here and—I'm sorry. I'm not doing this.

                                              for both the cashless debit card and the BasicsCard. Given the minister's comments about the additional costs of the BasicsCard—per year, from memory—I wonder if she can indicate to us the forward estimate cost of the dual system that is contemplated by the amendment.

                                                That's not correct. I'm sorry; you can't give her that advice. It may well be subject to commercial negotiations. There is a cost provision, which has to have been made, associated with the bill and the amendment. I'm asking what the cost provision is. I'm not asking for the terms of the tender.

                                                  So not only do we have an amendment that the minister won't front up to the Senate about in terms of how it has arisen or when it was negotiated or the fact that she doesn't appear to have consulted with people about it outside of this place, but she also won't tell us what it costs. That's pretty good! Do we have any estimate about the number of people that you are assuming will transition to the cashless debit card?

                                                              It's about the provisions in the current bill, which give the minister the ability to change the fifty-fifty split. The original legislation said that when people moved from the BasicsCard to the cashless debit card the fifty-fifty would generally remain. But under the new bill the minister would have the power to change that under certain circumstances. Does that remain or is that being taken away with these amendments?

However, I would like to put on the record that in the case of the Ceduna community—I think I included this in my second reading speech—the reason that we have the cashless debit card is that the people that actually developed the cashless debit card in Ceduna did so as a result of the coronial inquest into the sleeping rough inquiry that occurred on the back of six tragic deaths in their community because of people sleeping rough because of alcohol and drug related harm that people were doing to themselves. It was actually the Indigenous community leaders of the communities around the Ceduna area that sought for this card to be introduced in their community.

I can tell you now there are some of these who are not going to be able to avoid this. Do you intend to do anything about this? I'm quite sure this has just been brought to your attention, but that is the truth of the matter. They have been serving their country. These claims are taking so long, the support they're getting is from Centrelink—they're getting disability support pensions. Are they going to be put on the card or are you going to give them an exemption? How are you going to exempt them?

It was actually one of the design features that were sought by the leaders when they designed the card, because they believed that there were a number of their more vulnerable community members who were on disability support pension who they wanted to have the benefit of the card. That is why the disability support pension was included in some of the sites. In relation to your comments around veterans who are in the process of making application for a Veterans' Affairs pension, there are two ways that they can exit from the card. One is around financial wellbeing and the other one is a demonstration of being able to adequately manage their affairs. However, if you have a particular example of somebody who is in the situation to which you refer that you would like the government to have a look at, I will be more than happy to take that on on your behalf.

I will give you the ones from the trial site over the next week, but I also understand how this card is going to work. When I joined it five years ago—they won't tell you this, but I will—the reason they have this card is that eventually it's going to go across the country. That is the big picture. I know that. These veterans, they show they have served. I'm asking you if they can be removed from the card. There has got to be a simpler way. It shouldn't have to come from me. Remove the rigmarole, send you a letter and do the rest. Can you please put an exemption so that if they can show they have served with their service record they are to be removed immediately?

Could you put a policy through Centrelink to give them an exemption?

Whenever I've seen it, it's been an excuse covering a lack of facts and solid logical argument. It seems to be meant to intimidate, silence and divert. It won't silence people who have the facts. Has there ever been any targeting of groups, either under Labor or under the Liberal-National government? Or is this initiative broadly based upon people's needs and protecting children?

To be quicker in my answer: it's via consultation that we make sure that we keep ourselves up to date on the issues that are occurring within the four trial sites, and making sure that the card and all the other services that sit around the card reflect the needs and wants of those communities.

My understanding of 'racist' and 'racism' is where one group, a particular race, is classified or thought of as inferior or superior. Is there any discussion at all, or labelling, within the department of any group as inferior or superior? Or is this based on needs?

The government does not seek to impose the cashless debit card on to communities. It is very clear in the legislation that the cashless debit card communities are those that have come forward and sought to have this measure put in place in their community.

I've been on the public record on a number of occasions to say that I will release that report. But can I just put on the record that there is nobody in this chamber that's more frustrated than me about the lack of quantitative data around these measures. As you rightly point out, the government has put millions of dollars into these evaluations, and they do provide valuable insights. We have had a number of reports commissioned over the years. You would be much more aware of the time frames of these. Your interest in this matter goes back a very long way, but mine does, too, particularly in the Ceduna area before I came to this place. They do provide very valuable insights and thoughts about the cashless debit card, but what they haven't been able to provide, and what I want to get access to, is the hard, quantitative data.

Was the information reported there on the money? In other words, very few people wanted the card extended and it wasn't showing the sorts of results that would show it was a glowing success.

The question being asked about this being racism really disturbs me—that it's racist in the policy of picking areas where this is to happen.
                                                                                                              </p>

                                                                                                               I asked the minister directly how this came about and the areas that were picked. The areas were picked because the community leaders—whether that be the mayors, the councillors, the community itself or the business leaders—asked for this trial. The whole fact is that, yes, they're saying it's because of the population, and Senator Wong asked the question about the percentages. We got in the high 40 per cents for one area being Indigenous, and yet in another area there were only 18 per cent Indigenous, and the majority were non-Indigenous.
                                                                                                              </p>
                                                                                                              <p>
                                                                                                               As a parliament, and leaders of this nation, we need to look at what's in the best interests of the people. This was a trial that was put out, and these were the communities that asked for the trial. It's a card which is actually going to restrict spending money to 80 per cent being spent on essential services. That means paying the rent, buying food and buying clothes for the kids. It actually ensures there's food on the table. Isn't the basis of what we all should be concerned about the wellbeing of the children? Adults can take care of themselves; children can't. Children rely on their parents. If we have a problem in our society where the parents are tied up with alcohol, or drug abuse or gambling and the money doesn't get to where it should, then isn't that the basis of why we're looking at this card?
                                                                                                              </p>
                                                                                                              <p>
                                                                                                               It doesn't matter what race or what the colour of your skin is; we have problems right across our whole society; in regional and rural areas especially there's a huge drug problem. I hear it constantly, all the time. The thing is that some ask if it's racist. I could go into many areas where I can see we have racist policies in Australia, purely based on the fact that because you're Indigenous you get extra funding. You get care. But I'm not going to head down that path. Many Australians know that, and I don't think that's the basis of what we should be looking at here.
                                                                                                              </p>
                                                                                                              <p>
                                                                                                               I've travelled in Indigenous communities—I've been there and I've seen the problems that we have there. But it's not only in Indigenous communities; we have them in other areas in Australia, and they need to be addressed. As the leaders of this nation, we must look at what we're trying to achieve here. It's for the benefit of the future generations. Kids in these communities are not getting schooled. They are not getting the care that they need. They're not getting fed.
                                                                                                              </p>
                                                                                                              <p>
                                                                                                               The fact is, that's what we need to address. We also have to look at the fact that the communities have asked for this. I've listened to the Indigenous leaders who have begged for this card, said that they want this card. We have people opting in for the card. We have people in communities saying, 'We can't control our money, because our family and friends come to us and force us to hand money over to them.' Now they have control of their money. What are you actually worried about? They've still got 20 per cent of their money that they can spend as they wish; 80 per cent is going to go towards their household needs and towards looking after their children. If you look at the stats and reports—and I haven't got the figures in front of me—over 40 per cent were actually saying that there is less drug use, less gambling, less domestic violence. The police report that came in said that they are having less domestic violence and fewer problems. More kids are going to school, and they're actually being fed before they go to school.
                                                                                                              </p>

To sit here and argue over whether it is racist policy is not what this is about. And I'm sick of some people in this chamber sitting there as if they're the victims. Our job is to make sure that there is good policy for all people, all Australians—that they have the benefit of our wise decisions, because they are relying on us to make the right decisions in this parliament. It is also a fact that on websites and on the opposition side of parliament we are seeing scaremongering going on—the things they are telling the elderly about who is going to be affected by this. People are ringing up my office and saying, 'Well, it is the age pensioners who are going to be losing this, due to the card.' But there is no talk about that whatsoever. That question has been asked by the government. It is not going to include the aged. So, I'm sick of the scaremongering that's going on, because I'm getting that at my office, and it is up on the website, clearly stating that it is the elderly, and the veterans. So, people think that you're going to tie them up in this, but it's got nothing to do with them. This has been completely blown out of proportion by people not telling the truth to the Australian people so that they can know the benefits of this card.
                                                                                                              </p>

                                                                                                               Minister, can you clarify here, in this chamber, to the people of Australia: are age pensioners going to be involved in this card? Are the people who are on disability pensions going to be included on this card? Who is it actually going to affect? And I think the Australian people need to have a direct answer. Is this going to be rolled out in this term of parliament, up until the next election, to all Australians? That is what is being said to Australians, in lies that are being put out by the opposition and by the Greens party. People have to have an honest answer that is recorded here in the parliament. Is it going to include the elderly? Is it going to include those on disability pensions? Is it going to be rolled out to all Australians before the next election? And what do you intend to do with your policies after the next election?

Firstly, I acknowledge the second reading amendment of Senator Patrick, which gave us the opportunity to put on the record that the government has provided a commitment through the supporting of that second reading amendment that no recipient of the age pension or a veteran or services pension will be placed on the cashless debit card.
                                                                                                               </p>

There are two main categories of exemption. People on the age pension are able to voluntarily seek to go on to the BasicsCard or the

The second category of people who could be on income management who are of pension age or are on a pension card are those that have been referred by the Family Responsibilities Commission—and, for those who are listening and don't know what the Family Responsibilities Commission is, it is the group of commissioners in

There are very few people on the card for that reason. However, I just want to be very clear: those are the only two categories of people on the age pension that are subject to income management.
                                                                                                               </p>

They are one component of a suite of measures that need to be put together to bring about the kind of change that the communities who have sought access to the cashless debit card have requested. From reading the letter of support that I received from the community leaders in Ceduna, there were many things that the community has observed over the time that the cashless debit card has been in place in that community.
                                                                                                               </p>

It says: 'Since the introduction of the cashless debit card, we have observed positive changes in our communities. Fewer vulnerable people have been harassed or humbugged'—those are their words—'to hand over cash to others. More children are attending school. Families have money to spend on groceries, and alcohol fuelled violence has decreased. Our communities are safer. People are saying they have the money they need to provide for the basics of life, such as buying clothes and food, and paying rent and bills.' Community leaders across the whole of Australia have signed this letter, which was sent to me today, from all of the trial sites around Australia. They say more, but the final sentence is: 'In order to create stronger, safer and healthier communities now and for generations to come, we call upon our parliamentary representatives to pass the

Minister, I wanted to respond to a couple of things, if I may, that Senator Hanson said, and then I'll ask you a couple of questions.

I don't think they come in here and play the victim. They come in here and seek—and are often rebuffed—to progress reconciliation and to progress policies that matter to them, to their parties and to their people. To simply dismiss them as 'playing the victim' is disrespectful, and I disagree with it. I'm up-front enough to say to you respectfully: I disagree.
                                                                                                                    </p>

You can say that. But I would make the point that, out of the government's own mouths, they have talked about broader application. I think it is legitimate for a party to raise this fact when you firstly have Senator Canavan saying, I think two days ago, 'I think it's time we take the evidence on board and roll it out across the country,' when in February this minister said, 'It does need to have a broader application,' and when the Prime Minister said, 'The

I appreciate that you have a different view on this policy measure. You're entitled to that. The Labor Party disagree with it, but I think it is entirely reasonable for us to point out that out of the mouths of the coalition is an indication that this is something that they want to roll out more broadly. I don't think that's an illegitimate thing for us to raise in public debate.

Section 12DL provides that a person must not send another person a credit card except in specified circumstances. I think it is clear from the ASIC letter that ASIC—and I invite the minister to explain her answer, because, despite her tone towards

ASIC says that that 2016 letter 'was specified to apply to the trial of the program' and, 'It does not cover the proposed ongoing and broader program to be enabled by the bill.' The letter goes on to say that obviously nothing that ASIC does can actually change the operation of the law itself; it simply indicates no action.

I'm sure Senator McCarthy can explain to you the postal service for some of the communities that are being described and the significant impediments that would be put in place for your plan if, indeed, you can't actually send it out. Are you expecting people to come in and collect it? What is the plan for this so-called transition for people who are currently, involuntarily, on income management to move from one to the other?

The reason that I say that, Senator Wong, is because the intention of the method to offer the card is actually to go out to communities, one by one, and work with communities to explain to them the benefits of the card and to help them in the process of moving from the BasicsCard to the cashless debit card.

We do it around the whole of Australia; we make sure that we provide a service to people, even if they're in the most remote of communities. For people who want to go on to the cashless debit card, we are now offering a voluntary transfer from the BasicsCard to the cashless welfare card which entirely circumvents the issue which has been raised today by

They sought for that information to be provided to them in person, and often the request was for it to be in first language—and I acknowledge that there are quite a number of those, Senator McCarthy. So the process to make this offering to the Northern Territory will probably take some time, but it is our intention to engage one on one with communities as this card is offered out into the Northern Territory.

It is actually a separate card altogether. So you are actually delivering a new credit card, or debit card in this instance. Is there an assumption that, just because they have the BasicsCard, you can automatically roll out the cashless debit card?

In undertaking that voluntary action to seek to have the BasicsCard, the consent is ipso facto given by the person who is seeking to have the card. So it's not a matter of the card being posted to somebody who didn't know that it was arriving; the person actually has to actively engage in the process to seek to change from the BasicsCard to the cashless debit card.
                                                                                                                         </p>

The issue we were discussing in question time was specifically about the means by which somebody would receive a financial instrument—which, as I've said, we were already intending to be able to respond to through the means by which we will be consulting with communities and offering the card up. But the fact that it is now a voluntary measure completely overrides the issue that we have been discussing today.

What I'm seeking to do by this particular amendment is to say to people—we will certainly provide everybody who is currently on the BasicsCard with the information about the increased functionality of the cashless debit card. The comparison between the two cards is quite stark. I know you've bothered to inform yourself around the two different cards. One of the biggest issues that was raised initially with the rollout of the cashless debit card, when it was clearly obvious that that's what it was—it had a big 'Indue' written on the front of it, and, similarly, the BasicsCard is lime green and people have to use a BasicsCard terminal—is that it is quite obvious to anybody and everybody if somebody has one of these cards. The cashless debit card now does not have any identification on it to indicate that it is a cashless debit card. It is just a silver card.
                                                                                                                           </p>

In doing so you remove any obviousness of the fact that the payment method that the person is using to buy their items is actually an income management card.
                                                                                                                           </p>

That of course was Senator Griff. He is not here. He didn't bother to vote on the second reading amendment. He has left the building tonight. He's not here to debate the details of this bill. Rebekha Sharkie, the member for Mayo, and Senator Griff, Centre Alliance, were both clearly on the record opposing this piece of legislation.

It is detrimental to the lives of these people. It does have a disproportionate impact on

You can't trust her word on anything. Centre Alliance say one thing in Adelaide and another thing in Canberra. They say one thing on Monday and do another thing on Wednesday night. Their word is useless. They don't tell the truth when it comes to what their agenda is. They don't disclose the deals they do with this government. And they come into this place and purport to argue for transparency and accountability. Their word is mud. You can't trust them. You shouldn't vote for them. And they should not be protected.

South Australians who believed that this political party would tell the truth, would stand up to the government of the day, would hold them to account have, sadly, just been let down. And this party doesn't even have the guts to come in and say what it is that it is going to do. Centre Alliance tonight have shown that they are gutless, that they're up for pathetic deals with the Morrison government and that they simply cannot be trusted.

So the technological advances that have been undertaken under the working group have been around things like product-level blocking. For instance, when the product-level blocking technology is rolled out—we're currently trialling it in a number of places around in Australia, and you'll be very pleased to know that it's working particularly well—it will mean that if someone using the card went into what we would refer to as a 'mixed' merchant, being somebody who sells prohibited products as well as all the other products, they would still be able to use their card at the terminal because the terminal and the technology that exists would differentiate between a product that is allowable and a product that isn't allowable.
                                                                                                                                </p>

Many people—I admit not all people, but many—have mobile phones. They'd be able to have the technology embedded into their phones so that they could tap and pay, and wouldn't actually have to carry the card. One of the most important technological advances is that you can use your cashless debit card to make purchases online. Even if you were in a remote community—obviously, one with internet reception—you could use your phone or other device to make purchases online.
                                                                                                                                </p>

That includes working with the product-level blocking and the pilot for that, the cloud based activities and the multiple-issuer feasibility study.

At the moment, Indue is the only issuer of the cashless debit card. We're seeking to have a situation where the person has the choice of who they would like to have as their issuer, so if they happen to bank with Westpac then Westpac would be the issuer of the card.

We heard that from Senator Lambie as well, the fact that the minister had been doing that.

It's also an absolute disgrace on the part of Centre Alliance for not having the courage of their conviction, if this is what they truly believed and was the way they were always going to go, to really address this Senate and in particular to talk to the people of the Northern Territory.

Rebekha Sharkie MP in the lower house was also invited to come to the Northern Territory. She took up that offer, and at the last minute was unable to come; however, she sent her staff. Again, the people of the Northern Territory were very thankful for that.

There has been no discussion, no respect in conversation, to even bring this as something that Centre Alliance was going to do. People may say, 'That's politics.' But what it really says more than anything is how desperate this government is, how desperate this government is to keep a failed policy—one that has proven no evidence that it actually works. The minister herself has stood up tonight and talked about anecdotal evidence. We can all say that. But what we expected in this Senate was a far greater depth of respect and of that evidence coming forward. Like the cowards that you are, you've scurried off and made the deals. You haven't even talked to the people of the Northern Territory, Minister. You haven't even said who you've spoken to in the last few hours in order to bring this last-minute amendment into the Senate.

You haven't been sitting in here, so you don't even know what you're talking about. So I would settle down over there.
