          <p>
           In the debate in the other place, Labor moved amendments to ensure that entitlements that are contained in registered enterprise agreements and in awards are preserved and protected for workers in the case of a forcible divestiture. Following the Senate inquiry into the bill, it became clear that a similar issue exists for non-registered agreements between workers and employers in the context of possible divestiture. The evidence suggested this was particularly significant at
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liddell_Power_Station" rel="nofollow">
            Liddell Power Station
           </a>
           , where the workers have obtained important commitments from the employer, through their union, in relation to employment after Liddell's scheduled closure. The union and the workers understandably seek to preserve these commitments in the event of divestiture.
          </p>
          <p>
           This amendment accepts that no worker at Liddell or elsewhere should be worse off as a result of divestiture, which is a remedy for prohibited conduct that workers themselves have no part in. This amendment will ensure that non-registered agreements between workers and employers, which provide workers with additional protections agreed by employers, should be safeguarded in the event of divestment. I commend the amendment to the Senate.

            The government will not be supporting this amendment.
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Senate" rel="nofollow">
             The Senate
            </a>
            would be aware that the government has already moved amendments in the House of Representatives to ensure that under any forced divestiture the transfer-of-business provisions in the Fair Work Act would apply and provide all of the appropriate protections in the context of transfer-of-business provisions to employees. The proposed amendment would cause the transfer-of-business provisions in the Fair Work Act 2009 to apply more broadly in the case of divestiture scenarios than they would under any ordinary sale of assets. The proposed amendment would alter the way the transfer-of-business provisions in the Fair Work Act apply in the case of divestiture under the bill by expanding the types of arrangements covered by the transfer-of-business provisions. Where relevant circumstances are satisfied, the transfer-of-business provisions will ordinarily apply to a transferable instrument such as an enterprise agreement. The proposed amendment would expand the scope of arrangements to which the transfer-of-business provisions apply to a broader class of instruments, namely any workplace instrument. The proposed amendment would mean that there are additional rights conferred in the case of divestiture that are over and above those currently contained in the Fair Work Act 2009 for usual transfer-of-business situations.
           </p>
           <p>
            Even more concerning from the government's point of view, it is unclear precisely what additional instruments the proposed amendments would pick up. It would be a blanket obligation under the legislation to act consistent with any non-registered agreement, and we don't believe that that is desirable. We believe that it is preferable, in sharing the same objective, to ensure that, in the context of a forced divestiture, employee entitlements are properly protected. We believe it is preferable to give the government of the day the discretion to deal with any such non-registered agreements on a case-by-case basis to assess the public interest in each circumstance. That is why the government flag that we will be moving government amendments to give the Treasurer the regulation-making power to deal with non-registered agreements in that way.

             I place on the record the support of the Greens for the opposition's amendment. Of course, we want to find ways to ensure that workers are indeed protected, and particularly those in relation to the fiasco that this government has created for the workers of Liddell. Let me put clearly on the record: we are disappointed that Labor are voting with the government on this piece of legislation. Yes, there have been some improvements in relation to workers' entitlements, but the overall impact of this bill, making climate change worse by allowing these polluting clunkers of power stations to remain open for longer, is only going to make it harder and harder for Australia to transition in a way that the science, the community and anyone who understands what's going on today would accept needs to happen.

               Just briefly. This amendment gives the Treasurer the power to make regulations to ensure that, when a body corporate disposes of assets under a divestiture order, the entity through which the assets are disposed of must comply with arrangements or undertakings that were made by the body corporate in relation to its employees and that satisfy requirements set out in the regulations. The government is confident that this amendment strikes the right balance between facilitating a smooth divestment process in the circumstances where divestiture is ordered while also protecting any rights or agreements previously negotiated between an entity which is subject to a divestment order and its workforce. But it does provide the appropriate level of discretion where the government of the day can make relevant judgements on whether a particular non-registered agreement is, indeed, in the public interest.

                Labor welcomes this amendment by the government. As I indicated in my earlier remarks, we have been concerned to ensure that the workforce of a business that is subject to divestiture is not unfairly impacted by the operation of this bill. In particular, we are concerned to ensure that entitlements that are contained in non-registered agreements, essentially agreements between management and the workers, are protected. The reasons for this were explained by the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_Trades_Union" rel="nofollow">
                 Electrical Trades Union
                </a>
                of Australia in their evidence to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee during our inquiry into this bill. They explained that a divestiture order applied to an ageing generator that was scheduled to close would put at risk all of the good work that may have been done in planning to minimise the impacts of closure and disruption to the community. Another union went on to explain how this was particularly important in relation to Liddell, a power station in my home state of
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
                 New South Wales

                . The committee received advice from the

                 CFMEU

                that there exists:

                Energy Ltd to "no forced retrenchments" with respect to the retirement of the Liddell power station. This means the company will,

                 inter alia

                , rely on employee retirements, voluntary redundancies, redeployment to the nearby Bayswater power station and redeployment to other activities at the Liddell site.
               </p>
               <p>
                In our earlier amendment, Labor sought to ensure that agreements like this were protected. This amendment now proposed by the government will allow regulations to be made to ensure that, when a business disposes of a power station or another asset under a divestiture order, the entity to which the assets are disposed must comply with arrangements or undertakings that were made in relation to employees. Labor expects that the government would use this regulation-making power to protect workers at power stations like Liddell if divestiture orders were made against their owners.

                   have in relation to this particular piece of legislation. This bill, make no mistake about it, will contribute to making climate change worse. It will contribute to ensuring that pollution continues to rise and climate change gets worse and that disasters such as those we're experiencing across the country today will become more horrid, more frequent and more deadly. That is the horrid and awful truth that we are confronted with today. As policymakers, as decision-makers and as leaders in our communities we have been called into action by some of the most senior members of the emergency services bodies across the country and by scientists, who have said collectively that it is time to reduce Australia's carbon pollution, to get serious about climate change and to deliver climate change action. Instead, we are seeing from the government legislation dressed up as something to do with reducing electricity prices when, in fact, all it is going to do is keep the polluting and dangerous coal being burnt for longer in this country, which will contribute to more and more global warming, and more and more disasters as a result.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   We have been warned by scientists, by emergency services personnel and by our own children and next generation that we have to get serious about climate action and reducing pollution. This bill is going to make it harder for us even to get to the point of reducing pollution, because it will keep coal being burnt for longer and keep coal-fired power stations open and operating for longer—and the government wants to spend Australian taxpayers' money doing that. This amendment would at the very least try to curtail public money being spent keeping coal being burnt for longer and making climate change worse. That is a fundamental point. It beggars belief that we have a government that wants to spend taxpayers' money to make climate change worse by burning more coal and putting more pollution into the atmosphere, rather than deal with the emergency that confronts us today.

                   While I'm speaking about this, I will point out just how disgusted, how absolutely revolted, many people were to see the comments this morning by the former Deputy Prime Minister and former leader of the National Party,
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnaby_Joyce" rel="nofollow">
                    Barnaby Joyce
                   </a>
                   , who—in the midst of the disaster that we are seeing unfolding, particularly in northern

                   </a>
                   over the past two or three days, in which people have died, homes have been destroyed and communities made distraught—had the gall to link the deaths of two people to whether or not they were Greens voters. That is absolutely unbecoming of somebody who is elected to this place, let alone someone who thinks he ought to be Deputy Prime Minister again. Marry his comments with the comments made yesterday by the current Deputy Prime Minister,
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_McCormack" rel="nofollow">
                    Michael McCormack
                   </a>
                   , who dismissed the very serious concerns that this issue is causing right across the country, particularly in rural and regional areas, where they are saying, 'Can we get some action on climate change, because our homes, our communities, our regions are now on fire.' What did Mr McCormack say? He said that climate change is just an issue of raving lefties from the inner city. It's not. This is an issue that is affecting the entire nation. It doesn't matter in what part of this country you live or were born. It doesn't matter how old you are, how rich you are, how poor you are or what you do for a job. Climate change is already having a huge impact. It is not a matter that affects just the inner city lefties. It is an issue that right now—today—is confronting the people of the bush, the very people that Mr McCormack is meant to represent. Between the Deputy Prime Minister and Mr Barnaby Joyce, these two blokes are sounding more and more like the obnoxious uncles at a Christmas party, doing whatever they can to piss everybody off and upset them, to grab a headline and insult people. It's not the behaviour that we should be expecting from someone who is the Deputy Prime Minister or used to be the Deputy Prime Minister.

                      </a>
                      . I just wanted to appeal to my fellow senators today. This legislation is nothing but a Trojan horse to support the coal industry. This amendment being put forward by the Greens that we are now debating removes the ability for this government to fund—using public funds—a coal-fired power station because it suits their politics. I can't say it suits their policy on energy or climate, because they don't have one. But it certainly suits their politics.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Let's put this whole thing into context. Ever since I have been here—I witnessed in my first two years as a senator the Liberal and National parties in opposition doing everything they could to undermine the clean energy package, which had been brought in by the Greens and Labor, that raises the world's gold standard legislation package to tackle the rising emissions that have led to global warmings and the climate emergency that we find ourselves in today. There has been relentless, cynical, ruthless campaigning to remove action on climate.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Let me tell you a little story, Chair. I remember Senator Christine Milne, when she was here, sitting in that chair across there, after campaigning her entire career inside and outside of this parliament to get action on climate. She wasn't the first Greens to be campaigning on action on climate change in this place. Ex-Senator
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Brown" rel="nofollow">
                       Bob Brown
                      </a>
                      raised it in his first speech, in 1996—over 20 years ago—the imperative for us to act on the biggest challenge to our society and our economy.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      I remember when the last bit of legislation to rip up the clean energy package came before the Senate. This is after, in the other place, members of parliament had stood up and done their 'ring a rosie'—Mr Greg Hunt, Mrs Kelly O'Dwyer and so on and so forth—celebrating and destroying the only parliamentary action we've seen in a decade on climate change. I remember seeing that. And I remember seeing Senator Milne in the last moments of the debate, just before it went to a vote, and this is after nearly 14 hours of us sitting in this chamber, listening to the nauseating climate-denial politics of the opposition. Those who know former Senator Milne know she's a hard woman, but I saw her hand tremble as she packed up her files, as the vote went through, as the people were patting themselves on the back. I saw her hand trembling when she saw her life's work go down the drain. I followed her outside this chamber, in that room out there, and I witnessed something I never thought I'd see: Senator Milne breaking down in tears. But, being the person she was, rather than having me distressed, she said: 'Don't worry, Peter. We're still going to win this fight.' And we have never given up fighting for action on climate change. That's why we've raised this amendment today. That's why we consistently highlight the need for action.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      I'm going to get my chance a little bit later to talk about the events we are witnessing around this country—the catastrophic events that
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
                       CSIRO
                      </a>
                      warned us about in 2006. I've fought hard with my colleagues to make sure this government hasn't cut funding to the exact agencies that monitor and manage the risks that it is so necessary for us to understand and prepare for in this climate emergency. We have consistently raised that the No. 1 issue for a government is to protect its citizens and that we are facing, from changing weather patterns, the greatest threat to our nation, to its economy, to its communities and to its ecosystems and its environment. In 2006 CSIRO warned us that by 2020 we would see the exact conditions that we have seen in
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

                      </a>
                      and Queensland. And it's not just New South Wales and Queensland; some of the changes we're seeing right around this country are off the charts. We have to do everything we can to act on reducing emissions and taking the strongest possible action, and this big-stick legislation today—and I commend my colleague
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Bandt" rel="nofollow">
                       Adam Bandt
                      </a>
                      in the other place for his leadership in highlighting this—is just a Trojan horse to support the coal industry, which shouldn't surprise anyone who understands the modus operandi of this government. It is in the pocket of big business, doing the bidding of those who donate to its coffers to keep it in power.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      I've got another theory for you, Chair and fellow senators. It's not just political donations. It's not just this broken democratic system that allows vested interests to buy influence in this place. It's also this mob here:
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Nation" rel="nofollow">
                       One Nation
                      </a>
                      . They are the biggest electoral threat to the

                       LNP
                      </a>
                      and especially to the National Party. In New South Wales and Queensland, the major parties haemorrhage votes to One Nation and, sadly, rather than standing up for principles like fighting for action on climate change, transitioning to 100 per cent renewable energy and spending money on the emergency services we need to tackle climate emergencies, they would rather pander to the antiscience, climate denial politics of One Nation. They have become One Nation in an attempt to hang on to power. That's what the cynical politics of this debate is now.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      This bill is designed to be hung out there so that the Nationals and the Liberal Party can go out to these marginal seats and say, 'Hey, look what we've done: we're supporting coal and we're supporting employment in your region,' regardless of the fact that, as leaders who make the decisions that affect real people's lives, they could be putting in place a transition plan away from coal to renewables and the industries of the future while at the same time reducing emissions and taking the strongest possible action on climate change. That's what leadership looks like, that's what the Greens do in this place and that is what this amendment is. This is leadership on climate.

                       Labor will be opposing the amendments moved by Senator Hanson-Young. As I indicated in my earlier remarks and my second reading contribution, our focus in dealing with this legislation has been on ensuring that any backdoor privatisation of assets—specifically in Queensland, Tasmania and

                       —was ruled out and also that workers affected by divestments had access to protections. The Greens' amendments are largely unrelated to this particular bill, and they have the potential to jeopardise some of the important agreements that Labor has arrived at in pursuing these interests of stopping privatisation and protecting workers.

                       Our commitment to climate action is unshakeable, and that is why last month in this place, with the support of my colleagues, I called upon the government to declare a climate emergency.

                         These amendments relate specifically to the major concern that people have in relation to this bill and the motivation of the government: that it is to make it harder for the

                         </a>
                         to close. We know that this bill is being used as part of the government's broader bully tactics against
                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGL" rel="nofollow">
                          AGL
                         </a>
                         to force them to keep Liddell open rather than to close it, despite the fact that all of the evidence, all of the advice and all of the expertise shows that, if we are to start reducing pollution, if we are to meet the Paris Agreement, if we are to get well and truly on the way to net zero emissions by 2050, we are going to have to start closing some of these older coal-fired power stations. If this bill is to pass, which it will because of the support that the Labor Party are giving the government, we don't want to see it being used to override decisions and announcements that are already made.

                         speak in relation to the previous sheet of Greens amendments, saying that it wasn't in direct relation to the bill. Well, this one clearly is. You can't run that argument on this one, because this is precisely related to allowing for AGL to ensure that they can do what it is that they have said—that's to retire Liddell because it is old, because we need to be reducing pollution and because it's just simply not efficient any longer to be keeping it open.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         We know that what this bill is about. Despite all the dressing up and window-dressing in relation to this being about lowering power bills, we've heard directly from government members in the House of Representatives debate that this bill is all about sticking it to AGL because of their decision to close Liddell and to retire what is a coughing and spluttering clunker of a coal-fired power station.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         This amendment is important, because the last thing we want to see is the government dogged by the ideological battle inside their party room between those who don't understand the science of climate change and those who do—and there are some. I'll pay credit to that. There are plenty of people inside the Liberal Party who understand the science of climate change, but there are others who have their heads so deep in the sand that they have no idea what is coming in terms of the huge impact that global warming is bringing to our communities and to the future of this planet. They think that, as long as they keep talking about how much they love coal, everything will be okay. The fight and the ideological war inside the Liberal and National parties should not stop this country moving forward towards a clean renewable energy future. It certainly shouldn't. The ideological war inside the Liberal-National coalition should not be used to bully AGL and in fact other companies who are rightly seeing the writing on the wall. They want to transition out of coal because they can see that it doesn't make smart business sense and it doesn't make environmental sense.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Climate change is already here on our doorstep and there is a moral obligation to act. So let's put this amendment in place, even if it's just to help the Prime Minister deal with some of those dinosaurs in his own party who think that loving coal, at any cost, is the only way forward. This amendment is important if we are to transition to get coal out of the system and to ensure that companies like AGL can make smart business choices without the fear of being bullied by the government of the day.

                          Labor won't be supporting this amendment. I am horrified by the approach taken by the government to the energy system. I am horrified by the continual discussion about direct investment and public money being applied to new or old coal-fired power stations. I think the approach that they are taking is ad hoc, political and totally failing the public. But the solution proposed by the Greens in this amendment doesn't deal with the material problem in this bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Prohibiting Energy Market Misconduct) Bill 2019. In Labor's view, the role of the
