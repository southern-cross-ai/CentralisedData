           We all agree that the allegations contained in the Brereton report are serious but I take issue with the final point of this motion, asking those affected by these allegations and the response to reach out and get help. The minister for veterans affairs runs a $12 billion department that can find the time, surely, to reach out to the Australian military witnesses, those military members accused and their families. I'd also like to express my deepest respect and sympathy to all those who have served in 2 Squadron

           since 1964, including our Borneo and Vietnam veterans, those who fought in Afghanistan and Iraq and those who are on other missions that we will never know about, and to the thousands of family members attached to these men who are now feeling shame, heartache and repercussions because of the alleged actions of a few. I want to make sure it is fully acknowledged by all sides of the parliament that they too are suffering.
