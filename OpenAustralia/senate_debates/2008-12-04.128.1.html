         I acknowledge Senator Moore’s very close and long-term interest in Public Service issues. I am pleased to be able to inform the Senate that the government is today honouring another of its election commitments. It is an important one; I think it is fundamental to our approach to integrity in government. I acknowledge that in September last year my colleague Senator Wong, in an excellent speech on Labor’s approach to the

        </p>
        <p>
         The government, therefore, is establishing an Ethics Advisory Service within the Australian Public Service Commission. Funds for this purpose are being provided in the 2008-09 additional estimates. It will be operational from April next year.

             agencies to enhance ethical awareness and decision-making capabilities. As well as providing advice to agencies on specific ethical issues and problems, the service will review and develop publications and advice on ethical issues, establish and maintain an ethics website and a phone line for advice and set up agency networks for the discussion and exchange of views and experiences on ethical issues. There will be an annual report to parliament, which will identify and analyse ongoing and emerging ethical trends and issues. I commend this to all senators in the chamber and I hope all senators will acknowledge that this is an important and very long overdue initiative.

               It is an important issue that Senator Moore raises in her supplementary question. The commissioner will establish a new ethics team in the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APS" rel="nofollow">
                APS
               </a>
               C. It will assist rather than direct. While emphasising the service-wide standards expected of all public servants, the team’s approach will recognise that individual agencies face particular challenges and acknowledge that some agencies already have arrangements in place for providing advice specifically relevant to their circumstances. The team will assist a network of agencies’ ethics contact officers in responding to ethical issues within agencies. In conjunction with the commissioner, it will also handle queries from agency heads,

               employees and other staff. Although much of its work will be public, the team will be able to handle sensitive issues with appropriate confidentiality when that is required.

                 No, it does not. I want to place clearly on the record that the government believes that it and the Australian people are very well served by its public servants, who, with remarkably few exceptions, are honest and hardworking and take extremely seriously the obligations placed on them by the

The legislation provides a sound framework, but it is the right culture and leadership which matter and which, in all organisations, public and private, need to be carefully nurtured and consistently reinforced. I might say that in honouring this important election commitment the government is providing the means to enhance—
