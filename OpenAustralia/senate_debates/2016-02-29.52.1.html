        My question is to the Minister for Communications, Senator Fifield. In this place on 22 February this year the minister said that the rollout of the Prime Minister's copper
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        was 'accelerating'. But NBN documents dated 19 February 2016 reveal that the Prime Minister's copper NBN is in crisis and that nbn co has failed to meet even a third of its internal rollout target. Was the minister informed that the NBN rollout was behind schedule before or after he made his statement?

          I thank Senator McLucas for her question. I think colleagues would be aware that perhaps Senator Conroy and Mr Clare in the other place have been getting around the place from time to time, opening up their trench coats, saying to walking journalists going past them, 'Psst, psst, I've got something here.'

            rollout is going well. 1.8 million households have the opportunity to connect to the NBN. There are currently about 820,000 premises that have elected to do so. I can share with you that under the previous government only 51,000 premises activations had occurred. Fifty-one thousand under Labor and 820,000 under the coalition—

                            rolled out fastest and at lowest cost. We will see the NBN rolled out six to eight years sooner and at $30 billion less expense than would be the case with a full fibre rollout.

                            Those opposite seem to have forgotten that they spent in excess of $6 billion to have just two per cent of premises available for the NBN—just two per cent of premises. Those opposite seem to have forgotten that they only achieved 15 per cent of their rollout objectives—only 15 per cent—so this idea that the NBN was somehow the national nirvana network under the other side is completely wrong. It was off track, it was over budget, it was behind. We have got it back on track.
