           The government remains committed to creating a better experience for senior Australians entering aged care, including receiving timely, consistent and high-quality needs assessments. The government made a commitment in the 2018-19 budget to create a single assessment workforce for aged care, in line with the 2017 Tune review recommendation No. 27, and we continue to work towards this outcome, working with the jurisdictions and the sector. Labor, on the other hand, have offered nothing but fear campaigns and baseless commentary. Despite plans for $387 billion in new taxes at the last election, including their retirees tax, Labor provided no additional funding in their costings for home care places and no additional funding for aged-care quality, workforce or mainstream residential aged care.

               The government has not made a decision to privatise aged-care assessments. It's disappointing that claims to that effect by the opposition are misleading the community and, indeed, the parliament. The government made a commitment in the 2018-19 budget to create a single assessment workforce for aged care in line with the 2017 Tune review recommendation No. 27, and we continue to work towards this outcome, working with the jurisdictions involved and the sector. As the Treasurer said last week, that statement was not in his speech. It was

               as the Treasurer who called Australia's ageing population a demographic time bomb. The Morrison government remains committed to creating a better experience for senior Australians entering aged care.

                   The government has not made a decision to privatise aged-care assessments, and again it's disappointing that claims to that effect are being made by the opposition. They are misleading the community and the parliament. The government had made a commitment in the 2018-19 budget to create a single assessment workforce for aged care in line with the Tune review of 2017. Recommendation No. 27 of that review was that the government integrate regional assessment services with aged-care assessment teams. The government rejects the false claims by Labor about consultation. In fact, there have been several rounds of consultation with states following the Tune review recommendation. The government remains committed to creating a better experience for senior Australians entering aged care.
