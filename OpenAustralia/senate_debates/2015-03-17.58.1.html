        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Abetz. Can the minister confirm the foreign minister delivered a scathing assessment of the Abbott government's first budget at last night's full ministry meeting which was then leaked to the parliamentary press gallery?

           I understand that that which Senator Conroy asserts is not correct. But can I say: talk about sham competitive processes!

           springs to mind. Senator Conroy would have to be the champion of sham competitive processes. He is shaking his head. I do not think he even pretended it was competitive. It was simply a sham. Of course, that is why Senator Conroy is interested in this matter.

            , I ask a further supplementary question. Given that the foreign minister has confirmed that she was cut out of a vital national security decision and her budget assessments to her ministry colleagues are now being leaked, can I ask: how is good government going for you?

             Good government is going exceptionally well for the Australian people. We have got rid of the carbon tax. We have got rid of the mining tax. We have got three free trade agreements. Employment is growing at three times the rate that it was under the Labor government. Retail sales are up. Construction rates are up. There are green shoots all over the Australian economy. After six years of job reduction in the agriculture fishery and forestry sector, so ably represented by Senator Colbeck in this place, we have actually seen jobs growth. In my home state of Tasmania just recently, we had the wonderful announcement of the enhancement of the Freight Equalisation Scheme, a wonderful good news story for my home state of Tasmania.
