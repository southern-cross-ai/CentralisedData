        My question is for the honourable Senator Birmingham, representing the Minister for the Environment.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EIS" rel="nofollow">
         EIS
        </a>
        approval in November 2014. To date, approval has not been provided. Could you please explain whether Mr Hunt is delaying consideration and why this project has not been approved?

         I thank Senator Lazarus for his question. As I have told the Senate before, and I think I have told Senator Lazarus before in response to questions, Minister Hunt and the government take our responsibilities for thorough and rigorous assessment of projects under the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC" rel="nofollow">
          EPBC
         </a>
         Act quite seriously. In relation to the particular project in question, I will take the details on notice because I do not have the exact time line for that project before me. But I will happily get the information for Senator Lazarus as to how the assessment processes around that project are proceeding.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would note that Senator Lazarus spoke about jobs in Queensland and about EPBC approvals and assessments. This government are absolutely committed to making sure that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC_Act" rel="nofollow">
          EPBC Act
         </a>
         operates in the most efficient and effective way possible. That is why Minister Hunt has ensured environmental approvals for more than a $1 trillion worth of economic activity since we took office. It is why we have made sure that projects are rigorously assessed but assessed as expeditiously as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is why we are pursuing the agenda of having a one-stop shop for environmental approvals, so that we can make sure projects like this are given clear air to be assessed in the quickest possible way simultaneously by both state and federal governments. It is why we are proposing further improvements and enhancements to the EPBC Act to ensure that projects like this, when they do get approval, can actually have the certainty that the approval will stand, that investors can have certainty that they will not be subject to unreasonable litigation, that we will not see instances where tens of thousands of jobs are held up because of technical problems or because of litigious practices. I will certainly give Senator Lazarus the answer to his question.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I can only hope that the government become as thorough with mines as they are with wind farms. The Mount Emerald wind farm project will provide power in the Cairns region for up to 75,000 thousand homes a year. Does the government understand the benefit that renewable energy provides to the country and why it is so important that projects of this nature are given prompt consideration?

           The government absolutely understand that projects need to have prompt consideration. We are absolutely committed to making sure that, whilst all assessment practices are rigorous, we do give prompt consideration to them. And, of course, we are determined to make sure that investors have certainty at the end of that. We want to ensure that when those who are pursuing a project—whether it is a wind farm, whether it is a mining project, whether it is an infrastructure development project—get the approvals, they know that they can invest with confidence and proceed with confidence. So I am pleased that Senator Lazarus, who I note has indicated his opposition to our latest reforms to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC" rel="nofollow">
            EPBC
           </a>
           Act, is so concerned about investor confidence. I invite Senator Lazarus to reconsider his position, because in reconsidering his position he could be supporting confidence for the very investors he is talking about; that, whatever the nature of the project, they can then have confidence they will not face litigious practices in future that put those jobs and investment at risk.

            , I ask a further supplementary question. In view of the government's approach to dirty coal in favour of renewable energy, is the government deliberately delaying the approval of renewable energy projects to harm the renewable energy sector?

             I completely reject the assertion of Senator Lazarus. Every
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC" rel="nofollow">
              EPBC
             </a>
             application that comes to this government is considered on its merits. Every application is considered against the law. We adhere to the law and we apply the law, and that is exactly what Minister Hunt does, regardless of the nature of the project in question. We want to make sure that it is applied as effectively and expeditiously as possible. That is why we have managed to progress more than a $1 trillion worth of environmental approvals since we have been in power, why we have got rid of much of the backlog that existed from the previous government. I will make sure in relation to this one, Senator Lazarus, that we get prompt answers for you as to why those approvals have not been forthcoming. But I can assure you, Senator Lazarus, there is no difference in treatment, but we do want to give investors the certainty so they can build and create jobs in whatever industry it is in Queensland and all around Australia.
