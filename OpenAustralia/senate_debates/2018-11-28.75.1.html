        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence. Minister, can you confirm that the defence department has expressed strong opposition to siting a national radioactive waste storage facility within the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woomera_Prohibited_Area" rel="nofollow">
         Woomera Prohibited Area

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        ? Can you confirm the department's view that siting of such a facility within the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woomera_Test_Range" rel="nofollow">
         Woomera Test Range
        </a>
        would present what is claimed to be an intolerable risk for range operations? Given that mineral exploration, mining and pastoral activities are allowed within the Woomera Test Range, can the minister provide an authoritative statement for Defence's opposition to hosting a national radioactive waste facility anywhere within the Woomera Prohibited Area?

         The Department of Defence is not in the habit of publicly commenting on the details of that sort of advice, and I think that is a sound approach for the department to take. If there are any aspects of Senator Patrick's question to which I am able to provide further information, then I will happily take those on notice, of course, and return to the chamber.

            FOI

           documents, Minister. Nonetheless, it's a fact that there are 10,000 drums of low-level radioactive waste from
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">

           and 35 cubic metres of intermediate-level waste of Defence's within the target area. Defence has advised that that's an intolerable risk. Can you reconcile that, please?

            Senator, it is correct to say that you did provide me with a copy of an article from the ABC of 1 August relating to the storage of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
             CSIRO
            </a>
            related waste and a number of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOI" rel="nofollow">
             FOI
            </a>
            materials. As I understand the nature of the FOI, the material that has been released relates to the analysis that was done of Commonwealth landholdings which indicated that there was no Commonwealth land suitable for hosting the facility. But a number of the parcels included in that analysis were Defence land, as the senator has noted. This response has come from the department and relates to that analysis.

           <p>
            I think it is important for the chamber to be reminded that Woomera itself, the Woomera protected area, is a unique part not just of Australia but in fact of the globe and presents some very importantâ€”

              Minister, I draw your attention to a study commissioned by the Howard government, a 400-page study, on where a radioactive waste facility should be sited, which makes a clear recommendation that it be sited in Woomera, at Evetts Field, near the range. Noting that, can you tell the people of Hawker and Kimba why there is nowhere within 122,000 square kilometres of the prohibited area where you can place a facility?

               It's not for the Minister for Defence and me, in my capacity representing him, to talk about the location of any future national radioactive waste management facility. As the senator would know, that is a matter for the Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science and the minister who represents her in this chamber. I was going to say in my earlier remarks that the Woomera prohibited area represents a unique part of Australia, particularly for some defence activities. I don't have any further detail to provide to the senator on that, but I'll take any other aspects of his question on notice and return to the chamber if I can provide any more information.
