          I brought this motion forward to draw the parliament's and the minister's attention to this important issue. Changes to the subsidy to the hourly rate of in-home child care now means that high-needs families are unable to get the child care they need to attend medical appointments, receive respite and go to work. Service providers are leaving the industry and carers are losing their jobs. As noted in the motion, we should recognise that although there are problems with the in-home childcare program some families with complex needs are facing a childcare crisis as a result of the changes. Some changes have been made, but they are not enough. I urge the government to take concrete action on this.

             The government does not support this motion. The government has increased the in-home care hourly rate to $32 per hour, which equates to $38.40 per hour for families eligible for the additional childcare subsidy. The government has also increased the number of places available by 200 places nationally, effective from 1 January 2019.
