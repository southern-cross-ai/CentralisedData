        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Government Services, Senator Ruston. Can the minister confirm the government received 14 official reports of robodebt victims threatening self-harm: on 7 January 2017, 13 July 2017, 1 August 2017, 8 August 2017, 28 August 2017, 30 August 2017, 6 October 2017, 23 October 2017, 26 October 2017, 6 November 2017, 7 August 2018, 24 September 2018, 6 November 2018 and 11 December 2018?

         for her question. I do not have with me today the information that you require. However, I will take the specifics of the detailed question that you asked in relation to each and every one of those individual instances that you have just quoted. I make the point that this is a very delicate and sensitive area and that we need to be mindful of how we handle these issues. I would warn everyone opposite that talking about this issue requires great sensitivity and I caution anyone reaching unfounded conclusions that continue to perpetuate the upset and trauma that is inflicted on the loved ones.

           Has the minister asked the department for a report on how many Australians died by suicide as a result of the government's illegal robodebt scheme?

            As I said, we need to be very careful and very sensitive because any death by suicide is a tragedyâ€”I say that upfront. Senator

             McCarthy
            </a>
            , I reject the premise of your question, because I believe it is incorrect for you to interpret Centrelink customer death statistics as suicides. These are all individual cases and all these individual people deserve respect and not to be spoken about as just a statistic. We know that there are a number of deceased customers of Centrelink whose estates are entitled to a refund under the Income Compliance program. Those estates will receive those refunds, as will everybody in the Income Compliance program.

              asked whether the minister had sought a report about those who might have died by suicide as a consequence of being pursued under the illegal scheme. We haven't asked about refunds; we've asked whether or not a report around the effects of the scheme has been asked for.

                 As I said to a previous question that was asked of me by those on the other side, when we became aware as to the income compliance program, which used income averaging as the sole determining factor for determining a debt, we ceased that program and we commenced immediately putting in place a program to repay those debts. We have nearly completed that program, and we are just working through the final stages to make sure that anybody who had a debt that was raised as a result of income averaging is now in the process of receiving that refund.
