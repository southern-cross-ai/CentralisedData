        While the minister is on a roll, my question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Watt. The Albanese government's National Reconstruction Fund promises to be a landmark policy that will transform Australian industry and revitalise our manufacturing sector. How will the

         Thank you, Senator Sterle, who is known throughout this chamber and throughout this parliament as a strong supporter of Australian agriculture, including as the fabulous chair of the R

         committee, where he does a terrific job.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is good to see he is not lacking in confidence in that respect! The Albanese Labor government wants Australia to be a country that makes things again. What a revolutionary idea that is, to be a country that makes things again, after 10 years of our manufacturing industry being run down by a Liberal and National Party government that literally dared our car industry to leave this country. We want a country that supports Australian manufacturing and the development of our sovereign capabilities. We don't ever want to be in the same situation that Australia was in through COVID, where all of a sudden we didn't have the capacity to make ventilators, to make
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPE" rel="nofollow">
          PPE
         </a>
         , to make all the other things—the RAT tests—that we were caught short on and that is why we need to be able to stand on our own two feet and have greater sovereign capability, and that is exactly what the Albanese government's National Reconstruction Fund is all about.

         The National Reconstruction Fund is about transforming the Australian economy. It is a $15 billion investment in securing our future prosperity, adding value to our natural resources and bolstering critical supply chains. The National Reconstruction Fund will provide finance to drive investments in seven priority areas of the Australian economy and, pleasingly, one of those areas is via a $500 million sub fund for value adding in agriculture, forestry, fisheries, food and fibre. This fund will unlock potential and value add to raw materials in sectors like food processing, textiles, clothing and footwear manufacturing. Importantly, it will also invest in agricultural supply chain products such as fertiliser, which would help drive down input costs for farmers right around the country. I can tell you, over the last few weeks, I have been meeting with a lot of farmers' organisations, telling them about the National Reconstruction Fund and how it can help with fertiliser costs and everything else, and they think this is something we should all get behind.

           The National Reconstruction Fund will invest at least $500 million in value adding in the agriculture, forestry and fisheries sectors. We know that these sectors generate economic activity and jobs in regional Australia, so how will the National Reconstruction Fund support businesses and create manufacturing jobs in regional Australia?

             Thank you, President, and thank you, Senator Sterle. The National Reconstruction Fund is about creating jobs—secure jobs, well-paid jobs, blue collar jobs, jobs in our regions,—and a number of National Reconstruction Fund priority areas have a strong regional presence in sectors such as resources, agriculture, defence and renewables. In fact, one-third of manufacturing jobs are located outside our capital cities. That is exactly why we should get behind the National Reconstruction Fund and that is exactly why any party that claims to represent regional Australia should be backing in the National Reconstruction Fund as well.

            <p class="italic">

                  Senator Sterle, I'm very sorry to inform you that there is some risk that these reforms won't pass the parliament. Unfortunately, not everyone is on board with backing our regions and with the Albanese government's plan to transform Australian manufacturing and back good blue-collar jobs. The opposition had the choice to say yes to Australian manufacturing, but they've chosen to say no. They've chosen to say no to new jobs, no to new investment, no to new opportunities, especially in our regions. Whatever the issue, they just say no. It's like being caught in some never-ending loop of
