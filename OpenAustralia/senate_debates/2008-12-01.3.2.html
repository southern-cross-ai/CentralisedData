        I seek leave to amend government business notice of motion No. 1 by omitting paragraphs (2) to (5).
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        I move the motion as amended:
       </p>
       <p>
        That, on Monday, 1 December 2008:
       </p>
       <dl>
        <dt>
         (a)
        </dt>
        <dd>
         the hours of meeting shall be 12.30 pm to 6.30 pm and 7.30 pm to 11.40 pm;
        </dd>
        <dt>
         (b)
        </dt>
        <dd>
         the routine of business from 7.30 pm shall be government business only; and
        </dd>
        <dt>
         (c)
        </dt>
        <dd>
         the question for the adjournment of the Senate shall be proposed at 11 pm.
        </dd>
       </dl>
       <p>
        In trying to deal with the workload that we have—which is some 18-odd packages of bills—in the Senate this week, the government’s view was that it was best to lay out the timetable from Monday to Thursday evening so that all senators would understand what the week would bring. There is a view from the opposition—and, probably, the minor parties—that it might be more interesting to deal with it on a daily basis. The government does see some merit in that because we do not know what progress might occur through the week.
       </p>
       <p>
        Omitting paragraphs (2) to (5) from the motion does not change the timetable for today; it leaves today the same. The hours of sitting shall be from 12.30 to late at night. At 11 o’clock the adjournment will be proposed and then of course there will be the usual 40-minute adjournment debate.
       </p>
       <p>
        The object will be to get through as much of the program as possible, of course ensuring that everyone gets an opportunity to make their contribution. I remind senators that this follows from the leaders and whips meeting last week, which allowed a range of bills, 40 in all, to be progressed. We have progressed 22 of those, so there is some merit in dealing with the hours on a daily basis this week, based on the progress that has been made so far.
       </p>
       <p>
        I remind senators that in the two final weeks of sittings we are always required to deal with a significant program before the end of the session. However, it is not as onerous as in the past. In the final two sitting weeks in September last year the Senate considered 50 bills. Numbers of bills considered in the past have ranged from 30 to 40. So there is merit in dealing with the hours on a daily basis, given that we have a smaller number of bills to progress through than in the past.
       </p>
       <p>
        We understand that senators have had extensive briefings on the relevant bills, as required, through their parties and can request additional information if they so desire. We also understand that a range of the bills have been dealt with through the committee. I enjoin all senators to allow the program to proceed so that we can complete the number of bills required before Thursday evening.

         I have listened very carefully to Senator Ludwig’s comments. I do not think he meant to infer any criticism as to the level of cooperation that has been extended to the government in getting this program together. The statistics do not lie, and the extra time allowed for government business in the sitting week prior to this alone was nine hours and 42 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
         I will not take up the Senate’s time talking about all of the extra time that we have agreed to to enable the government to progress its program. This is a matter for cooperation. It is the last week. We think there is eminent good sense in looking at the program day by day. That is not in any way to suggest there is any lack of cooperation—just the contrary. All senators need to be able to make the contributions they need to make in relation to these important matters. I think there are something like 17 packages left. We hope that nothing else is going to be introduced—I notice a couple more seem to have snuck in. The government knows we are taking a very responsible approach to this, but there is an end to one’s patience with some of these things. I am sure during this last week all senators will be very keen to ensure that the program can be completed, and we will review it tomorrow.

          indicate to the minister that I have something to do with one of the bills that is listed—I will not name it—in a representative capacity on behalf of the opposition, but the shadow minister in the other place indicated to me that this particular package of legislation was not even on the government’s ‘must do’ list for this year. Let me say to Senator Ludwig that the opposition is keen to assist on urgent material that needs to be dealt with before the Christmas break. I do not want to inflame things, but I think it is a matter of record that we have not had a huge amount of legislation in this last 12 months. In many weeks we have struggled to find sufficient bills to have a chat about.

            Indeed, Senator Ferguson. We have had a pretty casual year this year because the government have not brought bills to this chamber for debate. It is up to them to bring bills through when they want them. If there are urgent things, as Senator Coonan has said, we of course want to help where it is important, but I say to the minister: if it is not urgent, we are not going to sit here until three o’clock in the morning to do things that could well be done next February.
