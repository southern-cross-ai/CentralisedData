         I thank my parliamentary colleagues for their contributions to this debate. All in this chamber should be concerned about the footage of the National Socialist Network marching through Ballarat over the weekend. It is imperative that we look at ways we can address this concerning threat of right-wing extremism. We will work with all in this chamber on ways to address this, including a broad-ranging inquiry.
        </p>
        <p>
         In response to a bipartisan recommendation of the PJCIS, the government has removed the express reference to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State" rel="nofollow">
          Islamic State
         </a>
         flag from the definition of prohibited symbols. This reflects the concerns raised by members of the Muslim community that the shahada and the seal of the prophet have been misappropriated by a terrorist organisation. We will not let a terrorist organisation cause further harm or distress to any in our community. The government thanks members of the Australian Muslim community for their engagement and valuable feedback on this important legislation. I note that the Australian Muslim Advocacy Network welcome the removal of the Islamic State flag from the list of prohibited hate symbols, saying, 'This addressed concerns raised by Australian Muslim organisations.' The government condemns Islamophobia and stands with the Australian Muslim community in opposition to terrorism in all its forms.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is an historic moment, the first Commonwealth legislation of its kind. The bill will ensure no-one will be allowed to glorify or profit from acts and symbols that celebrate the Nazis and their evil ideology. We should all be proud of this fact. This is a moment when the parliament has come together.

          I just have a question for Senator Chisholm about the government not supporting a second reading amendment that basically talked about the need to actually look at the underlying causes of Nazism and not just ban some symbols.
         </p>
         <p>
          The TEMPORARY CHAIR: Time has, unfortunately, expired, Senator Pocock. That was the time allotted for the debate on the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Prohibited Hate Symbols and Other Measures) Bill 2023. After I have put the question before the chair, I will then put the questions on the remaining stages of the bill. The question is that the amendments moved by Senator Roberts on sheet 2307 be agreed to.
         </p>
         <p>
          Question negatived.
         </p>
         <p>
          The TEMPORARY CHAIR: I will first deal with the amendments circulated by the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Greens
          </a>
          . I understand that earlier today Senator Shoebridge withdrew the amendments on sheet 2313, so I will now deal with the amendments on sheets 2251 and 2280. The first question is that items 3, 4 and 5 of schedule 4 stand as printed.
