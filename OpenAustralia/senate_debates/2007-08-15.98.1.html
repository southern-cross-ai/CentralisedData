        My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Attorney-General. Given that the Attorney-General reported on 13 August that around half of the 100,000 calls to the national security hotline have been referred to the relevant law enforcement or security agencies, I ask the minister: how many of those referrals have resulted in investigations being conducted by the relevant security or law enforcement agencies and how many of those investigations have resulted in charges being laid?

         I thank the senator for her question on this very important subject. I expect that it is inappropriate to talk about the ratio of public information and intelligence flowing through the hotline and the amount that is actually investigated. Approximately half of the 100,000 calls received by the hotline since its inauguration in 2002 have resulted in

         inquiries. I am advised that a substantial number of those inquiries have led to prosecutions and/or detailed investigations. Many of those will be ongoing over a prolonged period of time.

           I know the hotline has been the subject of considerable ridicule from those opposite. 1800123400 is the actual number, for those over there who are interested in the subject.
          </p>
          <p>
           With terrorism, the government is confronted with the proposition of defeating the act before it happens, so intelligence is absolutely crucial to protecting the Australian community. This tool has been vital. There have been 100,000 calls from members of the community who have taken the time to get on the phone to talk to the government about something they have observed as being worth drawing the government’s attention to. I think it is a very substantial tool.
          </p>
          <p>
           We had undertaken to promote the hotline again prior to the attacks in the United Kingdom on airports, which we are all aware of. This is a vital tool, it is an inexpensive tool and it enables people anonymously to alert the government to things that they see happening in the community. Every detail helps—and that is the name of the current program we are running. I thank the senator for her question and the opportunity to put these matters, which are very important, before the Senate. The current threat level is medium, which means that, while there is no specific threat, a threat could occur at any time.

            , I ask a supplementary question. I just want to clarify something. The minister has indicated that prosecutions have taken place as a consequence of the referrals to the relevant security or law enforcement agencies, but the minister just cannot say how many. Is that the case? Secondly, I understand that phase 3 of the public awareness campaign has kicked in this month. I ask the minister to explain to the Senate: why is the government spending more money on increased advertisements for the national security hotline? What factors have made the government decide to boost the advertising at this particular point in time? I ask the government: how much money is being spent on this increased public awareness campaign, and what form will these advertisements take? I am aware of where they are taking place but I would like to know the volume—how many advertisements will the government be placing as part of phase 3 of this increased public awareness campaign for the national security hotline?

             Again, I thank the learned senator. The new phase of the campaign was being developed prior to the failed

              UK
             </a>
             car-bombing incidents and the attack on Glasgow airport. The recent events in the UK serve as a reminder of the need to remain vigilant. Since it was launched in December 2002, the national security public information campaign has been, as I have said, very successful. I do not have—but I can provide them to the learned senator—the answers specifically on the cost of the current campaign, but I have indicated we have had approximately 100,000 calls. Around half the calls received by the hotline have been referred to the

             and the relevant state and territory police. A substantial number of these calls—and that is as far as I wish to take it—have contributed to existing investigations or initiated new investigations. In the budget of 2007-08, some $20 million over two years was allocated to engaging the Australian public in counterterrorism efforts and to promoting the national security hotline.
