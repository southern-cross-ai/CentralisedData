        My question is to the Minister for

         Climate Change
        </a>
        and Energy. In 1991, Vanuatu, on behalf of small island states, first asked the question: 'Who should pay for climate catastrophe?' Over the next three decades, wealthy nations of the global north dodged and deflected that question, while continuing to fuel the climate crisis. They relentlessly pursued profit and power, putting the world on track for climate catastrophe and fuelling climate disasters. These disasters have affected 33 million people in Pakistan, and 50 million people in the

        After decades of pushing by the global south, a loss and damage fund has finally been agreed to.

              We are pleased that the parties have committed to exploring a broad range of ways to provide support to vulnerable countries, including those in the Pacific. We have heard our Pacific family when they've said the region's loss and damage needs are distinct from adaptation and resilience. And, as you know, we are actively working with Pacific partners to consider new climate finance options, including on loss and damage, and to ensure that global funding mechanisms work for the Pacific. So there's an engagement and a willingness to discuss. I would make this point, because the Greens come in here and they want us to do this but they also want to reduce revenue from other sources, such as—

                  Minister, as you well know, the climate crisis is an existential threat to the Pacific, where communities are facing rising sea levels and extreme storms. The government claims to be listening to the Pacific islands.

                   I'm interested in the implication about our motivation in that, because we are motivated, genuinely—
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   We had a long discussion yesterday about motivations. Senator

                   demanded something be withdrawn. I notice you did put it on social media afterwards anyway, but that's okay. But I would say to Senator Faruqi: the implication that we're not genuine in our engagement with our Pacific neighbours is wrong. We are. That does not mean there is not a lot that we have to work through, and I have been upfront with them. I have said: 'We are a highly emissions-intensive economy. We are seeking to shift the trajectory—the direction in which we're heading—and we are doing so belatedly. It will cost us more and it will be harder because of nine years of inaction. But we are serious about doing it.' So, please, if there was an implication, and perhaps I misheard, that somehow we are not genuine in how we engage with the Pacific—because we understand the nature of the threat—it is incorrect.

                     and Energy tabled his climate change statement earlier today but failed to even mention the elephant in the room: the impact of new coal and gas on Australia's climate targets. And yet the latest greenhouse gas inventory, also released today, shows that emissions from gas are increasing. Does the government acknowledge that burning coal and gas is causing and fuelling the climate crisis? And why won't it rule out opening new coal and gas projects?

                      I've answered this question many times. I understand this is the political campaign that the Greens party wishes to run between now and the next election, if I may say; that's a decision for you. But actually the policy challenges are far greater—far greater. So you can have a mantra around that, but what we need to do is transition an economy which is not only emissions intensive domestically but reliant on highly emissions-intensive industries for much of our export revenue. Now, we have to transition the economy, change the economy, so our people, our children and our country can thrive in a net zero world. That is an enormous undertaking.

                      I'll take that interjection. I'll take that interjection, because, as I said to Senator Milne years ago, it's possible that people might just disagree. It's not because we're corrupt; we just might disagree—
