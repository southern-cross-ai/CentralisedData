        I seek leave to move a motion relating to the consideration of legislation.

       <p>
        Leave not granted.

       <p>
        Pursuant to continent notice standing in my name, I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Birmingham moving a motion to provide for the consideration of a matter, namely a motion to provide that a motion relating to the consideration of legislation may be moved immediately and determined without amendment or debate.
       </p>
       <p>
        This motion provides for finalisation of the Fair Work Amendment (Supporting Australia's Jobs and Economic Recovery) Bill 2021, which the chamber has been debating for some number of days. It also provides for consideration of the Social Services Legislation (Strengthening Income Support) Bill 2021 and non-controversial matters for today. It preserves the Senate's opportunity to consider formal motions and have them voted upon today, as well as other ordinary business, including question time. I would also flag the government's intention to bring to the chamber later today legislation in relation to the parliamentary workplaces inquiry and the protection of information provided to the parliamentary workplaces inquiry. And I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the question be now put.

              I thank the Senate. Here is a government in crisis. A government that has had months on this industrial relations bill is now guillotining it after being so taken by other crises that they can't negotiate with the crossbench. They are now guillotining this bill, guillotining the next bill and guillotining the bill after that, including JobSeeker legislation.

                All you've got is bluster. You've got a part-time industrial relations minister who hasn't been able to pay attention, and so now the Senate is seeing the consequences of a government in crisis, trying to ram this legislation through in 20 minutes, and trying to ram the Jobseeker legislation through in that time. The government is trying to salvage some pride by passing a bill that, on your own admission, you're going to gut because you haven't got the numbers.

                      This government couldn't arrange a chook raffle. We have a late-hours motion which has some very tricksy additional consequences. There is a little rule in there that says you can't circulate any more amendments on the

                      bill with less than one hour's notice. But, hey presto, there's less than one hour to go. So they've effectively silenced everybody else from circulating any amendments, in response to their last-minute amendments, in relation to protecting workers' rights.

                      The other thing this motion successfully does is says that we can't vote on the sports rorts report that was due to be tabled this afternoon, that we can't speak on that. My colleague Senator Rice was going to seek to speak on that, because this government is up to its neck in corrupt activity, and it's conveniently ensured that that can't occur either. This government is in an absolute mess, but it's still managed to cover its own rear end on inconvenient matters.

                         , what a theatrical experience that was to watch on the floor of parliament. The whole fact is that, if you're so worried about the workers of this nation, if you're so worried about small business, with Senator Gallagher saying, 'We need to pass this for JobSeeker,' then start working to get it passed. If not, where's your notice of motion to continue it tonight? 'Let's stay back tonight. Let's work tonight. Let's stay till tomorrow.' Where's your notice of motion for that? If you're really worried about the workers of this nation and small business and JobSeeker, where's your notice of motion? The filibustering and the lies that have gone on in this parliament are absolutely disgusting. You've actually dragged this out, because now we've got a six- to seven-week break in this parliament. If you really care about the workers, if you really care about JobSeeker, then work to get these bills passed. As far as I'm concerned, you don't give a damn—

                            Senators, I'm going to insist upon quiet, otherwise the tellers and the Clerk cannot do their jobs. I don't think anyone would like me to name anyone now, but I'm going to insist on quiet for the tellers because, with noise, they cannot conduct the count fairly. The question is that the motion moved by Senator Birmingham be now put.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            The question is that the motion moved by Senator Birmingham be agreed to.
