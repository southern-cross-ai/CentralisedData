        My question is to Senator Brandis, the Minister for the Arts and Sport. Will the minister inform the Senate how the government’s sound management of the Australian economy has benefited the arts in Australia? Is the minister aware of any alternative policies?

         I thank Senator Adams for her question and acknowledge her deep interest in the arts in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         . As Senator Adams has identified, the good economic management of the Howard government has produced many beneficial effects. By bringing the budget back into surplus by paying off $96 billion of Labor Party debt, we are able to avoid wasting $8.5 billion a year in interest payments and return that money to taxpayers or invest it in beneficial projects, including in the arts. The saving of $8.5 billion a year—which is $23 million a day and slightly less than $1 million an hour—in interest that Australia was paying under the previous Labor government has enabled us, among many other beneficial measures, to announce in the budget on 8 May the largest increase in real terms in arts funding that Australia has seen.
        </p>
        <p>
         I might detain the Senate for a moment by comparing arts funding under the Howard government to arts funding under the Keating government. In the budget announced by Mr Costello on 8 May, arts funding in this financial year will be $681.1 million—the highest level ever and an increase on the last year of the Keating government of 65.8 per cent. That includes increasing the funding of the

          Australia Council
         </a>
         by 121 per cent, increasing the funding of the

         </a>

         I would like to share also with the Senate a letter I received from Jill Berry, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Manager" rel="nofollow">
          General Manager
         </a>
         of The

          Bell Shakespeare
         </a>
         Company. She said, ‘Bell Shakespeare in particular will enjoy an increase of approximately 65 per cent on our base Nugent funding model.’ The entire industry will be greatly buoyed by this announcement, and the many other visionary arts funding decisions in the budget papers—probably the most significant of them being the decision to invest in the small to medium arts sector.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is something of an urban myth that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Labor Party
         </a>
         attracts a greater level of support from the arts sector than does the government. It is not so. I was told, for example, by one of the most respected and senior arts administrators in Australia that the funding of the arts under this government has been, to use his words, ‘incomparably better’ than it ever was under the Labor government and that this government has, again to quote his words, been ‘incredibly generous’ to the sector. That is a view that is echoed across the sector. If perhaps Senator Adams would ask me a supplementary question, I will share some further insights with her.
