        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Abetz. Will the government provide bipartisan support for Australia's Future Submarine project, our largest ever Defence procurement project, and promise to build, maintain and sustain our new submarine fleet in Australia, or is the government still set on delivering the Prime Minister's captain's pick to have our submarines built in Japan?

         I was surprised to learn today of the announcement by the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Defence spokesman in relation to Labor's plan, during which time I noted that the Leader of the Opposition boldly claimed that no-one was calling for an open tender in relation to this particular project, despite—

           Exactly. No-one was, despite the fact—and he has now just admitted it—that the shadow minister himself had called for an open tender not once, not twice but three times. So the Labor Party comes to this having done nothing on the submarine program for six years whilst in office. They now want a process which would take another five years before we come to a landing in relation to this issue.

It is a point of order on direct relevance to the question asked.

               What I had just done was contextualise the situation, bringing us up to date with where we are now. The government's position is very clear: the safety and security of our citizens has to be the No. 1 priority. So the government is determined to get the best submarine capability available and the best value for money for taxpayers through a competitive evaluation process. We are not going to prejudge what that is, and what the Labor Party is saying is: 'We don't care what the Defence capacity is. We don't care what the cost is.'

                      , I ask a supplementary question. Will the government provide bipartisan support for a proper competitive tender process with a funded definition study to ensure that Australia secures a future submarine fleet that meets Australia's Defence requirements at the most competitive price for taxpayers, or is the government still committed to your sham evaluation process designed only to deliver the Prime Minister's captain's pick, which your entire

                       Just as the shadow minister just then went way over time with his question, so Labor went way over time in putting pencil to paper. It took them six years of not even getting pencil to paper for the submarine program. Let that not be forgotten. Now the shadow minister has the audacity to come into this place and say, 'Please join us in a bipartisan manner,' when for six years you had misled the Australian people about where you had got to with the submarine program.

                          Absolutely nowhere did they get with their submarine program in six years, despite media release after media release. Now they say, 'Trust us and join us in a bipartisan approach.' Your actions speak louder than your words—or should I say your inactions speak a lot louder than your words.

                           , I ask a further supplementary question. Will the government provide bipartisan support for Sweden to join Japan, Germany and France in the procurement process so that the most capable submarine designers are all competing for the work, or is the government still committed to excluding this experienced builder so that the Prime Minister can deliver his captain's pick to Japan? It is your government that promised to build 12 submarines in Adelaide before the last election.

                            Once again, Senator Conroy is overtime, exactly like Labor did with the submarine program. They have no understanding of time limits and the need to get this project underway as soon as possible. We have already indicated our attitude in relation to Sweden, and it really does seem interesting, does it not, that any mention of Japan is met with howls of derision. Yet they seem to champion the cause of Sweden. One wonders why they have this approach of 'Japan bad; Sweden good.' I wonder what might motivate that sort of attitude. It does not reflect well on the
