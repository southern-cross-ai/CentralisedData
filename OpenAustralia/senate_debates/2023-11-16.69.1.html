       <p>
        In the 12 months to September this year, there have been 33 Tasmanian families whose lives have been shattered by road fatality. Those 33 families will spend this festive season without loved ones because of the horrific reality of road trauma deaths. Nationally, that figure is 1,240. Tasmanians rely heavily on the road network. Driving is second nature, but despite an increase in driver education our road toll remains stubbornly high.
       </p>
       <p>
        Road trauma impacts everyone. The emotional toll radiates out from the victims' families and the first responders and ripples out into communities. With a son and daughter-in-law both involved as first responders, I've seen firsthand the impact that attending a serious crash or fatality has on them and their colleagues. The community impact is also evident, with an outpouring of grief often experienced, as seen recently with the shocking tragedies at Daylesford and Ashcroft.
       </p>
       <p>
        As tragic as they are, road fatalities serve as a stark reminder that we all need to be serious about road safety. Crashes can occur for many reasons, so it is important that we have the opportunity to analyse the events around them and use that learning to reduce further risk, not just for now but for future generations. That's why I support the Australian Automobile Association's Data Saves Lives campaign, calling on the Albanese Labor government to deliver on their promises made in 2022 to improve timely release of road crash data. Data is an incredible tool that can help us understand the why of a fatality or serious crash, particularly in relation to road quality and crash causation. It can help pinpoint locations that may need upgrades and help to identify crash hotspots or highlight areas previously overlooked. Data driven decisions ensure communities who need funding get funding, and it improves transparency, which is critically important. I call on the Albanese government to honour your commitment to work with the states and territories and ensure data driven decisions are central to your negotiations for the national partnership agreement on land transport infrastructure projects due next year.
