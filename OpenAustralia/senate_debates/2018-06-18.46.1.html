        My question is to the Minister for Finance, Senator Cormann. The Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance have repeatedly refused to be up-front about the cost of the government's personal income tax plan. Will the government finally tell the parliament the year-by-year cost of each element of its personal income tax plan? Why is the Turnbull government willing to spend taxpayer money to undermine the independent Parliamentary Budget Office costings of Labor's policies, but not be up-front about the costings of its own?

         The government has released all of the appropriate information and more, and let me just correct what Senator Keneally just said. This is a saving, a major saving, for working families around Australia. We on this side of the chamber want to help working families get ahead. We are providing income tax relief to provide cost-of-living-pressure relief for low- and middle-income earners but, of course, we want to ensure that we address bracket creep right across the board. We want to ensure that all Australians, all working Australians, have the right incentive, the right encouragement and the right reward for effort, because we understand that bracket creep is a drag on economic growth. If the economy grows more slowly, you know who is the first to hurt the most? Low-income earners. A stronger economy is good for low-income earners because it means they get better opportunities to get aheadâ€”to get a job, to get a well-paid job, to get a better-paid job and continue to get ahead.
        </p>

         The Labor Party doesn't understand this. The Labor Party under

           The point of order is that the minister is failing to respond to the question. The question is not what he thinks the Labor Party does or does not understand. The question is again quite clear: will the Turnbull government finally tell the parliament the year-by-year cost of each element of its Personal Income Tax Plan? It's not, 'What do you think is appropriate, Minister?'

            Senator Collins, there were other elements to that. That was one element of the question. I caught Senator Cormann's answer to part of the question upon his commencing his answer, and he is continuing to present material that's relevant to it.

             We on this side of the chamber stand for encouraging the Australian people so that they have the best possible opportunity to get ahead. We stand for more investment, stronger growth, more jobs and higher wages. Those on that side of the chamber stand for a socialist agenda that will make all Australians poorer. You stand for an antibusiness, anti-opportunity, socialist, politics-of-envy agenda that will leave all Australians worse off; that will lead to less investment, lower growth, fewer jobs, higher unemployment and lower wages. That is going to be the choice for the Australian people at the next election: do they want more jobs and higher wages or fewer jobs, higher unemployment and lower wages under

                      The point of order is direct relevance. The minister was asked why the crossbench should not be provided with the full information as to the impact of all three stages of the government's income tax plan and what the government has to hide. He's now answering about Labor's policy. How is that directly relevant?

But I also note that the second part of the question, the final words, are rather open ended, and that is easier to be directly relevant to than a specific request for information.

                            Let me be very direct: the government has nothing to hide. The government is very proud of its $144 billion worth of personal income tax relief for hardworking families around Australia, prioritising low- and middle-income earners, but providing bracket-creep relief for all working Australians. We're certainly very keen to ensure that the crossbench understands that the Labor Party wants taxes on hardworking families to be $70 billion higher. You want to put your hand into the pockets of hardworking families and take more of that money for yourself? Let me tell you: if you ever get back into government, Labor is actually not that good at spending it. Labor, in government, is not that good at spending people's money. We want the Australian people to have more of their own money.
