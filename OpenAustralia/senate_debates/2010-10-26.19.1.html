        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Senator Conroy. When was the government first advised by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority that it believed the Water Act did not allow it to fully and equally balance environmental, economic and social objectives?

         I thank Senator Birmingham for the question. As the senator could imagine, I would have to provide the exact answer to that very detailed question on notice. I will seek what information I can from Minister Burke and provide that to Senator Birmingham at the earliest opportunity.

I ask the minister: had Mr Taylor also earlier advised Minister Wong of this fact and, regardless of that, why did the government wait until the wave of public outrage to get legal advice clarifying the authority’s interpretation of the Water Act when it was advised of this problem before the guide was released?

             No, you have asked for a date. Let us be very clear: if you are going to ask for a specific date then I am obviously not going to have that information to hand as I am not the minister. But I will happily seek the information you have asked for and get back to you.

              , I ask a further supplementary question. I highlight the last part of the first supplementary question, which asked why the government allowed the guide to be released when it knew the authority had conflicting legal advice to what the government thought the objectives of the act were. I also ask the minister: how can the government expect communities to have confidence in its management of this challenging reform agenda when it is unable to deliver promised water-saving infrastructure projects, unable to produce complete socioeconomic analysis of reforms and unwilling to go out and address community meetings and the government itself was unable to ensure—

               The hypocrisy from Senator Birmingham and those opposite is staggering. This is a piece of legislation that began while they were in government, was passed while they were in government and was amended by our government with their full support. This is legislation that they signed up to, that they voted for, that they created. They created this legislation; every single word of it is theirs.

                     , I rise on a point of order: unparliamentary language. Can you ask him to withdraw that?

                       . Thank you. But let us be clear about this: the National Party have rolled over so far they do not know which way they are facing.
