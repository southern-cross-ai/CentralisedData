        I rise tonight to speak in the adjournment debate about the increase in homophobic and transphobic sentiment in this place and in the national debate, perhaps more disgracefully the harmful attitudes expressed that have been aimed at children. Last week we heard much in this place about the school program provided by the Safe Schools Coalition. It is a program designed to address the shocking discrimination and bullying against young people who are same-sex attracted and gender diverse. I spoke at that time on the appalling decision to review the program that makes schools safer for same-sex attracted and gender diverse young people. At that time I said it was not simply a matter of the government being out of step but a matter of the government perpetrating dangerous views that have the potential to have devastating impacts on the lives of young

        </a>
        Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have also heard from the service provider, Drummond Street Services, that they have seen a doubling in demand for support from anxious and distressed young people in the wake of the debate about the safe school program and the same-sex marriage plebiscite. But it seems that my messages and the message from many eminent Australians has been lost on the ultraconservative. Today we heard that the former Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, has put his support behind Senator Bernardi's campaign and called for funding of the safe schools program to be axed. In arguing to have the program's funding terminated, Mr Abbott is reported to have said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It's not an anti-bullying program, it's a social engineering program.
       </p>
       <p>
        While the debate on the safe schools program has been distressing, it is my fear that this is just the start of what we can expect from the campaign against marriage equality during the plebiscite. This point was echoed by

        that is headed up 'Gay marriage would lead to drug use and disease, pamphlets say'. A former Liberal MP has generated this pamphlet, claiming that same-sex parents are more prone to sexually transmitted disease, unemployment and drug abuse. It was in

        , who had a copy of the pamphlet. Apparently, the pamphlet was funded by the one-time minister of the Howard government,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Miles" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . The pamphlet is entitled 'You have a choice: National vote: Same sex mirage: Have your say', promoting a no vote ahead of the proposed marriage plebiscite.
       </p>
       <p>
        For those who may not know, Chris Miles was a member for the seat of Braddon in my home state of Tasmania. Mr Miles's pamphlet also claims that 'married biological parents have a better record for providing safety and development of healthy, well-adjusted adult children'. Speaking to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairfax_Media" rel="nofollow">
         Fairfax Media

        , Mr Miles says he 'may print millions of copies in the lead up to the vote'. He says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If we are going to have a plebiscite, people need to be informed …

        These will be distributed throughout Australia at the grass roots.
       </p>
       <p>
        Marriage equality proponents have condemned the pamphlet, as all well-meaning and good people would, in my view. You would condemn a pamphlet that is designed to be damaging and divisive on marriage equality. This is something that has been put together for the debate on a marriage quality plebiscite.

        says this is just the start, and this is what has been feared about the government's decision to continue with a plebiscite. This is exactly what was feared: that this debate would turn into a debate that vilified same-sex attracted people, and this is exactly what it is. This disgraceful pamphlet is just the tip of the iceberg of what will come. We have Rodney Croome, who said that this is the start, and we know that it is the start, of anti-gay misinformation campaigns Australians will have to endure if the government goes ahead with a plebiscite. Mr Croome has said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia can avoid a damaging plebiscite campaign, and we could have marriage equality by mid year, if parliament is simply allowed to do its job and has a free vote …

        He goes on to say:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Not only is the information on this flyer wrong, it will put the lives of young gay people and the children of same-sex couples at risk by reinforcing the message that they and their families are broken.
       </p>
       <p>
        In parliament, Labor and the Greens continue to call for a free vote instead of having a very expensive plebiscite, a plebiscite that will cause damage. Mr Miles's pamphlet shows that is exactly what we are on a path to do if the government—

        It is true, Senator. Mr Miles's pamphlet shows the damage that will be done to same-sex couples and their children and their families in a debate if we continue on the path to a plebiscite. It is a harmful debate. We have all talked about the potential of it, and we have now seen the potential of a debate like this to really have very negative and distressing impacts on young LGBTI people and their families.

        </a>
        spokesman on this issue, Senator Simms, says, 'This flyer is the latest example of this ugly campaign against equality'—and he is right—and many in the Senate and in the House of Representatives would agree with that. During the last week, we have seen a tsunami of vile homophobia fanned by people like Senator Bernardi and Mr George Christensen. That is a quote directly from Senator Simms, and I absolutely agree with what he has to say. It is clear that the ultraconservative extremists are planning an ugly hate campaign levelled at the LGBTI community, and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is sitting back and letting it happen. But he does not have to. He can stop this plebiscite. It is a plebiscite that is not needed, a plebiscite that is there just to appease the ultraconservatives is in his caucus. The parliament has the authority to make a decision on this issue. All we need to see is some leadership from Mr Turnbull where he agrees to give his caucus a free vote. Let's just get on with it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Senator Simms also went on to say that the Greens were also concerned about the impact that this kind of hurtful campaign might have on young people in particular. I could not agree more, and I really just do not understand how the coalition can sit back and allow this sort of propaganda to come out in this way. This propaganda is designed for the plebiscite. We do not need a plebiscite. We have the power. We need to get on with it.
