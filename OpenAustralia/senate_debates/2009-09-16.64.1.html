        My question to the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Economy" rel="nofollow">
         Digital Economy
        </a>
        relates to the government’s proposed mandatory net censorship scheme. Can the minister confirm for us whether the trial results are in, whether he is still planning on releasing to the Australian public the trial results in full and whether his reliance on a small, self-selected group of internet users to trial a mass-deployed compulsory filter qualifies as evidence based policy?

         I thank Senator Ludlam for his question. The live pilot trial into
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISP" rel="nofollow">
          ISP
         </a>
         level filtering has recently been completed. The report has not yet been finalised but I have undertaken—and I repeat that commitment—to release it in due course. In the meantime, the existing laws introduced by the Howard government remain in place and, I assume, still have the support of those opposite. Labor took a comprehensive cyber safety policy to the 2007 election. The internet is the most powerful platform for information and entertainment we have known. However, it also has potential dangers. That is why the Rudd government, in the 2008-09 budget, committed $125.8 million towards our cyber safety plan. This included funding for education, law enforcement and the establishment of a youth advisory group—people aged between 11 and 17 years—to help develop our policy.

            . My point of order went to relevance. The minister was busy entertaining the chamber with information which was completely irrelevant to the point of my question. I asked for information about the mandatory net censorship proposal and the minister’s reliance on this evidence in rolling out mandatory net censorship around Australia.

              . I did recently see a comment from a university professor who knows nothing about actual internet filtering, which I think is the basis on which you are seeking to ask your question about whether or not the basis of the test was valid. I think it was dealt with quite comprehensively by the company that was doing the testing, Senator Ludlam. I think that if you go back and check the clippings, you will find that the criticism made of the validity of the statistical—

                Thank you for that supplementary question, Senator Ludlam. Yes, as I indicated at estimates, I have been in discussion with some in the industry about an enhanced practical measure to ensure that there is confidence that a government minister, or a government bureaucrat, is not the sole arbiter. There have been a number of options floated. As I said at estimates, one option is that the Classification Board may consider all of the possible items for classification. I am considering another option in which an industry based body, together with the government agency involved, could go through and examine material. Another option is a parliamentary committee, which would then undertake the classification process. So there are a number of options that the government is genuinely considering.
