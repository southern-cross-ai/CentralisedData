        I rise today to advocate for sharpening public awareness and visibility of, and action on, Australia's early learning, primary and secondary education policy and practice. I continue to spend a great deal of my time digesting front-line practicalities, collating parent and teacher feedback and professional research conclusions. I am disturbed on several levels by our findings, and will cite here a selection of examples of the challenges that we not only face but should long have known and that it seems we are still not addressing.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will start with the observation that Australia is far too captive to the destructive effect of the political election cycle. Expensive research and development projects, frequently costing millions of dollars, proposed by a government of one political disposition are abandoned in a dismissive manner by a new government of the other mainstream party. Cost does not seem to matter, except to the unfortunate taxpayer. There are several major instances where this persists, but for now let me settle on the Gonski review.
       </p>
       <p>
        Published in 2011, this comprises 319 pages. I repeat: 319 pages. The size of the report is indicative of the volume of work undertaken. Many experts have taken the opportunity to critique Gonski. Regardless of one's political persuasion, it must be acknowledged that the review does contain some observations and conclusions deserving of respect for their intellectual quality. This is too complex an environment to allow for a simplified endorsement or rejection, especially within the limitations of this adjournment speech. In particular, I have paid attention to matters of equity, to the ongoing impact of educational disadvantage and to Australia's justifiable concern about the risk arising from socially biased policy and the prospect of a growing underclass as a consequence of young people growing up without positive, socially mixed exposure in their formative years.
       </p>
       <p>
        How is it that such a significant investment—remember that word, 'investment'—in a studious examination of our school system funding policy and practice can be so completely disregarded and dismissed as being without any redeeming features? I ask, with the degree of urgency that is so lacking in Australia right now: is every topic heading, funding issue discussion or recommendation in the Gonski report seriously without value? Further, how does this apparent inertia square with the feeling among professional educators, teachers and parents that investment in our early learning through primary and secondary education is adrift?

        Earlier this year, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Council
        </a>
        for Educational Research published
        <i>
         Imperatives in schools funding
        </i>
        . This is a thoughtful and thought-provoking document worthy of priority attention. It is by no means the exclusive source of value. But when I consider the high volume of related matters being digested in my office, especially under our research and innovation banner, it adds weight to the argument that we do not have the luxury of time if we are to hold our own in educational rankings in the medium- to long-term globally competitive environment. On page 62, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACER" rel="nofollow">
         ACER
        </a>
        paper employs the subheading 'A funding scheme at war with itself'. For me, that epitomises Australia's great hindrance to our own progress in the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course, the devil is in the detail, but that does not mean we should ignore pressing issues or pretend that they are not urgent. Getting this right is very urgent. I will cite here one article from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conversation" rel="nofollow">
         The Conversation
        </a>
        in March 2015, because it accords with the continuing academic and practical research findings of my office:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Six ways Australia's education system is failing our kids
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        1. Australian teens are falling behind, as others race ahead.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        2. Declining participation in science and maths.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        3. Australian education is monolingual.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        4. International and migrant students are actually raising standards, not lowering them.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        5. You can't have quality education without quality teachers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        6. Early learning participation is amongst the lowest in the developed world.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is extraordinary to note that federal funding for private schools is disproportionately increasing while public school funding will be indexed to inflation from 2017. This is a time when our priorities should be clear and shared across party lines. We should invest in creating an equitable education system, an inclusive start in life for our young generations across the socioeconomic talent and skills spectrum; and avoid the growth of an underclass with all the negative implications that flow with segregated modes of schooling. What we do now creates a legacy. If in our school education system we fail to actively and sincerely honour the Australian mantra of giving everyone 'a fair go', there will be an unaffordable price to pay in a few years time.
