         What I can confirm for the Senate is the following. As you would be aware,

           A point of order on relevance. The minister is quoting figures about grants. My question was about loans. In fact, I have only asked something that the Prime Minister confirmed yesterday. She should be on top of this.

I am listening carefully, because it was a specific question. Senator Cash.

               Yes, on direct relevance. We only asked about the confirmation of one concessional loan across the country for small business. We asked the minister to confirm and, as Senator Watt, I think courteously, indicated, it is the figure the Prime Minister confirmed yesterday.

                On the point of direct relevance: the minister can be directly relevant to the question by talking about the concessional loans scheme and its administration, as she was earlier. But I do take the point that the grant scheme was not in the question. I remind senators that I cannot instruct a minister how to answer the question. Senator Cash.

                    I grant some latitude to people restating the question. My previous ruling was that the minister can be directly relevant by talking about the specific scheme that you referenced. You are seeking to order me how to direct a minister to answer a question, which is not appropriate for me to do. There is an opportunity after question time to debate the merits of answers.

                       I refer to the Prime Minister's media release of 20 January that assured struggling small businesses in bushfire affected regions that government support would be 'immediate'. Does the minister seriously suggest that only one bushfire affected small business was in immediate need of assistance?

                        The bushfires that we have seen over the summer have been absolutely devastating, in particular for those who have been directly impacted by the fires and for those who have also been indirectly impacted by the fires. The government has announced a comprehensive package, a $2 billion response package, to assist those in need as a result of the devastation of the bushfires.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        You see, those on the other side don't seem to understand this: the only reason that this government has been able to respond so quickly with so many different measures, and to the extent that it has been able to, $2 billion, is because it manages a strong economy.
