        With reference to the Tax Studies Institute announced in October 2011 as an outcome of the Tax Forum, and for which $3 million of funding over 3 years from 2012-13 was announced in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook 2011-2012:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) Given the reference made in the 2012-13 Budget document Tax Reform Road Map of the intention to establish a Tax Studies Institute in 2012, is the Government still committed to the Tax Studies Institute.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) What reasons are there to explain the delay in establishing the Tax Studies Institute.
       </p>

         The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) Yes.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2)
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
          The Government
         </a>
         is considering the best way of establishing and structuring the Institute, including the design of its governance arrangements.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) See answer to Question (2). In the 2011-12 MYEFO, the Government announced that it would provide $3 million over three years to establish the Tax Studies Institute.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Institute" rel="nofollow">
          The Institute
         </a>
         will also have deductible gift recipient status.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) Treasury officers have consulted a range of interested parties, including academics, industry, tax practitioners and state government representatives. A number of options and models for the Institute were discussed. We are still receiving feedback from stakeholders. The Government is factoring this input into its consideration of the issue.
