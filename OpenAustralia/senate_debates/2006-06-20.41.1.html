        I have some further information for Senator Nettle which may be of interest in relation to her question to me today. I do not have it in a form that I can give to her, but I seek leave to read it into

        .

        Senator, two attempts were made on 27 and 28 May to contact the family at the Royal Children’s Hospital by persons claiming to be from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International" rel="nofollow">
         Amnesty International
        </a>
        . Ward staff did not provide any information, and reported the inquiry to the hospital security. Security staff searched the area but were unable to locate the persons. Following discussions between DIMA and the security manager, it was agreed that the hospital would provide an additional officer at the entrance to the particular ward as well as outside the patient’s room. At around six o’clock on 28 May, the security manager advised that two males had approached the ward and identified themselves as being from Amnesty International seeking the Afghan family with the sick child. The persons were denied access to the ward. The RCH acting director contacted DIMA later that night, concerned about the disruption to staff, patients and parents such incidents would have. He contacted treating doctors regarding ongoing treatment options and it was suggested that, subject to medical advice, discharge and treatment as an outpatient might be considered.
       </p>

        On 1 June, Amnesty International provided their position on the Afghan case via email to the department. The content of the email as I have been given it—there may be a further part to the email—is as follows: ‘Last weekend, an employee of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Amnesty International Australia
        </a>
        visited the Royal Children’s Hospital in Brisbane, accompanying a member of the Afghan community in Brisbane. The visit was not an authorised official representation on behalf of Amnesty International Australia. Amnesty International Australia is not commenting further on the case due to the need to protect the claims for asylum and the security of the individuals concerned. Amnesty International Australia is in liaison with the department of immigration and relaying any concerns held through the appropriate channels. I would appreciate if you would convey this to,’—an official in the department who is then mentioned—‘and to’—my office.
       </p>
       <p>
        Senator, my answer to you stands. I am advised that the family had declined visitors. I have no advice in relation to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Cross" rel="nofollow">
         Red Cross
        </a>
        but I do have that advice in relation to Amnesty. It is possible that you have been given some information about someone being denied a visit. That is why I thought it was appropriate to give you that information plus what Amnesty International have said to us about the person alleging to be there on behalf of Amnesty.

          I should put on the record that I have asked for a check to be made to see whether this is the only such incident and, in particular, whether there is anything in relation to
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Cross" rel="nofollow">
           Red Cross
          </a>
          as well. The same may be the case.
