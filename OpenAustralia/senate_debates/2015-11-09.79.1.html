         I thank Senator McKenzie for her question and for her strong and ongoing interest in education and training matters, particularly in relation to vocational education and training. The government does have a comprehensive agenda for reforming vocational education and training. It is incredibly important to this government for two prime reasons.

           Firstly, around three million Australians participate in vocational education and training annually—around double the number in our university sector. It is crucial to ensure that those students get the highest quality of training available. Secondly, because our vocational education and training sector provides the type of skills mix necessary for an innovative and agile economy, I say to those opposite that our vocational education and training sector is a critical complement to our university sector and to our overall skills and training mix. That is why, since coming to government, we have made sure that the investment is available—a record sum of around $6 billion in different funding streams that flow from the Commonwealth to vocational education and training this year. It is why we have made sure that we have strengthened and enhanced the link between employers and the operation of the vocational education and training system. It is incredibly important that training is structured in a way to give employers the types of employees with skills that are relevant to the needs of their workplace, and to make sure that, of course, the

           </a>
           system does what it is designed to do—that is, to train people for real jobs that really exist.
          </p>
          <p>
           We have enhanced the opportunity and support, especially for apprentices, in providing the trade support loans, which are now supporting more than 16,000 apprentices with additional assistance to help them complete their apprenticeship. In doing so, we have enhanced support overall for apprenticeship arrangements to make sure there is support for completion of apprenticeships and to drive up the unacceptably low completion rates that have historically existed.

                    Why is Labor being so neglectful in terms of coming up with any ideas as to how to address this? This, of course, has been a serious problem which this government has taken seriously and enacted changes to fix.

Well, Senator Wong, you do not seem to want to take any responsibility that, as the finance minister of the previous government, you put in place an arrangement that has seen billions of dollars going out the door without getting good completion rates and without getting real training. That is why we have been implementing these reforms,

                            This government took quick action, because new standards applied from 1 January this year. Further conditions were applied from 1 April this year to ensure inducements were banned. Further actions are being put in place from July this year and again from January next year, all of which have been developed to fix up a mess created by those opposite, to ensure we deal with that legacy problem and to make sure training in future is for students who want genuine training outcomes.
