        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister Reynolds. On 5 February 2020 the Prime Minister announced that the Australian government would establish the new
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Commissioner" rel="nofollow">
         National Commissioner
        </a>
        for Defence and Veteran Suicide Prevention to inquire into suicides of serving and former ADF members. Part of this announcement was the appointment of an interim commissioner to commence a review of known current and former defence personnel suicides dating back to 2001. My question to the minister is: who is the interim commissioner?

         I thank Senator Lambie for her question. I can confirm for Senator Lambie and the Senate that legislation will shortly be introduced by the Attorney-General to set up the office of the permanent commissioner. As I said, the interim commissioner will be appointed shortly to implement that work, so—

        <p>
         Senator Lambie, would you like me to finish? What I can confirm is that, once appointed by the Attorney-General, the national commissioner will work to identify and undertake the factors and the systemic issues that may contribute to suicide risk amongst serving and former members. They will have all of the powers of a royal commissioner. The government has been acting on this and, as I said, the Attorney-General will be introducing legislation shortly to set up this position.

           As part of the 5 February announcement, the Prime Minister, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and you all said that an interim commissioner would immediately commence a review of historical suicides and report within 12 months. Did that review commence immediately as promised?

            As I've said, we got the legislation underway to set up the permanent commissioner this week. As part of that process, we will still be appointing an interim commissioner, and the Attorney-General is in the process at the moment of going through a short list for the interim commissioner to undertake the work as discussed.

              If you say something is ready to go immediately—your words, not mine—how can it possibly be delayed? Either it's ready to go or it isn't. Was it ready to go in February and, if not, why did you claim it was?

               As I announced in February, we did say that we would bring forward this office of the commissioner, which would have the powers of a royal commission, and we would establish an interim commissioner. As I've said, the Attorney-General currently has a short list of applicants for that interim process. But I would also note that we did say that we would appoint a Veteran Family Advocate, and, in fact, we have done so, with an outstanding person, Ms Gwen Cherne, being appointed by the Governor-General as the Veteran Family Advocate. We have actually implemented that, and we will shortly be announcing the interim commissioner.
              </p>
              <p>
               We are delivering on exactly what we promised to deliver. We have the legislation in train, we have in train the appointment of the interim commissioner, and we have appointed an outstanding Veteran Family Advocate. This government is delivering exactly what we said we would, Senator Lambie.
