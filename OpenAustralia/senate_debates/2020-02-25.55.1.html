             <p>
              I thank fellow regional senator, Senator Davey, for her question. We both know that people living in rural and regional communities know that drought is not like fire or flood. It doesn't just occur; it creeps up slowly. But when it actually takes effect, it has a massive effect on our regional communities. As you rightly point out, we've had some great rain, and obviously we want more. But it hasn't been enough to break the drought. We're going to need an awful lot more rain, and it's going to be long time, even after those rains, before our rural and regional communities are going to recover.
             </p>
             <p>
              Despite the rain, 98.8 per cent of rural and regional
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
               New South Wales
              </a>
              , your home state, is in drought, with 22 per cent classified as being in intense drought. The Australian government is absolutely committed to assisting our rural and regional communities through this terrible drought, with over $8 billion now having been put into recovery actions and initiatives. Just last week the government extended its Drought Community Support Initiative, with another $82.75 million of continued funding to assist households that are battling this terrible, terrible drought, on top of the commitments that have already gone out the door—$180 million—and in New South Wales alone that's $36 million that's been invested in eligible household support.
             </p>
             <p>
              Since May last year the government has rolled out more than $1 billion in grants and payments to support our regional communities. We've announced the appointment of the drought coordinator,
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Stone" rel="nofollow">
               Shane Stone
              </a>
              , to make sure we work with our states and territories, because it's really important that we work together so that we play an important role of coordination and collaboration and make sure we get the very best out of every dollar that's been invested so that we are targeting our farmers and their communities so that they receive the support they need. It remains a key priority of this government.

                 There are a range of measures available to farmers who are struggling with drought. Recognising that there is no one-size-fits-all model here, we need work individually with farmers and their communities to make sure that we are targeting and putting the right and appropriate drought supports in place for our farmers. As an example, one of the most important measures has been the farm household allowance. It's a safety net, and it's there to make sure that our farmers have the dignity and the respect that they deserve during these tough times and to make sure farming families can put food on the table. Also, in response to our significant drought conditions last year, we changed the existing drought loans eligibility and criteria through the Regional Investment Corporation to make sure that we could get money to farmers that was interest free over the next two years so that they would not be burdened with the interest. We continue to invest in our farming communities because we know they need our help.
