        , Senator Conroy! Was the decision to embark on a $43 billion fibre-to-the-home national broadband network an example of the 'contempt for the cabinet process' the minister recently said was endemic in the Rudd Labor government and the 'dysfunctional decision-making' that the Treasurer recently said marked the Rudd era?

         I thank Senator Birmingham for his ongoing interest, albeit extremely superficial. Let me be very clear about this. I have answered questions like this before at some considerable length so I am happy to repeat them. The popularisation, by those opposite, that this was done on the back of an envelope on a plane could not be more wrong. It could not be more wrong.

           Yes, the early discussions took place with Mr Rudd on a plane, as has been reported. But what is ignored by every one of those opposite is that there was then three months of extensive cabinet committee process.

             Three months. I lost count of—I could not even tell you off the top of my head—how many committee meetings we went to and how many times we discussed it. I lost count of the number of meetings. For those opposite to continue to perpetuate this myth just shows you how lazy they are and how they have no alternative policy.
            </p>
            <p>
             We then commissioned the McKinsey report—$25 million—to demonstrate that the

             could be a viable proposition. We then considered the McKinsey report at length and released it. This was a program that went through extensive consultation, extensive research and extensive reports to ensure that we got it right. Those opposite continue to cry crocodile tears for process when they do not have a policy. Mr Turnbull spoke six months ago—

                   One of the problems you get when you let Senator Birmingham write his own questions on the run is that he actually then begins to verbal the minister across the chamber. He completely misrepresented my answer. He has completely tried to conflate two different statements and claim they are contradictory. Senator Birmingham should stick to doing what he is good at—detailed policy work.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   You should not be trying to make up questions on the run, because you are just not any good at it. Stick to the detailed policy work in estimates, which you are pretty good at. You are much better than some of these clowns here. Some day you will get on the front bench and you will get a chance to have your own policy area.

                         I thank the senator for her question. The small business sector got some very exciting news last week when it comes to the
                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network" rel="nofollow">
                          National Broadband Network
                         </a>
                         . I am happy to advise the Senate that on Tuesday, 7 February Optus released its
                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
                          NBN
                         </a>
                         business plans for the small to medium enterprise sector. Optus's small business plans are going to provide
                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SME" rel="nofollow">
                          SME
                         </a>
                         s with a vastly superior product offering because they will be delivered over the NBN. Optus are also offering additional web based programs to assist SMEs get on line that are not included in their current
                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADSL" rel="nofollow">
                          ADSL
                         </a>
                         plans. In Optus's business entry level plan, they are even providing double the download data from 50 gigabits to 100 gigabits when compared to their equivalent ADSL product—all delivered over a fibre network, significantly increasing the experience of business in speed and quality of service.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Despite the ongoing scare campaigns waged by the opposition—specifically the members for Bradfield and Wentworth—that the NBN would increase the cost of broadband for families and businesses, Optus's business plans are priced the same as their existing broadband prices over copper. That is right,
                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
                          Mr President
                         </a>
                         —the same. They first claimed residential prices would be unaffordable, and that has been proven to be false, and now the business plans released by Optus confirm the opposition has no credibility whatsoever—none when it comes to NBN pricing. You at least understood that, Senator Birmingham, and you did not make a goose of yourself. This is a very exciting time to be a small business broadband customer in Australia.

                           Again, I thank the senator for her question. Earlier today, Telstra launched their pricing and product services over the

                           </a>
                           . Telstra will offer a range of plans on the NBN's 25- and 100-megabit speed tiers with prices that, once again, are comparable to those Telstra offers today on their copper and

                           networks but with significant increases in speeds and quality of service. It is clear from Telstra's plans that they have confidence in the growing Australian demand for higher speeds and capacity. This demonstrates that the Australian telecommunications market recognises the reality that the coalition still refuses to acknowledge—that Australians require and deserve better quality broadband to help them engage with the digital economy.

                             This means that for the first time businesses in rural and regional Australia will no longer be at a competitive disadvantage with their counterparts in metropolitan areas. The tyranny of distance will no longer be a barrier to running a successful business in regional and rural Australia. The

                             will allow families to access infrastructure at an equivalency of price and an equivalency of service.

                             But what do those opposite think we ought to do? They want to demolish the NBN, dig it up and abolish the uniform wholesale pricing that underpins price parity. Under the Liberals' plans, businesses and families across regional and rural Australia will end up paying more and getting less—paying more and getting less under your plans. There has been a lot of talk about leadership recently. It is about time the National Party started showing some on behalf of regional Australians.
