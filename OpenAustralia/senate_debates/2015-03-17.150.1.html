        I would like to take the opportunity to thank the people of Australia for their support. I have created a petition on www.change.org to secure the help of the people of Australia to call on the Abbott government to establish a royal commission into the human impact of coal seam gas mining. The people of Australia are answering my call. The petition is growing every day. Already some 15,000 people have signed the petition.
       </p>
       <p>
       </p>
       <p>
        As I have stated in the Senate previously, I am deeply concerned about the human impact of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSG" rel="nofollow">
         CSG
        </a>
        mining and the desperation being felt by Australians affected by CSG mining. They feel that no-one is listening and no-one cares. I care, and I am determined to give the people of Australia a voice on this issue and to ensure that all levels of government, CSG mining companies and associated businesses are held to account for the damage which has and is being caused by CSG mining.
       </p>
       <p>
        It has to stop. I am not prepared to sit on my hands and turn a blind eye to this issue, like so many people in positions of power and authority appear to be doing. Something needs to be done and I am determined to see that this happens.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am not alone in my quest. Others around the country are also taking up the fight. A young man by the name of Dayne Pratzky is also emerging as a coal seam gas crusader. You may know him as the 'Frackman'. If you have not seen the film, I strongly suggest that you do. It tracks Dayne's personal journey as a property owner living a few hours west of Brisbane who has been affected by coal seam gas mining.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have visited rural and regional areas affected by CSG mining to see firsthand what type of effect it is having on our people and on the water, land and communities. What I saw upset me. CSG mining is one of the most contentious and environmentally and socially destructive forms of gas extraction known to the developed world. A massive 437 million hectares of Australia are now covered by CSG licences or applications. That is roughly twice the size of the state of Victoria.
       </p>
       <p>
        CSG mining involves drilling holes deep down into the earth to tap into methane gas trapped in coal seams by natural water pressure. While I support the resource sector and the value its role has in our society, we cannot and must not allow the health of our people to be compromised.
       </p>
       <p>
        Therefore, I am determined to support the people of Australia by calling on the government to establish a royal commission into the human impact of mining and, in particular, of CSG mining; to cease the approval of any further CSG mining projects until it is deemed safe; and to establish a resources ombudsman. An independent resources ombudsman will provide the people of Australia with a point of contact to resolve mining and CSG mining issues. The ombudsman will be an advocate for the people. It is about time the people of Australia had someone on their side.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my home state of Queensland, all levels of government have let the people of Queensland down. I cannot believe that this type of thing is happening in Australia, but it is. All Australians should be very concerned. Thankfully, the efforts of people power are starting to make a difference.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will continue to promote my petition and I strongly urge all Australians to take part. Once it is complete I will deliver it to the Abbott government and also present it to the Senate.
