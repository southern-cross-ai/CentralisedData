        My question is to Senator Brandis, the Minister representing the Prime Minister. Can the minister explain to Australians earning as little as $21,655 why they are facing a tax hike, while the government can still find a spare $50 billion for big business and give millionaires a tax cut of $16,000 a year?

         Thank you, Senator Gallagher, for giving me the opportunity to speak about a budget of which this government is extremely proud—a budget which is based on the principle of fairness, based on the principle of opportunity and based on the principle of ensuring that Australians have the security that they deserve.
        </p>
        <p>
         Before speaking about the budget in more detail, let me correct some of the false premises in Senator Gallagher's question. You speak of a tax hike, Senator. I assume that is an intended reference to the increase by half a per cent in two years time of the Medicare levy to fund the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
          NDIS
         </a>
         , a program that you left entirely unfunded. All the rhetoric in the world, Senator Gallagher, will not excuse you from the reality that you devised a system—a system, by the way, which the present government supported—but you made no provision to fund it. As is so often the case in Australian politics, it is the Labor Party that has got a monopoly on the rhetoric, but it is the coalition that actually has to find the money to fund the program.
        </p>
        <p>
         So what we have done is announce in the budget last night that in two years time we will ask Australians to pay an extra half a per cent on the Medicare levy in order that the NDIS may be funded. That is one of the aspects of the budget, Senator Gallagher, that we regard as a fairness measure. And, if you support the NDIS, as you claim to do, what is your problem with saying that the money should be found and put in a locked box to make sure it is properly funded?

            Another false premise. In fact, there is no such cut as you suggest, Senator Gallagher. There is, in fact, had you been listening to Senator Birmingham in question time yesterday, an increase in school funding over the next 10 years by $18.6 billion. But this is Labor Party economics. Senator Gallagher dreams up a pie-in-the-sky number for which there is no funding available, compares it to the government's number—an increase of $18.6 billion—for which there is funding, subtracts one from the other and says, 'That's a cut!' No, Senator Gallagher, it is an $18.6 billion increase in school funding—an increase, by the way, based on a methodology that puts fairness and needs-based funding at the centre of the system. That is an $18.6 billion increase

               Senator Gallagher, I am so pleased you keep asking me these questions about fairness, because I think most Australians would understand that it is fair that university students should not have to contribute even half of the cost of their degrees, and that there be a system—instituted, by the way, by a former Labor government, the Hawke Labor government—the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HECS" rel="nofollow">
                HECS
               </a>
               , whereby they get the most preferential low interest that they will ever see in their lives, with no obligation whatsoever to begin paying back that debt until they can afford to do so. As a result of the education they receive through that system, they will have a higher income and better life chances than all of the other taxpayers who are paying the majority of the cost of their education.

                <p>
                 I thank Senator Bushby for that question. The budget delivered by the Treasurer last night is our next instalment of our plan for stronger growth to deliver more and better-paid jobs. We are doing this by enshrining our Ten Year Enterprise Tax Plan right at the heart of the budget, delivering a more competitive business tax rate for all businesses across Australia. We are doing it through record investment in productivity-enhancing infrastructure—well over $70 billion worth of infrastructure investment, driving stronger growth and delivering more and better-paid jobs. Of course we are doing it by focusing on more export trade deals and by focusing on energy security, delivering affordable and reliable energy to businesses across Australia.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The budget the Treasurer delivered last night continues to chart a responsible course to a balanced budget within four years. Our budget surplus projected for 2021, consistent with the timetable we set out in our half-yearly budget update in 2015-16, just before Christmas in 2015, is a return to surplus in 2020-21 and now at $7.4 billion. Our responsible fiscal management and our responsible economic management have meant that we are in a position to protect Australia's
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAA" rel="nofollow">
                  AAA
                 </a>
                 credit rating, with Moody's already coming out confirming that the policy settings of this government in our budget are consistent with those of a AAA rated economy.
                </p>
                <p>
                 This budget provides incentives for businesses across Australia to employ more Australians. We had a previous question sneering at our business tax cuts and sneering at the additional investment that we want to attract into the Australian economy so that businesses across Australia can have the opportunity to be more successful and more profitable so that they can hire more Australians and pay better wages.

                    I thank Senator Bushby for that question. As I indicated in the answer to the primary question, the government are investing well over $70 billion in productivity-enhancing infrastructure in this budget, creating tens of thousands of new jobs during construction on productive projects across the country. This includes the Inland Rail project from Melbourne to Brisbane. It includes the building of the

                    , and I know that Senator Xenophon is going to be interested in having a conversation in relation to that. It includes a $10 billion national rail program—new money which state governments across Australia who want to participate with the federal government can actually invest—

                       As well as delivering our plan for stronger growth and more jobs, this government are guaranteeing the essential services Australians rely on in health, education, disability support and national security. Of course, one of the challenges that we faced on coming to government was the fact that the National Disability Insurance Scheme, which enjoys broad bipartisan support, was not fully funded. We were facing a $56 billion funding gap over the next decade—a $56 billion funding gap. Of course, those opposite appear to be in the know in relation to this.

                        My question is to the minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Brandis. In February this year, when asked when he could rule out a tax increase in the budget, Prime Minister Turnbull said:
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        We have no plans to increase tax—indeed, all of our plans for tax were set out in the budget last year …
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Given that Mr Turnbull has now raised an additional $14 billion in new taxes, when he made his statement, was Prime Minister Turnbull simply not telling the truth?

                         There are tax measures in the budget. I wonder which of those tax measures you are going to oppose in this chamber. Are you, for example, going to oppose the measure to impose a levy on banks? Are you going to oppose that measure or are you going to support it through the chamber? Are you going to support the government's proposal in two years time—

                             I am sorry: I thought it was pretty clear from what I was saying that I was disputing what Senator Wong had put to me. If it is not perfectly clear to you, Senator Wong, there is nothing that the Prime Minister has said in the past that is at variance from the announcements that were made last night.

                             may turn to some of those measures—as I was saying, are you going to be opposing in this chamber a measure that supports and funds the National Disability Insurance Scheme, which in two years time will involve a half a per cent increase in the Medicare levy, or will you support it in this chamber? Because the ball is now in your court.

                             The ball is now in the court of Mr Shorten to decide whether or not he will support these measures, or whether he will support the government's initiative to bring the budget back into surplus sooner to fund programs like the

As I said in answer to your colleague Senator Gallagher, the underlying theme of this budget is fairness. Are you on the side of fairness or are you not?

                               Just two days before the 2016 election, Prime Minister Turnbull said:

                               Given, under Mr Turnbull, the coalition government is now the highest taxing government in a decade, isn't it clear Australians simply cannot rely on his commitments?

                                           . For the so-called zombie measures, we have capitulated to the political reality that there are no circumstances in which the opposition and the Greens were going to allow them through the Senate, so they are no longer on the books. But interestingly, the zombie measures are counted in your costings, Senator Wong. So that is another question that Mr Shorten has to answer tomorrow night—where he is going to find the extra money for the black hole that now appears in the Labor Party's costings?

                                            . Many people were shocked to see that the government's so-called welfare reform included drug testing income-support recipients. Many think the government has, in fact, reached a new low. The government and the Treasurer committed through the budget to fairness, opportunity and security. How is this measure not a gross violation of people's civil liberties? And how is it fair?

                                             , this measure is a trial, firstly. This measure is a trial for 5,000 new applicants to the jobseeker payment. But it is also actually aimed at supporting those people. It is aimed at ensuring that people do not fall into habitual drug use which can profoundly damage their health and future employment prospects. I am of the view, and the government is of the view, that this particular measure is very fair. It is going to ensure that we can direct people to services that they need. The critics of this have fallen into the trap of assigning or impugning a motive to those proposing it. The government has made clear, the minister has made clear—

The government has made clear and the minister has made clear that this is a policy that is being directed to support those applicants and to prevent people from falling into habits that can damage themselves, their families and their economic welfare over the longer term. So I think it is quite fair. It is actually about supporting participation.

The media briefing sheet outlines that the government is going to be profiling people in order to select people. They say they are going to randomly select people using data profiling to select participants. What criteria are they going to be using for selecting these people?

And, quite frankly, preventing people from falling into a habit of long-term habitual drug use and providing them with the services requires detection. It actually does mean that some people will, hopefully, avoid that habit and will have a better chance of employment.

Can the minister please outline to the Senate how the budget strengthens Australia's welfare compliance system, how it provides greater support to the most vulnerable jobseekers, while also ensuring that those who can work do work?

                                                         I thank Senator Reynolds for her question. On this side of the chamber we are very proud to say that one of our fundamental beliefs is that the best form of welfare is a job. That is why, yet again, in the budget that was delivered last night we are putting in place extensive measures to assist Australians who are currently on welfare move from that position into work.
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                         In terms of the programs that we are investing in, we are extending the successful ParentsNext program. This is all about helping parents of young children move back into the workforce when their youngest child goes to school. Our new PaTH program is getting our youth who are staring down the barrel of long-term unemployment off welfare and giving them the chance to get a job. And, of course, more and more older Australians will be looking for work. We will be supporting them with our new career-transition training.
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                         It is a fact that the majority of jobseekers do the right thing. However, there are a minority of welfare recipients who are capable of working but, unfortunately, they deliberately shirk their mutual obligations. What we will put in place is a new targeted compliance framework to address this deliberate shirking of obligations. Under the government's changes, jobseekers who repeatedly fail to comply with their agreed job plan with no reasonable excuse will now face effective penalties. Our welfare system is there to provide a strong safety net for those who need it, but it should also be one that encourages and motivates those who can find work to find work. It should not be abused by those who deliberately do not want to comply with their obligations.

                                                            Australians expect that their taxes should be spent fairly and that the system they pay for does help get people off welfare and into work. That is why the Turnbull government is tackling the link between drug use and long-term unemployment. As has already been articulated, from 1 January 2018, 5,000 new recipients of Newstart allowance and youth allowance in three trial sites will be required to undertake random drug tests. This is a two-year trial of random drug testing and it will be a condition of receiving a welfare payment. For those who test positive, we will provide them with the assistance they need, and they will be placed on welfare quarantining for two years. What this is deliberately designed to address is to curb the devastating effects of drug addiction and ensure that people with abuse problems are getting the help they need.

You just have to look at the comments made by Senator Di Natale last night, when he basically said that it was a massive violation of the rights of jobseekers receiving welfare to be drug tested. No-one has a right to take drugs. As Senator Ryan has already articulated, it is illegal. This demonstrates just how out of touch those on the opposite side of the chamber are. Well, this government will do everything that it can to ensure that those who are taking drugs are given the help that they need if they are in receipt of taxpayer funds. I would ask all senators to back this program.

We are making record investments into South Australia, not the least of which is to support a $90 billion naval shipbuilding program, predominantly centred around Adelaide in South Australia, which includes a very significant infrastructure investment into upgrading the Osborne shipyard facilities which will start from 1 July 2017. Our commitment also includes about $1.6 billion towards upgrading the North-South Corridor, a key freight and passenger route through Adelaide, $835 million of which will be invested in the '17-18 financial year. There are a whole range of other commitments. There is a long list that I can assist Senator Xenophon with.
                                                                     </p>

There is $40 million towards South Australian local roads, and Senator Xenophon would be very aware of this because, as well as having received representations from South Australian Liberal members and senators, we of course have had representations from you and your team in relation to this particular topic.
                                                                     </p>

And there is a $10 billion national rail program which South Australia can apply for, to support the AdeLINK project. But we have not received a submission yet—we have not received a proposal from the South Australian government.

Unlike the former Labor government, which did not commit to a single ship on their watch, we committed to a record naval shipbuilding program, and Australian naval ships of course will be built using Australian steel. We have also committed to building the Adelaide to Tarcoola rail upgrade using Australian steel. You would also be aware of the very exciting announcement by Adani that Adani proposes to use Australian steel.
                                                                        </p>
