         I thank Senator Ruston for her question. I can indeed update the Senate. But first let me remind colleagues of the miserable and misleading promises that Senator Conroy made when he was minister. In 2010, you will recall,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
          Mr President
         </a>
         , Labor claimed that within three years they would get to 1.27 million houses with a fibre-to-the-premises network and 283,000 premises with a fixed wireless network. What happened is they barely reached 16 per cent of that number, which I think most colleagues would agree is pitiful. Instead of taking Labor's approach and making outlandish promises on the back of a napkin—I forget if it was a napkin or a coaster, but I think you get the general idea, Mr President—we have taken the time to get the company rolling out broadband in a predictable and an efficient manner.
        </p>
        <p>
         I can inform senators that yesterday the company released its national rollout plan for the next 18 months, which shows that we are getting on and getting these upgrades delivered sooner, at less cost to taxpayers and more affordably for consumers, importantly. In the next 18 months, the company will start construction in areas covering an additional 1.9 million premises. This is a credible and realistic path forward. The simple fact of the matter is that, if you do the groundwork, you can deliver the results that Australians need and deserve.

           The plan demonstrates the significant progress that we are making. By June 2016, one in three Australians will live in areas where the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
            NBN
           </a>
           is accessible or where the rollout is underway—a far cry from the two per cent of premises with access to the NBN after the six years of the previous administration. The plan shows we are delivering on our pledge to prioritise underserved areas. Around 19 per cent of premises included in the rollout plan are considered underserviced, compared to 16 per cent nationally. We have also more than doubled the number of serviceable premises that have access to NBN's fixed line network, since the election, and this plan will include 7.9 million premises on the fixed line network where the NBN will start rolling out prior to 30 June 2016.

             We know that those living in rural and regional areas often have the worst access to broadband services. The rollout plan shows our commitment to rural and regional Australia, with almost one million premises outside of major urban areas covered. Of the areas receiving upgrades to the fixed line network, more than 800,000 are outside of major urban areas, which is almost half of the total rollout in the fixed line footprint. An additional 128,000 premises in the bush will be upgraded with the fixed wireless rollout.
            </p>
            <p>
             In terms of the fixed wireless network, a network neglected by Labor, we have more than tripled the number of premises passed since the election, going from 39,000 premises to 135,000 premises; and there are another 97,000 premises where the network is currently being built and another 128,000 premises which will see construction begin in the next 18 months. We are getting on with the job of delivering fast broadband for Australians, particularly those in rural and remote areas.
