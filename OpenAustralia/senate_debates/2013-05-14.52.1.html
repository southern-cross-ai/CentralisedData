        My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Wong. Is the minister aware of reports that the Assistant Treasurer has been contacting selected businesses to brief them about aspects of tonight's budget which relate to potentially market sensitive information?

           Well, he does. I am very happy to have a discussion with him about nominal

            GDP
           </a>
           and the effect on revenues after he has read the budget papers. I assume he will be in the lock-up. I understand that this question has been asked and answered in the other place. I understand that Mr Bradbury has made the point that it is appropriate for government to regularly engage in consultation with stakeholders, and I cannot provide any further information on what the Assistant Treasurer has done because obviously that is a matter for him. I can say to the Senate that this is a government that does value consultation processes. I understand, and obviously I do not have

           in front of me, that a similar suggestion was put in the other place and the Assistant Treasurer has clearly refuted the suggestion.

                 I am almost loath to answer that because the conversation at the other end of the chamber is so entertaining. But my suggestion to Senator Sinodinos is that he be very cautious about making unfounded accusations. I am certainly happy to get further details from the Assistant Treasurer. The government is very well aware of both the legal provisions and the conventions in relation to market sensitive information. The government is also aware of the importance of continuing to engage with stakeholders in the development and finalisation, or the consideration, of policy.
