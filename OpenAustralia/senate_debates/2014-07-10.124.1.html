        , Senator Fifield. I refer to the government's decision to axe the dementia and severe behaviours supplement. Is the minister aware of comments by Leading Age Services Australia

        Mr Patrick Reid that:

        Does the minister agree?

         I thank Senator Polley for her question. The decision I took to cease the severe behaviours supplement for people with dementia was not one I took lightly. But the situation this government inherited was one where the previous government in the last financial year had budgeted for a scheme of $11 million applying to 2,000 people. Rather than the scheme designed by the previous government applying to 2,000 people and costing $11 million, in the last financial year it was going to apply to 25,000 people—a slight overrun—and it was going to cost $110 million. The projections for the next four years were that, rather than costing $52 million, the scheme was going to cost $780 million. Let me repeat that: over the next four years the projections were that, rather than costing the $52 million budgeted by the former government, it was going to cost $780 million. In fact, over 10 years it was going to cost $1.5 billion.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is yet another example of a scheme that was badly designed by the previous government. It is important to emphasise that this was called a dementia and severe behaviours supplement. This was not the base funding for aged-care providers to support people with dementia. About half of Australia's 180,000 people in residential care have dementia. This was for people with severe behaviours related to dementia. This was a badly designed scheme with a serious cost overrun and, as a responsible minister, I could not sit back and do nothing.

           I agree that the planning and design by the previous government was more than tragic—absolutely. It is important to put this in context. This was not a minor miscalculation; this was designed and budgeted for—$11 million— in the last financial year by the previous government but, in fact, it was going to cost $110 million over the next four years. Let me repeat that: the projection was that it would cost not the $52 million budgeted by those opposite but $780 million. Over a decade, it was going to cost $1.5 billion. This was not a situation of my creation; it was a situation I inherited. It would not have been the responsible thing to sit back and do nothing.

             I should also remind colleagues that one of our election commitments which we are delivering in full is $200 million for dementia research. It also bears repeating that the severe dementia behaviours supplement was not base funding for aged-care providers who are supporting people with dementia. It was intended for a very specific and narrow cohort—people with severe behaviours in relation to dementia.
            </p>
            <p>
             I should also indicate that in the budget we increased the base subsidy to aged-care providers by 2.4 per cent. Indeed, we repurposed $1.1 billion about which the previous government said to aged-care providers, 'You can have this only if you enter a union enterprise agreement.' We thought that was not fair, so we said to aged-care providers—
