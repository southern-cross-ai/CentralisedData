        My question is to the Minister for Communications, Senator Fifield. On 6 June 2017, Charles Clinic Heart Care in Tasmania wrote to you outlining the disparity in internet quality between their main clinic in Launceston and their outreach clinic in Burnie. The clinic needs upload speeds of at least 10 megabits per second, but
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        Co will not guarantee these speeds over fibre to the node. As a result, the clinic may close and patients may be forced to travel to Launceston for appointments. Minister, why have you continued to roll out fibre to the node when it cannot guarantee even basic upload speeds?

         I thank Senator Urquhart for the question. Obviously, I cannot comment in relation to a particular business or premises, but I should make the point, as I did earlier in answer to a question from Senator Georgiou, that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
          NBN
         </a>
         was a failed project under our predecessors where barely 50,000 people nationwide had an active NBN service; contractors had downed tools in four states; and the best part of $6 billion had been spent over four years for that suboptimal outcome. Since that time—because of the good work that my predecessor did in this portfolio—the NBN will very shortly, by 30 June, be available to 50 per cent of Australians.
        </p>
        <p>
         The NBN is going to be complete by 2020—and that is a good six to eight years sooner than would have been the case under those opposite and at about $30 billion less cost. One of the main reasons why that is the case is that this government has given the mandate to NBN for a multitechnology mix. That means that the NBN has the capacity to choose the technology that makes sense in a given area that will see the NBN rolled out fastest and at the lowest cost.
        </p>
        <p>
         The NBN is one of the great corporate turnaround stories in Australia compared to what it was when we inherited it. There are a range of options available to NBN customers. There are a range of speed tiers available from the retail service providers.

           The current connection for the clinic is a node 1.7 kilometres from the hospital, which is across the road from another node.

           </a>
           Co have committed to moving the node to within 500 metres of the hospital. Why would NBN Co move a node 1.2 kilometres closer to a hospital but not right to the hospital?
