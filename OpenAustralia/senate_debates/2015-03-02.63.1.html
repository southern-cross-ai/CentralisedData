         I thank Senator Canavan for the question. As senators will know, both Tropical Cyclone Marcia and Tropical Cyclone Lam had devastating impacts on families and businesses; in the case of Cyclone Marcia, in parts of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
          Central Queensland
         </a>
         . Thankfully there was no loss of life.
        </p>
        <p>
         On Thursday and Friday of last week the Prime Minister, the justice minister, I, Senator Canavan and the members for Capricornia and Flynn visited both Yeppoon and Rockhampton—and, in my case, Biloela as well—to see the recovery effect and meet with families who really are still trying to get back on their feet. The Australian government is providing extensive assistance to the people of the Fitzroy and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_Bay" rel="nofollow">
          Wide Bay
         </a>
         -Burnett areas in the form of both the disaster recovery payment and the disaster recovery allowance. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DRP" rel="nofollow">
          DRP
         </a>
         is a one-off, non-means-tested payment of $1,000 for eligible adults and $400 for eligible children who have been adversely affected by a major disaster such as Tropical Cyclone Marcia.

          The Commonwealth

         's decision to make disaster recovery payments available to the residents of Fitzroy as soon as we could after the cyclone was of great benefit to those affected. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DRA" rel="nofollow">
          DRA
         </a>
         is going to support the local economy by giving employees, small business owners and farmers a bit of a hand when they need it most. This is assistance which is over and above the jointly Commonwealth and Queensland funded Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements, the NDRRA. That sort of assistance covers hardship payments to individuals, loans for businesses and primary producers, and support for councils to assist them in rebuilding impacted infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
         The clean-up effort is still underway; and there is some way to go, to be honest. The ADF, the Attorney-General's Department and my own
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Human_Services" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Human Services
         </a>
         have worked tirelessly since the cyclone in Queensland to support communities affected by those recent cyclones, and we will continue to work closely with the Queensland government.

           In terms of access I am really quite pleased and proud to be able to say that my department was back up and running in Rockhampton, Yeppoon and Biloela on the first business day after the cyclone, albeit running off some very large generators. When we bear in mind that the local staff have also enjoyed the same experience of the disaster events as the community, that is a pretty big undertaking. In addition to manning those service centres, we have also had staff operating in both recovery hubs in Yeppoon and Rockhampton. To assist with ease of access in more remote areas, we also diverted one of our mobile service centres—which I have spoken about in this chamber before—to this region from Monday of last week. It has visited a number of smaller towns and villages. Today it is in Marmor, helping there.
          </p>
          <p>
           Our phone lines were open straight away. Since that Sunday we have taken over 9,400 phone calls relating to both cyclones. We have received, in Queensland, 7,485 claims for disaster recovery payments and, as a result of that, granted 3,263.

We have remote servicing teams from my department in the communities of Galiwinku, Ramingining, Gapuwiyak and Milingimbi to help expedite these payments. We also have local departmental staff providing specific interpreter services at Galiwinku, and we have sourced interpreters for the other three communities.

                   As I said, the Minister for Justice visited the region personally on Friday to meet with the community and also to announce additional assistance in the form of the disaster recovery allowance. Since the announcement we have granted 255 claims in that part of the Territory.
