        That the Senateâ€”

       <p class="italic">

         Australian Parliament
        </a>
        on progress in meeting these Closing the Gap targets;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) is of the view That the presentation of these annual reports should be marked by a special parliamentary procedure in recognition of the significance of these initiatives to all Australians;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) therefore proposes to the House of Representatives that it consider marking the presentation of the Prime Minister's annual report on Closing the Gap by:

       <p class="italic">
        (i) hosting a meeting of the House to which senators are invited in a similar manner as senators are invited to attend addresses by foreign

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) resolves that, on its presentation to the Senate, the Prime Minister's annual report on Closing the Gap and accompanying ministerial statement be listed for consideration as a government business order of the day, and That the Government undertake to provide for at least 2 hours consideration of the statement during government business time.

           The government will not be supporting this motion. I stress that we remain firmly committed to the Closing the Gap targets and we want to be judged on results. We want kids going to school, we want adults going to work and we want the law of the land applying in Aboriginal and
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
            Torres Strait Islander
           </a>
           communities. We do not take any issue with the sentiments behind this motion. However, the correct Senate procedure would be to refer such matters to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_Committee" rel="nofollow">
            Procedure Committee

           report, along with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander involvement in the opening of parliament, are significant parliamentary events. The government will continue the same practice for
           <i>
            Closing the gap
           </i>
           reports that has been followed over the last five years, and we will continue to welcome parliamentary debate.
          </p>
          <p>
           Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leaders around the country acknowledge the significance of this event and routinely attend, and they will be welcomed to continue to do so. Most of the senators in this place often attend the speeches of both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. The government considers Closing the Gap a bipartisan task and calls on all members of parliament to focus on outcomes and making real changes to the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians.
