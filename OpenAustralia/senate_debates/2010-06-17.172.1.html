        My question is to Senator Arbib, Minister representing the Minister for Education. Does the minister agree with education department officials who claimed during estimates hearings that school halls built at state schools are more expensive than those built by Catholic schools because of the school facility standards—that is, the intent to build buildings that are going to last a long time? Does the minister therefore claim that buildings built by Catholic schools are of inferior quality and not built to last?

          The one thing I have learnt from listening to Senator Mason is not to believe anything he says on
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_the_Education_Revolution" rel="nofollow">
           Building the Education Revolution
          </a>
          . I would be more likely to listen to Mr Laming. I remind senators that Mr Laming, the Liberal member for Bowman, said outside the parliament:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Look I’m very grateful for every one of the projects in my electorate. They are all of high quality and the community appreciates them.
         </p>
         <p>
          That was the Liberal member for Bowman, talking about the school infrastructure projects in his electorate. I would be more likely to believe Mr Laming than Senator Mason on school infrastructure projects. There is no doubt about it: Building the Education Revolution is delivering on its goals. It is keeping countless Australian workers employed. It is keeping tradespeople, carpenters, plumbers and electricians employed on sites. It is employing apprentices.

           , I rise on a point of order on relevance. The question was specifically directed to comments made in estimates by the education department bureaucrats about the different standards for Catholic schools and non-Catholic schools. The minister has not addressed the question; he has not gone near it. This answer is not directly relevant. It is not even relevant to the question.

             As I was saying, supporting countless tradespeople, countless small businesses and supporting apprentices. More importantly, we are seeing schools get infrastructure that they would never have gotten under the coalition. What is the coalition’s most outstanding achievement? Their most outstanding education achievement from 12 years in government was 3,000 flagpoles. The Rudd government is building 3,000 school libraries—a record we are proud of.

                  Catholic block grant authority as well as leading construction industry expert Rawlinsons have now disproved claims made at estimates by Minister Carr and education department officials that Catholic school building costs are much lower because they do not include the costs of furniture and fit-outs, what other desperate excuse can the minister offer for the fact that state school buildings are two to five times more expensive than the same types of buildings built by non-government schools?

                    I certainly do not accept that and the government does not accept that. It is a complete misrepresentation of what happened in Senate estimates. But we do now know what the coalition’s plan is for the stimulus and for education, because Mr Pyne let the cat out of the bag when he said about the money being spent on schools:
                   </p>
                   <p class="italic">
                    We'll come to some arrangement with you about whether you keep half of that or all of that or give some back to the Coalition …
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    We know what they are going to do now: they want to stop the stimulus, stop the school projects and take the money for their other election commitments, robbing schools across the country. Senator Mason wants to rob Queensland schools of vital infrastructure, vital funding. That is the coalition’s plan for schools. Twelve years of robbing them, cutting education funding, putting in place flagpoles and that is their plan if they get back into government—shame on them.

                      I say to Senator Mason that he should spend less time doing his research in the newspapers and a little bit more time talking to principals and school communities because school communities and school principals across the country are supportive of what the government is doing. This is infrastructure they would not have seen for decades. Remember: 3,000 flagpoles under the coalition government, 3,000 school libraries under Labor. I remind you of what the construction industry is saying about these projects. Mr
