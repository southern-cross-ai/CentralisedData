        I rise tonight to speak about those in our country who have gone before us—generations gone by who laid down their lives and made the ultimate sacrifice for the generations to come. In this instance, I'm talking about the late, and recently recognised, Ordinary Seaman
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teddy_Sheean" rel="nofollow">
         Teddy Sheean
        </a>
        , who, on 12 August, was finally recognised—and appropriately so—with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Cross" rel="nofollow">
         Victoria Cross
        </a>
        for his acts of bravery. This has been the subject of a great deal of debate in Tasmania and of very, very long and energetic campaigns by a great many Tasmanians, including members of the public and members of both the Tasmanian and Commonwealth parliaments.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to reflect tonight on what a wonderful outcome it is for the late Ordinary Seaman Teddy Sheean and his family that his bravery and gallantry have finally been recognised. The coverage that has been given to the case being made for Teddy Sheean to be awarded a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VC" rel="nofollow">
         VC
        </a>
        has outlined quite extensively his acts of bravery in the last moments of his life. When the order was given for the crew of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS" rel="nofollow">
         HMAS
        </a>
        <i>
         Armidale
        </i>
        to evacuate the ship as it was going down, Teddy Sheean strapped himself to the gun at the stern of the ship and started firing at the Japanese aircraft that were strafing the sinking HMAS
        <i>
         Armidale
        </i>
        all to protect his fellow crew members, who were seeking to make their way to safety, having disembarked the sinking ship. He sacrificed his life for them, in an ultimate act of bravery.
       </p>
       <p>
        Teddy Sheean's bravery has never been in question. However, after 17 years of campaign to have Teddy Sheean recognised with the highest of military honours, he has finally received that recognition. The process was extensive and, sadly, became a matter of public debate, certainly in the Tasmanian media. But the one thing that we all had to remember on the way through was that this was not a political debate. The awarding of the VC is not in the domain of politicians to grant. The granting of this award to those who have made sacrifices is not something that can be done with a stroke of a pen by anyone in this building—indeed, by anyone in this country. It's an award given by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Majesty" rel="nofollow">
         Her Majesty
        </a>
        the Queen or the Governor-General on her behalf, which is what happened on 12 August. But the review that was undertaken, headed by the Hon. Dr
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Nelson" rel="nofollow">
         Brendan Nelson
        </a>
        , the former director of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
         War Memorial
        </a>
        , found the right outcome and that was that it was right to recognise Ordinary Seaman Teddy Sheean for the acts of bravery he committed that I outlined earlier on.
       </p>
       <p>
        I do want to pay tribute to the Tasmanians who have contributed to this outcome—those who have tirelessly campaigned for this outcome over a long period of time and more recently. I do want to start by paying tribute to a former member of this place and a good friend and colleague of mine in the Tasmanian parliament,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Barnett" rel="nofollow">
         Guy Barnett
        </a>
        , for his tireless advocacy for the outcome that has been achieved today. I think it is important to put that on the record. But I also want to thank my colleagues Gavin Pearce, Bridget Archer and Senator Askew, who has just concluded her adjournment contribution tonight. All the members of the Tasmanian federal Liberal team have advocated behind the scenes for this outcome. It is the right outcome. It is a 'Team Tassie' approach. As I said, this is not a political outcome. This is not a political issue. It was not a political decision. So I have to also acknowledge Jacquie Lambie for her work in advocating for this outcome as well. As a strong representative of the north-west coast of Tasmania she made her views clear.
       </p>
       <p>
        All Tasmanians wanted to recognise this proud Tasmanian son, someone who has done so much for our country and made the ultimate sacrifice. So all of us in Tasmania are pleased with this outcome. We wish Teddy's family well and we hope that his descendants cherish and relish the honour that has been bestowed upon him and his family for the sacrifice that has been made.
