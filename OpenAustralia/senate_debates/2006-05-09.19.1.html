        My question is addressed to Senator Kemp, the Minister representing the Minister for Human Services. What is the government’s understanding of the reasons for the resignation of the head of the government’s smartcard technology task force, Mr James Kelaher? Are the minister and the government aware of his reported concerns, which apparently include plans to scrap an external expert advisory board, plans to keep the project within the

        </a>
        and plans to keep funding for the project within Centrelink and Medicare? Given these concerns, can the minister, on behalf of the Minister for Human Services, explain to the Senate the government’s plans for the introduction of an independent assessment of the privacy implications of the smartcard?

         Senator Stott Despoja has a longstanding interest in this issue and, as such, we welcome questions on this very important initiative by the Australian government. There were three parts to the question, if I recall correctly. Let me deal with the issue of the advisory board. You may be aware—I think the minister has made some comments on this—that nothing has been ruled out or in yet by the government. It has only made a decision to proceed with the health and social services access card on 28 April, which you will be aware of. I can assure you the smart technologies task force has consulted widely with representative groups—

           not you, Senator Ray—over the past 12 months and will continue to do so regardless of what consultation is adopted. You asked for the attitude of the minister on this matter. He has reservations about picking a few favoured groups for a formal board to the exclusion of other interest groups. I think that deals with the first part of your question.
          </p>
          <p>
           You asked also about whether a separate agency should be established, but let me again say from the minister’s brief that the government would like to put on record that in relation to this issue nothing has been ruled in or out yet. However, the minister would like to add that the Review of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_Governance" rel="nofollow">
            Corporate Governance
           </a>
           of Statutory Authorities and Office Holders conducted by Mr John Uhrig in 2003 warned the government about the proliferation of government agencies. I think the minister for finance is fully aware of that particular issue. The minister will consider the Uhrig proposals when evaluating possible future structures for the access work card.
          </p>
          <p>
           The final part of the question was whether sufficient funding is being allocated to Medicare and Centrelink. Of course, the Treasurer will this evening make an important statement in relation to general funding of government services, and we all wait anxiously for the Treasurer’s announcement. There will be funding announced regarding the access card, I am advised, in this evening’s federal budget but I do not think I can say at this stage where the funding will be allocated. It is not for me to pre-empt
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Hockey" rel="nofollow">
            Mr Hockey
           </a>
           nor is it for me to pre-empt the Treasurer. However, I can say at this stage that any money spent by agencies, a department or any other possible group established to implement the access card will come under very close scrutiny from a firm contracted to provide audit and oversight assurance. The minister’s brief concludes that both Centrelink and Medicare will have a role in the implementation of the health and social services access card; however, much of the work will be contracted to private sector providers in accordance with advice from expert advisers.

            , I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for his answer and again refer him to my question involving the resignation of Mr James Kelaher and the government’s understanding of Mr Kelaher’s reasons for resigning from the task force. I thank the minister for the information about the external advisory body and the fact that the minister has not ruled it in or out, according to Senator Kemp. Does the minister realise that if it is scrapped this will be contrary to previous discussions and agreements involving departments, stakeholders and other ministers, as I understand it? Finally, in the interests of accountability and the government being so up-front on the issue of the so-called smartcard, could the minister advise the parliament as to whether or not the government will release the entire

            report into the smartcard and not simply an edited version, as has been previously announced?

             The final part of the question is a matter for

              Mr Hockey
             </a>
             , but I know Mr Hockey follows Senate proceedings with great interest and care. Undoubtedly, he will note the points you have raised and will carefully, as he always does, consider them. In relation to the consultation you mentioned, my understanding is that there has been very wide consultation with many groups over the last 12 months and Mr Hockey will continue to do so regardless of what consultation framework is adopted. In relation to the advisory board, as I mentioned, nothing has been ruled in or out but the minister has indicated that he does have reservations about picking a few favoured groups for a formal board to the exclusion of other groups. That seems to me to be a very sensible statement from Mr Hockey. It is one that I would endorse.
