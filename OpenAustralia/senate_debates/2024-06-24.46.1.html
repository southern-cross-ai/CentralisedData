        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. Can the minister please outline what cost-of-living relief the Albanese government is delivering for all Australians? I am particularly keen to hear about the measures that come into effect in just seven days time, including tax cuts for every Australian taxpayer, the Albanese Labor government's $300 energy bill relief, and wage rises for low-paid workers, backed by the government.

         I thank Senator Marielle Smith from my home state of

         for that great question. The senator is right; the Albanese Labor government is delivering for every Australian because we are a government for all Australians. On 1 July, in just seven days, every Australian taxpayer gets a tax cut. All 13.6 million Australian taxpayers get a tax cut in seven days. The average tax cut is nearly $1,900 year—36 bucks extra per week in your pocket. Unlike those opposite, we want Australians to earn more and keep more of what they earn.

         and the Liberals and the Nationals want you to work longer for less. We hear a lot about aspiration from the other side, but we understand aspiration doesn't just start at the top tax bracket. That's why our tax cuts travel all the way up the income scale. We on this side are also backing wage rises for low-paid workers. Nearly 2.6 million workers get their third consecutive pay rise backed by the Albanese Labor government. From next Monday we are also supporting every household with $300 in energy relief—another policy from Albanese Labor government. Around one million small businesses will receive $325 off their bills—another cost-of-living policy from the Albanese Labor government. What have we got from those opposite? Those opposite want to serve up the most expensive form of energy there is in two decades' time. That's their answer to how to deal with the cost of living and energy supply—to go for the most expensive form of energy. It won't deliver for two decades, and do you know what? Mr Dutton won't tell Australians how much his nuclear reactors are going to cost.

          Thank you, Minister. It's really great that Labor is cutting taxes for all Australian taxpayers, not just some, as the opposition had intended. Can you please outline the benefits for all households, in particular for families, and those in our home state of

           Senator Smith would know that we're also freezing the cost of PBS items from 1 July, delivering stronger Medicare and cheaper medicines. She would also know that, from Monday, paid parental leave increases to 22 weeks and that we are delivering
