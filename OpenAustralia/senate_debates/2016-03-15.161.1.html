        , I present the committee's 79th annual report. I seek leave to have the tabling statement incorporated in

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        2015 was a busy and productive year.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         The Committee
        </a>
        held more meetings and processed more referrals in 2015 than in any of the preceding five years.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In 2015, the Committee reported on 22 works, with a combined cost of $3.1 billion, and held 44 meetings, including inspections and public hearings across the country. By comparison, in 2014 the Committee dealt with 13 referrals and in 2013, 14 referrals.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Of the referrals in 2015, 11 were for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Defence
        </a>
        , totalling approximately $2.7 billion.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        During the year the Committee also reviewed 40 medium works notifications. Medium works are projects with an estimated cost of between $2 million and $15 million. The Committee approved 37 medium works, with a combined cost of $235.3 million. Of the remaining three medium works, one was withdrawn and two were combined and referred to the Committee for full inquiry.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In July 2015 the Committee wrote to all agencies that had made referrals since 2010 reminding them of the requirement to provide post-implementation reports when a project has been completed. As a result, the Committee received 18 post-implementation reports and several status-updates for projects that are still in the delivery phase.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
         Mr President
        </a>
        , the Committee strongly supports the requirement for post-implementation reporting. Not only does it support improved accountability and transparency, but there are real benefits to be gained by the agencies critically assessing their own project outcomes against key objectives such as timeliness and cost. For these reasons, the Committee will continue to put great emphasis on findings noted in post-implementation reports.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        At various times during the year the Committee considered operational matters. These include a review of the monetary threshold for referral and possible amendments to the Public Works Committee Act. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Finance" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Finance
        </a>
        is currently reviewing these matters and the Committee expects to be consulted on proposed changes in due course. The Committee recognises the importance of reviewing aspects of it operation from time to time to ensure its practices continue to be consistent with the Commonwealth's property management framework and the broader construction environment. Such considerations though must be made in a context that supports the fundamental principle of Parliamentary scrutiny.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In concluding, I would like to thank all who have assisted the Committee in its work during 2015 and I commend this report to the Senate.
