        I rise today to congratulate the Chidlow Progress Association on their 125th anniversary. Chidlow is a small, beautiful Perth hills community with a population of less than 2,000, in the federal electorate of Hasluck, which is about 45 kilometres east of Perth. The Chidlow Hall was opened on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        in 1905, and I commend all of the locals who banded together to save this historic hall from demolition. For any local community, particularly in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        , to reach such a milestone is impressive, but the voluntary nature of the Chidlow Progress Association makes their 125th anniversary even more noteworthy.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Chidlow Hall has a really important local history. It was used for elections, church services and choir practice, and it was also where Chidlow's young men took their medicals before departing for World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Now the hall is restored, the community is once again running community events such as the Chidlow market day and their local film club. One of the association's latest projects is the Chidlow community garden, which builds on the vision for a shared community open space. Without the Chidlow Progress Association, the community would not be what it is today.
       </p>
       <p>
        Congratulations to everyone involved in your 125th anniversary. I'm proud to have been part of a government that committed $11,000 to fund the maintenance and the upgrades of the hall. As I said, congratulations to all involved. Together, you have ensured that Chidlow remains a great place to live, work and raise a family. Congratulations.
