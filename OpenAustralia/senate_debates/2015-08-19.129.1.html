        (a) notes that:

        (i) the Australian sugar industry directly employs approximately 16,000 people across the growing, harvesting and transport sectors,
       </p>
       <p>
        (ii) 95 per cent of the sugar produced in Australia is grown in Queensland with the balance grown in

        ,
       </p>
       <p>
        (iii) the sugar cane industry is one of Australia's largest and most important rural industries, and sugar has been identified as Queensland's most important rural crop,
       </p>
       <p>
        (iv) the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References committee in its report
        <i>
         Current and future arrangements for the marketing of Australian sugar recommended the development and implementation of a mandatory sugar industry code of conduct, and
        </i>
       </p>
       <p>
        (v) sugar cane growers are urgently seeking the assistance of the Government to support them in ensuring the long-term viability and health of the Australian sugar industry; and
       </p>
       <p>
        (b) calls on the Government to act on the Committee's recommendation by working with stakeholders across the Australian sugar industry to develop an industry code of conduct, and to ensure that sugar cane growers have the flexibility to engage any party to undertake marketing and establish an independent arbitrator to undertake pre contractual commercial arbitration.

           I would like to indicate that the government cannot support this motion because it is a premature motion. Negotiations are still occurring between sugar mills and sugar growers and it is not the right time for the government to act before those negotiations are concluded. Everybody in the sector appreciates that the best outcome here is a commercial outcome, that the best outcome is for millers and growers to come back together. Indeed, they will have to do that at some point. This approach is consistent with the government's approach to the food and grocery industry code earlier this year.
          </p>
          <p>
           I would also like to note that the Prime Minister has established a sugar marketing task force, which has reported. It took 32 submissions and had meetings will all interested stakeholders. We have had a Senate inquiry with three public hearings and 51 submissions which made recommendations. While I welcome the interest of my fellow senator from Queensland, I would like to note that he was not at any of those Senate hearings, he has not made a submission to that task force and he has not been involved in the process to date.

              I had the Burdekin Canegrowers in my office yesterday. Their biggest disappointment is the fact that the Queensland National senators will not even talk to them. They will not even reply to their phone calls. They are the people you represent. I am taking a great interest in the sugar industry in Queensland because they need help and I am here to do it.
