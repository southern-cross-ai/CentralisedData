        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Abetz. I refer to the Minister for Defence, Mr Andrews, who described the Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, as someone whose focus seems to have been almost entirely on himself and on undermining the government. Does the minister agree?

         I learned long ago not to trust the Labor Party when they come in here claiming to quote my colleagues. I have said time and time again that this is a government committed to the service of the Australian people—a government that does not indulge in the sort of gossip column tactics of the Labor Party.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
          Mr President
         </a>
         , you would have thought that on an occasion such as this, having the opportunity to put the government to the test, there might have been a question about the China free trade agreement and the jobs that that would provide. But no, instead we have a question about what somebody allegedly said on some program. We do not indulge in those sorts of matters on this side—we keep on with the task of serving the Australian people, of creating the employment opportunities, of reducing the cost of living pressures on family budgets, of ensuring that we get a good, sound, balanced environmental policy, of getting our resource projects underway and of getting rid of red and green tape. They are the things that we concentrate on, they are the things that we are devoted to, and that is what we will continue to do.
        </p>
        <p>
         We can play all sorts of games about 'he said', 'she said', and indeed there are some very interesting quotes of what Labor people are saying about each other. Where does that advance the cause of the national interest? Absolutely nowhere. What advances the cause of the national interest is a focus on the policies that will create jobs, will keep jobs, will put downward pressure on the cost of living and will ensure the future of our nation. That is what we are dedicated to doing.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I refer to former Prime Minister Abbott's comments about the sour, bitter character assassination that took place while he was leader. Does the minister agree with Mr Abbott's description of Mr Turnbull's actions as he white-anted his way to the top?

           While Mr Abbott was leader of the Liberal Party I do understand that a very sour, bitter character assassination took place, and that was by
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rudd" rel="nofollow">
            Kevin Rudd

            Julia Gillard
           </a>
           , and then by Julia Gillard of Kevin Rudd. If the honourable senator is referring to that sour, bitter character assassination while Mr Abbott was Leader of the Liberal Party, chances are she is right. As the Australian people recognise, it is important when there is a change of leader to get on with the business of governing, on delivering on the China free trade agreement. What the Australian people want to know today is where does Senator Wong stand on the China free trade agreement? Will the Labor Party be supporting the China free trade agreement or will they be pursuing the xenophobic policies of the most corrupt union that this country has, namely the

            , I ask a further supplementary question. Can the minister confirm that Mr Turnbull once sought support for a Labor Senate seat, and does this not show that former Liberal Premier of Victoria, Mr Jeff Kennett, is right when he says that Mr Turnbull 'is an individual who always puts self-interest first'?

              , shifting from the Labor Party to the cause that advanced the nation. If that which is asserted about Mr Turnbull is correct, he then follows that great model of Joseph Lyons who, having seen the problems of the Labor Party, came across to the conservative side of politics and did untold good for our nation in times of economic circumstances which we would not have wished on our nation. I say to the honourable senator that, if that which she asserts is true, I welcome the fact that Mr Turnbull saw the light, and I trust others on that side will as well.
