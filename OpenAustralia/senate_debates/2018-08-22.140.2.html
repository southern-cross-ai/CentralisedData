           Reducing the impact of drugs is a priority for the Commonwealth government. Although state and territory governments are the primary funders of drug and alcohol treatment services, the Commonwealth is providing an investment of approximately $574 million over four years from 2016-17 for drug and alcohol treatment services. The government notes that several points raised in this motion are ultimately a matter for state and territory governments or private organisations.

              Labor has supported drug policies that complement law enforcement with evidence-based harm minimisation, early intervention and treatment. But this motion is a typical Greens stunt. It includes a number of policies that are beyond the Commonwealth's control or for which there is not yet evidence in Australia. So, while Labor will commemorate International Overdose Awareness Day on 31 August, we will not be supporting this motion.

               I just say to the Labor Party and to all those people who have lost a loved one as a result of a drug overdose that to label support for International Overdose Awareness Day a stunt is absolutely disgraceful. When you consider that the number of drug-related deaths is now double the road toll, something needs to be done. All of the issues that we canvass in this motion, including ending the use of sniffer dogs at festivals and introducing pill testing at festivals, are based on evidence. We know that access to substitution therapies is expensive and that cost is a barrier to patients. We should have increased access to medically supervised injecting facilities. We know they work. It's about time that the Labor Party and the government understood what the evidence is actually telling us and started to show a bit of guts and stand up for people who are dying far too soon.

                … greater access to needle and syringe programs across the country, including urgent roll-out of trials inside prisons …

                   I can speak with authority on this, because everyone knows that I'm probably the only senator in this place that has actually been in prison, in maximum security, although I was exonerated. I didn't see the drugs. I want to know why you think we need syringes in prisons for the drug problem. So I cannot support this.

                      Senator Hanson, you have company with some jail experience. I have the same objection that Senator Hanson has to that piece of the motion. Some of the motion is good and some of it's bad. When I was in jail, we were strip-searched every time we were going to meet visitors and we were strip-searched every time we came out. I think guards must be getting drugs to people in prison, because, when you're in a one-piece jumpsuit with a padlock on the back of your neck, there's no way known you can carry anything in there. They check inside your mouth to make sure it's not under your tongue. When I was under house arrest for five months, they came and knocked on the door at 10 o'clock at night to drug-test and alcohol-test me. Part of what you say, Senator Di Natale, is true, but on that angle I can't support it.
