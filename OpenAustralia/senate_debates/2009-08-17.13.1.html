           I seem to recall having said in this place on a number of occasions that agriculture is not in the bill that was voted down by those opposite. It was not included, and what we have made clear is that we would not include it until 2015 and that a decision would be made in 2013, prior to which we will continue to work with the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Farmers_Federation" rel="nofollow">
            National Farmers Federation
           </a>
           and other peak agriculture representatives to deal with some of the issues that are presented when you consider how to deal with agriculture. So the government has not made a decision to include it. That is why it is not in the bill. It is in 2015.
          </p>
          <p>
           I just remind those opposite of what Woolworths have said today:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Modelling undertaken last year on the previously proposed scheme did show that food like all goods would incur a slight price rise. This price impact would be higher if agriculture were included but agriculture is omitted under the current plan. Woolworths submitted this information to the government in 2008 in order to assist with compensation planning for low-income households.
          </p>
          <p>
           The government has been consulting. The government has been working closely with industry and the government is determined to take action on climate change—something those opposite have never had the courage to do.

            of Agricultural Producers about the capacity of the world to feed itself, and given the fact that no other country is considering the inclusion of agriculture in emissions trading, can the minister explain why the government continues to threaten not only Australian farming but also Australian agribusiness by refusing to exclude completely agriculture from an emissions trading scheme?

               that is what you were going to do. I remind you again also of what the Garnaut review says will occur if climate change proceeds unabated: in excess of a 90 per cent reduction in irrigated agriculture in Australia’s food bowl, the Murray-Darling Basin. That is what faces our farmers and our food producers. So you can tell people what you wish, but—

                   There was very little factually correct in that assertion. I am not sure what I am supposed to respond to. What I will say on that issue is this: if there is confusion and uncertainty on climate change policy in this country, it is as a result of those opposite, the alternative government, who went to the election with a commitment for an emissions trading scheme and who have walked away from it because there are too many people in your party room who do not believe climate change is real. If there is uncertainty on this policy issue, it is the alternative government’s failure to come up with a responsible policy.
