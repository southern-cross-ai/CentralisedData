         Leader of the Government in the Senate
        </a>
        , Senator Evans. I refer to the massive uncertainty being caused to Australian families and businesses by the government's inability to indicate in the budget even the most basic costs of the carbon tax it plans to impose. In order to dispel some of this uncertainty, can the minister confirm that the Labor-Greens carbon tax will increase the price of electricity by an average of $300 per household, increase the price of petrol by 6c per litre and increase the price of groceries by five per cent? If the minister cannot confirm these particular price increases, can he advise the Senate by how much the price of each of these items will increase?

         I thank Senator Abetz for the question, because here we are, two days after the budget, and after the second question they have run out of questions about the budget. They have got nothing to say about the budget of this country. They got five or six questions yesterday, one today, and they have run out of steam. They have nothing to contribute to the economic debate in this country. They cannot lay a hand on the budget.

           , I rise on a point of order on relevance. This minister has now had almost a minute and all he has done—the same as Senator Wong does—is comment on the questioner. In no way can that be seen to be directly relevant. I know neither of those ministers have any competence with their own portfolio, but to allow them to spend the first minute of their answers actually attacking the questioner is just not relevant and, Mr President, I would ask that you might interrupt those ministers without us taking a point of order and make them abide by the regulations.

              Let's be clear: I could not actually hear the answer, so I am not sure you are going to be in a position to make a judgment on relevance. Most importantly, traditionally it has always been the case that the leader can range widely across a range of issues. That has always been the tradition. I would put to you,
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">

              , that the pathetic attempt to hear his own voice again and to prove he is relevant by Senator Macdonald should be ruled out of order.

               There is no point of order. The minister has one minute 19 remaining to address the question and answer the question. It will assist question time if, when the answers are being given, people stop shouting across the chamber.

                I was just making, as a preliminary point, the very obvious point that the opposition has nothing to say on the important economic issues confronting this country other than slogans and abuse. What we do know is that, on the second day after the budget at question time, when the government is supposed to be under pressure to be held to account, they have no questions.
               </p>
               <p>
                The government is pursuing the implementation of a price on carbon, as we have committed ourselves to. This government is working through a multi-party climate change committee and consulting with industry, unions and the community about the form of that new price on carbon. That work is ongoing. When that work is finalised, that work will be completed, it will be put to the parliament and any budgetary impacts will be included in future budgets—just as has been the case in the past, when the Howard government introduced the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
                 GST
                </a>
                . Once those decisions are taken, once legislation is carried, provision will be made in the budgets, as per normal practice.

                 , I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for confirming that cost-of-living issues are not addressed in Labor's budget. I refer to the $13.7 million squirreled away in the budget to fund what is euphemistically referred to as a climate change foundation campaign, which, accor­ding to the Minister for

                 , will be used for websites and the printing of information brochures. Given the experience with GROCERYchoice and Fuelwatch websites, can the minister understand why Australian families might regard the spend­ing of this money as another example of waste and mismanagement?

                  I have to give it to Senator Abetz: talk about front! Remember the guy who used to run the Liberal advertising campaign, wherein they spent hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' money advertising everything under the sun to try and save their political hides?

                             So the question is highly hypocritical and just exposes Senator Abetz's performance in this chamber.

Why are they not addressing the issues of mental health, schools, tertiary education and all the issues that are important to Australians?' We have a question, first of all, about what is not in the budget, a supplementary about what was in last year's budget and then a clever question that tried to bring them all together that said, 'Spending in last year's budget was for a program you did not introduce until this year's budget.' You are a disgrace. This is a complete nonsense.

                                      Although the minister has 21 seconds to go, there has been nothing so far in this answer other than abuse of the Leader of the Opposition. Given that there has been literally nothing relevant in the answers to the primary question and the first supplementary question, it is not too soon,

                                      , for you now to rule—given the approach that the minister is taking—that his answer is not relevant and he should be drawn to the question.
