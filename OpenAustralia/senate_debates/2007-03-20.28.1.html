        My question is to Senator Minchin, representing the Prime Minister. I refer the minister to his press release of 16 March, in which he praised Senator Santoro’s contribution as minister and in which he said, ‘I look forward to his continued contribution to the coalition’s Senate team as Liberal senator for Queensland.’ Minister, do you still believe that deliberately failing to declare his share ownership some 72 times entitles Senator Santoro to continue to represent the coalition Senate team? Didn’t the Prime Minister and Minister Robb today describe Senator Santoro’s actions as unbelievable and indefensible? Do you think that Senator Santoro’s failure to adhere to the Senate rules is acceptable behaviour for Liberal Party senators?

         passed the resolution on senators’ interests back in 1994. I would remind all senators that they need to observe that resolution regarding the registration of senators’ interests. It is clear in its obligations on all senators, and I expect that all senators on all sides of the chambers will be reminded by what has occurred of their obligations to ensure that the Register of Senators’ Interests is properly maintained. But let us be realistic about what Senator Santoro has done. He has neglected to ensure that his Senate register of interests properly reflects the full extent of his pecuniary interests. He has failed to observe the requirements of that resolution.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is a matter for the Senate if it wishes to pursue that matter but, so far as the government is concerned, his failure to properly ensure that his entry into that register was accurately maintained and his coincidental failure to ensure the Prime Minister’s code of conduct was observed have resulted, properly in the circumstances, in him tendering his resignation from the ministry. He has paid an enormous price therefore for his neglect of his responsibilities as a senator and as a minister. I stand by every word I said in the press release.
        </p>
        <p>
         When one looks at the contribution that any individual, whether on the other side of the chamber or on our side, makes to politics, one must look at all sides of the ledger. I am happy to state in this place that Senator Santo Santoro has been one of the great servants of the Liberal Party throughout the last 20 or 30 years. He has worked tirelessly to advance the cause of the Liberal Party in the state parliament, the state party organisation of Queensland and the federal parliament. He was regarded as an outstanding minister in the then Queensland coalition government and, as I said before, he was widely commended on his performance in the role of Minister for Ageing in this government. On any proper balance of the ledger of Senator Santo Santoro’s performance as a Liberal, both in the state party organisation and in the state and federal parliaments, he has served his party well and with distinction. Obviously, the actual question of who will be a candidate for the Queensland Liberal Party at the next federal election is a matter for the Queensland division of the Liberal Party, but I note that Senator Santoro has already been selected on the ticket and is a continuing senator for Queensland until 30 June next year. I expect that he will continue to serve his party and his country well as a Queensland Liberal senator.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I note Senator Minchin’s loyalty to a friend and major Liberal Party fundraiser, but is it really the case that Senator Santoro’s failure to properly reflect his share earnings is an apt description of what has occurred? Isn’t it really a trivialisation of the massive serial misleading of the Senate by the declarations made by Senator Santoro? What does it say about the government’s standards if you are to trivialise these matters in this way? Do you not think that the community expects higher standards of behaviour from Liberal Party senators?

           That is mischief-making on Senator Evans’s part to suggest that I am seeking to trivialise this issue in any way. Senator Santoro himself knows how serious this matter is. He has enormous regard and respect for the Senate and, in the light of that regard for the Senate, he has tendered his resignation as a minister. I understand he intends to speak to the Senate tonight to explain his failure to observe the resolution of the Senate regarding senators’ interests. He takes this matter seriously, as do I and all members of the government. He had no alternative but to tender his resignation as a minister in the light of the seriousness of the issue.
