        My question is to Senator Ludwig, the Minister representing the Minister for Indigenous Health, Rural and Regional Health and Regional Service Delivery. My question concerns the recent announcement that the Commonwealth will make a transportable dialysis facility available in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Springs" rel="nofollow">
         Alice Springs
        </a>
        to address the current crisis in renal services. Will new interstate patients such as Patrick Tjungurrayi be able to access this Commonwealth dialysis facility or will they be prevented from doing so? Was the provision of this facility by the Commonwealth made contingent on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        agreeing to lift the ban on new interstate renal patients? If not, why not?

         I thank Senator Siewert for the question. I know Senator Siewert has a longstanding interest in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         Indigenous health issues. I am aware that, on 6 November 2009, Minister Snowden offered the Northern Territory government the temporary use of a relocatable two-chair dialysis facility for placement in Flynn Drive in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Springs" rel="nofollow">
          Alice Springs
         </a>
         . This facility will be used as an interim measure to ease some of the pressures on Northern Territory dialysis facilities whilst the new 12-port facility is being constructed.
        </p>
        <p>
         I understand that the Australian government is also working with the Northern Territory government, but the Australian government acknowledges that access to renal dialysis in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Central Australia
         </a>
         is, and continues to be, a major issue. Dialysis services are predominantly administered by state and territory governments, but I am aware that the Northern Territory government has implemented protocols to refer new patients presenting for treatment in Alice Springs who are nonresidents of the Northern Territory to their state of residence for treatment.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          The Northern Territory
         </a>
         Department of Health and Families has advised that this decision was necessary due to delays in establishing a new 12-port renal facility in Alice Springs and to a substantial increase in patient numbers in Central Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         Given the high demand for dialysis services in Alice Springs, the Australian government, as I have indicated, has recently agreed to make available to the Northern Territory a two-port relocatable dialysis facility. It is only for temporary use while we await the 12-port facility, which will ensure that Central Australia is serviced with dialysis facilities, to come online. The Northern Territory government is—

           What I can say about the $5.3 million which was committed at the election to provide additional renal dialysis services in the

            Northern Territory
           </a>
           is that, with this funding, in the first quarter of 2010 a mobile dialysis service will be piloted in

            Central Australia

           . This will help improve access for people in remote communities without their having to travel to major centres for treatment. In addition, renal-ready rooms, to be co-located at community health centres, are also proposed for the communities around Maningrida, Lake Nash and—

In addition, the Commonwealth government would like to see, and will encourage, the three state and territory governments to come to a speedy resolution of these issues. To resolve the issue, the Northern Territory government is leading discussions with the

                    , I rise on a point of order. The earlier question asked the minister: did the Commonwealth levy a condition on the spending of this money? The minister ought to be able to directly answer the question: are patients from over the border being denied access to that Commonwealth funded facility right now?
