         I can confirm that the Prime Minister has made a number of trips overseas since the election of the Rudd Labor government. I will have to take on notice the number of days he was overseas, but I make it very clear that the government actually thinks it is very important that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PM" rel="nofollow">
          PM
         </a>
         travel. It thinks that it is very important that, as a new government, the Prime Minister establishes strong relations with nations with which we seriously engage, be it on trade, economic or political matters. It is important that we establish, if you like, a new stance in international affairs, representing the priorities of this government. The Prime Minister has worked very hard at doing that and has engaged in travel which has been to promote Australia’s interests. One of the main comments you hear about it is how hard he works while he does it and what long hours he does in pursuing Australia’s interests.
        </p>
        <p>
         One of those trips—in fact, the first occasion the Prime Minister went overseas—was to the Bali climate change conference, where he committed Australia to signing the Kyoto protocol. I think Australians were very proud that the Prime Minister took that initiative, that he did go overseas, that he did engage in the great international task of combating climate change, and that we committed to the Kyoto protocol. After years and years of inaction and climate change denial by the former Howard government, the Prime Minister took the lead and went and signed the Kyoto protocol on behalf of Australians. I think Australians were very proud that he did and were very supportive that he did.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Prime Minister has made a number of trips, as the former Prime Minister, Mr Howard, did. I think in 2005 Mr Howard spent 60-odd days overseas. In 2003 I think he travelled overseas 11 times. Quite frankly, it is perfectly appropriate for prime ministers to travel pursuing the interests of the nation. It is particularly appropriate for a new Prime Minister, with a very different approach to foreign affairs, to travel overseas. Be it his trip to Bali, be it his trip to China, be it his trip to Japan, they have been very important in promoting Australia’s trade interests, promoting improved bilateral arrangements, and promoting a better understanding between our countries. They have had key economic results for us. I have talked about the Kyoto agreement, but his trip to China in April saw, I think, a major unfreezing, if you like, of the bilateral trade negotiations. So they are very important for our economy and very important for business that we encourage trade between ourselves and other countries. I think you will find that the business community and the Australian community more generally support his endeavours to promote Australia and its interests.

            The first thing to say, of course, is that most of the claims in the question were wrong: the Prime Minister has visited
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
             Western Sydney
            </a>
            on a number of occasions and the Prime Minister has also been in the north of Australia on a number of occasions. We had a community cabinet in the north of Australia, as Senator Heffernan well knows. I explained to him why the Prime Minister went to Bali, and I think that was a very good result and well worth the effort. I can also say that the Prime Minister went to Japan after urging by the Liberal Party and the then Leader of the Opposition. So you cannot have it both ways. One moment you urge him to go and then you criticise him for going. You are such a rabble. I would also suggest that attacking the Prime Minister for visiting our troops in Afghanistan and Iraq is a pretty low act.
