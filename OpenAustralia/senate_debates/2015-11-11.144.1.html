         The Government
        </a>
        thanks the Committee for its consideration of the
        <i>
         Amendments to Appendices I and II to the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals
        </i>
        , done at Quito on 9 November 2014, and tabled on 10 February 2015. The Government appreciates the Committee's support for the amendments to the Appendices, and the recognition that it was necessary for the Government to seek a reservation in relation to five shark species.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        However, five members of the Committee did not support the Australian Government lodging a reservation and provided a dissenting report. The Government is pleased to provide the following response to the dissenting report.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         The report states that lodging the reservation is detrimental to Australia's reputation as a world leader in marine conservation, and that the better approach would be for Australia to amend its domestic legislation to accommodate local requirements or administrative complications. The report also notes that some non-government organisations considered there was inadequate notification or consultation with respect to the Government's decision to lodge the reservation.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As stated in the National Interest Analysis (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIA" rel="nofollow">
         NIA
        </a>
        ) tabled in Parliament on 10 February 2015, the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMS" rel="nofollow">
         CMS
        </a>
        ) has two Appendices that carry different obligations:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Once listed on either Appendix of the Convention, the
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_Protection_and_Biodiversity_Conservation_Act" rel="nofollow">
          Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act
         </a>
         1999
        </i>
        (the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC" rel="nofollow">
         EPBC
        </a>
        Act) obliges the Minister to include that species on the list of migratory species established under the Act. It is important to note that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC_Act" rel="nofollow">
         EPBC Act
        </a>
        does not distinguish between species listed on Appendix I and Appendix II of the Convention. Once listed as a migratory species under the Act, irrespective of whether it is listed on Appendix I or II of the Convention, it becomes an offence under the Act to kill, injure, take or move the species in Commonwealth waters.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Accordingly, Australia's domestic measures go well beyond that required by the Convention for Appendix II listed species. Under the Convention, once a species is included in Appendix II, Range States are merely required to endeavour to enter into agreements. In contrast, under the EPBC Act, a listing on Appendix II enlivens the prohibition of killing, injuring, taking or moving the species.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Whilst the Government submitted a reservation with regard to five species of shark that were added to Appendix II of the CMS in November 2014, Australia continues to fulfil CMS requirements under Appendix II, namely the obligation to endeavour to conclude agreements where these would benefit the species. Australia is a signatory to the CMS Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation of Migratory Sharks, and the recent shark additions to the Convention Appendices will be forwarded to this
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOU" rel="nofollow">
         MOU
        </a>
        for consideration for inclusion under its auspices. Australia will be supportive of their inclusion under this instrument to facilitate information exchange and cooperative research work. However, due to the restrictive domestic management arrangements that would have been required if these species were included on the migratory species list under the Act, entering a reservation for these particular listed species allows Australia to reflect our international obligations accurately and not be bound to the consequential, stricter domestic measures required by current legislation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        With regard to the consideration by some non-governmental organisations of inadequate notification or consultation with respect to the Government's decision to enter a reservation, it should be noted that the Government undertook extensive stakeholder consultation in the lead-up to the CMS Conference of Parties in November 2014. As outlined in the NIA, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_the_Environment" rel="nofollow">
         Department of the Environment
        </a>
        conducted consultation with relevant Commonwealth Government departments, State and Territory environment and primary industries counterpart agencies, 12 environmental non-government organisations and ten commercial and recreational fishing stakeholders. This consultation occurred over a five month period and provided the Government with comprehensive stakeholder views on the potential listings under the CMS Appendices, as well as stakeholder positions with regard to management options considered following the listings.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia makes frequent use of international forums to urge signature and ratification of the CTBT by countries which have yet to do so and highlights the importance of that call for countries whose ratification is required for the CTBT to enter into force, including India. On 29 September 2015 Foreign Minister Bishop spoke at the CTBT Article

India supports the same objective and officials coordinate regularly on this issue. While the CD has been unable so far to agree to the commencement of FMCT negotiations, both Australia and India continue to support additional efforts to promote work on a treaty.

         Recommendation 2
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         The Committee recommends the Australian Government considers facilitating the negotiation of a nuclear arms limitation treaty for the Indian subcontinent region. Such a treaty could feasibly have an initial goal of preventing the development of thermonuclear weapons by India and Pakistan, and prevent the deployment of such weapons to the region by China.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia and India have established an annual dialogue on Non-Proliferation and Disarmament, at which we discuss issues including nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, nuclear doctrine and confidence building measures to reduce the risk of nuclear conflict in the region. Shared interests in nuclear safety and security are also part of this dialogue. These talks at senior officials' level are an important means for Australia to promote disarmament and non-proliferation on the subcontinent, thereby contributing to greater peace and security.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Only the states involved can decide to negotiate an arms limitation agreement, but Australia and other concerned states assign priority and diplomatic resources to encouraging reduction of tensions in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia" rel="nofollow">
         South Asia
        </a>
        , and for a rethink of approaches to nuclear arms, including through reducing the significance of nuclear weapons in military doctrines, and increased transparency as a confidence building measure. The CTBT and, prior to its entry into force, the continuation of moratoria on nuclear testing (including by India) helps to prevent the proliferation of thermonuclear weapons because the development of such weapons relies on explosive nuclear testing to prove and refine weapon design.

        The Government concurs with the Committee on the importance of the matters raised in this recommendation. The Nuclear Cooperation Agreement with India includes provisions that address the separation of India's civilian and military nuclear facilities and programmes, as well as commitments to achieve the highest standards of radiation and nuclear safety.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_I" rel="nofollow">
         Article I
        </a>
        I of the Agreement offers a basis for Australia and India to develop cooperation in areas related to peaceful uses of nuclear energy, including regulatory and technological advancements for the safe, secure, sustainable and safeguarded use of civil nuclear energy. Ahead of implementing the Agreement, Australia and India are discussing the establishment of such cooperation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Separation of civil and military nuclear facilities
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        India agreed with the United States in 2006 to separate its civil and strategic nuclear programs. A clear demarcation between civilian and strategic facilities was a key objective for the United States when negotiating the plan with India, to ensure compliance with its obligation under Article I of the NPT to not assist, encourage, or induce nuclear weapons development, production, or proliferation. The 2006 separation plan specifies that facilities that are subject to safeguards in India are those that, "after separation, will no longer be engaged in activities of strategic significance".
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        India's separation plan is contained in IAEA document INFCIRC/731. It stipulates 22 nuclear facilities to be designated as civil and brought under IAEA safeguards. India has said that all newly constructed civil nuclear facilities will also be brought promptly under IAEA safeguards. India's commitment to the separation plan forms part of the decision of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_Suppliers_Group" rel="nofollow">
         Nuclear Suppliers Group
        </a>
        (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSG" rel="nofollow">
         NSG
        </a>
        ) in 2008 that provides a framework for countries such as Australia to develop nuclear cooperation with India. India has met, and continues to act in accordance with, commitments made in connection with the NSG decision.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The 2006 plan is the only agreed definition for separation for India's civil and military nuclear activities. The IAEA has confirmed in its document INFCIRC/754/Add.7, dated 5 February 2015, that India has now designated all 22 civil facilities for the application of safeguards. On this basis, the Government is satisfied that the first element of the Committee's recommendation is met.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Regulation of nuclear safety in India
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        India is already working to implement enhancements in its regulation in the area of nuclear safety based on recommendations from its own reviews and those made by the IAEA.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The second to fifth elements of the Committee's recommendation are in alignment with recommendations made by an Integrated Regulatory Review Service (IRRS) mission conducted by the IAEA in March 2015 at India's invitation. The IRRS mission provided an in-depth review of India's performance against IAEA safety requirements. The international team of experts that conducted the IRRS mission concluded that there is a strong commitment to safety in India. The leader of the team commented also that India "continues to enhance its regulatory programme to face the current and future challenges in regulating nuclear safety, such as reinforcing the safety of existing nuclear facilities, monitoring ageing and decommissioning, as well as providing oversight of the construction, commissioning and operation of new nuclear power plants." Following each IRRS mission, the IAEA and the host country develop an action plan for IRRS recommendations to be addressed, including potential timeframes.

        In a statement to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Parliament" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Parliament
        </a>
        on 28 October 2014, the Minister for Foreign Affairs said: "Australia expects India will follow international best practice to ensure safety in its nuclear industry." The Government stresses the importance of ongoing review and improvement of nuclear safety. However this does not warrant delaying, and potentially lessening, the benefits offered by nuclear cooperation. Accordingly, the Government does not accept the Committee's recommendation that exports of uranium to India should be deferred.

         2.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The use of AONM in India in facilities other than those under permanent IAEA safeguards is unlikely for a number of practical and technical reasons. Scenarios mentioned in evidence to JSCOT by non-government witnesses, where India might use AONM at a temporarily safeguarded facility in a manner that would assist its nuclear weapons program, would be contrary to the fundamental provisions of the Nuclear Cooperation Agreement, as well as India's safeguards agreement with the IAEA.

         4. That the NCA not be ratified in its present form without addressing concerns about the ambiguity of the consent provisions.

        The commitments that India made in connection with the development of nuclear cooperation with the United States, as well as the 2008 decision of the Nuclear Suppliers Group to provide an exemption for civil nuclear cooperation with and transfers to India, have served to draw it more fully into the non-proliferation mainstream and are an important part of the framework under which Australia will export uranium to India. These commitments include the continuation of India's moratorium on nuclear testing. The Government makes frequent use of international forums to urge signature and ratification of the CTBT by countries which have yet to do so and highlights the importance of that call for countries whose ratification is required for the CTBT to enter into force, including India. Accordingly, the Government sees no reason to defer exports of uranium pending further commitments by India.
