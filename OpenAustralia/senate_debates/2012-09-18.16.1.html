        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Senator Wong. What is the government doing to support Queenslanders who have lost their jobs following the decision of that state government to cut 14,000 public sector jobs?

         Unlike Senator Abetz, we do not think 14,000 job losses in Queensland is a laughing matter. I welcome the release today by Minister Shorten and Minister Ellis of a package that will provide help for Queensland workers sacked by the Newman government—the Premier who told Queenslanders that the public service had nothing to fear from him. Oh, how that changed so quickly! The government is rolling out immediate and targeted support in Queensland in the wake of the decision of the state
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
          LNP
         </a>
         to axe 14,000 public sector jobs, contrary to what they told Queenslanders prior to the election. The package that was announced today by Ministers Shorten and Ellis is aimed at helping workers find new jobs and to minimise the flow-on impacts to non-government organisations that will no longer have access to state government funding to deliver services in Queensland.
        </p>
        <p>
         This government is providing targeted additional assistance to those affected by the savage cuts in Queensland because we do not believe you should just abandon working people. Unlike those opposite, we have been focused on job creation. Since we came to government, over 800,000 jobs have been created in this country. The only people who are not happy about that are those opposite, who I hear are very quiet now. You only hear them when they want to talk down the Australian economy because they do not actually want to back the Australian economy, Australian jobs and Australian workers. The position is this: on this side we support jobs; those on the other side support job cuts.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Can the minister advise why it was necessary for the government to provide the assistance package announced today for Queensland workers and was there an alternative approach that the government could have taken?

           The reason the government had to act was due to the cuts made to jobs and to services by the Newman government. The alternative approach that was open to the Newman government was to make responsible savings and also perhaps to be upfront with Queenslanders about what their plans were prior to the election. We do know the sort of economic thinking that was behind Premier Newman's approach, and it is shared by those opposite. We know that Senator Joyce, for example, is on the record as saying he backs Premier Newman 100 per cent—backs the Premier 100 per cent as he sacks public servants in Queensland, contrary to what the Premier told people prior to the election. We also know this is the same approach that Mr

           </a>
           , should he ever win government, wants to take.

              All we have seen from the other side, in the face of cuts to jobs, to nurses, to doctors, to firefighters, to roads, to transport, to palliative care and even to Vinnies, is cheerleading—cheerleading the Queensland government as they make these cuts.
