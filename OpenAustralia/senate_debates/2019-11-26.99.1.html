        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Health, Senator Cash. Can the minister outline to the Senate how the Morrison government's strong and stable economic management enables investment in groundbreaking medical research and clinical trials?

         I thank Senator Davey for the question. The benefit of a strong economy to health cannot be underestimated. The Morrison government recognises the importance of, in particular, clinical trials. They drive new ideas and they achieve new discoveries, resulting in improved quality of life and survival rates, and they boost our nation's strong reputation as a global leader in medical research.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is estimated that more than 40,000 Australians are diagnosed with a rare or less-common form of cancer. For many, there is a lack of evidence based information to inform treatment options and support networks. While survival rates for high-incidence cancers have improved, those for rare cancers have remained relatively static. That is why, through our landmark Medical Research Future Fund, we are investing $55 million to research rare cancers and diseases. This is the largest investment in clinical trials in any single round in Australian history. The unprecedented clinical trials activity is aimed at developing new drugs, devices and treatments and, ultimately, at saving lives.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of the $55 million investment that we are making, $15 million is for research into reproductive cancers; $5 million is for childhood brain cancer clinical trials, with the aim to double the 10-year survival rate of childhood brain cancer; $20 million will address an increasingly significant burden of neurological disorder; and $15 million will address other significant gaps in current research and/or knowledge in rare cancers, rare diseases and areas of unmet medical need. These are the benefits of a strong economy.

            You can't underestimate the impact of clinical trials. We are also as a government investing an additional $8 million in world-class clinical trials, focusing on conditions affecting the heart, preterm baby lungs, the brain, infection control and dementia. Five Australian-led trials will now receive funding from the Medical Research Future Fund International Clinical Trial Collaborations program.

               Again, our government, the Morrison government, is able to make and provide an unprecedented level of support to health and medical research because of the plan that we've put in place to enable a strong economy. We've put in place the right economic framework to ensure that the economy grows, so that we can invest in the services that the Australian people deserve. We on this side of the chamber understand that, in order to sustainably fund the health services Australians deserve, you need to run a strong economy. This, of course, allows us to invest in record funding for medicine, the care and the research for all Australians. Our record is reflected in our results: record listings on the

               ; record investments in medical research; record bulk-billing; and record funding for our hospitals. This would not be possible without the coalition's strong economic management.
