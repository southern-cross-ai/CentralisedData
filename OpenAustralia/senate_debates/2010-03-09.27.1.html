        My question is to the Minister for Defence, Senator Faulkner, representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and it relates to the Montara oil spill. Is the government aware that an oil sample taken in Indonesian fishing grounds has been identified as Montara oil and can therefore be assumed to have come from the Montara oil spill? Has the government commenced any investigation into, or review of, the impacts of the oil spill on Indonesian fishers and communities on

         I certainly am aware of recent media reports concerning the results of tests ordered by the Montara commission of inquiry in relation to seawater samples which I think were provided by Senator Siewert. Those samples came from near
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rote_Island" rel="nofollow">
          Rote Island
         </a>
         and off the south coast of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Timor" rel="nofollow">
          West Timor
         </a>
         , as I understand it. The commission asked a group called Leeder Consulting to analyse the samples and, according to revision 1 of the analysis report from Leeder Consulting, dated 18 February this year, the samples were received by them on 19 January. I am informed that page 3 of the Leeder Consulting report states:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         … these sample containers are inappropriate for the sampling of oil spills …
        </p>
        <p>
         In making this conclusion, it references the

           Oil Spills
          </a>
         </i>
         . I am also informed that page 17 of the Leeder Consulting report concludes that, with respect to the second and third samples, the whole oil ratios of these samples are similar to the whole oil ratios of fresh Montara crude. The report also suggests that these samples have a positive match with Montara crude based on biomarker ratios.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is now up to Commissioner Borthwick to assess the appropriate weight to be given to the report and the oil samples, and the documents which gave rise to it. Like all evidence presently before the commission, I think the material is untested. The commissioner, as I understand it, is yet to make any conclusion—

          , I ask a supplementary question. Given that the oil is more than likely to be Montara oil and that oil found in the region is likely to have an impact on Indonesian fishers, has the government commenced any negotiations or any discussions with the Indonesian government concerning the possible impact on Indonesian fishers and their livelihood?

           I will just conclude my other sentence. I understand that the commission is yet to make any conclusions regarding the evidence. To move to Senator Siewert’s supplementary question, I am advised that Australia notified Indonesia on 3 September of the presence of oil in its
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EEZ" rel="nofollow">
            EEZ
           </a>
           . Australia has kept Indonesia closely informed of the movement of oil and our response efforts. An Australian delegation visited Indonesia on 10 November last year to provide a briefing to the Indonesian government on the oil spill, Australia’s response efforts, the environmental monitoring and also the Borthwick commission of inquiry. The Australian government has offered to conduct a joint Australia-Indonesia shoreline survey, to be funded by PTTEP Australasia. I think Indonesia is yet to respond to that proposal.

           say also that Australian embassy officials met with parliamentarians from

           on 4 December 2009 to provide information on Australia’s cooperation with Indonesian officials on the spill.

             I thank Senator Siewert for her further supplementary question. I can certainly say, Senator, that the Australian government intends to continue to keep Indonesia closely informed of developments, including the implementation of the environmental monitoring plan. I can say to you that Australia will continue to act fully consistently with international law and our strong bilateral relationships in responding to this incident.

             assesses that, based on the reports of surveillance aircraft during the response, the oil observed in Indonesia’s

              EEZ
             </a>
             posed no significant threat to the marine environment. The reports of significant quantities of oil in Indonesian waters, I am informed, are not consistent with observations from surveillance aircraft throughout the incident, so I am not aware of a basis for a compensation claim. But what I will do is ask the relevant ministers, particularly Mr Ferguson and
