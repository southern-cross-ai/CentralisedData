        My question is to the Minister for Indigenous Affairs, Senator Scullion. Will the minister update the Senate on how the government's Remote School Attendance Strategy is delivering on this government's commitment to get more children into schools in remote communities?

         I thank the senator for that question and acknowledge her keen interest in improving educational outcomes for our children, a passion that she has brought to this place with some 20 years experience as an educator. When we came to government, we found that there had been no improvement in the very poor school attendance rates in most remote Indigenous communities. In fact, we found that, from 2007, attendance was dropping in many places. While some may wash their hands and say this is a state and territory government responsibility, which it is, it was clear that a new approach was needed, so this government acted and acted decisively.
        </p>
        <p>
         In 2014 the government introduced the Remote School Attendance Strategy to improve school attendance. School attendance officers are now operating in 73 schools, in 69 communities, and I am pleased to report that, while we still have a long way to go, we are making real progress. In the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         , attendance rates at government schools have increased. For example, the attendance rates at both Ngukurr and Alekarenge schools rose by 15 per cent from term 2 in 2013 to term 2 in 2015. In Senator Lindgren's home state of Queensland, government asked our schools, and the number of children attending school increased by 12 per cent over the same period of time. We have all seen a number of individual schools in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         with large increases. This government is committed to the challenge of making sure children go to school and building on the progress that has already been made. That is why I have recently announced an additional $80 million to extend the Remote School Attendance Strategy for a further three years, until the end of 2018.

           We all recognise that a good education is the foundation of a healthy and successful life. We know that the evidence says: if you are not attending school at least 90 per cent of the time, you are not retaining the information you need to get a proper education. A
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            Western Australia
           </a>
           n study has found that as much as one-third of the gap in educational attainment between Indigenous and non-Indigenous children could be attributed to poorer rates of school attendance for Indigenous children.
          </p>
          <p>
           A good education leads to good employment opportunities and supports a healthy and safe community. Whilst there has been a lot of talk around this place about targets and aspirations, we on this side of the chamber recognise that the most effective way to deliver better outcomes for
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
            Indigenous Australians
           </a>
           is to work on the ground with communities to deliver practical solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Remote School Attendance Strategy is a community-driven strategy, and this kind of improvement is only possible when schools, parents, families and local organisations work together to get these kids to school.

             people in remote communities across Australia. There are currently over 500 local community members employed as school attendance supervisors and school attendance officers across the 73 communities that the strategy is operating in. These attendance officers who are on the front line of efforts to get children attending school are all local people who know their communities. It has been a great privilege of my job to spend time with them and to see their determination. I must say that the most pleasing aspect has been the number of school attendance officers who have been poached by other organisations in the community. That has been a real starting point to begin a great career. From Donald in Yirrkala to Lennie in
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halls_Creek" rel="nofollow">
