            just clarify so there is no confusion, a motion was passed by the Senate in the name Senator Pratt earlier in the week requiring me to be present in the Senate at 9.30 this morning so that 'a senator may ask the Attorney-General for an explanation of certain matters concerning the Bell issue'. No question was asked of me, so we are moving on.

               Order! Can senators come to order so that we can deal with this matter efficiently? Last time when this approach was adopted it was agreed between the parties that the Attorney-General would be called upon by the President. I have done that. I called upon the Attorney-General, and now there seems to be some confusion as to the practice. If a senator wishes to stand and move a motion in relation to this, we can do it that way or I can simply call the Attorney-General.

                  I am going to raise a point of order. Senator Pratt cannot move that motion without leave and she has not sought leave. There was a motion agreed to by the Senate earlier in the week which, relevantly provided by paragraph 4:
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  …

                   The Senate
                  </a>
                  requires that the Attorney-General be in the Senate at 9.30 am on Thursday 30 March 2017, so that a senator may ask the Attorney-General for an explanation in connection with his actions on this matter, and at the conclusion of the explanation any senator may move a motion to take note of explanation; or if the Attorney-General fails to provide an explanation any senator may move to take note of his failure to do so.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  That is the operative part of the resolution. I was here at 9.30 and no opposition senator asked me a question. I am in a position to respond to any questions that may be asked of me. Senator Pratt has now raised an issue. I have not been asked a question.

                   Senator Pratt did actually ask a question. She did not actually move a motion. Can we just take it now that a question has been asked of the Attorney-General. I ask the Attorney-General if he wishes to respond.

                            could maybe assist: the motion is that a senator may ask for an explanation in relation to all matters in relation to the subject material. I will take it that that question has been asked of the Attorney-General. At the conclusion of the Attorney-General's response, a motion may be moved to take note of that answer.

                                         I seek an explanation from the Attorney-General on the following matters. The Attorney-General has specifically refused to allow answers as to whether his office prepared a direction under the

                                         , which would have prevented the Australian tax office from intervening in the Bell matter. Will the Attorney-General give us that answer now? Secondly, does the Attorney-General believe that he is above the rules of the Senate which specify legal privilege is not on its own a basis for refusing to answer questions in a Senate committee? Why has the Attorney-General not complied with the Senate's request to provide a legitimate basis for a public interest immunity claim? I note that in his response to the Senate tabled on 23 March, the Attorney-General stated:
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="italic">
                                         Thus, whether or not the Senate has accepted that matters pertaining to confidential legal advice to government are always and in all circumstances immune from disclosure is neither here nor there. The fact is that, in general, such matters are not disclosed.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                         Can the Attorney-General explain to the Senate why he believes that what the Senate accepts or asks for is 'neither here nor there'? The report tabled yesterday by the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee required that the Attorney-General provide to the committee a statement of the grounds for concluding that it would not be in the public interest to disclose the information specifying the harm to the public interest that would result from the disclosure of the information of the documents. Will the Attorney-General comply with the committee's requirement?

                                         On what basis does the Attorney-General believe that there would be a harm to the administration of justice, given that the litigation has now ended and there is no risk of compromising that litigation? The Attorney-General would be aware of evidence given before the committee on Monday, 27 March, that the Australian tax office was so worried that the Attorney-General was about to issue a direction that they sought legal advice and made the tax commissioner,

Will the Attorney-General now tell the truth? Was he planning to issue a direction to stop the tax office from intervening?

                                            I made a note of what Senator Pratt has asked. In answer to question No. 1: that matter has been dealt with on several occasions. I might remind the Senate that this issue has been the subject of questions at estimates, at a spillover estimates day and at the Senate references committee. On each occasion, the response has been that this question goes to legal advice and, therefore, consistent with the uniform practice of all Australian governments, it will not be provided for that reason on the ground of public interest immunity.
                                           </p>
                                           <p>
                                            On question No. 2: no, Senator Pratt. I believe that I am obliged to comply with the same constitutional convention that every Australian Attorney-General and, indeed, minister has complied with in relation to protecting legal advice provided to the Commonwealth.
                                           </p>
                                           <p>
                                            In relation to question No. 3, contrary to what is asserted in the question, a public interest immunity claim was fully articulated in response to the questions, and I table a copy of the public interest immunity claim as articulated. The requirement of
                                            <i>
                                             Odgers'
                                            </i>
                                            , which is one point of view about this, and not the only point of view, is that a public interest immunity claim be fully articulated. It has been, and the document I have tabled you have seen before because it is in the form of the answers provided in articulating the public interest immunity claim.
                                           </p>
                                           <p>
                                            In response to your fourth question, Senator Pratt, it is not a question of whether orders of the Senate were neither here nor there. The question is what my obligations are, as a minister and as an Attorney, to protect the position of the Commonwealth in relation to its legal advice, and that is explained and set out in the answers that were given, which are embodied in the document I have just tabled.
                                           </p>
                                           <p>
                                            In answer to your fifth question, the requirement to provide a statement was complied with, so the assertion in your question is incorrect. But, nevertheless, out of courtesy to the Senate I have tabled, once again, the grounds of the public interest immunity claim—a claim, by the way, taken on advice.
                                           </p>
                                           <p>
                                            The answer to your sixth question is explained in the document that has just been tabled and was explained in the written answer provided to the question when it was taken on notice. All other matters which you raise have been dealt with by me already in evidence before either the references committee or the estimates committee or in the instrument which I have tabled.

                                              In your comments and explanations to the Senate on 28 November, you said, in part, when talking about the Solicitor-General, Mr Gleeson:
                                             </p>

                                              After I indicated that I did not intend to intervene in the proceedings on behalf of the Commonwealth, I was contacted by the Solicitor-General, Mr Gleeson. He gave me certain advice.
                                             </p>
                                             <p>
                                              You invoked privilege on that, understandably. You then said:
                                             </p>
                                             <p class="italic">
                                              It is sufficient to say that Mr Gleeson was strongly of the view that the Commonwealth should intervene, … I saw the force of what Mr Gleeson put to me and I accepted his advice.

                                              He obviously told you that he was the Solicitor-General and was representing the

                                              at the time. Was it after he put this forceful argument that you decided to issue the directive, just before the election, that all matters for all ministers and all departments had to in future come through you?

When did you become aware of this? What, if anything, did you or any of your staff do after you became aware of that? Secondly, do you agree that the precedent of this Senate is that the fact that legal advice might be considered privileged by government or by a minister does not automatically mean that it satisfies the public interest immunity requirements that have been established in the past by this chamber? Thirdly, are you seriously walking away from

Do you regard it as a fire starter to get your kindling going, or do you accord it anything higher than simply being one opinion on how this Senate works? If you do, what other body of work do you rely on to give advice to the senators in this place and to the chamber as a whole about how the Senate operates?

                                                 , you have asked me about my or my officers' knowledge of certain matters at certain times. Obviously, I will have to take that on notice. In relation to the position of invoking a public interest immunity claim in respect of legal advice, that, as I pointed out in my answer to Senator Pratt, is the invariable position of all Australian governments, and it has been since Federation, and in the written answers to questions that I took on notice in the references committee, which I have tabled again this morning, the various precedents quoting the views of attorneys-general from both sides of politics are set out. They are merely a sample of those views. It is an absolutely fundamental position that the Commonwealth does not publicly disclose its legal advice and that that is a recognised ground of public interest immunity.

                                                    My first question relates to evidence that we have taken at this inquiry already, which is that the Attorney-General did not personally prepare a direction to stop the

                                                    from intervening in this case, but we know that the Attorney-General has refused to answer whether his office prepared a direction to prevent the ATO intervening. My first question is: doesn't this cause an inference that his office did request such a direction to be prepared?

It must be established that there is some particular harm to be apprehended by the disclosure of the information, such as prejudice to pending legal proceedings or to the Commonwealth's position in those proceedings.
                                                               </p>

                                                                According to the advice received by the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee, the existence of legal professional privilege may lend weight to a public interest immunity claim, but any such claim must nonetheless be raised on an accepted ground and accompanied by a statement of the harm to be apprehended from the disclosure of the information sought, and that is that the harm specified should relate to the matter at hand. What is the harm to the public interest in relation to this matter specifically, not in relation to general disclosure of legal advice? What is the harm to the public interest in relation to the Bell matter that would occur from the disclosure of the information sought?
                                                               </p>

                                                                As I outlined in my questions, in his response to the Senate, tabled on 23 March, the Attorney-General showed absolute disregard for the standing orders of this place when he stated: 'Thus, whether or not the Senate has accepted that matters pertaining to confidential legal advice to government are always and in all circumstances immune from disclosure is neither here nor there.' That is blatant disregard for the standing orders of this place. He went on to say: 'The fact is that, in general, such matters are not disclosed.' That is not a proper reflection of his obligation to the Senate. It is important that the Attorney-General is able to explain his actions and he has failed to do so adequately today. It really demonstrates that he believes he is above the rules of the Senate which specify that legal privilege is not in and of itself a basis for refusing answers to Senate committees or, indeed, for refusing answers in this place.
                                                               </p>

                                                                So the question before us today is why the Attorney-General has not complied with the Senate's request to provide the basis for his public interest immunity claims. It needs to be a legitimate basis. The substantive nature of the public interest immunity claim made by Senator Brandis does not meet the threshold tests required by this chamber. The report tabled by the committee yesterday required the Attorney-General to provide the committee with a statement of the grounds for concluding that it would not be in the public interest to disclose this information, specifying the harm to the public interest. There has been no recognition within the Attorney-General's answers that goes to that point. No harm to the public interest has been specified that would demonstrate that there is a harm to the administration of justice, given that the litigation in this matter has now ended and there is no risk of compromising that litigation.

                                                                On that note, why the Attorney-General has specifically refused to allow answers as to whether his office prepared a direction, under the

The Attorney-General, again, was aware of evidence given before the Senate committee on 27 March that the tax office was so worried that the Attorney-General was about to issue such a direction that they indeed sought legal advice and made the tax commissioner,

Indeed, that suggests that the Attorney-General was considering doing so. Why won't the Attorney-General tell the truth on that matter? He was indeed planning to issue a direction to stop the Australian tax office from intervening.

When you think about it, that is logical, because it is executive government that flows from parliament, not the other way around. The pre-eminent institution in our democracy is this parliament. It is not the cabinet, it is not the office of the Prime Minister and it is certainly not the office of the Attorney-General. We are debating right now in the pre-eminent institution of our democracy, the

The first point to make is the obvious point that the Attorney-General has continually missed in this debate—that is, that legal privilege is his to waive. Governments right through Australia's history have from time to time chosen to waive legal privilege and provide matters that otherwise would have been covered by legal privilege, because it was in their political interests to do so. I have seen it on many occasions, both in the Tasmanian parliament and, before I was a senator in this place, through the media in relation to governments at a national level in this country. Make no mistake: the Attorney-General could right now waive legal privilege and provide the information that the Senate is asking for. The fact that he is not doing that shows that he has something to hide here. It is not good enough to him to rely on what he describes as a 'lengthy precedent of governments of all stripes in this country'. The Attorney could waive legal privilege, if he wanted to, and he could provide that advice to the Senate right now. It is his gift to give, but he is not giving the gift, presumably because he has something to hide. This is why we need to see the advice that this motion or the motion previously passed by the Senate refers to.
                                                                </p>

                                                                 The second point to make—and this the question I put to the Attorney that he did not go to in his answer—is that clearly the precedent of this Senate is not to accept a simple claim of legal privilege as grounds for a successful claim of public interest immunity. That is the long precedent of this place. We need from the Attorney a proper claim of public interest immunity that outlines in detail the public harm that he claims would flow from releasing the legal advice. That is certainly what the

So clearly this was the discussion at senior levels of the Commonwealth bureaucracy—and so it should have been, because it would have been almost unprecedented had the Attorney decided to issue a direction to effectively prevent the ATO from maximising its opportunities to recover the moneys it believed were owed to Commonwealth coffers as a result of the matters in

I have been a minister in the Tasmanian government, and we all know what your staff do is in effect what you do. When a staff member tells someone something, it is as if the minister told them himself or herself. So we need to know what the Attorney and his staff knew about the ATO seeking legal advice on their position should the Attorney have directed them not to intervene, when he became aware of it, and what happened either in his office or from his office out into any part of the bureaucracy in this country, including the Solicitor-General's office, once he became aware of that fact.

This man is so determined to hide evidence from the Senate and Senate inquiries that he has to be hauled before the full Senate and be asked questions that he will not answer when put to him by a committee set up to inquire into this issue. I cannot remember the last time I saw a minister, whether in a state parliament or the federal parliament, having to be dragged before the full chamber in order to get them to stop hiding information that is reasonably sought by a committee. You can only wonder what Senator Brandis's colleagues must think of the amount of time that is being expended in defending his incompetence, his secrecy and his deception. This is a government that is struggling desperately to get clear air to do something positive for this country. We are told that we are going to sit into the night tonight to try to get legislation through which they say is necessary for the future of this country, but yet again Senator Brandis's incompetence and deception is causing the Senate to divert time to ask him very reasonable questions about his practice and that of his office.

It was not that long ago that we had to establish a Senate inquiry into his behaviour in relation to the former Solicitor-General of Australia and we had very clear evidence from numerous senior officials in this government, from the Solicitor-General down, that the Attorney-General had clearly taken action against the Solicitor-General as retribution for the Solicitor-General's desire to maintain some level of independence around the advice that he had given. We have seen the Attorney-General deceive the Senate previously about his role with the Solicitor-General—

                                                                            </a>

We will all remember the statement from the Attorney-General in late November last year when he told the Senate that his first personal involvement in this case was on 3 March 2016, and of course before too long he had one of his own Liberal counterparts, the former Western Australian Attorney-General, come out publicly and say that that was not correct and that he had actually spoken to Senator Brandis in early February. Senator Brandis had one of his now infamous memory losses. He does not recall that conversation and maintains this ridiculous fiction that having a conversation with an Attorney-General from Western Australia does not amount to personal involvement in the matter.
                                                                           </p>

Most Australian taxpayers would want to make sure that companies who owe taxes repay those taxes and do the right thing, and they would expect the Australian tax office to pursue those taxes on their behalf. But what we have uncovered over the course of this inquiry is an apparent attempt by the Attorney-General or his office to prevent the Australian tax office from doing its job. Even today, those who have been listening to Senator Brandis will have noted his slippery use of language to yet again try to evade responsibility in this matter. What he has told the Senate again today is that no direction was issued to the Australian tax office to prevent them from taking action. That is not the subject of the questions that have been asked. What has been asked is: what directions were drafted by his office, or what action did his office take to try to prepare a direction, to stop the Australian tax office from taking action?
                                                                           </p>

We were told very clearly by the Attorney-General's Department that the Attorney-General had not done so. But, when we went on to ask whether the Attorney-General's office had prepared a direction to stop the

Privilege was claimed. A public interest immunity was claimed. And we are now told by the Attorney-General that it is against the public interest to reveal whether his office directed the ATO or attempted to direct the ATO from interfering in this case.
                                                                           </p>

There is a clear inconsistency and a clear double standard that is being used by the Attorney-General and his department to try to hide the involvement of the Attorney-General's office in this matter.

We asked them again whether they had become aware of any discussions about the prospect of a direction being issued. What they advised the Senate inquiry was that senior Australian tax office officials were aware of discussions and were party to discussions with officers from Treasury and the
                                                                            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government_Solicitor" rel="nofollow">

But what we now have is clear evidence on the record where senior officers of the Australian tax office have said that they were having discussions with their counterparts in Treasury and the Australian Government Solicitor about efforts that were being made to stop them from interfering in this case.
                                                                           </p>

He is supposed to be beyond reproach. He is supposed to be someone who is just quietly doing his job rather than distracting the government from their agenda. But, time after time after time, we have to spend the Senate's time trying to get answers out of this Attorney-General, and, in the process, he goes on to embarrass all of his colleagues and the government as a whole. The Attorney-General should just answer clearly today whether his office requested that a direction be drafted to prevent the Australian tax office from interfering in this case, and then these questions would cease.

I just say that Senator Brandis is probably the best Attorney-General I have ever experienced in this chamber. Senator Brandis is a longstanding colleague of mine—not a particular friend, I might say, but a longstanding colleague. I have known him over a long period of time. His knowledge of the law is impeccable. His attention to precision and detail is without peer in this chamber and in any Attorney that I have seen here in the 27 years I have been here. I have seen a few, and there have been some good ones—none of the Labor ones, I might say, but there have been some very good attorneys-general from the coalition. Senator Brandis is as good as, if not better than, all of them.

They are not Senate inquiries; they are simply Labor Party and Greens inquiries. I keep wondering why they do it. It is pretty obvious that if you want to attack someone, if you want to bring someone down, you do not do that to the worst-performing minister in the parliament; you do it to the best, the one that causes you most trouble, the one that has an accurate answer to every allegation levelled against the government in his role both as

I repeat that this and several other committees are committees that have been set up by the Labor Party and the Greens. Instead of spending moneys of the Labor Party and the Greens to do these political exercises they use the money of the Senate.
                                                                                </p>

I heard someone mentioned inquiry into the Solicitor-General. We all know the result of that. Senator Brandis came out unscathed and unblemished, with not a chink taken out of anything he had said in that whole debate. But the Solicitor-General, I have to say, did the right thing and resided during the course of the hearing, because the Solicitor-General knew that his conduct as an officer of the government—dealing with secret information to a member of the opposition—was untenable. I did not know the Solicitor-General—I do not think I ever had anything to do with him—but I thought his conduct was particularly improper and that he did the right thing by resigning. I only raise that to say that the Labor Party and the Greens keep running these political inquiries because they want to attack the person who is most valuable to the government and is the one who causes most grief to the Labor Party and the Greens.
                                                                                </p>

He is not a particular friend of mine, but I have the greatest admiration for his ability—

I cannot understand the Labor Party and the Greens. I think these things are brought by people perhaps who wanted to be lawyers, who could never make a go in private practice, who became ambulance chasers, who tried to get into state parliament, were there for a little time and were then thrown out by the electorate. Perhaps it is these sorts of people who want to make a mark in the law that they were never able to do in real life, out there. All of these inquiries have been as wasteful of Senate resources and of Senate time as this inquiry was.

It was not 20—I will take your interjection—it was 30 years ago. That is how long ago this was. Can you believe it? Can you believe the Senate is spending any time on rehashing one of the darkest periods in Labor Party history, and there have been plenty of dark ones with the Labor Party, I tell you. The darkest period in Labor Party history in Western Australia and, by implication, federally was when the Labor Party got into bed with crooks who cheated

You might remember that—was it one or two?—Labor premiers went to jail over this incident.

The suggestion that somehow the Commonwealth was going to miss out on money is just so ludicrous. I cannot understand the Labor Party except if you come back to my original premise that it is this constant attack on Senator Brandis, who, as I say, is one of the best attorneys-general I have seen in this parliament in the 27 years I have been here. He is a man with impeccable legal knowledge, a man whose precision and detail are beyond reproach. And you have these amateurs from the Labor Party and the Greens thinking they will make their mark in life by trying to find a chink in his armour—people who failed in state parliaments, failed in Tasmania, failed in Queensland. They could never make their way there, and they hope that they can do something in this chamber by raising these issues.

We have had this farce this morning of the Senate taking a lot of time—and I apologise to the Senate clerks. Obviously the Labor Party has imposed on the Senate clerks to write out all these questions to ask and these motions to put. It was wasting the time of the Senate clerks, of the Senate committees area, to put up this series of questions, which I listened to earlier. Senator Brandis has answered every single one of them—I might say for about the third or fourth time.
                                                                                    </p>

As the Attorney has said, as anyone who has been around parliament for a long while knows, you cannot run a government if the legal advice is made public. That is something that governments since 1901 have been adopting. It is something that governments around the world do. It is uncontroversial. It is not contestable. And yet we have spent so much time here today arguing about this.
                                                                                    </p>

I just felt compelled to enter the debate when I heard the previous speakers carrying on about things they clearly know nothing about. They are desperate to try and find a chink in the armour. They are desperate to try and bring down one of the government's better performers. All of this continues on. This is the third, fourth or fifth inquiry now and, as I say, Senator Brandis has come out of each one of them not only looking and smelling like roses but actually being a rose. Why the Labor Party and the Greens continue to waste the Senate's time on this I simply cannot understand. I should be encouraging them to continue, because they keep making fools of themselves. They keep looking like spoilt little children who cannot become king of the kids. They take on all of these quite ridiculous inquiries at the taxpayers' expense.

They are set down when Labor Party and Greens members know that government senators are elsewhere, on other inquiries. They have been told time and time again that government senators have other committees that they are precommitted to, and the hearings are still set down. So you have three Labor senators and a Greens senator as voting members on these committees, and no government senator. How can they possibly be classed as Senate inquiries, when they are nothing more than a political game being carried on by the Labor Party and the Greens political party, using Senate resources and the taxpayers' money? It is a disgrace.

WA would get the $300 million and other creditors would not. Especially, the ATO, the Commonwealth, would not get it. They dudded the small creditors out in WA. They dudded the Commonwealth. That is one point.

On that occasion we had the then Solicitor-General, Mr Gleeson, eventually resigning. I mentioned earlier that forceful argument that they had about Mr Gleeson, the then Solicitor-General, being before the High Court as the ATO's lawyer at the time. I will not be taking up the 20 minutes on this. I made my point earlier. I make it again. I just want to stress to Senator Macdonald, through the chair, that I am not part of some Labor-Greens cabal in all of this. I am a participating member of the committee, and I do not regret a minute of it.

After lengthy questioning at Senate estimates on both the principal hearing day and the spillover day, after two hearings of a references committee where the Labor Party and the Greens got absolutely nowhere, they seek now to try and revive this flogged, dead horse of an issue on the last morning of sittings. I am going to use my time to address a couple of the issues of fact in relation to the Bell litigation, and, secondly—

This scarecrow of a suit has, in course of time, become so complicated that no man alive knows what it means. The parties to it understand it least, but it has been observed that no two Chancery lawyers can talk about it for five minutes without coming to a total disagreement as to all the premises. Innumerable children have been born into the cause; innumerable young people have married into it; innumerable old people have died out of it. Scores of persons have deliriously found themselves made parties in Jarndyce and Jarndyce without knowing how or why; whole families have inherited legendary hatreds with the suit. The little plaintiff or defendant who was promised a new rocking-horse when Jarndyce and Jarndyce should be settled has grown up, possessed himself of a real horse, and trotted away into the other world. Fair wards of court have faded into mothers and grandmothers; a long procession of Chancellors has come in and gone out; the legion of bills in the suit have been transformed into mere bills of mortality; there are not three Jarndyces left upon the earth perhaps since old Tom Jarndyce in despair blew his brains out at a coffee-house in

There are very few of the directors still alive who were parties to the commercial transactions in the 1970s and 1980s that led to the Bell group of companies being put into liquidation some 30 years ago. And, like the young child who was promised a rocking horse when Jarndyce and Jarndyce should be settled, there is a man who began his legal career working on the Bell litigation as an articled law clerk in Perth who now sits on the High Court, so long has the Bell litigation proceeded.

That statutory settlement was the subject of the High Court proceedings of which we have heard so much. But the first thing to remember about this is that this was a nonpartisan attempt to bring to an end more than 30 years of seemingly endless litigation on which, according to some estimates, almost half a billion dollars of lawyers' fees, liquidators' fees and insolvency practitioners' fees had already been wasted. So the motive was pure.

People can draw their own conclusions about Senator Watt's honesty, and we can be very satisfied that Mr Hockey has nothing to answer.

But that is the evidence and those are the facts.
                                                                                           </p>

It is an argument about an instruction that was never given, about a direction that was never issued. The highest to which the case made by the opposition rises, on the basis of evidence from an officer earlier in the week who was not directly involved, was that he had heard some bureaucratic whispers. Honestly and truly, Senator Pratt, if that is the best you can do—and it is the best you can do—you should not waste our time.
                                                                                           </p>

Let me say again—as I said in answer to you, Senator Pratt, and others—that it is absolutely the standard position of the Australian government that its legal advice, like the legal advice of any private client, for that matter, is not made public. Senators have been misled, perhaps through ignorance rather than malice, by a selective quotation from

                                                                                           </p>

It must be established that there is some particular harm to be apprehended by the disclosure of the information, such as prejudice to pending legal proceedings or to the Commonwealth's position in those proceedings.

I accept that, Senator Watt, and I provided a detailed statement, which is the document I tabled this morning and which I will read into the record. What it represents is both a statement of the universal practice of all Australian governments since Federation in relation to legal advice, subject in exceptional circumstances to waiver, I acknowledge, but that is something that is seldom done and is never done, nor should be done, if the advice to government is that the publication of the advice would prejudice the legal position of the Commonwealth.

                                                                                           </p>

The fact is that, in general, such matters are not disclosed. Plainly, as I acknowledged at the hearing, there may be exceptional circumstances in which to depart from that general practice. However, no such exception arises in the present context. On the contrary: as I will explain below, the present case is one in which the potential harm of disclosure is particularly acute, and the grounds for non-disclosure thus particularly strong.
                                                                                           </p>

Absent exceptional circumstances, it is essential that privileged legal advice provided to the Commonwealth remain confidential. Access by Government to such confidential advice is, in practical terms, critical to the development of sound Commonwealth policy and robust law-making.

Given its application, no further balancing exercise is required.
