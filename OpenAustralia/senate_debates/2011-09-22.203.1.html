        (4)   Was there a full economic assessment of the impacts an oil spill or leak would have on key industries, such as tourism and fishing; if not, when will a full economic assessment of potential impacts of oil spills be included as part of the assessment process.

         The Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities has provided the following answer to the honourable Senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The department assessed this proposal and determined that significant impacts on matters protected under the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_Protection_and_Biodiversity_Conservation_Act" rel="nofollow">
          Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act
         </a>
         1999 (

         Act) were unlikely if the action was undertaken in a 'particular manner'. In this case, the 'particular manner' refers to measures to minimise acoustic impacts to whales arising from seismic testing undertaken as part of the drilling program.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         All
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC_Act" rel="nofollow">
          EPBC Act
         </a>
         assessments of offshore drilling proposals consider direct impacts of the proposal as well as potential impacts in the unlikely event of a major, unintended hydrocarbon release. The department thoroughly considered the potential risk of a hydrocarbon spill, including a well blow out.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         As a result of the companies' plans and response measures and the low likelihood of such an event, it was decided that no further federal environment assessment is needed. This decision is consistent with previous decisions made under national environment law for other similar proposals.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Every proposed project differs in nature and extent of potential impacts. Consistent with this, each referral received under the EPBC Act is considered on a case-by-case basis.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The Minister is aware that this project has received international attention.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Potential impacts to the 'the environment' of the Commonwealth marine area including the social, economic and cultural aspects of that environment were considered.
