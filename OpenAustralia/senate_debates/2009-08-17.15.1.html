         I thank Senator Minchin for that question. As he has indicated, the government has established a company—
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
          NBN
         </a>

The company was incorporated on 9 April 2009 as a wholly Commonwealth owned public company, limited by shares, following the government decision on the NBN on 7 April. On 25 July the government announced that Mr Michael Quigley had been appointed as

           Mr Quigley has had a distinguished 36-year career at Alcatel, one of the world’s largest telecoms, technology and network deployment companies. He was most recently president and chief operating officer of the company, leading more than 55,000 staff and responsible for operations in 130 countries. During the course of his career, Mr Quigley has led the development and integration of large-scale fibre-to-the-premise and fibre-to-the-node implementations for some of the largest

             As has been indicated, Mr Quigley and the board have extensive experience in regulatory issues and telecommunications standard setting. Mr Quigley, as has been indicated, will receive a total remuneration of a maximum of $1.95 million per annum, with no long-term incentive or equity based remuneration. Senator Minchin continues to carp and run a policy-free zone. If you want to ask, ‘How does someone justify their collecting a cheque?’, Senator Minchin—the policy-free zone—could answer that question for himself. I note that other Liberals understand the need for an experienced and qualified person to run

                   On Friday night Mr Abbott did have some things to say about this very matter. He stated:
                  </p>
                  <p class="italic">
                   But I guess, in the end, if he does a very good job and we do get a national broadband system that does dramatically improve the current situation, I suppose he’ll be worth every bit of it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   That is Mr Tony Abbott: ‘Worth every cent of it.’ Mr Abbott has got this right: Mr Quigley will be worth every cent of his package.

                    I rise on a point of order. The minister now has only 23 seconds to answer. This is a serious question. I want to know where the $46,000 per week for the chairman and directors is actually coming from, given that in government business enterprises the chairman and directors are paid out of earnings. This company has no earnings, so where is the $46,000 coming from? He has got 23 seconds.

                        . Senator Minchin took a point of order. Simply saying, ‘The minister has 23 seconds’ is not a ruling on the point of order. You do that quite regularly, Mr President. I just say that, where a point of order is taken, you must rule whether it is valid and accepted or whether it is not a point of order and reject it.
