        My question is to the Assistant Minister for Health, Senator Nash. I refer to the minister's answer in question time yesterday, when she said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … there have been no cuts to the flexible funds as announced in the budget.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also refer to the minister to page 110 of Budget Paper No. 2, which states:

         I assume I would be correct in taking the senator's comment as referring to my saying 'It is not a cut to the flexible funds.' I was indeed referring to the CO-

             , I ask a supplementary question. I again refer to the minister's answer in question time yesterday, which stated that the figure of an $800 million cut to the flexible funds is incorrect. Given that evidence from her department at the recent budget estimates confirmed a $596 million cut from the health flexible funds in this year's budget, as well as a $197 million cut in the 2014 budget, will the minister now correct the record?

             <p>
              My comment yesterday about the $590 million was relating to this year's budget. If that was not clear in
              <i>
               Hansard
              </i>
              , that was indeed my intent. I was looking at the context of this year's budget; I was not referring to last year's budget. It is very clear that we have said there will be some cuts to the flexible funds as a result of this year's budget—the $590 million.
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
               Can I
              </a>
              add that it is of funds to the value of $12 billion—it is a 2.8 per cent increase over the next three years that will determine those cuts. It is very important that we focus on the facts.
